Certainly! Below is the `reproducer.py` script designed to reproduce the issue described. It assumes that Django is setup with a model and database settings properly configured in your Django project. Make sure you've configured the database and have a model `Employee` with fields `salary` and `department` in one of your apps.

```python
# reproducer.py
import django
django.setup()

from django.db import models
from django.db.models import F, Value, Case, When, Window
from django.db.models.functions import Lag
from django.core.exceptions import NotSupportedError

# Print stack trace function
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Assuming Employee is a model in your Django project
class Employee(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    salary = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    department = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    class Meta:
        app_label = 'myapp' # Change 'myapp' to the actual app name

try:
    # Attempt the operation that is expected to fail
    Employee.objects.annotate(
        lag=Window(
            expression=Lag(expression='salary', offset=1),
            partition_by=F('department'),
            order_by=[F('salary').asc(), F('name').asc()],
        ),
        is_changed=Case(
            When(salary=F('lag'), then=Value(False)),
            default=Value(True), output_field=BooleanField()
        ),
    ).first()  # Fetch one instance to trigger the evaluation

    # If the operation succeeds, we assert failure as this behavior is unexpected based on the issue
    assert False, "Expected NotSupportedError was not raised."

except NotSupportedError as e:
    # If the expected error is caught, print the stack trace to debug
    print_stacktrace(e)
    # Exit without error as the reproduction was successful
    exit(0)
except Exception as e:
    # If an unexpected error occurs, print the stack trace
    print_stacktrace(e)
    # Assert failure since the issue couldn't be reproduced as expected
    assert False, "An unexpected error occurred."
```

Please ensure the following before running this script:

1. **Django Project Setup**: Your Django project is configured with the necessary `DATABASES` setting in `settings.py`.
2. **Model Definition**: The `Employee` model is defined within one of your apps (you may need to adapt the `Employee` class definition in the script above to match the actual model in your project, especially the `app_label`).
3. **Migrations**: Run migrations to ensure the `Employee` model is created in your database.

To run the script, navigate to your project's root directory (where `manage.py` is located) and execute it with:

```shell
python3 reproducer.py
```

This script is designed to raise an `AssertionError` if it does not encounter the expected `NotSupportedError`, which indicates the issue is present. If the issue is fixed, and the script runs without raising `NotSupportedError`, it will exit with code 0, indicating success.
