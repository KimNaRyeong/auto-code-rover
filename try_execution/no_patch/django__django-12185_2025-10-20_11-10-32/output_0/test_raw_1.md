Given the previous attempt did not correctly reproduce the issue due to the Django environment not being properly set up, here's an improved standalone `reproducer.py` script. This version will make use of Django's `settings.configure()` to dynamically configure settings required for the script to run outside of a standard project structure, avoiding `ImproperlyConfigured` errors.

Please ensure Django is installed in your environment. This script dynamically sets up Django settings for convenience, so it doesn't require being run inside a Django project's directory.

```python
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import F, Window, Case, When, Value, BooleanField
from django.db.models.functions import Lag
from django.core.exceptions import NotSupportedError

# Function to print stack trace for exceptions
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Dynamically configure Django settings
if not settings.configured:
    settings.configure(
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': ':memory:',
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=[
            '__main__',  # This script acts as a standalone Django app
        ],
        USE_TZ=True,
    )

# Necessary Django setup
django.setup()

# Define a simple Employee model for this test
class Employee(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    salary = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    department = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__' # Makes this model belong to the standalone script app

try:
    # Attempt to use a window expression in a Case When statement within the annotate query
    result = Employee.objects.annotate(
        lag=Window(
            expression=Lag('salary', offset=1),
            partition_by=[F('department')],
            order_by=[F('salary').asc(), F('name').asc()],
        ),
        is_changed=Case(
            When(salary=F('lag'), then=Value(False)),
            default=Value(True),
            output_field=BooleanField(),
        ),
    )
    list(result)  # Force query evaluation
    # If no error, assume the issue might be fixed and exit with code 0
    print("Test passed: NotSupportedError was not raised, the issue might be fixed.")
    exit(0)

except NotSupportedError as e:
    # Print the stack trace for the NotSupportedError exception
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exit with error code to signal reproduction of the issue

except Exception as e:
    # If any other exception is raised, print its stack trace
    print_stacktrace(e)
    assert False, "An unexpected error occurred."
```

This script attempts to dynamically set up a minimal Django environment, define an `Employee` model, and reproduce the described issue involving window expressions in `SELECT` clauses with `Case` statements. If the issue described is accurately replicated, it will print a stack trace upon encountering a `NotSupportedError`, as expected from the issue description. If the issue no longer exists and the script runs without raising this specific exception, it suggests the issue might have been fixed, exiting with code 0 and a printed message indicating success.
