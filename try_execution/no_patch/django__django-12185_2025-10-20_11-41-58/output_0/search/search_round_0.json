        "content": "To efficiently gather the necessary context for resolving the issue related to Django's handling of window expressions in conditional statements in the SELECT clause, we should aim to localize and understand the relevant parts of the Django ORM source code that deals with query construction, particularly how window functions and conditional expressions are validated and compiled into SQL queries. Given the detailed description of the issue, it seems pertinent to explore the parts of the code that deal with the `annotate()` method, the handling of `Window` expressions, and the processing of conditional expressions like `Case` and `When`. \n\nGiven this, the following API calls would help in gathering the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the class that represents or handles the `Window` expression functionality in Django's ORM. This could help us understand how window functions are processed.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"Window\")\n   ```\n\n2. Search for the class that handles conditional expressions, particularly `Case` and `When`, as they are directly mentioned in the issue description.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"Case\")\n   search_class(\"When\")\n   ```\n\n3. Since the issue description mentions that this is a regression caused by a specific commit (`4edad1ddf6203326e0be4bdb105beecb0fe454c4`), we should find references or uses of `Window` and conditional expressions (`Case`, `When`) that may have been modified in or around this commit. Unfortunately, without direct access to a repository's commit log through the APIs provided, the best approach is to look into the methods that construct or validate the SQL queries generated from annotations, as these methods are likely to contain logic related to the issue.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"annotate\")\n   ```\n\n4. Given the focus on the SELECT clause, finding code snippets related to SQL compilation or transformation where `Window` and conditional expressions are handled might also offer insight. However, without specifying a particular file, this could return a broad set of results, so it would be strategic to localize where these compilations occur after identifying relevant classes and methods.\n   \nBecause the use of `Window` expressions in Django's ORM is relatively specialized, focusing on these specific components should yield the most direct path to understanding the problem and devising a suitable solution.\n"
