This adjustment must preserve the SQL standard's compliance that disallows window functions in the WHERE clause but permits them in the SELECT clause. The method might need to include logic to identify when a Window expression is properly used within a SELECT clause context and bypass restrictions that incorrectly flag this as an error."

Specifically, the method should preserve its functionality while also supporting the inclusion of Window functions within Case expressions as part of annotations. The validation process should differentiate between the unsupported use of window functions (e.g., in WHERE clauses directly) and supported uses, such as within the SELECT clause inside conditional statements."
