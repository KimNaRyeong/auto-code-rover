Given the error in the initial attempt, and the misunderstanding around the specific Django exception to catch, it's important to adjust the reproduction script appropriately. Django does not have a `NotSupportedError` directly for this use case; instead, `django.db.utils.NotSupportedError` (which is database backend specific) or a more general exception type might be caught when trying to execute unsupported operations. If the environment doesn't support window functions in the described manner, the database backend might raise an `OperationalError` or another specific error, rather than a Django `NotSupportedError`. Thus, I'm adjusting the script to catch a broader range of possible exceptions to better suit the issue description:

```python
# reproducer.py
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models, OperationalError
from django.db.models import F, Case, Value, Window, When, BooleanField
from django.db.models.functions import Lag

settings.configure(
    INSTALLED_APPS=["__main__"],
    DATABASES={
        "default": {
            "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
            "NAME": ":memory:",
        },
    },
    USE_TZ=True,
)

django.setup()

class Employee(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    salary = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    department = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    Employee.objects.annotate(
        lag=Window(
            expression=Lag('salary', offset=1),
            partition_by=F('department'),
            order_by=[F('salary').asc(), F('name').asc()],
        ),
        is_changed=Case(
            When(salary=F('lag'), then=Value(False)),
            default=Value(True), output_field=BooleanField()
        ),
    ).first()  # Trigger the query execution to catch any errors
    
    print("The issue seems fixed.")
except Exception as e:  # Catch a broader range of exceptions due to backend specific errors.
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise AssertionError("Failed to execute window function in SELECT clause.")

```

This script will attempt to reproduce the reported issue using Django's ORM. If the operation is not supported by the database backend being used, it will raise an exception which should be caught by the broad `except Exception as e:` block. Adjust your error handling as needed based on the specific exceptions you encounter to narrow down the script's response to more accurately capture the expected failure mode. 

Before running the script, ensure Django is installed and properly configured in your environment. Execute the script using Python 3 to determine if the issue is present. This script uses an SQLite memory database for simplicity and assumes it supports the necessary window function operations for this test case. Adjustments might be necessary for different databases or Django configurations.
