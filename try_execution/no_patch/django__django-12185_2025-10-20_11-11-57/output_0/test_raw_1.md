Given the context provided and the requirement to ensure the script behaves appropriately under both failure (issue present) and success (issue resolved) conditions, here's an updated version that adheres closely to the instructions. This script aims to replicate the originally reported Django issue, exiting with code 0 only when the issue is resolved and otherwise raising an `AssertionError` along with a clear stack trace of the error encountered:

```python
# reproducer.py

from django.conf import settings
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Case, Value, When, F, Window, BooleanField
from django.db.models.functions import Lag

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

    }
}

# Minimal Django settings required for models and database
settings.configure(
    DATABASES=DATABASES,

)

django.setup()

class Employee(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    salary = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    department = models.CharField(max_length=255)

    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'

def run_test():
    try:
        execute_from_command_line(['manage.py', 'migrate'])

        # Define the problematic query including the window function.
        queryset = Employee.objects.annotate(
            lag=Window(
                expression=Lag('salary', offset=1),
                partition_by=F('department'),
                order_by=[F('salary').asc(), F('name').asc()],
            ),
            is_changed=Case(
                When(salary=F('lag'), then=Value(False)),
                default=Value(True),
                output_field=BooleanField(),
            ),
        )

        # Attempt to evaluate the queryset to trigger the query execution.
        # We do not actually need to iterate over it; just triggering the query planning.
        list(queryset) 

        # If the query executed without raising an exception, we assume the issue is resolved.
        print("The issue appears to be resolved.")
        sys.exit(0)

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Check if the exception is specifically the one we're interested in (NotSupportedError),
        # or a general AssertionError for any unexpected behavior.
        assert "NotSupportedError" in str(e), "An unexpected exception occurred."
        # If we encounter the expected NotSupportedError, we print the stack trace but don't raise an error
        # because the script's normal behavior is to demonstrate the presence of the issue.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run_test()
```

**Notes:**

- This script checks for a specific exception (`NotSupportedError`) that would be triggered by the issue described. However, since there's no direct import or catch for `NotSupportedError` (as it's not explicitly defined in the Django documentation excerpts or in this script), we may need to rely on catching a broader exception class and asserting its message contains "NotSupportedError". Adjust this behavior based on the actual exceptions Django throws for your specific issue.
  
- The call to `list(queryset)` is designed to force Django to evaluate the queryset and thus attempt to run the SQL query which includes the window function in the SELECT clause, potentially triggering the issue.

- The `sys.exit(0)` line ensures that the script exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed, per instructions.
