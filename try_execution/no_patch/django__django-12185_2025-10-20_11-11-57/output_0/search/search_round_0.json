        "content": "To address the issue related to window expressions in conditional statements in the SELECT clause, let's narrow down our search by targeting specific classes, methods, or code snippets mentioned or implied in the issue description. Here are the API calls I would like to make:\n\n1. Search for where window expressions are processed to understand how they're currently handled:\n   - `search_code(\"Window(expression=Lag\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions `NotSupportedError` when using window expressions in a conditional statement, it's important to understand where this error is raised:\n   - `search_code(\"NotSupportedError\")`\n\n3. The description directly involves the annotation mechanism of Django's ORM, implying the issue may be in the annotation handling, particularly in how conditional expressions are processed:\n   - `search_method(\"annotate\")`\n\n4. Given the error might stem from the handling or parsing of SQL expressions, specifically the use of window functions in select clauses but outside WHERE clauses, there might be logic specific to handling these cases in Django's ORM:\n   - `search_code(\"Case(When(salary=F('lag')\")`\n\n5. The issue mentions a regression tied to a specific commit (`4edad1ddf6203326e0be4bdb105beecb0fe454c4`), which might mean changes in that commit affected the handling of window functions or conditional expressions:\n   - `search_code(\"4edad1ddf6203326e0be4bdb105beecb0fe454c4\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to collect information on how Django handles window expressions in annotations, where the `NotSupportedError` might originate concerning this functionality, and any relevant changes introduced in the mentioned commit that could have led to this regression."
