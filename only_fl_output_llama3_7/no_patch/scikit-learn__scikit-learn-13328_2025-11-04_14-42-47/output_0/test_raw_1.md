It seems that the issue is not with the code itself, but rather with the installation of scikit-learn. The error message suggests that scikit-learn has not been built correctly.

To reproduce the issue, you can try installing scikit-learn from source and then running the reproducer script. Here's how to do it:

1. Clone the scikit-learn repository: `git clone https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Build scikit-learn: `python setup.py build`
4. Install scikit-learn: `python setup.py install`
5. Create a new file called `reproducer.py` with the following code:
```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from sklearn.linear_model import HuberRegressor

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    X, y, _ = make_regression(n_samples=200, n_features=2, noise=4.0, coef=True, random_state=0)
    X_bool = X > 0
    try:
        huber = HuberRegressor().fit(X_bool, y)
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

reproduce_issue()
```
6. Run the reproducer script: `python3 reproducer.py`

This should raise a `TypeError` and print the stack trace of the issue.

Note that you may need to modify the code slightly depending on your specific environment and setup.
