The issue is not with the reproducer script itself, but rather with the installation of scikit-learn. The error message indicates that scikit-learn has not been built correctly.

To reproduce the issue, you can try installing scikit-learn from source and then running the reproducer script. Here's an example of how to do this:

1. Clone the scikit-learn repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git
```
2. Change into the cloned directory:
```
cd scikit-learn/
```
3. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Build and install scikit-learn:
```
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
```
5. Create a new file called `reproducer.py` with the following contents:

```py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    test = TfidfVectorizer(dtype=np.float32)
    result = test.fit_transform(["Help I have a bug"])
    assert result.dtype == np.float32
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)
```

6. Run the reproducer script:
```
python3 reproducer.py
```

This should reproduce the issue and raise an `AssertionError` when the dtype is not what was expected.
