        "content": "To address the reported issue effectively, we need to investigate how the glossary terms are processed within the `doc/glossary.rst` file in the phpMyAdmin project. Since the issue stems from a Sphinx documentation build for a duplicate term with different cases (\"MySQL\" vs \"mysql\"), it's crucial to understand the specific context around the mentioned line in the glossary document and also if there's any Sphinx configuration or custom processing involved.\n\nFirst, let's inspect the area in the `glossary.rst` file around the mentioned line to get an idea of how terms are defined and potentially identify the duplicate entries:\n\n1. `get_code_around_line(file_path=\"doc/glossary.rst\", line_number=234, window_size=10)`\n\nNext, we should check if there's any custom Sphinx setup or directives in the project that might affect how glossary terms are handled, particularly looking into Sphinx configuration files or custom extensions.\n\n2. `search_code_in_file(code_str=\"glossary\", file_path=\"doc/conf.py\")`\n\nThese API calls should give us insight into how `glossary.rst` is structured around the problematic term and whether any custom Sphinx handling could contribute to the issue."
