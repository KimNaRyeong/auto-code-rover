Sphinx, by default, may not treat differently cased terms as unique, leading to the reported issue. Therefore, the glossary should either consolidate the information of \"MySQL\" and \"mysql\" into a single term that is correctly cased or apply a workaround to differentiate terms that are case-sensitive. The specific fix would depend on the content strategy for the documentation but ensuring uniqueness or properly configuring Sphinx to handle such cases is crucial."

        "intended_behavior": "Review and adjust the Sphinx configuration to ensure it is correctly handling case sensitivity for terms. This may involve setting configuration options that affect glossary behavior, or implementing a Sphinx extension if default behavior does not support case-sensitive term uniqueness. Furthermore, ensuring that the Sphinx version used supports the desired configuration or handling method is vital. If the case sensitivity issue cannot be resolved through configuration alone, a workaround could involve a custom Sphinx extension or preprocessing step to validate and adjust glossary terms for case sensitivity before Sphinx processing."
