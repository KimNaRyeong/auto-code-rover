Based on the revised criteria and ensuring the proper execution context, let's write an updated `reproducer.py`. This version aims to directly address the glossary duplicate term issue within a Sphinx documentation build process for a hypothetical project, similar to the `phpmyadmin` example provided, but crafted to be standalone for ease of demonstration.

This script will try to simulate the scenario by creating a minimal Sphinx project with a glossary having a case-sensitive duplicate term issue. It assumes Sphinx and necessary dependencies are already installed in the environment where the script is run.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_sphinx_project():
    """
    Create a minimal Sphinx documentation project including a glossary with
    duplicate terms differentiated only by case, which should trigger the bug.
    """
    os.makedirs("test_docs/source", exist_ok=True)
    with open("test_docs/source/conf.py", "w") as conf:
        conf.write("project = 'TestDocs'\nextensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'sphinx.ext.autosummary']")
    with open("test_docs/source/index.rst", "w") as index:
        index.write(".. glossary::\n\n   MySQL\n      A database.\n\n   mysql\n      Command-line tool.")
    with open("test_docs/Makefile", "w") as makefile:
        makefile.write("SPHINXBUILD = sphinx-build\n\nhtml:\n\t$(SPHINXBUILD) -b html source build")

def build_sphinx_docs():
    """

    about duplicate glossary term.
    """
    try:
        os.chdir("test_docs")
        subprocess.check_call(["make", "html"])
        os.chdir("..")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        return False, str(e)
    return True, ""

def main():
    try:
        create_sphinx_project()
        success, message = build_sphinx_docs()
        assert success, "Sphinx build failed due to glossary issue."
        print("Sphinx built successfully. No duplicate glossary term issue detected.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script creates a minimal Sphinx documentation setup with a glossary that includes intentionally duplicated terms (with different cases) to reproduce the reported issue. When running this in an environment matching the described setup (Python 3.6, Sphinx 3.0.0, on Unix-like OS), it should trigger the same warning or error if the issue persists.

Ensure you have Sphinx installed (`pip install Sphinx==3.0.0`) before running this script. If the issue has been resolved in your Sphinx environment, the script should exit with code 0 and print a success message. If the issue persists, it will exit with code 1, indicating failure due to the detected problem.
