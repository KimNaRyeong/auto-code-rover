Certainly! Below is the requested standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the specific issue you described. When the issue is present, the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace of the issue using the provided function. It will exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed.

```python
# reproducer.py
import traceback
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from sklearn import datasets
        from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
        # The original script used sklearn.mixture.GMM which is deprecated
        # Updated to use GaussianMixture as per newer sklearn versions
        from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture as GMM

        X, y = datasets.make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, n_classes=2)

        gmm_model = GMM()

        param_grid = {
            'n_components': [1, 2, 3, 4],
            'covariance_type': ['tied', 'full', 'spherical']
        }

        grid_search = GridSearchCV(gmm_model, param_grid, scoring='roc_auc')
        grid_search.fit(X, y)

        # If an error related to the initial issue is not found,
        # an AssertionError is raised to indicate the problem.
        assert False, "The issue did not occur as expected."

    except AssertionError as assert_error:
        # Catching the assertion error to print a custom error message or handle differently
        print_stacktrace(assert_error)
    except Exception as e:
        # Catching all other exceptions to print their stacktrace
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error status if an unexpected error occurs
    else:
        print("No AssertionError encountered. The issue might have been resolved.")
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script makes use of the `GaussianMixture` model from `sklearn.mixture` as the original `GMM` class is deprecated in more recent versions of scikit-learn. Given the goal is to reproduce an `IndexError` related to `roc_auc` scoring with a model that does not inherently support binary classification probabilities out of the box, this script maintains the essence of the expected error's scenario. 

However, it's important to note that due to the evolution of libraries and their error handling, reproducing the exact error may require adjustments in sklearn's version or handling specific cases where sklearn has added validations that prevent such misconfigurations from proceeding to the point of raising an `IndexError`.
