        "content": "To address the issue described, I need to gather more context about where and how the error is occurring. Here are the search API calls I plan to make based on the information provided in the issue description:\n\n1. I need to understand how the `GridSearchCV` class is implemented and how it integrates the scoring functionality, particularly with respect to the 'roc_auc' scoring method. This will help in identifying where the index error might be happening.\n\n2. Since the error traceback mentions `scorer.py`, it's pivotal to check how scorers are called and possibly how they handle predictions, especially for classifiers that might output a different shape of `y_pred` than expected.\n\n3. The bug report explicitly mentions an error arising from `y_pred = y_pred[:, 1]`, which suggests an assumption about the shape of `y_pred` that might not hold for all classifiers, like the GMM classifier from `sklearn.mixture`. Understanding the conditions under which this line is executed will be crucial.\n\nGiven these considerations, here are the API calls I will make:\n\n- `search_class(\"GridSearchCV\")`\n- `search_class(\"GMM\")`\n- `search_method_in_file(\"__call__\", \"scorer.py\")`\n- `search_code(\"y_pred = y_pred[:, 1]\")`\n\nThese calls aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how GridSearchCV uses scoring methods, how the GMM class is expected to work within this context, and specifically how `__call__` in `scorer.py` leads to the mentioned index error. This information will be essential for crafting a fix."
