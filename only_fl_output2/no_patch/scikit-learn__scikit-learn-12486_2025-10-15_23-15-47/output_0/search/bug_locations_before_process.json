        "intended_behavior": "The method should check if the output of the predict_proba method from the classifier has more than one column before attempting to index the second column ([:, 1]). If there's only one column, it implies there's only one class, or the classifier treats the task differently. In such cases, the method might either use the available probabilities as is (if logic allows) or raise a more informative error explaining the mismatch in expected output format. This ensures that users are made aware of incompatibilities between the scoring metric and the classifier output in a clear and actionable way."

        "method": "__call__",
        "intended_behavior": "Similar to _ProbaScorer, this method should implement a check for the structure of the y_pred array after calling predict_proba. If the predict_proba output doesn\u2019t fit the expected format (e.g., not a two-dimensional array with a separate column for the positive class probabilities in a binary classification scenario), the method should either adapt to this output or throw a meaningful error. This adaptation might involve using the single-column output directly if applicable or providing guidance on compatible classifiers and scoring combinations."
