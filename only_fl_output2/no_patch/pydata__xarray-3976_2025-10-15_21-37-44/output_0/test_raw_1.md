Given the context and error message from the previous attempt, it appears you are seeking a revised version of the standalone Python script to reproduce the specific error discussed earlier, despite the challenge encountered. I'll maintain the error handling approach to capture and print stack traces as requested but rewrite the `reproducer.py` content to reflect a scenario closely matching your requirements.

Here, we aim to ensure the script is executable under various environments, including handling potential version conflicts or deprecations, which seemed to affect the previous trial negatively.

```python
# reproducerer.py
import numpy as np
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys

    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_in_place_addition():
    n = 5

    d1 = np.arange(n)
    np.random.shuffle(d1)
    A = xr.DataArray(np.ones(n), coords=[('dim', d1)])

    d2 = np.arange(n)
    np.random.shuffle(d2)
    B = xr.DataArray(np.ones(n), coords=[('dim', d2)])

    try:
        A_updated = A + B
        A += B
        assert np.array_equal(A, A_updated), "Arrays not equal after in-place addition"
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("In-place addition failed") from e

    # If AssertionError was not raised, the program will exit indicating the issue is resolved or not present
    print("In-place addition succeeded.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_in_place_addition()
```

This script should either:
- Successfully complete, printing "In-place addition succeeded." and exiting with status code 0.
- Or, if the issue remains unresolved, it should raise an `AssertionError` due to the in-place addition failure, printing the stack trace to help diagnose the problem.

Ensure your system's Python and package (numpy, xarray) versions are up to date or aligned with the versions known to exhibit or not exhibit the described issue. If the issue is version-specific, reproducing it may also require the specific environment where it was initially observed.
