Given the context and the specific requirements provided, the following Python script named `reproducer.py` aims to reproduce the original issue related to in-place addition of arrays within the xarray library while systematically identifying failure or success. The script will incorporate the error handling and stack trace printing mechanism provided:

```python
# reproducerer.py
import numpy as np
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_in_place_addition():
    n = 5

    d1 = np.arange(n)
    np.random.shuffle(d1)
    A = xr.DataArray(np.ones(n), coords=[('dim', d1)])

    d2 = np.arange(n)
    np.random.shuffle(d2)
    B = xr.DataArray(np.ones(n), coords=[('dim', d2)])

    try:
        # Attempt to perform in-place addition and capture its result
        A += B
        # Perform regular addition for comparison
        A_regular_add = xr.DataArray(np.ones(n), coords=[('dim', d1)]) + B
        # Assert comparison to validate if in-place addition behaves as expected
        assert np.array_equal(A, A_regular_add), "Arrays not equal after in-place addition"
    except AssertionError as e:
        # Catch the AssertionError specifically to ensure the script can exit with code 0 when issue is fixed
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Use non-zero exit code to indicate failure
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch other exceptions that could occur during the process
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

    print("In-place addition succeeded and matches expected behavior.")
    exit(0)  # Use zero exit code to indicate success

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_in_place_addition()
```

This script is designed to:
1. Run a test case involving in-place addition `+=` of two `xarray.DataArray` objects with the same dimensions but in different order.
2. Compare the outcome of in-place addition with regular addition to verify if they yield the same result.
3. Print a detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function if an exception occurs, specifically highlighting if the AssertionError is triggered by unequal arrays after the addition process.
4. Exit with code 0 when the issue is not present or has been fixed, signaling success without any uncaught exception or assertion failures. Conversely, it will exit with code 1 if an assertion error or any other exception is raised, indicating the reproduction of the issue or encountering an unexpected runtime problem.
