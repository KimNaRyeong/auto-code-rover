To directly address the task of reproducing the issue, the Python standalone file named `reproducer.py` will attempt to serialize an object containing both `datetime` and `Decimal` fields using Flask's JSON encoder. It will employ a custom JSON encoder to handle these types, as detailed in the provided description. The goal is to simulate and highlight the problem described, where the lack of native support for `Decimal` types in Flask's JSON encoder after the removal of `simplejson` leads to serialization issues that the custom encoder aims to solve.

Ensure that Flask is installed in your environment before execution. If Flask or any other dependency is missing, the script will terminate without attempting to reproduce the issue, as it requires Flask to run properly.

```python
# reproducerer.py

import functools
import decimal
from datetime import datetime
from flask import Flask, json as flask_json
from flask.json import JSONEncoder

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class CustomJSONEncoder(JSONEncoder):
    """
    Add Decimal coverage
    """
    def default(self, o):
        if isinstance(o, decimal.Decimal):
            return str(o)
        return super().default(o)

def main():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.json_encoder = CustomJSONEncoder

    # Simulating object with Decimal and datetime
    obj = {'datetime': datetime.now(), 'decimal': decimal.Decimal('10.01')}

    # Attempt serialization
    try:
        result = flask_json.dumps(obj)
        print("Serialization successful:", result)
        # If the output doesn't raise an error, check if Decimal is handled as expected
        assert '10.01' in result, "Decimal is not serialized correctly."
        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating no issue found (serialization successful).
    except Exception as e:
        print("Serialization failed.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 indicating issue reproduced.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Test failed:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 indicating issue is present.
```

This script, when executed, will attempt to serialize an object containing both a `Decimal` and a `datetime` instance, leveraging a custom JSON encoder for Flask that includes support for `Decimal`. If serialization fails or if the `Decimal` value is not correctly serialized (i.e., not represented as a string in the JSON output), it will catch and print the exception, thus reproducing the issue. It exits with 0 if the object is correctly serialized, indicating the issue is resolved or non-existent with the current setup, and 1 if there's an error or assertion failure, signaling the presence of the described issue.
