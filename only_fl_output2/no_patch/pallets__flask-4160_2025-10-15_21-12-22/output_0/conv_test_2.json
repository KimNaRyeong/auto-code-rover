        "content": "Here is an issue:\n\nhandle Decimal in json encoder\nThe `simplejson` removal (#3555) decreased the flask encoding capabilities as the built-in `json` doesn't cover cases like `Decimal` types. The solution seems to be: overwrite the flask app encoder with `JSONEnconder` from `simplejson`, but this incorporates a problem for users that relies on both `Decimal` and `datetimes` as `simplejon` doesn't handle `datetimes`, while flask encoder does. The solution I found is to build a custom encoder that tests if the value is `Decimal` and gives it to `simplejson`, otherwise, handles it with the default flask app encoder. My suggestion is to incorporate a simple test in the flask encoder to add `Decimal` coverage, that would remove any residual dependency on `simplejson`. The str(decimal) was taken from: [simplejson/encoder.py#L511](https://github.com/simplejson/simplejson/blob/8bef979ad8272cbc2903970f4b9992f603d50973/simplejson/encoder.py#L511)  \r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom flask import json as fjson\r\nfrom flask.json import JSONEncoder\r\nimport simplejson as sjson\r\nimport decimal\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\nrdatetime = datetime.strptime('1/1/2008 1:30 PM', '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M %p')\r\nrdecimal = decimal.Decimal(10)\r\n\r\nobj = {'datetime':rdatetime,'decimal':rdecimal}\r\n\r\nfjson.dumps(obj) #Doesn't work because of decimal\r\nsjson.dumps(obj) #Doesn't work because of datetimes\r\n```  \r\nThe custom encoder:  \r\n```python\r\nclass CustomJSONEncoder(JSONEncoder):\r\n    '''\r\n    Add Decimal coverage\r\n    '''\r\n    def default(self, o):\r\n        if isinstance(o, decimal.Decimal):\r\n            return str(o)\r\n        return super().default(o)\r\n\r\napp.json_encoder = CustomJSONEncoder\r\n```  \r\n\r\nThe expected behavior is to work with both `Decimal` and `datetimes`  as it used to work on Flask version 1.1.2\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\n\r\n- Python version: 3.8.10\r\n- Flask version: 2.0.1 and 1.1.2\r\n- Simplejson(Optional) version: 3.17.2\r\n\n"

        "content": "Given the feedback, it seems necessary to revise our approach. The previously submitted script failed due to the absent Flask module in your environment, indicating a need for a self-contained script that ensures all dependencies are checked beforehand. Let's update the `reproducer.py` to include dependency validation and streamline the reproducibility process while maintaining the initial goal of identifying the described issue regarding Flask's handling of `Decimal` and datetime objects. \n\nHere's a revised version of the `reproducer.py`, including a pre-run check to ensure Flask and simplejson (if necessary) are installed. Otherwise, it will advise on installing the missing modules.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\n\n# Dependency check\ntry:\n    from flask import Flask, json as fjson\n    from flask.json import JSONEncoder\n    import decimal\n    from datetime import datetime\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    print(\"Missing module.

This version ensures that the script checks for dependencies and attempts to reproduce the issue accurately, informing you of the necessary steps if dependencies are missing. It will raise an `AssertionError` if it successfully identifies the issue as described, concerning the handling of `Decimal` and datetime objects within Flask's JSON encoding mechanisms, and exit accordingly based on the outcome."
