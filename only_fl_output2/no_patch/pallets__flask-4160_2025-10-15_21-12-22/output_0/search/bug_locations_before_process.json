        "intended_behavior": "The method should be modified to check if the object o is an instance of decimal.Decimal. If so, it should return a string representation of the Decimal object (or possibly a float, depending on the desired precision and compatibility). This modification will extend the JSONEncoder's capability to handle Decimal objects seamlessly, similar to how other special types are handled. The change must ensure that other types, especially datetime, continue to be serialized correctly, thereby maintaining all existing functionality."
