        "content": "To address the issue about deprecating the use of `get_random_string` without an explicit length, we will need to find where this method is defined and how it is currently being utilized. Since this method is part of `django.utils.crypto`, our initial step will be locating its definition to understand its default parameters and any documentation around it. Next, we may also search for instances where this method is called to gauge the impact of requiring an explicit length argument on the broader codebase.\n\nHere are the API calls we should make to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"get_random_string\")` - To locate all occurrences of the method definition and its usage across the codebase.\n2. `search_code(\"get_random_string(\")` - To find snippets where `get_random_string` is being called, which could help us identify cases where the length parameter is not specified.\n3. `search_code(\"from django.utils.crypto import get_random_string\")` - To identify how widely and where the method is imported, giving us a sense of the scope of the changes needed."
