Ensuring that migration operations do not flag false positives for conflicts in ManyToManyField relations just because models share names across different Django apps."

This could involve: Enhancing the logic that validates model names and related field attributes to consider the app label as part of the identity. This way, even if models share names (and have similar ManyToManyField configurations), they are treated as distinct as long as they reside in different apps."
