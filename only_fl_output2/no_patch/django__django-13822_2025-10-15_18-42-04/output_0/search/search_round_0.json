        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand the Django model structure better, specifically how the ManyToManyField with a `related_name='+'` attribute is handled and causes the `fields.E305` error when used in models across different Django apps but with the same model name. Given this, we will focus on finding related Django model definitions, the use of ManyToManyField, and perhaps the migrations or checks that raise `fields.E305` error.\n\nBased on the issue description, let's perform the following search API calls to gather relevant code context:\n\n1. Since the issue mentions a problem with `ManyToManyFields` and `related_name='+'`, we'll search for code snippets where `ManyToManyField` is used with this specific attribute.\n    - `search_code(\"ManyToManyField(related_name='+')\")`\n\n2. The issue also highlights a problem that arises during the creation of a database migration. It might be useful to see if there's any custom migration code or signals connected to model save events that might be impacting this.\n    - `search_code(\"migrations\")`\n    - `search_code(\"pre_save\")`\n    - `search_code(\"post_save\")`\n\n3. Given that Django model classes and migrations spread across different files and apps, let's search for any class named `Migration` or methods that might customize the migration process, potentially causing or related to this issue.\n    - `search_class(\"Migration\")`\n    - `search_method(\"makemigrations\")`\n    - `search_method(\"migrate\")`\n\nThese searches will help us pinpoint where the issue may stem from within the project's codebase and provide a foundation for resolving it."
