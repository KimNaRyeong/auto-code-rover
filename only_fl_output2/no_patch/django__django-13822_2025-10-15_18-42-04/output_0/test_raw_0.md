Sure, I'll provide a standalone Python file `reproducer.py` that aims to replicate the described issue. This script will attempt to create models dynamically and then trigger the migration generation process to check for the specific `fields.E305` error. The file is meant to be executed in the root directory of a Django project.

```python
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_django_environment():
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'test_project.settings')
    import django
    django.setup()

def create_models_with_m2m():
    from django.db import models
    from django.apps import apps

    class Meta:
        app_label = 'dynamic_app'

    # Define a dynamic model as reference for M2M
    Base = type('Base', (models.Model,), {'__module__': __name__, 'Meta': Meta})

    # Create two models in different apps with the same name and a ManyToManyField to Base
    for app in ['app1', 'app2']:
        class_name = f'MyModelFrom{app.capitalize()}'
        model_dict = {
            '__module__': __name__,
            'bases': models.ManyToManyField(Base, related_name='+'),
            'Meta': type('Meta', (), {'app_label': app})
        }
        model = type(class_name, (models.Model,), model_dict)
        # Django needs to be aware of the new model
        apps.register_model(app, model)

def make_migrations():
    from django.core.management import call_command
    call_command('makemigrations', 'app1', 'app2', interactive=False, dry_run=True, verbosity=3)

def main():
    try:
        setup_django_environment()
        create_models_with_m2m()
        make_migrations()
        print("No issue detected. Exiting with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert isinstance(e, AssertionError), "An unexpected error occurred."
        # If an AssertionError is raised, we assume it's because of the issue being present

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script covers the steps to setup a minimal Django environment, create dynamic models within that environment, and attempt to generate migrations which would trigger the error if the issue persists. The `AssertionError` mention might not directly map to the exact behavior of Django's migration system faulting, so replace or complement this line accordingly based on practical outcomes and the specifics of the error manifestation.

Keep in mind that this script assumes a certain structure for a Django project (`test_project.settings`) and might need adjustments to match your setup, especially regarding the environment setup and the apps' names.
