Its `as_sql` method is responsible for generating the SQL representation of the window expression.\n   \n2. **Relation to the Issue**: Since the issue involves Django raising a `NotSupportedError` when using window expressions in conditional statements within the `SELECT` clause, and given that `Window` objects clearly support an SQL-like interface (including ordering and partitioning), it indicates that the class itself is likely capable of doing what the user expects but may be improperly integrated or used within the wider ORM query generation context, especially in `annotate()` calls.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: The intended behavior of the `Window` class within an `annotate` call should be to allow its expressions to be used without raising errors if they're used correctly according to SQL standards, which in this case means being part of the SELECT clause but not being used in WHERE clauses, JOINS, etc.\n\n### Analysis of the `annotate` method\n\n1. **Functionality**: The `annotate` method allows adding fields to each object returned in a QuerySet that are not necessarily a part of the model's fields. This can include aggregate values computed over some set of fields or other expressions. The method validates that provided arguments are expressions, manages aliases to ensure no conflicts, and modifies the query clone to include the annotations.\n\n2. **Relation to the Issue**: The `annotate` method is the context in which the user encounters the issue. It suggests that when window expressions (which are valid expressions) are passed to `annotate`, there's a validation or processing step that fails to account properly for these cases, triggering a `NotSupportedError`.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: The intended behavior in this context would allow users to pass window functions through `annotate`, adding calculated fields based on these window expressions to the QuerySet without raising unsupported errors\u2014provided these uses conform to SQL standards, meaning they are only part of the SELECT clause and not mishandled as part of WHERE conditions or similar.\n\nGiven the complexity of the issue and the understanding that the `NotSupportedError` might be coming from a different part of the Django ORM - possibly the validation or query compilation steps that handle window expressions improperly - a next step could involve investigating how Django constructs its SQL queries from QuerySets and how it specifically treats window functions in those translations. This investigation might focus on methods related to SQL compilation or validation within Django's ORM layer, which could involve:\n\n- Searching for the method or function that raises `NotSupportedError` for a better understanding of its intended constraints.\n- Investigating how Django's ORM translates `annotate()` calls into SQL to spot where the window function expressions might be mishandled."

The intended behavior at the location(s) identified by further investigation would involve:\n\n- **Intended Behavior**: The code responsible for assembling the SQL query from a Django QuerySet, particularly when it involves window functions used within `annotate`, should correctly recognize and allow such usage as valid, aligning with SQL standards. This means that the logic triggering the `NotSupportedError` needs to be adjusted or bypassed under conditions where window functions are appropriately used in the SELECT clause of a query. This adjustment should ensure that window functions in annotations do not incorrectly trigger validations intended for preventing their use in unsupported query parts (like the WHERE clause).\n\nFurther information obtained through the recommended search API call would allow for a precise determination of the bug location(s) and the necessary modifications to resolve the issue while preserving the existing functionality of Django's ORM."

Analyzing this in relation to the reported issue on window expressions involves understanding the specific contexts in which `NotSupportedError` is used, and which of those contexts might incorrectly handle window expressions in the SELECT clause.\n\n### Analysis Based on the Search Results\n\nGiven the broad appearance of `NotSupportedError` across different files, the most relevant ones likely to be involved with the issue at hand are:\n\n- **django/db/models/expressions.py**: This file contains the `Window` class, and its mention here suggests that there may be specific handling or restrictions around window functions that could trigger the error.\n- **django/db/models/sql/compiler.py**: The SQL compiler is responsible for turning Django ORM queries into SQL queries. Since the issue involves the ORM not correctly supporting window functions in a certain context (the SELECT clause of an annotate call), it's plausible that the SQL generation logic might be incorrectly flagging valid uses of window expressions as not supported.\n\n### Intended Behavior in Relevant Contexts\n\n1. **In django/db/models/expressions.py**: If `NotSupportedError` is being raised here in the context of window functions, the intended behavior would be ensuring that valid window expressions passed into the `Window` class (especially those used within the `annotate` method) are not incorrectly flagged as unsupported. This could involve adjusting validation logic to properly recognize context-appropriate usage of window functions.\n\n2. **In django/db/models/sql/compiler.py**: The SQL compiler should be able to accurately distinguish contexts in which window functions are valid according to SQL standards\u2014specifically allowing window functions in the SELECT clause without raising `NotSupportedError`. The intended adjustment here would ensure the compiler correctly handles window expressions within annotations, perhaps by bypassing or refining checks that trigger the unsupported error for valid use cases.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWithout direct excerpts from the code where `NotSupportedError` is being thrown in relation to window functions, one can only hypothesize about the exact nature of the bug. However, it is clear that:\n\n- The solution to the reported issue involves ensuring that window expressions used in annotations are recognized as valid by whatever part of Django's ORM or SQL compilation process currently deems them not supported.\n- This might involve fine-tuning the ORM's internal validation logic (for expressions deemed valid for annotations) and ensuring the SQL compiler has clear, context-aware logic for when to consider window functions as supported features of a generated SQL query.\n\nGiven the distributed nature of `NotSupportedError` mentions, precise identification of the bug and fixing it would require in-depth examination of these specific files, especially in parts of the code where window expressions in annotations are processed or SQL queries involving such expressions are compiled."

However, considering the limitations and the aim to provide a targeted response based on the available information, we proceed with identifying potential bug locations and their intended fixes.\n\n### Bug Locations\n\n1. **File**: `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, **Class**: `SQLCompiler`\n   - **Method**: Potentially a method involved in compiling the `SELECT` clause that includes the handling of window expressions. Specific details are not available, but `compile` methods or methods that handle expressions within `SELECT` are candidates.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Update or refine the logic to accurately recognize and allow window functions in the `SELECT` clause of an SQL query. This may involve adjusting the conditions under which `NotSupportedError` is raised, to ensure that it is not triggered by the valid use of window expressions in annotations. The compiler should be able to generate SQL for queries using the window functions in the `SELECT` clause without raising exceptions, as long as those uses align with SQL standards.\n\n2. **File**: `django/db/models/expressions.py`, **Class**: `Window`\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Verify and possibly update the `Window` class to ensure it correctly flags its use as appropriate in `SELECT` clause contexts and does not inadvertently contribute to triggering a `NotSupportedError` when processed by the rest of the ORM or compiler logic. It may also involve ensuring that the `contains_aggregate` and other relevant flags are set in a way that does not mislead the ORM's validation checks.\n\n### Additional Context\n\nFor a more precise pinpointing of the issue and to craft a solution, further context would be ideal, such as understanding exactly how the ORM interprets window function expressions during the SQL compilation phase and any relevant validation checks that precede it. Unfortunately, without specifying methods where `NotSupportedError` is specifically related to window functions in annotations, the above locations are conjectural based on the provided information about the Django ORM's handling of SQL and window expressions.\n\nThese locations and intended behaviors approach the problem from the perspective that the handling of window functions specifically in annotations is not being correctly recognized or processed by parts of Django's ORM. The solution would involve ensuring that the ORM allows for the compliant use of SQL window functions within the context described by the issue, aligning with both Django's design philosophy and SQL standards."
