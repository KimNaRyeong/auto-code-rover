Its `as_sql` method is responsible for generating the SQL representation of the window expression.\n   \n2. **Relation to the Issue**: Since the issue involves Django raising a `NotSupportedError` when using window expressions in conditional statements within the `SELECT` clause, and given that `Window` objects clearly support an SQL-like interface (including ordering and partitioning), it indicates that the class itself is likely capable of doing what the user expects but may be improperly integrated or used within the wider ORM query generation context, especially in `annotate()` calls.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: The intended behavior of the `Window` class within an `annotate` call should be to allow its expressions to be used without raising errors if they're used correctly according to SQL standards, which in this case means being part of the SELECT clause but not being used in WHERE clauses, JOINS, etc.\n\n### Analysis of the `annotate` method\n\n1. **Functionality**: The `annotate` method allows adding fields to each object returned in a QuerySet that are not necessarily a part of the model's fields. This can include aggregate values computed over some set of fields or other expressions. The method validates that provided arguments are expressions, manages aliases to ensure no conflicts, and modifies the query clone to include the annotations.\n\n2. **Relation to the Issue**: The `annotate` method is the context in which the user encounters the issue. It suggests that when window expressions (which are valid expressions) are passed to `annotate`, there's a validation or processing step that fails to account properly for these cases, triggering a `NotSupportedError`.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: The intended behavior in this context would allow users to pass window functions through `annotate`, adding calculated fields based on these window expressions to the QuerySet without raising unsupported errors\u2014provided these uses conform to SQL standards, meaning they are only part of the SELECT clause and not mishandled as part of WHERE conditions or similar.\n\nGiven the complexity of the issue and the understanding that the `NotSupportedError` might be coming from a different part of the Django ORM - possibly the validation or query compilation steps that handle window expressions improperly - a next step could involve investigating how Django constructs its SQL queries from QuerySets and how it specifically treats window functions in those translations. This investigation might focus on methods related to SQL compilation or validation within Django's ORM layer, which could involve:\n\n- Searching for the method or function that raises `NotSupportedError` for a better understanding of its intended constraints.\n- Investigating how Django's ORM translates `annotate()` calls into SQL to spot where the window function expressions might be mishandled."

Since the actual method or function that triggers the `NotSupportedError` when using window functions in `annotate` calls has not been identified through the provided API calls, further context is indeed necessary to specifically pinpoint the cause of the issue and to determine an appropriate fix. Thus, to proceed towards a resolution, we should:\n\n- `search_code(\"NotSupportedError\")`: This will help identify where in the Django codebase the `NotSupportedError` is being raised, especially in relation to the handling of window expressions within queries. Given that the issue describes a situation where this error should not appear (since SQL standards allow for window functions in the SELECT part of queries), locating the source of this error is crucial.\n\n2. **Bug Locations**:\n\nAs of the current analysis, the specific bug location within the project files could not be conclusively identified due to the lack of detailed information on where the `NotSupportedError` is raised from when window functions are used in an `annotate` method. The intended behavior at the location(s) identified by further investigation would involve:\n\n- **Intended Behavior**: The code responsible for assembling the SQL query from a Django QuerySet, particularly when it involves window functions used within `annotate`, should correctly recognize and allow such usage as valid, aligning with SQL standards. This means that the logic triggering the `NotSupportedError` needs to be adjusted or bypassed under conditions where window functions are appropriately used in the SELECT clause of a query. This adjustment should ensure that window functions in annotations do not incorrectly trigger validations intended for preventing their use in unsupported query parts (like the WHERE clause).\n\nFurther information obtained through the recommended search API call would allow for a precise determination of the bug location(s) and the necessary modifications to resolve the issue while preserving the existing functionality of Django's ORM."
