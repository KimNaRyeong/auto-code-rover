        "content": "To begin resolving the issue, we need to gather context around where Django handles window expressions and where the `NotSupportedError` might be raised from. Based on the description of the issue, the following steps will be crucial:\n\n1. Identify where Django evaluates the conditions for window expressions in the SELECT clause to possibly pinpoint the location of the bug (i.e., where it improperly raises a `NotSupportedError`).\n\n2. Since the regression is mentioned with a specific commit hash, looking into files or classes modified in that commit could provide insights but since direct commit inspection is not available through the provided APIs, we will focus on the parts of the code most likely affected by the issue description.\n\nGiven the details, the following classes, methods, and code contexts are critical to our investigation:\n\n- The handling of `annotate()` method which is part of the QuerySet API.\n- How Django translates the `Window` expression into SQL.\n- The code related to raising `NotSupportedError` especially in the context of window functions and the SELECT clause.\n\nLet's start by searching for the classes and methods involved in the window expression and annotation process:\n\n1. `Window` class handling.\n2. `QuerySet` class or its method `annotate` where `Window` expressions could be processed.\n3. `Case` and `When` classes might also be relevant, but the core issue seems more closely related to window expressions and their context in SQL generation.\n\nAPI calls to make:\n\n- `search_class(\"Window\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"annotate\", \"QuerySet\")`"
