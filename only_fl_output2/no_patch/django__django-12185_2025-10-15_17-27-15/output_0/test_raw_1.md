Given the feedback, it seems there was a mistake in using `NotSupportedError` which is not directly available from `django.core.exceptions`. The correct exception class that can be used to capture a database backend's refusal to execute a query with a window function in a certain context is typically `django.db.utils.NotSupportedError` or a more generic exception such as `django.db.utils.OperationalError` depending on the database backend being used.

Let's correct the script to properly handle this situation by updating the import statement and making sure any database backend specific exception related to the issue can be caught and reported. Here is the corrected version of the `reproducer.py`:

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import django
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import F, Value, Window, When, Case
from django.db.models.functions import Lag
from django.db.utils import OperationalError, NotSupportedError

os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "your_project.settings")  # Replace `your_project.settings` with your actual Django project settings module
django.setup()

class Employee(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    salary = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    department = models.CharField(max_length=100)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        Employee.objects.annotate(
            lag=Window(
                expression=Lag('salary', offset=1),
                partition_by=[F('department')],
                order_by=[F('salary').asc(), F('name').asc()],
            ),
            is_changed=Case(
                When(salary=F('lag'), then=Value(False)),
                default=Value(True), output_field=models.BooleanField()
            ),
        ).first()
    except (OperationalError, NotSupportedError) as e:
        print("Issue reproduced successfully.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert True  # The assertion to indicate the presence of the issue
        return
    except Exception as e:
        print("Unexpected exception type.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False  # This should not happen if the issue is as expected

    # If execution reaches this point, it implies the issue did not occur as anticipated
    print("No issue detected. It seems like the problem has been resolved.")
    assert False  # An assertion to ensure the script exits with an error if the issue is not reproduced

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note a few adjustments you need to make to run this script correctly:

- Replace `"your_project.settings"` with the actual path to your Django project's settings module.
- Ensure your database schema is updated to include the `Employee` model, either by creating a corresponding migration and applying it or adjusting the script as necessary for your environment.

This script attempts to reproduce the described issue by executing a database query that includes a window expression inside the `annotate` method. If the issue exists as described, running this script should catch either a `django.db.utils.OperationalError` or `django.db.utils.NotSupportedError` (depending on the exact nature of the failure and the database backend used), which is then reported by printing a stack trace.
