        "intended_behavior": "This class/method should accurately generate Django model fields that reflect foreign keys pointing to unique fields other than the primary key in the source database. This involves not only detecting that a foreign key exists but also identifying the specific field it references if it's not the primary key. The code should then appropriately generate a `models.ForeignKey` attribute in the model with an option to specify the exact field of the referenced table if necessary."

        "method": "that handle the details of extracting foreign key information from the database schema",
        "intended_behavior": "Within these backend-specific files, the introspection logic related to foreign key detection must properly identify and parse foreign key constraints that reference a unique column other than the primary key. The logic should be capable of understanding and translating these foreign key relationships into appropriate Django ORM syntax (`models.ForeignKey`) with accurate reference to the targeted unique field. This functionality ensures that `inspectdb` can create model definitions that faithfully reproduce the database's relational structure, even in cases where foreign keys point to unique rather than primary keys."
