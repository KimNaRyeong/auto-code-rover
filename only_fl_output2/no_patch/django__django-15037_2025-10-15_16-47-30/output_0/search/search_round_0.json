        "content": "To address the described issue effectively, we need to gather more context about how foreign keys are handled, specifically how models are generated from database tables. The main points of interest include classes and methods that are likely involved in the process of generating models from database schemas (`inspectdb` functionality). This functionality is typically part of the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) of a framework, and knowing the issue is related to Django (suggested by `inspectdb` reference), we will focus on finding the relevant parts in Django's codebase.\n\nBased on the issue, the following API calls would be necessary to get more context:\n\n1. **Search for classes and methods involved in the `inspectdb` process**:\n    - This requires knowing where the `inspectdb` command logic resides within the Django codebase. Assuming `inspectdb` is a management command, it's likely part of Django's core management commands. However, without specific knowledge of class names involved, we might initially search for the method or code snippet related to handling foreign keys within the command's functionality.\n    - `search_method(\"inspectdb\")`: Since `inspectdb` is a management command, there might be a method that initializes or handles its execution.\n    - `search_code(\"inspectdb\")`: To find occurrences of the code relevant to the `inspectdb` process which might not be encapsulated in a method with `inspectdb` in its name.\n  \n2. **Find how foreign keys are detected and mapped to models**:\n    - The issue description indicates a problem with mapping foreign keys correctly when they reference a unique field other than the primary key. Thus, we are interested in finding the part of the code that handles foreign key detection and the generation of the model fields.\n    - `search_code(\"FOREIGN KEY\")`: Since we are dealing with foreign key generation, searching for this part of SQL syntax may reveal how the Django `inspectdb` command parses foreign keys from the database schema.\n  \n3. **Obtain details on model field generation**:\n    - Given that the main issue revolves around the incorrect mapping of foreign keys in generated models, understanding how fields are generated for each model during the `inspectdb` process is key.\n    - `search_code(\"models.ForeignKey\")`: Since Django models use `models.ForeignKey` for defining foreign key relationships, finding occurrences of this might help locate where the mapping is done incorrectly.\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive context surrounding how Django's `inspectdb` command works, especially concerning foreign key handling and model field generation, which are directly related to the reported issue."
