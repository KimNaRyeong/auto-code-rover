To address the issue of `ModuleNotFoundError` encountered in the previous attempt, it's essential to ensure that the necessary modules (`numpy` and `astropy`) are installed in your Python environment. If not, you can install them using pip before running the reproducer. For demonstration purposes, I'll bypass the installation steps and head straight into amending the reproducer script under the assumption that `numpy` and `astropy` are now correctly installed in your environment.

Here's an updated version of `reproducer.py` which should work as expected:

```python
# reproducer.py

import numpy as np
from astropy.stats import biweight_location

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_biweight_location_with_constant_array():
    # Execute the biweight_location on a constant array
    result = biweight_location(np.ones(4))
    
    # Check if the result is not a number (NaN)
    if np.isnan(result):
        try:
            # The test condition fails because we expected a non-NaN result
            assert not np.isnan(result), "biweight_location of a constant array returned NaN"
        except AssertionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            # Since we're catching the AssertionError, exit with code 0 indicating the issue is reproduced
            exit(0)
    
    # If the test passes (i.e., doesn't end up NaN), print a corresponding success message
    print("Test passed: biweight_location returned the expected result.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_biweight_location_with_constant_array()

```

This time, the script includes an explicit check to see if `biweight_location` returns `NaN` for a constant array and expects it not toâ€”indicating the issue when it does. Remember, this script is designed under the premise that the encountered issue still persists and will exit with code 0 to signal that the issue was successfully reproduced. If the issue has been resolved and `biweight_location` returns the correct result, the script will print a success message instead.
