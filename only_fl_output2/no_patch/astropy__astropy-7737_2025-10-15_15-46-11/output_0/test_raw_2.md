Understood, let's write a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that you've requested. This script is designed to reproduce the issue where `biweight_location` from `astropy.stats` returns `nan` for a constant array, and it also incorporates the function you've provided for printing the stack trace clearly:

```python
# reproducer.py

import numpy as np
from astropy.stats import biweight_location

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Test data: a constant array
    test_data = np.ones(4)
    try:
        # Attempt to calculate the biweight location
        result = biweight_location(test_data)
        assert not np.isnan(result), "Unexpected nan result from biweight_location"
        # If no exception is raised and the result is not nan, the issue is considered not reproduced (fixed).
        print("Success: No issue detected, the result is:", result)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Exit with code 0 indicating that the AssertionError was expected and thus the issue is reproduced.
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script will attempt to calculate the biweight location of a constant array using `astropy.stats.biweight_location`. If the function returns `nan`, this is unexpected behavior based on the issue described, and the script will handle this by raising an `AssertionError`.

- If the `AssertionError` is caught (indicating the issue is present), the script prints a detailed stack trace and exits with code `0`, signaling that the issue was successfully reproduced.
- If no error is encountered (meaning the issue is potentially fixed or not reproducing under the given circumstances), it prints a success message indicating no issue was detected, and the script exits normally.

Please ensure that `astropy` and `numpy` are installed in your environment to avoid import issues. You can install them using pip if necessary:

```sh
pip install numpy astropy
```

Then, you can run the script with:

```sh
python3 reproducer.py
```

This script requires Python 3.x and appropriate installations of the `numpy` and `astropy` packages to run correctly.
