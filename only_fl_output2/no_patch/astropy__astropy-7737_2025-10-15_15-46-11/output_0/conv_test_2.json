If not, you can install them using pip before running the reproducer. For demonstration purposes, I'll bypass the installation steps and head straight into amending the reproducer script under the assumption that `numpy` and `astropy` are now correctly installed in your environment.\n\nHere's an updated version of `reproducer.py` which should work as expected:\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom astropy.stats import biweight_location\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef test_biweight_location_with_constant_array():\n    # Execute the biweight_location on a constant array\n    result = biweight_location(np.ones(4))\n    \n    # Check if the result is not a number (NaN)\n    if np.isnan(result):\n        try:\n            # The test condition fails because we expected a non-NaN result\n            assert not np.isnan(result), \"biweight_location of a constant array returned NaN\"\n        except AssertionError as e:\n            print_stacktrace(e)\n            # Since we're catching the AssertionError, exit with code 0 indicating the issue is reproduced\n            exit(0)\n    \n    # If the test passes (i.e., doesn't end up NaN), print a corresponding success message\n    print(\"Test passed: biweight_location returned the expected result.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_biweight_location_with_constant_array()\n\n```\n\nThis time, the script includes an explicit check to see if `biweight_location` returns `NaN` for a constant array and expects it not to\u2014indicating the issue when it does. Remember, this script is designed under the premise that the encountered issue still persists and will exit with code 0 to signal that the issue was successfully reproduced. If the issue has been resolved and `biweight_location` returns the correct result, the script will print a success message instead."
