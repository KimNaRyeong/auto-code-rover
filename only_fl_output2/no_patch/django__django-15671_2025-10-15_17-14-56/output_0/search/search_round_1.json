        "content": "### Analysis of the Collected Context\n\nLet's address each piece of information we've obtained through the API calls:\n\n#### 1. Search Class `FormSet` Result\nThe system couldn't find a class named `FormSet` directly in the codebase. This suggests that the `FormSet` might not be a standalone class or is perhaps dynamically generated or heavily abstracted, which is common in frameworks like Django, where classes can be generated or modified at runtime through factories or other mechanisms. Given this, the issue might be related to a base class or a factory function that produces formset classes.\n\n#### 2. `inlineformset_factory` Method in `django/forms/models.py`\nThe `inlineformset_factory` function is crucial for dynamically generating formsets that are tied to a parent model. The code snippet shows various arguments that can be used to customize the generated formset, including `error_messages`, which suggests that it's intended to allow customization of error messages at the time of formset creation. Since the issue description talks about wanting to override error messages via `inlineformset_factory`, this piece of code is directly related to the issue. The `error_messages` parameter here can be leveraged to implement the feature requested in the issue.\n\n#### 3. No Class `FormSet` in `__init__` Result\nThe absence of an `__init__` method in a `FormSet` class from the search results further supports the idea that `FormSet` classes are not statically defined but are rather created dynamically, possibly through functions like `inlineformset_factory` or similar factory methods.\n\n#### 4. `error_messages` Usages in the Codebase\nThe widespread use of `error_messages` throughout various files, especially in `django/forms/models.py` and `django/forms/formsets.py`, indicates that error message customization is a built-in feature across form and model handling in Django. This broad usage underscores the importance of having flexible and overrideable error messages, including within formsets, which is the crux of the submitted issue.\n\n### Conclusions and Next Steps\n\nGiven these insights, the intended behavior seems to be the ability to customize or override error messages specifically for scenarios where too few or too many forms are submitted within a formset, directly at the point of `inlineformset_factory` usage or possibly through other formset instantiation mechanisms.\n\nSince we've determined the use of `inlineformset_factory` as a potential interaction point for implementing this feature, it's likely that the enhancement involves extending or modifying its behavior to respect custom error messages related to the number of forms in a more explicit or accessible way. This might involve adjusting how `error_messages` passed to `inlineformset_factory` or its instantiated formsets are handled, especially concerning validating the number of forms.\n\nTo proceed, we might need to further investigate how formsets perform validation (particularly regarding quantity) and how they utilize the `error_messages` dict. This could involve searching for validation methods within `django/forms/formsets.py` or wherever the formset classes are defined or generated.\n\nGiven the lack of direct hits for a `FormSet` class, additional searches could include:\n- Exploring the `BaseFormSet` class to understand the base functionalities of formsets, as `FormSet` might be a concept rather than a specific class.\n- Searching for validation methods within formsets, possibly focusing on those handling the count of forms, such as `clean` methods or any specific validation for \"too many\" or \"too few\" forms."

While the method already accepts an `error_messages` argument, ensuring that this argument can seamlessly override default messages for form count validation will address the issue. This may involve further piping this customization through to the `BaseInlineFormSet` or wherever the actual validation for form count happens, preserving existing functionality while adding the new capability for message override.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: File: django/forms/formsets.py\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Although I haven't specified a class or method, this location is identified based on the inference that formset validation logic likely resides here. Modification or extension in this file should ensure that formset validation related to the number of forms leverages `error_messages` provided at construction time (for instance, through factories like `inlineformset_factory`). This would directly involve augmenting or ensuring the validation process can dynamically use custom error messages for form count issues, without altering the core validation logic beyond the handling of error messages. This enhancement needs to be compatible with formsets created through different mechanisms, not just `inlineformset_factory`, ensuring broad applicability."
