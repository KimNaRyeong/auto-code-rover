        "intended_behavior": "During the parsing of the multipart form data where filenames are extracted, specifically after the filename has been determined within the `parse` method (lines involving `file_name = disposition.get('filename')`), implement logic to strip any external double quotes from the filename. This logic should carefully identify and remove only the leading and trailing quotes, preserving any internal quotes that are part of the actual filename. This adjustment ensures compatibility with clients that include double quotes in the filename field of the Content-Disposition header of multipart form data, without altering the handling of filenames that do not include such quotes. The goal is to ensure the filename is accurately represented in Django without extraneous quotes, aligning with the behavior observed in certain clients and tools, thereby enhancing the robustness of Django's multipart form handling capabilities."
