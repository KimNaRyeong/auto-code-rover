However, some third-party tools wrap the value in double quotation marks when wrapping HTTP requests (such as the filename of the file uploaded by PostmanCanary). This results in double quotes for the filename at the end of Django parsing.\nPostman request body:\n----------------------------677822685948106391633425\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"\u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\"; filename*=\"UTF-8''%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95.txt\"\nContent-Type: text/plain\ntest\n----------------------------677822685948106391633425--\ndjango got filename is \u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\" not \u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\nThis is not a bug of Django.

        "content": "To gather the necessary context for addressing the issue related to multipart parsing and specifically dealing with filenames wrapped in double quotes, we will need to explore several key areas in the Django project codebase. Given the nature of the issue, our focus should be on the implementation of multipart parsing and any utilities or methods involved in handling the content disposition of multipart forms.\n\nHere are the API calls we should make to get the required context:\n\n1. Search for the class responsible for multipart parsing. Based on Django's architecture, this functionality might be a part of form parsing or request handling modules. Thus, we first look for a class named `MultiPartParser` or similar.\n   \n   ```\n   search_class(\"MultiPartParser\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the issue involves how filenames are handled, there should be a specific method dealing with parsing or processing the filename part of the content disposition header in multipart forms. Assuming such a method might be within or related to the `MultiPartParser` class, we should search for method names that suggest handling of filenames or content disposition headers.\n   \n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"parse_filename\", \"MultiPartParser\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"get_filename\", \"MultiPartParser\")\n   ```\n\n3. The issue description mentions compatibility behavior in CPython, comparing it with how Django handles filename parsing. Given this context, it's also helpful to understand how filenames are extracted specifically from the content disposition header, whether this process is in a utility method potentially used across different parts of Django.\n   \n   ```\n   search_method(\"parse_content_disposition\")\n   ```\n\n4. Additionally, understanding any existing code that specifically deals with quotes in headers or filenames could provide some context on how Django intends to handle such cases, or if there\u2019s precedent for handling quotes in a similar scenario.\n   \n   ```\n   search_code(\"filename=\\\"\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches aim to provide a comprehensive view of the code related to the issue, including how multipart form data is parsed in Django, how filenames are extracted and handled, and whether there's existing functionality that deals with or could be adapted to deal with filenames in double quotes."
