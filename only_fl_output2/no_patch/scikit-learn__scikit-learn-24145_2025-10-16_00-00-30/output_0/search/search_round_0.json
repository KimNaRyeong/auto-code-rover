Specifically, we're interested in modifications to support returning a sparse matrix. Here are the necessary API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"SplineTransformer\")`: This will help us locate the file(s) where the `SplineTransformer` class is defined.\n- `search_code(\"fit_transform\")`: Since the issue involves the `fit_transform` method, we need to find where it's implemented or if it relies on inherited behavior that might be modified.\n- `search_method(\"fit_transform\")`: To gather more details on how `fit_transform` is currently implemented and how it might be modified to support sparse matrix outputs.\n- `search_code(\"import numpy as np\")`: To understand where numpy is used in the context of the `SplineTransformer`, as modifications might require changing how numpy arrays are handled.\n- `search_code(\"import scipy\")`: Since the proposed solution involves using functionality from scipy (specifically `design_matrix`), searching for scipy imports will provide insight into how scipy is currently utilized, which is essential for integrating the new feature."
