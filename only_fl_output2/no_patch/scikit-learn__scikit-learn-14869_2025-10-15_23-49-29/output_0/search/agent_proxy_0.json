Key areas to explore include the initialization and fitting process of `HistGradientBoostingClassifier`, as well as how it processes the `loss` parameter. Here are the API calls that can help us get this context:\n\n- `search_class(\"HistGradientBoostingClassifier\")`: to get information on the class definition and potentially the file it's located in.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"HistGradientBoostingClassifier\")`: to understand how the `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` handles the fitting process, especially with regard to loss functions.\n- `search_code(\"loss='categorical_crossentropy'\")`: to find instances where `categorical_crossentropy` is explicitly handled or mentioned in the codebase, which could give clues on its expected behavior or integration points."
