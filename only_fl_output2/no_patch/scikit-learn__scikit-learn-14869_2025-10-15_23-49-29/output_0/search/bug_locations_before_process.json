        "intended_behavior": "This method should be updated to include a validation check for the use of 'categorical_crossentropy' in binary classification tasks. Specifically, if 'self.loss' is manually set to 'categorical_crossentropy' but 'self.n_trees_per_iteration_ == 1' (indicating binary classification), the method should raise a ValueError with a message indicating that 'categorical_crossentropy' is not suitable for binary classification and suggesting the use of 'binary_crossentropy' or letting the classifier auto-select the loss with 'auto'. This change prevents the classifier from silently failing and guides the user towards correct configuration, thereby preserving existing functionality for auto and multiclass settings while improving error handling for binary classification."
