Given the constraints and the goals to reproduce the issue clearly while tracking potential failures, below is a refined version of the `reproducer.py` script that aims to catch the specific problem described, regarding `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` with `categorical_crossentropy` on binary classification. This version will check for correct behavior and react accordingly when the issue is detected.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.experimental import enable_hist_gradient_boosting  # noqa
    from sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingClassifier
    
    X = np.array([[1, 0], [1, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1]])
    y = np.array([1, 1, 1, 0, 1])
    gb = HistGradientBoostingClassifier(loss='categorical_crossentropy', min_samples_leaf=1)
    gb.fit(X, y)
    
    pred1 = gb.predict([[1, 0]])[0]
    pred2 = gb.predict([[0, 1]])[0]
    
    # Given the issue, we expect an incorrect prediction. Correct behavior should assert an error.
    assert pred1 == 1 and pred2 == 0, "Correct behavior observed with categorical_crossentropy on binary classification, which contradicts the reported issue."
    print("Issue not reproduced. Predictions are as expected for binary classification with categorical_crossentropy.")
except AssertionError as error:
    print("Issue reproduced: Incorrect behavior detected with categorical_crossentropy on binary classification.")
    print_stacktrace(error)
    sys.exit(0)  # Exits with 0 indicating the script confirmed the issue
except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected error occurred while attempting to reproduce the issue.")
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero code indicating failure to execute test properly
```

This code involves an assert statement that gets triggered if the predictions match the expected, thus indicating the potential absence of the issue. If the predictions are incorrect per the issue description, the AssertionError exception is caught, and a message confirming the reproduction of the issue is printed along with the stack trace for debugging. If any other exception is caught, it indicates an unexpected failure during the execution of the test case, providing a stack trace for further investigation.
