The previous response provided a script that intended to reproduce an issue but may have missed the target problem statement you're addressing. Given your request for a correct approach in a standalone `reproducer.py` file along with the correct use of a specific method to print the stack trace clearly, here's an updated attempt:

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    from sklearn.experimental import enable_hist_gradient_boosting  # noqa: F401
    from sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingClassifier
    X = [[1, 0],
         [1, 0],
         [1, 0],
         [0, 1],
         [1, 1]]
    y = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]
    gb = HistGradientBoostingClassifier(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
                                        min_samples_leaf=1)
    gb.fit(X, y)
    pred1 = gb.predict([[1, 0]])[0]
    pred2 = gb.predict([[0, 1]])[0]
    
    # assert condition to raise an error if the predictions are not as expected
    assert pred1 == 1 and pred2 == 0, "HGBC with categorical_crossentropy does not work as expected for binary classification."
    print("No issue detected. The issue might have been fixed.")
except AssertionError as ae:
    print_stacktrace(ae)
    sys.exit(1)  # exit with error code 1
except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected error occurred.")
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # exit with error code 1
```

This script aims to directly address the issue related to `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` when using `categorical_crossentropy` for binary classification. Specifically, it intends to check whether the classifier predicts correctly for a simple binary classification task. If the behavior diverges from expectations (i.e., producing incorrect predictions), an `AssertionError` is raised, with a stack trace providing detailed context about the failure. If another type of error occurs, it reports an "unexpected error."

In case the classifier behaves as expected without issues, the script prints a success message and exits with code 0, indicating no error. This script, therefore, should serve as a more directly related response to reproducing and diagnosing the reported issue.
