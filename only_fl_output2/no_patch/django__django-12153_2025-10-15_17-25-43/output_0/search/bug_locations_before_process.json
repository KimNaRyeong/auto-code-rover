        "method": "update_proxy_model_permissions",
        "intended_behavior": "The method `update_proxy_model_permissions` should be modified to explicitly handle multi-database environments by ensuring the migration script can either determine the correct database to use for updating permissions or can accept a database argument to specify which database should be used. The migration operation wrapped inside `transaction.atomic()` should explicitly specify the database if multiple databases are configured and a default database is either not set or does not make sense for the operation. This can be achieved by adding a `using` parameter to the `Permission.objects.filter().update()` call, where `using` is determined based on a strategy suitable for the project's multi-database setup. Preserving existing functionality means ensuring that if a default database is configured and appropriate, operations would proceed as before, without requiring modifications to existing configurations that already work."
