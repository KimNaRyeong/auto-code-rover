        "intended_behavior": "The method should enforce or suggest that 'SessionMiddleware' must be installed and configured before 'AuthenticationMiddleware' in the Django 'MIDDLEWARE' setting. This can be done by adding a system check similar to the E410 check in the admin checks file, specifically designed to check the order of these middleware. The check should be run as part of the startup system checks, ensuring the correct configuration before the server fully starts. This prevents runtime errors related to session management and authentication middleware dependencies."

        "intended_behavior": "Enhance the 'check_dependencies' function to verify not only the presence of required middleware ('SessionMiddleware', 'AuthenticationMiddleware', 'MessageMiddleware') for the admin app but also their order. Specifically, it should ensure 'SessionMiddleware' is listed before 'AuthenticationMiddleware' in the 'MIDDLEWARE' setting. This is to prevent the Django admin from starting up with a configuration that will lead to runtime assertion errors, thus guiding the developer towards a correct configuration upfront. This could potentially involve adding a new check function or expanding the existing checks to include order validation."
