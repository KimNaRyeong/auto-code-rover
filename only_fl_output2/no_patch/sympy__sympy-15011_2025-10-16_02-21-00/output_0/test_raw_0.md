Certainly! Below is the standalone Python file **`reproducer.py`** designed to reproduce the issue as specified. It checks for the described behavior with `sympy.lambdify` and `MatrixSymbol`s named with curly braces, expecting to hit a `SyntaxError` due to the described bug. A stack trace will be printed if the issue is encountered, and it should normally exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed (i.e., if it doesn't hit an `AssertionError`).

```python
# reproducer.py
import sympy as sy

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_lambdify_with_matrix_symbol_and_curly_braces():
    curlyx = sy.symbols("{x}")
    v = sy.MatrixSymbol("v", 2, 1)
    curlyv = sy.MatrixSymbol("{v}", 2, 1)

    # These are expected to work
    curlyScalarId = sy.lambdify(curlyx, curlyx)
    vectorId = sy.lambdify(v,v)

    # These are expected to throw a SyntaxError
    try:
        curlyVectorId = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv)
        raise AssertionError("lambdify should have failed with MatrixSymbol named '{v}' without dummify")
    except SyntaxError as e:
        print("Caught expected SyntaxError for curlyVectorId")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

    try:
        curlyVectorIdDummified = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv, dummify=True)
        raise AssertionError("lambdify should have failed with MatrixSymbol named '{v}' even with dummify=True")
    except SyntaxError as e:
        print("Caught expected SyntaxError for curlyVectorIdDummified")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_lambdify_with_matrix_symbol_and_curly_braces()
    print("Test passed. No AssertionError raised.")
```

This script will check whether the issue where `lambdify` does not work as expected with `MatrixSymbol` names containing curly braces still exists. The script is designed to provide clear diagnostics in the event of an error, assisting in verifying the presence of the reported issue. When the issue is addressed in Sympy (or if your Sympy version does not have this issue), this script is expected to complete without raising an `AssertionError`, thereby fulfilling the request for it to exit with code 0.
