Understood, let's create a revised version of the `reproducer.py` file based on the updated instructions and specifically focusing on the error handling. The goal is to more accurately reflect the efforts to reproduce the issue described, where the expectation is to see a `SyntaxError` when using `lambdify` with `MatrixSymbol` having curly braces in their names, even with `dummify=True`.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sympy as sy

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        curlyx = sy.symbols("{x}")
        v = sy.MatrixSymbol("v", 2, 1)
        curlyv = sy.MatrixSymbol("{v}", 2, 1)

        curlyScalarId = sy.lambdify(curlyx, curlyx)
        vectorId = sy.lambdify(v, v)

        # First two are expected not to fail
        assert callable(curlyScalarId), "Lambda function for curlyScalarId is not callable"
        assert callable(vectorId), "Lambda function for vectorId is not callable"

        try:
            # This is intended to produce a syntax error
            curlyVectorId = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv)
            assert False, "lambdify did not produce SyntaxError with curly braces in MatrixSymbol name"
        except SyntaxError:
            pass  # This is expected

        try:
            # This is intended to produce a syntax error even when dummify is True
            curlyVectorIdDummified = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv, dummify=True)
            assert False, "lambdify (dummify=True) did not produce SyntaxError with curly braces in MatrixSymbol name"
        except SyntaxError:
            pass  # This is expected

        # If the script reaches this point without assertion errors, the original issue is presumed fixed.
        print("The issue has been fixed.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script asserts that a `SyntaxError` should occur when using `MatrixSymbol` with names that include curly braces, both with and without `dummify=True`. An assertion that fails (i.e., a part of the script where the script expects a `SyntaxError` but does not encounter one) indicates that the initial issue persists. Conversely, if the script does not raise an `AssertionError`, indicating that all assertions passed successfully, it signifies that the issue has been resolved, evidenced by the output message "The issue has been fixed."
