        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how `lambdify` handles `MatrixSymbol` objects, especially with names that include special characters like curly braces `{}`, and how the `dummify` flag is implemented and affects the process. Given this, the following search API calls will help us gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for how the `lambdify` function is implemented to understand its general behavior:\n   - `search_method(\"lambdify\")`\n\n2. Since the issue specifically involves `MatrixSymbol`s with special characters in their names, let's look into the implementation of `MatrixSymbol` to understand how names are handled:\n   - `search_class(\"MatrixSymbol\")`\n\n3. The `dummify` flag's role in `lambdify` and how it interacts with symbol names, especially with special characters, is crucial for resolving the issue. It's necessary to see where and how `dummify` is processed within the `lambdify` function:\n   - `search_code(\"dummify\")`"
