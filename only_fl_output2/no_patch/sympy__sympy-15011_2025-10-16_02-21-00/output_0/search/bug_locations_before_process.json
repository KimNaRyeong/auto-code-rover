        "intended_behavior": "The `lambdify` function, specifically where the `dummify` logic is applied (around lines 388-397), needs to be adjusted to ensure that `MatrixSymbol` names containing special characters, like curly braces, are correctly handled and converted into valid Python variable names. This might involve enhancing the logic that generates dummy variable names to either avoid using invalid characters or provide a more robust method of generating valid Python identifiers for any given symbol name, irrespective of its original character set. The behavior should ensure that the generated code does not contain Python syntax errors when special characters are present in `MatrixSymbol` names. This fix needs to preserve the core functionality of converting SymPy expressions into callable Python functions while maintaining existing capabilities for symbol names without special characters."
