The revised script will be more aligned with the goal of triggering an `AssertionError` if the issue described is present, and correctly exiting with code 0 when the issue is fixed. The misunderstanding seems to be related to the interpretation of the test results. Let's ensure the test aligns more closely with the requirements by raising `AssertionError` correctly based on the specific behavior of the `lambdify` function when encountering errors.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\nimport sympy as sy\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef test_lambdify_with_matrix_symbol_and_curly_braces():\n    curlyx = sy.symbols(\"{x}\")\n    v = sy.MatrixSymbol(\"v\", 2, 1)\n    curlyv = sy.MatrixSymbol(\"{v}\", 2, 1)\n\n    # These are expected to work\n    curlyScalarId = sy.lambdify(curlyx, curlyx)\n    vectorId = sy.lambdify(v,v)\n\n    error_occurred = False\n\n    # This is expected to throw a SyntaxError, test should pass if it does\n    try:\n        curlyVectorId = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv)\n        # If no exception is thrown, we consider the test failed\n        error_occurred = True\n        print(\"Curly braces in MatrixSymbol name did not cause an error as expected.\")\n    except SyntaxError:\n        print(\"Caught expected SyntaxError for curlyVectorId\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)\n\n    try:\n        curlyVectorIdDummified = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv, dummify=True)\n        # If no exception is thrown, we consider the test failed\n        error_occurred = True\n        print(\"Curly braces in MatrixSymbol name with `dummify=True` did not cause an error as expected.\")\n    except SyntaxError:\n        print(\"Caught expected SyntaxError for curlyVectorIdDummified\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)\n\n    if error_occurred:\n        raise AssertionError(\"Failed: `lambdify` did not behave as expected with `MatrixSymbol` having curly braces in its name.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        test_lambdify_with_matrix_symbol_and_curly_braces()\n        print(\"Test passed. No issues with `lambdify` and `MatrixSymbol` names containing curly braces were detected.\")\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)\n```\n\nIn this revised script:\n\n- The failure condition is clarified: the lack of a `SyntaxError` when executing `lambdify` with `MatrixSymbol` names containing curly braces is considered a failure. This aligns with the initially described issue.\n- A boolean flag `error_occurred` is introduced to track whether the operations that were expected to fail (due to the issue) have indeed failed or not. If a `SyntaxError` is not raised (indicating the issue was not reproduced), an `AssertionError` is raised at the end of the test.\n- The output messages and the usage of `print_stacktrace` are refined to provide clear insights based on the test outcomes."
