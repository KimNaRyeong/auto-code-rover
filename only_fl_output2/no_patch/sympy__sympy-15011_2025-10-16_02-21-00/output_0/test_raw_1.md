Given the request for a more accurate script to reproduce the issue, I've revised the approach. The revised script will be more aligned with the goal of triggering an `AssertionError` if the issue described is present, and correctly exiting with code 0 when the issue is fixed. The misunderstanding seems to be related to the interpretation of the test results. Let's ensure the test aligns more closely with the requirements by raising `AssertionError` correctly based on the specific behavior of the `lambdify` function when encountering errors.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sympy as sy

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_lambdify_with_matrix_symbol_and_curly_braces():
    curlyx = sy.symbols("{x}")
    v = sy.MatrixSymbol("v", 2, 1)
    curlyv = sy.MatrixSymbol("{v}", 2, 1)

    # These are expected to work
    curlyScalarId = sy.lambdify(curlyx, curlyx)
    vectorId = sy.lambdify(v,v)

    error_occurred = False

    # This is expected to throw a SyntaxError, test should pass if it does
    try:
        curlyVectorId = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv)
        # If no exception is thrown, we consider the test failed
        error_occurred = True
        print("Curly braces in MatrixSymbol name did not cause an error as expected.")
    except SyntaxError:
        print("Caught expected SyntaxError for curlyVectorId")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

    try:
        curlyVectorIdDummified = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv, dummify=True)
        # If no exception is thrown, we consider the test failed
        error_occurred = True
        print("Curly braces in MatrixSymbol name with `dummify=True` did not cause an error as expected.")
    except SyntaxError:
        print("Caught expected SyntaxError for curlyVectorIdDummified")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

    if error_occurred:
        raise AssertionError("Failed: `lambdify` did not behave as expected with `MatrixSymbol` having curly braces in its name.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_lambdify_with_matrix_symbol_and_curly_braces()
        print("Test passed. No issues with `lambdify` and `MatrixSymbol` names containing curly braces were detected.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
```

In this revised script:

- The failure condition is clarified: the lack of a `SyntaxError` when executing `lambdify` with `MatrixSymbol` names containing curly braces is considered a failure. This aligns with the initially described issue.
- A boolean flag `error_occurred` is introduced to track whether the operations that were expected to fail (due to the issue) have indeed failed or not. If a `SyntaxError` is not raised (indicating the issue was not reproduced), an `AssertionError` is raised at the end of the test.
- The output messages and the usage of `print_stacktrace` are refined to provide clear insights based on the test outcomes.
