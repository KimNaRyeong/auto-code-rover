        "method": "__eq__",
        "intended_behavior": "In order to resolve the issue described, the `__eq__` method within the `Model` class should be modified to return `NotImplemented` when the comparison is made with an object that is not an instance of a Django Model, instead of returning `False`. This change will signal to Python's comparison mechanisms to attempt the comparison from the other object's perspective or to fall back on default behavior if no appropriate comparison method exists on the other object. The rest of the comparison logic should remain unchanged to preserve existing functionality for cases where both objects being compared are instances of Django Models. This adjustment ensures compatibility with the Python data model reference and fixes the interaction with objects such as `unittest.mock.ANY` and others implementing their own `__eq__` method for testing or other purposes. To sum up, the line `if not isinstance(other, Model): return False` needs to be modified to `if not isinstance(other, Model): return NotImplemented`, ensuring that the method's behavior is correct according to the Python data model guidelines."
