Given the context and the constraints, I understand you would like a Python script (`reproducer.py`) that specifically tests for the Sphinx issue related to handling duplicate file references. Based on the information you've provided, I am modifying the approach to ensure it focuses on a Python environment where Sphinx is assumed to be installed and properly configured.

This version of `reproducer.py` will manually create a Sphinx project structure in a temporary directory, resembling the initially described scenario. It will then invoke Sphinx programmatically via its Python API rather than relying on the command line interface. This approach ensures better integration with the Python execution environment and error handling.

```python
import os
import sys
from sphinx.application import Sphinx
from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_sphinx_project(base_dir):
    src_dir = os.path.join(base_dir, 'source')
    build_dir = os.path.join(base_dir, 'build')
    os.makedirs(src_dir)
    os.makedirs(build_dir)
    conf_py = os.path.join(src_dir, 'conf.py')

    # Minimal Sphinx configuration
    with open(conf_py, 'w') as f:
        f.write("extensions = []\n")
        f.write("master_doc = 'index'\n")

    index_rst_path = os.path.join(src_dir, 'index.rst')
    with open(index_rst_path, 'w') as f:
        f.writelines([
            ":download:`downloads/archive.zip`\n",
            ":download:`/document/downloads/archive.zip`\n",
            ":download:`../document/downloads/archive.zip`\n"
        ])

    # Creating a dummy archive.zip in expected download location
    downloads_dir = os.path.join(src_dir, 'downloads')
    os.makedirs(downloads_dir)
    with open(os.path.join(downloads_dir, 'archive.zip'), 'wb') as f:
        f.write(b"Dummy archive content")

    return src_dir, build_dir

def build_sphinx_project(src_dir, build_dir):
    app = Sphinx(src_dir, src_dir, build_dir, build_dir, 'html')
    app.build(force_all=True)
    if app.statuscode != 0:
        raise Exception("Sphinx build failed with status code: {}".format(app.statuscode))

def check_for_duplicates(build_dir):
    downloads_dir = os.path.join(build_dir, '_downloads')
    files = os.listdir(downloads_dir)
    if len(files) > 1:
        raise AssertionError("Found multiple files, indicating duplicates were not correctly handled.")

def main():
    with TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
        try:
            src_dir, build_dir = create_sphinx_project(tmpdir)
            build_sphinx_project(src_dir, build_dir)
            check_for_duplicates(build_dir)
            print("Issue is not present or has been fixed. Only one output file as expected.")
        except Exception as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.exit(main())
```

This script programmatically sets up a minimal Sphinx environment, comes close to mimicking the file structure as described, and checks for the presence of duplicate files in the build output. It will print a stack trace and exit with code 1 if it encounters any exceptions, including if more than one file is found in the designated downloads directory, indicating the issue is present. If everything works as expected and only one output file is produced per the scenario described, the script will indicate that the issue is either not present or has been resolved.
