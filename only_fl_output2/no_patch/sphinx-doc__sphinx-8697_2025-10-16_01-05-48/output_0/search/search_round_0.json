        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue mentioned, we need to explore how Sphinx processes file paths for directives like `:download:` and potentially others (like `figure`) that might face similar issues due to path normalization. Let's focus our search on the relevant classes and methods where file path processing occurs, specifically in relation to handling directives and building the HTML output.\n\n1. Since the issue mentions the `:download:` directive and it's likely handled by a specific method or class related to processing directives or resources, let's start by searching for a method that might be responsible for handling this directive:\n   - `search_method(\"download\")`\n\n2. The issue also hints at a possible solution involving path normalization using `os.path.normpath()`, suggesting that we should look for places where file paths are handled but not normalized. To find where paths might be manipulated, we need to find methods that deal with path manipulation:\n   - `search_code(\"os.path\")`\n\n3. Additionally, since the problem results in the generation of duplicate files in the build output, we should also look into the methods responsible for copying or generating these files in the `_downloads` directory. This might give us further insight into where the duplication issue arises and how paths are treated:\n   - `search_method(\"copy\")`\n   - `search_method(\"generate\")`\n\n4. Given that the problem might not be isolated to just handling the `:download:` directive but could also affect other directives (as mentioned with the `figure` directive), it's beneficial to examine the classes and methods related to directive processing in general. This requires looking into classes that might be designed for this purpose:\n   - `search_class(\"Directive\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to identify the parts of the Sphinx codebase relevant to path handling, directive processing, and file generation, providing a solid foundation for understanding the issue and formulating a patch."
