Based on the information you've provided, I am modifying the approach to ensure it focuses on a Python environment where Sphinx is assumed to be installed and properly configured.\n\nThis version of `reproducer.py` will manually create a Sphinx project structure in a temporary directory, resembling the initially described scenario. It will then invoke Sphinx programmatically via its Python API rather than relying on the command line interface. This approach ensures better integration with the Python execution environment and error handling.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom sphinx.application import Sphinx\nfrom tempfile import TemporaryDirectory\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef create_sphinx_project(base_dir):\n    src_dir = os.path.join(base_dir, 'source')\n    build_dir = os.path.join(base_dir, 'build')\n    os.makedirs(src_dir)\n    os.makedirs(build_dir)\n    conf_py = os.path.join(src_dir, 'conf.py')\n\n    # Minimal Sphinx configuration\n    with open(conf_py, 'w') as f:\n        f.write(\"extensions = []\\n\")\n        f.write(\"master_doc = 'index'\\n\")\n\n    index_rst_path = os.path.join(src_dir, 'index.rst')\n    with open(index_rst_path, 'w') as f:\n        f.writelines([\n            \":download:`downloads/archive.zip`\\n\",\n            \":download:`/document/downloads/archive.zip`\\n\",\n            \":download:`../document/downloads/archive.zip`\\n\"\n        ])\n\n    # Creating a dummy archive.zip in expected download location\n    downloads_dir = os.path.join(src_dir, 'downloads')\n    os.makedirs(downloads_dir)\n    with open(os.path.join(downloads_dir, 'archive.zip'), 'wb') as f:\n        f.write(b\"Dummy archive content\")\n\n    return src_dir, build_dir\n\ndef build_sphinx_project(src_dir, build_dir):\n    app = Sphinx(src_dir, src_dir, build_dir, build_dir, 'html')\n    app.build(force_all=True)\n    if app.statuscode != 0:\n        raise Exception(\"Sphinx build failed with status code: {}\".format(app.statuscode))\n\ndef check_for_duplicates(build_dir):\n    downloads_dir = os.path.join(build_dir, '_downloads')\n    files = os.listdir(downloads_dir)\n    if len(files) > 1:\n        raise AssertionError(\"Found multiple files, indicating duplicates were not correctly handled.\")\n\ndef main():\n    with TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:\n        try:\n            src_dir, build_dir = create_sphinx_project(tmpdir)\n            build_sphinx_project(src_dir, build_dir)\n            check_for_duplicates(build_dir)\n            print(\"Issue is not present or has been fixed.

It will print a stack trace and exit with code 1 if it encounters any exceptions, including if more than one file is found in the designated downloads directory, indicating the issue is present. If everything works as expected and only one output file is produced per the scenario described, the script will indicate that the issue is either not present or has been resolved."
