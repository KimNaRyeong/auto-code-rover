        "intended_behavior": "Add a new method or functionality specifically for pretty printing of the lerchphi function. This new method should recognize the lerchphi function within expressions and convert it into a human-readable format that visually resembles its traditional mathematical notation. The implementation should closely follow the conventions and patterns used for other special functions within pretty.py, ensuring consistency and compatibility with the existing pretty printing framework. This method should integrate seamlessly with the broader pretty printing operations, capturing both the arguments of lerchphi and representing them elegantly in the output. The addition of this functionality will bridge the current gap in the pretty printing module, thereby resolving the issue."
