I first talked about this in the Wagtail Support Channel and while researching further, discovered that this is a Django/Python related issue. This was tested on Python 3.6 and on Python 3.7.\n(quick shoutout to Matt Wescott @gasmanic of Wagtail Fame for being a sparing partner in this)\nThere is a rather detailed analysis (README) in a git repo I created \u200bhttps://github.com/originell/django-wagtail-turkish-i - it was also the basis for my initial call for help in wagtail's support channel. Meanwhile I have extended it with a Django-only project, as to be a 100% sure this has nothing to do with Wagtail.\nI was not able to find anything similar in trac. While I encourage whoever is reading this to actually read the README in the git repo, I want to honor your time and will try to provide a more concise version of the bug here.\nExplanation\nmodels.py\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.utils.text import slugify\nclass Page(models.Model):\n\ttitle = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n\tslug = models.SlugField(allow_unicode=True)\n\tdef __str__(self):\n\t\treturn self.title\nUsing this in a shell/test like a (Model)Form might:\nfrom django.utils.text import slugify\npage = Page(title=\"Hello \u0130stanbul\")\npage.slug = slugify(page.title, allow_unicode=True)\npage.full_clean()\nfull_clean() then raises\ndjango.core.exceptions.ValidationError: {'slug': Enter a valid 'slug' consisting of Unicode letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens.?}\nWhy is that?\nslugify does the following internally:\nre.sub(r'[^\\w\\s-]', '', value).strip().lower()\nThing is, Python's .lower() of the \u0130 in \u0130stanbul looks like this:\n>>> [unicodedata.name(character) for character in '\u0130'.lower()]\n['LATIN SMALL LETTER I', 'COMBINING DOT ABOVE']\nSo, while slugify() finishes, the result is then passed into SlugField which uses the slug_unicode_re (^[-\\w]+\\Z). However, the Combining Dot Above is not a valid \\w:\n>>> [(character, unicodedata.name(character), slug_unicode_re.match(character)) for character in '\u0130'.lower()]\n[\n ('i', 'LATIN SMALL LETTER I', <re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='i'>),\n # EUREKA!!\n ('\u0307', 'COMBINING DOT ABOVE', None)\n]\nSo that's why the ValidationError is raised.\nProposed Solution\nThe culprit seems to be the order in which lower() is called in slugify. The assumption that the lowercase version of a re.sub-ed string is still a valid slug_unicode_re, does not seem to hold true.\nHence, instead of doing this in slugify()\nre.sub(r'[^\\w\\s-]', '', value).strip().lower()\nIt might be better to do it like this\nre.sub(r'[^\\w\\s-]', '', value.lower()).strip()\nIs Python the actual culprit?\nYeah it might be. Matt (@gasmanic) urged me to also take a look if Python might be doing this wrong. \n The \u0130 is the Latin Capital Letter I with Dot Above. It's codepoint is U+0130 According to the chart for the Latin Extended-A set (\u200bhttps://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0100.pdf), it's lowercase version is U+0069.\n U+0069 lives in the C0 Controls and Basic Latin set (\u200bhttps://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf). Lo and behold: it is the Latin small letter I. So a latin lowercase i.\nDoes this really mean that Python is doing something weird here by adding the Combining dot above? Honestly, I can't imagine that and I am probably missing an important thing here because my view is too naive.\n---\nI hope this shorter explanation makes sense. If it does not, please try to read through the detailed analysis in the repo (\u200bhttps://github.com/originell/django-wagtail-turkish-i/blob/master/README.md). If that also does not make a ton of sense, let me know.\nIn any case, thank you for taking the time to read this bug report. Looking forward to feedback and thoughts. I am happy to oblige in any capacity necessary.\n"
