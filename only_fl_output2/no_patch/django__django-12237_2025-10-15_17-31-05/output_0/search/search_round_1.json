        "content": "<issue>slugify() doesn't return a valid slug for \"\u0130\".\nDescription\nWhile working on an international project, we discovered that the turkish/azerbaijani letter \u0130 can not be properly processed when SlugField and slugify are run with allow_unicode=True.\nThe project itself runs with Django 2.2.6 and Wagtail 2.6.2. I first talked about this in the Wagtail Support Channel and while researching further, discovered that this is a Django/Python related issue. This was tested on Python 3.6 and on Python 3.7.\n(quick shoutout to Matt Wescott @gasmanic of Wagtail Fame for being a sparing partner in this)\nThere is a rather detailed analysis (README) in a git repo I created \u200bhttps://github.com/originell/django-wagtail-turkish-i - it was also the basis for my initial call for help in wagtail's support channel. Meanwhile I have extended it with a Django-only project, as to be a 100% sure this has nothing to do with Wagtail.\nI was not able to find anything similar in trac. While I encourage whoever is reading this to actually read the README in the git repo, I want to honor your time and will try to provide a more concise version of the bug here.\nExplanation\nmodels.py\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.utils.text import slugify\nclass Page(models.Model):\ntitle = models.CharField(max_length=255)\nslug = models.SlugField(allow_unicode=True)\ndef __str__(self):\nreturn self.title\nUsing this in a shell/test like a (Model)Form might:\nfrom django.utils.text import slugify\npage = Page(title=\"Hello \u0130stanbul\")\npage.slug = slugify(page.title, allow_unicode=True)\npage.full_clean()\nfull_clean() then raises\ndjango.core.exceptions.ValidationError: {'slug': Enter a valid 'slug' consisting of Unicode letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens.?}\nWhy is that?\nslugify does the following internally:\nre.sub(r'[^\\w\\s-]', '', value).strip().lower()\nThing is, Python's .lower() of the \u0130 in \u0130stanbul looks like this:\n>>> [unicodedata.name(character) for character in '\u0130'.lower()]\n['LATIN SMALL LETTER I', 'COMBINING DOT ABOVE']\nSo, while slugify() finishes, the result is then passed into SlugField which uses the slug_unicode_re (^[-\\w]+\\Z). However, the Combining Dot Above is not a valid \\w:\n>>> [(character, unicodedata.name(character), slug_unicode_re.match(character)) for character in '\u0130'.lower()]\n[\n('i', 'LATIN SMALL LETTER I', <re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='i'>),\n# EUREKA!!\n('\u0307', 'COMBINING DOT ABOVE', None)\n]\nSo that's why the ValidationError is raised.\nProposed Solution\nThe culprit seems to be the order in which lower() is called in slugify. The assumption that the lowercase version of a re.sub-ed string is still a valid slug_unicode_re, does not seem to hold true.\nHence, instead of doing this in slugify()\nre.sub(r'[^\\w\\s-]', '', value).strip().lower()\nIt might be better to do it like this\nre.sub(r'[^\\w\\s-]', '', value.lower()).strip()\nIs Python the actual culprit?\nYeah it might be. Matt (@gasmanic) urged me to also take a look if Python might be doing this wrong.\nThe \u0130 is the Latin Capital Letter I with Dot Above. It's codepoint is U+0130 According to the chart for the Latin Extended-A set (\u200bhttps://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0100.pdf), it's lowercase version is U+0069.\nU+0069 lives in the C0 Controls and Basic Latin set (\u200bhttps://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf). Lo and behold: it is the Latin small letter I. So a latin lowercase i.\nDoes this really mean that Python is doing something weird here by adding the Combining dot above? Honestly, I can't imagine that and I am probably missing an important thing here because my view is too naive.\n---\nI hope this shorter explanation makes sense. If it does not, please try to read through the detailed analysis in the repo (\u200bhttps://github.com/originell/django-wagtail-turkish-i/blob/master/README.md). If that also does not make a ton of sense, let me know.\nIn any case, thank you for taking the time to read this bug report. Looking forward to feedback and thoughts. I am happy to oblige in any capacity necessary.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, let\u2019s break down the results and consider their implications for the bug and potential fixes.\n\n**1. Search for the `slugify` Import Statement**\n\nThe search for \"from django.utils.text import slugify\" yielded no results within our codebase. This indicates that there might not be a direct customization or explicit usage of the `slugify` method within the project files that diverges from Django's implementation. However, it's also possible that the `slugify` function is utilized implicitly through Django models or forms without a direct import statement in the user\u2019s files.\n\n**2. Django\u2019s `slugify` Method**\n\nThe search for the `slugify` method returned two significant results from Django\u2019s codebase:\n\n- **`django/template/defaultfilters.py`**: This appears to be a reference or a simpler case where `slugify` is used as a template filter. This version directly calls `_slugify`, suggesting an internal or simplified handling likely relying on another implementation for its operation.\n\n- **`django/utils/text.py`**: This reveals the more complex and relevant implementation of `slugify`, particularly because it supports the `allow_unicode` parameter. The provided code snippet outlines the method's logic of normalizing the string, optionally converting it to ASCII (depending on the `allow_unicode` flag), removing non-alphanumeric/underscore/hyphen characters, converting to lowercase, and finally stripping leading/trailing whitespace and converting spaces or repeated hyphens to single hyphens. This description closely matches the bug's context, where the issue lies in converting a Unicode character, `\u0130`, to lowercase, leading to unexpected results (`i` with a combining dot above) that fail to validate against expected slug characters.\n\n**3. Relationship Between `slugify` and the Bug**\n\nThe issue lies in how the `slugify` function processes Unicode characters when `allow_unicode=True`. Specifically, the process of lowercasing and subsequent character replacement does not account for the Turkish character `\u0130`, resulting in a slug that contains disallowed characters. This directly relates to the bug since the function's intended behavior is to produce a valid slug from any input, which it fails to do for certain Unicode characters like `\u0130`.\n\n**4. Page Model**\n\nThe search for a `Page` class returned a class from `django/core/paginator.py`, which is unrelated to the issue described. The user was referring to a custom `Page` model within their project, which likely extends `django.db.models.Model` and includes a `SlugField`. The fact that this class was not found suggests we either searched with insufficient context or the model resides in a file or module not covered by the search API's scope. The absence of a custom `Page` model in our search results limits our analysis but doesn't impede addressing the `slugify` issue directly.\n\n**Conclusion and Next Steps**\n\nThe core of the issue lies within Django's `slugify` method when handling Unicode characters with the `allow_unicode=True` flag. The problem arises during the lowercasing and normalization steps where specific Unicode characters (e.g., `\u0130`) undergo transformations that are not congruent with slug validation rules. Based on the issue description and our analysis, a potential solution involves adjusting the sequence of operations in `slugify` or implementing a custom handling for characters that are known to cause issues.\n\nGiven this insight, the next logical steps would be to:\n- Propose adjustments to the `slugify` method in `django/utils/text.py`, specifically regarding how it handles Unicode characters during lowercasing.\n- Or, introduce a custom `slugify` wrapper within the project that correctly handles the problematic Unicode characters before calling Django\u2019s `slugify`.\n\nFurther investigation or a proposed patch would focus on the method in `django/utils/text.py` to ensure it handles Unicode characters like `\u0130` in a manner that produces valid slugs."

To resolve the issue with the Turkish letter \"\u0130\" and potentially other similar Unicode characters:\n    - The method should be adjusted to handle the lowercase conversion in a way that conserves the slug's validity. Specifically, before applying the `lower()` function, it might be necessary to apply a custom mapping or treatment for characters that are known to behave unexpectedly in lowercase conversions (e.g., \"\u0130\" to \"i\" without a combining dot above).\n    - This could involve pre-processing certain Unicode characters separately before the general `lower()` call or applying an additional normalization step post-lowering to ensure any added diacritics do not affect the validity of the slug.\n    - The goal is to ensure that the lowercase version of a string stripped of non-alphanumeric/non-slug characters remains a valid slug, thus properly supporting international characters as intended by the `allow_unicode=True` parameter, without introducing breaking changes to the existing functionality for other types of input.\n\nThis intended behavior ensures the method retains its original purpose while accommodating the necessary logic to handle specific Unicode characters that current processing does not correctly slugify."
