        "intended_behavior": "The slugify method should ensure to produce a valid ASCII or Unicode slug, which can include letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores, from any given input string when allow_unicode=True. To resolve the issue with the Turkish letter \"\u0130\" and potentially other similar Unicode characters: The method should be adjusted to handle the lowercase conversion in a way that conserves the slug's validity. Specifically, before applying the lower() function, it might be necessary to apply a custom mapping or treatment for characters that are known to behave unexpectedly in lowercase conversions (e.g., \"\u0130\" to \"i\" without a combining dot above). This could involve pre-processing certain Unicode characters separately before the general lower() call or applying an additional normalization step post-lowering to ensure any added diacritics do not affect the validity of the slug. The goal is to ensure that the lowercase version of a string stripped of non-alphanumeric/non-slug characters remains a valid slug, thus properly supporting international characters as intended by the allow_unicode=True parameter, without introducing breaking changes to the existing functionality for other types of input."
