Below is an updated `reproducer.py` script aimed at raising an `AssertionError` when the issue described is present and printing a clear stack trace of the issue. This version follows the description closely and includes the correct conditions to assert the failure based on the discussed behavior.

```python
# reproducer.py
import django
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
from django.db import models
from django.conf import settings
from django.utils.text import slugify
import re

# Setup Django without a full project
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=[
        __name__,  # this script is considered an app
    ],
    SECRET_KEY='fake-key',
)

django.setup()

# Define a simple Page model with a SlugField that allows unicode
class Page(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    slug = models.SlugField(allow_unicode=True)

    class Meta:
        app_label = __name__


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def test_slugify_with_ist_letter_i():
    try:
        # Attempt to create a slug with the title containing "İ"
        page = Page(title="Hello İstanbul")
        page.slug = slugify(page.title, allow_unicode=True)
        page.full_clean()

        # Check if the generated slug is incorrect due to the 'İ' letter issue
        assert 'i̇' in page.slug or 'i' in page.slug, f"Slug generation failed, got {page.slug}"

        # If we reach here without an exception, it means the issue is fixed
        print("The issue seems to be fixed.")
        exit(0)

    except ValidationError as e:
        # This path should be reached if the slug generated is invalid according to Django's standards
        if 'slug' in e.message_dict:
            # If the ValidationError is specifically for the 'slug' field, we reproduce the issue successfully
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)  # Indicate an error specific to the issue we're testing for
        else:
            raise AssertionError("ValidationError raised, but not for 'slug' field")
    except AssertionError as e:
        # This path should be reached if the assertion for slug correction fails
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit indicating the error was as expected for reproducibility purposes
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch all for any other unexpected exceptions
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit indicating an unexpected error occurred

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_slugify_with_ist_letter_i()
```

This script asserts whether the issue with slugifying the letter "İ" into a valid slug persists by checking the correctness of the resultant slug against expected behavior. If the issue is present, it is expected to either produce an incorrect slug or raise a `ValidationError`, upon which the stack trace will be printed clearly.
