        "intended_behavior": "The method `fetch_all_posts` in the `PostManager` class should properly manage the construction of a queryset that includes annotations, especially when using `Count` in combination with `Exists` for subqueries. Ensure that any subquery is specifically designed to return only the necessary column(s) required for the count operation, avoiding the inclusion of unnecessary data. Properly integrate with Django's ORM layer to leverage `Exists` in a way that neither disrupts the aggregation nor violates SQL constraints regarding expected results of a sub-select. Refactor `annotate` calls and ensure compatibility with both SQLite and PostgreSQL by adhering to stricter SQL standards relating to subqueries."
