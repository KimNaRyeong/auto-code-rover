This issue just arose on a project I've been working on, and it goes as follows:\nOur MANAGERS setting was set like so:\nMANAGERS = ['one@example.com', 'two@example.com']\nAnd after calling mail_managers, the result was:\nsmtplib.SMTPRecipientsRefused: {'=?utf-8?q?h?=': (550, b'5.1.1 <=?utf-8?q?h?=>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table'), '=?utf-8?q?u?=': (550, b'5.1.1 <=?utf-8?q?u?=>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table')}\nAfter some investigation it became clear that this setting was in the improper format, but that was only because of \u200bthis StackOverflow post. It would be nice if Django failed early if this setting was detected but improperly set, rather than waiting until the consequences become apparent.\nThank you,\nKevin\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insights into how Django handles sending emails to admins and managers as well as how it manages the `ADMINS` and `MANAGERS` settings. Here's a breakdown based on the search results:\n\n### `mail_admins` and `mail_managers` Functions\n\nBoth functions are located in `django/core/mail/__init__.py` and have a similar structure. They are designed to send emails to the admin or manager teams as defined in the Django project settings. The core steps include checking if the respective setting (`ADMINS` for `mail_admins`, `MANAGERS` for `mail_managers`) is defined, constructing an email message with the provided subject and body, and then sending the email. Notably, both functions use a list comprehension to extract email addresses from the respective settings (`[a[1] for a in settings.ADMINS]` and `[a[1] for a in settings.MANAGERS]`), assuming a specific format\u2014a list of tuples where each tuple consists of a name and an email address.\n\n### Relationship with the Bug\n\nThe bug as reported involved an `smtplib.SMTPRecipientsRefused` error when `MANAGERS` was set to a simple list of email strings rather than a list of tuples. This indicates that the culprit lies in the assumption made by `mail_managers` (and similarly `mail_admins`) about the format of the `MANAGERS` (and `ADMINS`) setting. The functions as they currently stand do not validate the format of these settings before attempting to send an email, leading to runtime errors if the settings do not match the expected format.\n\n### Intended Behavior and Fixes\n\nGiven the issue, the intended behavior would be for Django to validate the `ADMINS` and `MANAGERS` settings upon use (or possibly upon startup) to ensure they match the expected format\u2014a list of tuples where each tuple contains a name and an email address. If the settings do not meet this expectation, Django should raise a clear exception to inform the developer of the misconfiguration, ideally before any attempt is made to send an email. This would achieve an \"early failure\" that notifies developers of configuration errors without waiting for the failure to manifest in an email sending attempt.\n\nTo address the issue, a patch could introduce a format validation step in both the `mail_admins` and `mail_managers` functions or at a higher level where the settings are loaded or accessed. This validation should check that `ADMINS` and `MANAGERS` are lists of tuples and that each tuple has the expected structure and content (a name and a valid email address). If the validation fails, Django should raise a clear and instructive exception.\n\nIn terms of further action, it might be helpful to examine `django/conf/global_settings.py` to see the default configurations and the expected formats for these settings. Also, analyzing any existing documentation or comments within the `django/core/mail/__init__.py` file or looking for any utility functions that might already exist for validating email settings could provide a foundation for the necessary patch. However, the immediate next step seems to be drafting the pseudo-code or actual Python code for validating the `MANAGERS` and `ADMINS` settings format before proceeding with sending emails in the `mail_admins` and `mail_managers` functions."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Bug locations:\n   - Location 1: File: django/core/mail/__init__.py, Method: mail_admins\n     - Intended Behavior: Before attempting to send an email, validate that `settings.ADMINS` is properly formatted as a list of tuples, with each tuple containing two strings (a name and an email address). If the format is incorrect, raise an appropriate exception detailing the expected format. This validation should preserve the functionality of sending an email to all admins listed in the `ADMINS` setting but ensure that the configuration error is caught early.\n\n   - Location 2: File: django/core/mail/__init__.py, Method: mail_managers\n     - Intended Behavior: Similarly to `mail_admins`, implement a format validation for `settings.MANAGERS` to ensure it is a list of tuples with the correct structure. If the setting does not meet the expected format, raise a clear exception explaining the misconfiguration. This change aims to maintain the function's ability to send emails to all managers while introducing an early check for configuration errors.\n\nThese locations are pivotal in addressing the reported issue by enforcing validation on the `ADMINS` and `MANAGERS` settings before emails are sent out. By ensuring that these configurations are in the correct format upfront, Django can provide meaningful feedback to developers, preventing runtime errors and aligning with the principle of failing fast for configuration issues."
