The issue specifically involves handling situations where the format of email addresses in settings is incorrect, leading to runtime errors instead of validation errors upon configuration. Here are the API calls that would provide us with relevant context:\n\n1. To understand how `mail_admins()` and `mail_managers()` functions operate and where they might be verifying settings:\n   - `search_method(\"mail_admins\")`\n   - `search_method(\"mail_managers\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions an improper setting format for `MANAGERS`, we need to look into how Django processes or reads these settings, particularly looking for a function or class that validates or utilizes these settings:\n   - `search_code(\"MANAGERS\")`\n   - `search_code(\"ADMINS\")`\n\nThese calls will likely give us insight into which parts of Django's codebase are involved in mailing functions and how the settings are read or validated, which is crucial for resolving the issue of adding appropriate format validations."
