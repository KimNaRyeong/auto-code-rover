This validation should preserve the functionality of sending an email to all admins listed in the `ADMINS` setting but ensure that the configuration error is caught early."

If the setting does not meet the expected format, raise a clear exception explaining the misconfiguration. This change aims to maintain the function's ability to send emails to all managers while introducing an early check for configuration errors."
