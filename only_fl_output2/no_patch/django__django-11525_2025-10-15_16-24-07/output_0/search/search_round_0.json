This issue just arose on a project I've been working on, and it goes as follows:\nOur MANAGERS setting was set like so:\nMANAGERS = ['one@example.com', 'two@example.com']\nAnd after calling mail_managers, the result was:\nsmtplib.SMTPRecipientsRefused: {'=?utf-8?q?h?=': (550, b'5.1.1 <=?utf-8?q?h?=>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table'), '=?utf-8?q?u?=': (550, b'5.1.1 <=?utf-8?q?u?=>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table')}\nAfter some investigation it became clear that this setting was in the improper format, but that was only because of \u200bthis StackOverflow post. It would be nice if Django failed early if this setting was detected but improperly set, rather than waiting until the consequences become apparent.\nThank you,\nKevin\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the issue description, we need to gather information on how Django handles the `mail_admins()` and `mail_managers()` functions, along with how the `MANAGERS` and `ADMINS` settings are validated or used within Django's codebase. The issue specifically involves handling situations where the format of email addresses in settings is incorrect, leading to runtime errors instead of validation errors upon configuration. Here are the API calls that would provide us with relevant context:\n\n1. To understand how `mail_admins()` and `mail_managers()` functions operate and where they might be verifying settings:\n   - `search_method(\"mail_admins\")`\n   - `search_method(\"mail_managers\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions an improper setting format for `MANAGERS`, we need to look into how Django processes or reads these settings, particularly looking for a function or class that validates or utilizes these settings:\n   - `search_code(\"MANAGERS\")`\n   - `search_code(\"ADMINS\")`\n\nThese calls will likely give us insight into which parts of Django's codebase are involved in mailing functions and how the settings are read or validated, which is crucial for resolving the issue of adding appropriate format validations."
