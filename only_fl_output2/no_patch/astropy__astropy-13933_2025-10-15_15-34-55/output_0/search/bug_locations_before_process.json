        "intended_behavior": "The method `to_string` in the `Angle` class needs to correctly handle and convert angles in 'hourangle' units into a string format, even after an `Angle` instance has been unpickled. This implies ensuring that the `to_string` method or the underlying mechanism that maintains the unit information (e.g., 'hourangle') preserves this information accurately during the pickling and unpickling process. The intended behavior should make `to_string` robust against serialization and deserialization, seamlessly converting `Angle` instances to the desired string representation without errors. Additionally, if necessary, a review or update of the pickling/unpickling mechanisms may be required to ensure that unit meta-information is not lost or incorrectly handled during these processes."
