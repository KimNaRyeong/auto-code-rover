This implies ensuring that the `to_string` method or the underlying mechanism that maintains the unit information (e.g., 'hourangle') preserves this information accurately during the pickling and unpickling process. The intended behavior should make `to_string` robust against serialization and deserialization, seamlessly converting `Angle` instances to the desired string representation without errors. Additionally, if necessary, a review or update of the pickling/unpickling mechanisms may be required to ensure that unit meta-information is not lost or incorrectly handled during these processes.\n\nGiven the specificity of the issue to the pickling/unpickling process and its impact on the `to_string` method's functionality, the resolution should focus on either correcting how the `Angle`'s state is restored post-unpickling or adapting the `to_string` method to effectively deal with the state as it is restored. The solution must ensure that existing functionalities for `Angle` instances, both unpickled and regularly instantiated, remain unaffected outside of the correction for this bug."
