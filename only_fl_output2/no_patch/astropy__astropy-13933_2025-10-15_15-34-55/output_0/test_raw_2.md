Here's a revised version of the standalone Python file `reproducer.py` that will attempt to reproduce the issue and incorporate the correct way to print the stack trace. This script is intended to raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present by comparing the output of `to_string` method before and after pickling an `Angle` object. If the issue is fixed, it will exit with code 0.

```python
# reproducer.py
import traceback
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Test the issue with Angle to_string method post-pickling
    try:
        from astropy.coordinates import Angle
        import astropy.units as u
        import pickle

        ang = Angle(0.25 * u.hourangle)
        pang = pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(ang))

        original_str = ang.to_string()
        unpickled_str = pang.to_string()

        # The assertion fails if the condition is True
        assert original_str == unpickled_str, "Mismatch in Angle.to_string outputs"
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Non-zero exit code indicates an error or issue present
    else:
        print("Issue not reproduced, Angle.to_string works as expected after pickling.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit code 0 indicates success/no issue

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script checks if pickling and unpickling of an `Angle` object affects its `to_string()` method's ability to correctly display its value. In the case of reproduction failure (i.e., if an error is caught or the assertion fails), it prints the stack trace of the exception using the provided `print_stacktrace` function and exits with code 1 to indicate an issue. If no issue is detected, it will exit with code 0.
