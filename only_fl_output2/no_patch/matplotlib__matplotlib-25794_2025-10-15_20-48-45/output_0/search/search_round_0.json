The plural forms are documented in the function signature, but the singular forms actually take precedence if both are specified.\nThis adds some complexity for downstream libraries and confusion for their users (cf. https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues/2384).\n### Proposed Solution\nSmall change: Matplotlib could raise when both the singular and plural forms are specified.\nLarger change: I will confess that I don't know why the plural forms of the kwargs exist. If there's not a strong reason for the duplication, perhaps they could be deprecated, or at least \"formally discouraged\"?\n### Additional context and prior art\nScatter does a lot of argument checking on the `c`/`color` parameters (too much at times, \ud83d\ude09), so there's some local precedence for a lot of handholding. On the other hand, matplotlib generally doesn't raise when both long- and short-forms of kwargs are given `e.g. `edgecolor` and `ec`).\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, the following API calls seem appropriate:\n\n1. To find where `plt.scatter` is defined or referenced, the function name itself suggests it's a pyplot method, so finding the scatter method could give insights: `search_method(\"scatter\")`.\n\n2. Since the issue mentions argument precedence and checking, inspecting the actual implementation of the `scatter` method will help understand how arguments are processed: `search_method_in_class(\"scatter\", \"Axes\")`. Predicting from matplotlib's structure, scatter plots would most likely belong to an `Axes` class.\n\n3. To see how the `edgecolor`, `edgecolors`, `linewidth`, and `linewidths` parameters are handled specifically, we need to look for their references within the relevant matplotlib file or function. Since we don't know the exact file yet, broad searches will help:\n   - `search_code(\"edgecolor\")`\n   - `search_code(\"edgecolors\")`\n   - `search_code(\"linewidth\")`\n   - `search_code(\"linewidths\")`\n\n4. Additionally, since the issue discussion mentions potential confusion with singular and plural forms of parameters, it might be useful to see if there's any existing functionality or pattern in the library that deals with similar situations: `search_code(\"singular and plural forms\")`.\n\n5. Finally, to understand the context around how argument checks (especially for color parameters) are currently handled in `scatter`, we could search for the handling of `color` and `c` as per the issue's context: `search_code_in_method(\"color\", \"scatter\")`, `search_code_in_method(\"c\", \"scatter\")`. However, without knowing the precise file or class structure where `scatter` is defined, these calls might be too broad or impractical without prior specific search results.\n\nLet's start with the first two more focused calls to refine our search strategy based on what we find:\n\n- `search_method(\"scatter\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"scatter\", \"Axes\")`"
