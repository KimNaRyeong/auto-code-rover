For instance, consider:\nclass State(models.Model):\npass\nclass County(models.Model):\nname = CharField(max_length=50)\nstate = ForeignKey(State, related_name='counties')\nI can execute the following query just fine:\nCounty.objects.filter(\nExists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")),\nname=\"Dallas\",\n)\nBut a similar query using When does not work:\n>>> County.objects.annotate(\nstatus=Case(\nWhen(Exists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")), name=\"Dallas\", then=Value(\"DALLAS COUNTY\")),\ndefault=Value(\"ELSEWHERE\"),\n))\nTypeError: When() supports a Q object, a boolean expression, or lookups as a condition.\nInstead the arguments must be wrapped in a Q object:\n>>> County.objects.annotate(\nstatus=Case(\nWhen(Q(Exists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")), name=\"Dallas\"), then=Value(\"DALLAS COUNTY\")),\ndefault=Value(\"ELSEWHERE\"),\n))\nThis is inconvenient and inconsistent with how filter works, as shown.\nWhen's init method can be modified to allow similar input as filter. \u200bCode is in a branch in my repo, but as this is my first time contributing to Django, I want to make sure I open a ticket and get feedback first.\nAlso I wasn't sure how to classify this. I wasn't sure if it was a bug, as I wasn't sure if it was designed this way.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue, let's gather the necessary code context based on the description provided. Here are the steps and API calls that we need to make:\n\n1. Since the issue is related to the `When` clause potentially being unable to accept an `Exists` expression alongside keyword arguments directly, it's essential to understand how `When` is implemented. Thus, we should look into the `When` class definition.\n2. The issue description also hints at a comparison with the `filter` method, which can accept an `Exists` expression directly without wrapping it in a Q object. It might be useful to understand how `filter` handles its arguments, particularly `Exists` expressions.\n3. The problem description involves the use of models `State` and `County`. Although the issue doesn't seem to directly stem from the models themselves, having their definitions at hand might provide useful context for how they're intended to interact with the database layer, especially with regards to the `ForeignKey` and `CharField`.\n4. Lastly, the mention of wrapping the arguments in a `Q` object to work around the issue hints at a potential inconsistency in how conditional expressions are parsed or evaluated within the `When` and `filter` methods. It might be worthwhile to examine the `Q` class or how it interacts with these methods.\n\nWe will start by looking into the `When` class definition and the `filter` method to understand their implementations. Additionally, we will check the implementation of the `Exists` and `Q` classes to see if there's a specific handling or interaction that could be causing the issue.\n\nHere are the API calls we will make:\n\n- `search_class(\"When\")`: To get the class definition of `When`.\n- `search_method(\"filter\")`: To find out how `filter` is implemented and how it handles its arguments.\n- `search_class(\"Exists\")`: To understand how the `Exists` expression is defined.\n- `search_class(\"Q\")`: To get the class definition of `Q` and see how it's supposed to wrap conditions.\n\nThese calls should provide us with sufficient context to start addressing the issue."
