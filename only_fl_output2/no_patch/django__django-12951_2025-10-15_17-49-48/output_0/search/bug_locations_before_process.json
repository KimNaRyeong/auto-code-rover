        "intended_behavior": "The initialization method (__init__) of the `When` class should provide enhanced support for directly using expressions such as `Exists` alongside keyword arguments without the explicit need for wrapping them in a `Q` object for simplicity and alignment with how similar structures are handled in the `filter` method. This behavior preserves the existing functionality of allowing `Q` objects and boolean expressions as conditions but extends the implementation to more intuitively support `Exists` expressions (and potentially others) by internally ensuring compatibility with the expected condition format. This would also align with Django's ORM's general design philosophy of providing a powerful, yet user-friendly abstraction over SQL. The change should ensure that all current use cases of `When`, including those involving simple lookups, `Q` objects, and boolean conditions, continue to work unaffected. The enhancement should only improve the method's ability to interpret and process conditions directly, particularly focusing on `Exists` and similar expressions that currently require additional steps for compatibility, ensuring a seamless developer experience without breaking backward compatibility."
