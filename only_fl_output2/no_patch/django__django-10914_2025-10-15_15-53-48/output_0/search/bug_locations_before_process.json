If `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is not `None`, it should use `os.chmod` to set the file's permissions to the value defined by `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`. This ensures that regardless of the initial permissions set on the temporary file, the final file will have consistent and expected permission settings."

This change establishes a secure and sensible default permission set for newly uploaded files, addressing the inconsistency issue raised. By altering this setting, any file upload handled by `FileSystemStorage` will have permissions set to `0o644` by default unless explicitly overridden by the developer in the project's settings."
