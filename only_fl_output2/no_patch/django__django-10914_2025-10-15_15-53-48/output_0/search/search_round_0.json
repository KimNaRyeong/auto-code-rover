In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather context around the handling of file uploads, specifically related to the `FileSystemStorage` class and any methods involved in processing file uploads which could affect file permissions. Moreover, understanding how `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is managed or set by default in the Django project would also be crucial. \n\nGiven the information from the issue, we can speculate that modifications or inspections need to be done on classes and methods that handle file storage and temporary files, possibly within the `FileSystemStorage` class or relevant Django settings for file upload.\n\nTherefore, we should make the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `FileSystemStorage` class to understand its implementation and how it handles file permissions.\n2. Search for any usage of `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` or `os.rename` to see how temporary files are managed and how this might affect permissions.\n3. Look into the Django setting `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to see where and how it is defined or used, which might not be directly available by just a class or method name but could be referenced in relevant code sections handling uploaded file permissions.\n\nWe can break this down into specific API calls as follows:\n\n- `search_class(\"FileSystemStorage\")`: This will help us to find the implementation of the `FileSystemStorage` class.\n- `search_code(\"tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile\")`: Since this could be part of the process affecting file permissions, we need to find where it is used.\n- `search_code(\"os.rename\")`: Looking for this will provide context on how files are finally saved and if permissions are being altered during this process.\n- `search_code(\"FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\")`: This is to find out how `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is used or set within the Django framework, specifically if there's a default value set somewhere in the codebase or its usage context.\n\nThese API calls will help us gather enough context around how Django handles file uploads, specifically the permissions, and how `FileSystemStorage` works in association with temporary files, leading us toward resolving the issue described."
