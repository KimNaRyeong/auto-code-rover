However, when the colorbar is extended using extend='both', the black lines at the extremities do not show up.\n### Code for reproduction\n```python\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.colors import from_levels_and_colors\nmy_cmap = mpl.cm.viridis\nbounds = np.arange(10)\nnb_colors = len(bounds) + 1\ncolors = my_cmap(np.linspace(100, 255, nb_colors).astype(int))\nmy_cmap, my_norm = from_levels_and_colors(bounds, colors, extend='both')\nplt.figure(figsize=(5, 1))\nax = plt.subplot(111)\ncbar = mpl.colorbar.ColorbarBase(ax, cmap=my_cmap, norm=my_norm, orientation='horizontal', drawedges=True)\nplt.subplots_adjust(left=0.05, bottom=0.4, right=0.95, top=0.9)\nplt.show()\n```\n### Actual outcome\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34058459/164254401-7516988d-1efb-4887-a631-de9a68357685.png)\n### Expected outcome\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34058459/164254881-92c167b7-aa13-4972-9955-48221b38b866.png)\n### Additional information\n_No response_\n### Operating system\n_No response_\n### Matplotlib Version\n3.5.1\n### Matplotlib Backend\n_No response_\n### Python version\n_No response_\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\n_No response_\n</issue>"

We should start by examining the `ColorbarBase` class, and specifically look into methods that are likely involved in drawing edges or are invoked in response to the `extend` and `drawedges` parameters.\n\nTherefore, I will need to perform the following searches:\n- Search for the `ColorbarBase` class to understand its structure and find potential methods related to edge drawing or the `extend` parameter.\n- Search for methods within the `ColorbarBase` class that could be responsible for drawing the edges or handling the `extend` parameter.\n\nGiven these requirements, here are the API calls that would help gather the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ColorbarBase\")` - To locate the `ColorbarBase` class within the Matplotlib codebase.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"drawedges\", \"ColorbarBase\")` - To find any method that might be specifically responsible for drawing the edges in the colorbar.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"extend\", \"ColorbarBase\")` - Although \"extend\" might not be a method, this is to check if there are any particular implementations within `ColorbarBase` related to handling the `extend` parameter. It is acknowledged that \"extend\" may instead be handled by attribute checks or in a method that deals with rendering or initialization rather than a method named directly after the parameter."

        "content": "Given the initial unsuccessful attempts to locate the `ColorbarBase` class directly, there could be several reasons why the search did not yield results. It's possible that the class name was misspelled, the class is defined in a specific module that wasn't directly searched, or the information provided to the search API wasn't sufficient or accurate. To navigate around these issues and gain the necessary context, a different approach is required.\n\nTo progress, I can take a broader perspective by searching for occurrences of the `ColorbarBase` instantiation or related functionality within the codebase. Instances where the `ColorbarBase` object is being created or methods relevant to the colorbar's rendering process might be found in broader searches. Also, investigating how the `extend` parameter is used in conjunction with colorbars across the codebase can yield useful insights. Moreover, looking into the drawing of edges in general might help understand if there\u2019s a separate utility or function responsible for this that isn't directly tied to the `ColorbarBase` class name.\n\nConsidering these points, the next steps involve:\n1. Broadening the search to find code snippets or method calls involving `ColorbarBase`.\n2. Searching for methods or functionality related to `drawedges` and `extend` parameters without restricting the search to a specific class initially.\n3. Exploring any higher-level drawing or rendering methods that could interact with the colorbar's visuals.\n\nAccordingly, here are the revised API calls:\n- `search_code(\"ColorbarBase\")` to locate any instantiation or reference to `ColorbarBase` across the codebase.\n- `search_code(\"drawedges\")` and `search_code(\"extend='both'\")` to find how these parameters are generally handled within colorbar-related code or methods."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Since the actual source code and relevant API call results were not provided directly, I cannot specify the exact bug locations within the codebase, including file paths, class names, or method names. However, based on the issue description, the intended behavior and general locations can be hypothesized as follows:\n\n**Hypothetical Bug Location 1:**\n- **File:** Likely within a file that handles the rendering of `ColorbarBase` or similar functionalities in Matplotlib.\n- **Class:** `ColorbarBase` or a class that manages the colorbar rendering.\n- **Method:** A method responsible for drawing the edges of the colorbar segments, possibly something akin to `draw_edges` or an initialization method that applies the `drawedges` property.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\nThe method that handles the drawing of edges within the colorbar should ensure that when `extend='both'` is specified, the outermost edges at the extended parts are also drawn. This likely involves adjusting the logic that calculates which edges to draw, ensuring it takes the extended areas into account. The existing functionality for `drawedges` within the central part of the colorbar must remain unaffected.\n\n**General Recommendation for Resolution:**\n- Verify the logic within the method(s) that control edge drawing in the colorbar. This involves ensuring that the code correctly interprets the `extend='both'` parameter to include drawing edges at the start and end of the colorbar if extended.\n- Check if conditional checks or loops determining the edges to draw are inadvertently excluding the extended parts' boundaries.\n- Ensure that the resolution does not impact the appearance or functionality of colorbars without `extend='both'` or where `drawedges=False`.\n\nWithout direct access to the code or specific findings from the search, these recommendations are based on an understanding of the reported issue. Adjusting the approach to resolve the specific case within the Matplotlib codebase would require knowing the exact implementation details, which might be accomplished with more targeted or successful search API calls."
