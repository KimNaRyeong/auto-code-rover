We can replace this duplication with wider community developed version.\nhtml.escape() has been available since Python 3.2:\n\u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#html.escape\nThis function is also faster than Django's. As Python bug \u200bhttps://bugs.python.org/issue18020 concludes, using .replace() can be faster than .translate(). This function gets called numerous times when rendering templates. After making the change locally, I saw the following improvement:\nmaster:\n$ python -m timeit -s 'from django.utils.html import escape' 'escape(copyright)'\n50000 loops, best of 5: 4.03 usec per loop\nbranch:\n$ python -m timeit -s 'from django.utils.html import escape' 'escape(copyright)'\n100000 loops, best of 5: 2.45 usec per loop\nOne small concern, html.escape() converts ' to &#x27 rather than &#39. These values are functionally equivalent HTML, but I'll mention it as a backwards incompatible change as the literal text has changed\n</issue>"

This method is designed to encode ampersands, quotes, and angle brackets for safe use in HTML.

It uses the `.translate()` method, which utilizes a dictionary (`_html_escapes`) to map each character that needs to be escaped to its HTML-encoded counterpart.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue is concerned with this specific implementation. Although not technically a \"bug,\" the issue suggests optimizing the method by leveraging the Python standard library's `html.escape()` function for increased efficiency and to reduce code duplication.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior after addressing the issue would be to achieve the same outcome\u2014encoding text for safe HTML use, but doing so through the `html.escape()` function rather than manually through `.translate()` and a custom dictionary. This would simplify the implementation and potentially increase performance, as mentioned in the issue due to `html.escape()` being optimized over time by the larger Python community.\n\nGiven the above context and aiming to draft a patch, a logical next step would be to:\n- Replace the current body of the `escape()` function with a direct call to `html.escape()`, ensuring compatibility with its expected behavior and managing the slight difference in escaping apostrophes (`'`) as noted in the issue.\n- It's also important to review any direct references or dependencies on the `_html_escapes` dictionary to ensure that removing or modifying the existing `escape` implementation does not introduce regressions elsewhere in the Django framework.\n\nDespite the direct search for `\"django.utils.html.escape\"` not returning results, the identified function in `django/utils/html.py` provides a clear pathway for proposing a solution to the issue. Further action would involve looking into the Python `html.escape()` function's implementation details (specifically regarding its handling of special characters) and ensuring that any such change does not adversely affect Django's HTML escaping security guarantees."

The change should ensure that the function continues to encode ampersands, quotes, and angle brackets for safe use in HTML, while improving performance and reducing code duplication. The modification should consider and handle the minor behavior difference regarding how apostrophes (`'`) are escaped (`&#x27;` by `html.escape()` versus `&#39;` in the current implementation), ensuring that this change does not negatively impact Django's security guarantees or functionality. \n\n    The new implementation might look like this, considering the explicit import of the `html` module from the Python standard library at the top of the file:\n\n    ```python\n    from html import escape as html_escape\n\n    def escape(text):\n        \"\"\"\n        Return the given text with ampersands, quotes and angle brackets encoded\n        for use in HTML, utilizing Python's html.escape() for improved efficiency.\n        \n        Note: The behavior regarding the escaping apostrophes is slightly different\n        (html.escape() uses '&#x27;' while Django used '&#39;'), but these are\n        functionally equivalent in HTML.\n        \"\"\"\n        return mark_safe(html_escape(str(text), quote=True))\n    ```\n\n    This change presumes that `mark_safe` is compatible with the output of `html.escape()` and does not interfere with Django's safe string marking mechanism, which is a critical component in preventing XSS vulnerabilities."
