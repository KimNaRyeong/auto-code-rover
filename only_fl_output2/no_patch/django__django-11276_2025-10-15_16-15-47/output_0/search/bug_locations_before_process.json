        "intended_behavior": "The `escape` function should be modified to utilize the Python standard library's `html.escape()` instead of using its current implementation that relies on `.translate()` and the `_html_escapes` dictionary. The change should ensure that the function continues to encode ampersands, quotes, and angle brackets for safe use in HTML, while improving performance and reducing code duplication. The modification should consider and handle the minor behavior difference regarding how apostrophes (`'`) are escaped (`&#x27;` by `html.escape()` versus `&#39;` in the current implementation), ensuring that this change does not negatively impact Django's security guarantees or functionality. The new implementation might look like this, considering the explicit import of the `html` module from the Python standard library at the top of the file."
