We can replace this duplication with wider community developed version.\nhtml.escape() has been available since Python 3.2:\n\u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#html.escape\nThis function is also faster than Django's. As Python bug \u200bhttps://bugs.python.org/issue18020 concludes, using .replace() can be faster than .translate(). This function gets called numerous times when rendering templates. After making the change locally, I saw the following improvement:\nmaster:\n$ python -m timeit -s 'from django.utils.html import escape' 'escape(copyright)'\n50000 loops, best of 5: 4.03 usec per loop\nbranch:\n$ python -m timeit -s 'from django.utils.html import escape' 'escape(copyright)'\n100000 loops, best of 5: 2.45 usec per loop\nOne small concern, html.escape() converts ' to &#x27 rather than &#39. These values are functionally equivalent HTML, but I'll mention it as a backwards incompatible change as the literal text has changed\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue described, I need to find the implementation of `django.utils.html.escape()` to see how it can be modified to use `html.escape()` from the Python standard library. Given this requirement, the search should focus on locating the specific file and method where `django.utils.html.escape()` is defined. \n\nHere are the API calls that would be most helpful for this task:\n\n1. `search_method(\"escape\")` - This will help in finding all the occurrences of the method named \"escape\" across the entire codebase. Given the popularity of the method name \"escape\", this search might return a lot of results not related to html escaping. However, it's a good starting point to identify potential files to look into.\n\n2. `search_code(\"django.utils.html.escape\")` - This call will specifically search for any references to `django.utils.html.escape` in the codebase, which might lead directly to usage cases and the definition itself.\n\nThese two searches together should provide enough context to understand where and how `django.utils.html.escape()` is implemented and used throughout the Django project, allowing for an informed update to the function to use `html.escape()` from the Python standard library."
