        "intended_behavior": "The `mean_squared_error` function needs to be modified to accept an additional boolean parameter `squared` (defaulting to `True` to maintain backward compatibility). If `squared=True`, the function will return the mean squared error as it currently does. If `squared=False`, the function should return the square root of the mean squared error, effectively calculating the root mean squared error (RMSE). This change would allow users to directly compute RMSE through this function without manually taking the square root of its output."

        "intended_behavior": "A new scorer `neg_root_mean_squared_error` should be added to this file. This scorer calculates the RMSE between the true and the predicted values, multiplies the result by -1 (to keep in line with the convention where higher score values indicate better models in scikit-learn's scoring system), and then returns it. This scorer will facilitate the direct use of RMSE as a metric in model evaluation contexts that require scorers, such as grid searches or cross-validation, aligning with the request for a direct RMSE implementation within scikit-learn's framework."
