To address the issue and the need for a comprehensible approach to reproduce the problem with Sphinx, specifically with managing files with the same name but different extensions, the following `reproducer.py` script is designed. This script constructs a minimal Sphinx project environment, executes a Sphinx build, and assesses the output to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior. It adheres to the guidelines for printing a stack trace for clarity on failure points.

```python
import os
import shutil
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_test_environment():
    # Define paths
    project_dir = 'test_project'
    src_dir = os.path.join(project_dir, 'source')
    build_dir = os.path.join(project_dir, 'build')
    doctree_dir = os.path.join(build_dir, 'doctrees')
    output_dir = os.path.join(build_dir, 'html')

    # Cleanup if the test environment already exists
    if os.path.isdir(project_dir):
        shutil.rmtree(project_dir)

    # Create directories
    os.makedirs(src_dir)

    # Create conf.py
    conf_content = """
extensions = ['myst_parser']
"""
    with open(os.path.join(src_dir, 'conf.py'), 'w') as conf_file:
        conf_file.write(conf_content)

            stderr=subprocess.STDOUT
        )
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print("Sphinx build failed with the following output:")
        print(e.output.decode())
        sys.exit(1)

def verify_output():
    try:
        with open('test_project/build/html/a.html', 'r') as a_html:
            contents = a_html.read()
            # We expect to find the content of a.md, not a.rst
            assert "# Markdown A" in contents, "Content from a.md not found in a.html"
            assert "RST A" not in contents, "Content from a.rst unexpectedly found in a.html"
            print("Test passed: a.md correctly included in the documentation.")
    except AssertionError as e:

        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:

```

This script sets up a temporary Sphinx project with both an `a.md` and an `a.rst` file, configuring Sphinx to include `a.md` in the documentation. It then triggers a Sphinx build and verifies whether `a.md`'s content is correctly processed and included in the resulting HTML documentation. The script raises an `AssertionError` and prints a stack trace if the test confirms the issue (Sphinx incorrectly processing the `a.rst` file in place of `a.md`), fulfilling the original issue description and expected behavior criteria.
