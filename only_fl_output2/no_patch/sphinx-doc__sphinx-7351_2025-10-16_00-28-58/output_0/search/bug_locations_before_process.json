Introducing a new configuration option like `file_extension_precedence` would enable users to define an ordered list of extensions that Sphinx should use to resolve conflicts. This list would be checked whenever Sphinx encounters files with the same base name, ensuring the user-preferred extension is selected. Existing functionality for projects not using this configuration should remain unchanged, preserving backward compatibility."

When building the documentation structure, if Sphinx detects multiple files with the same base name (but different extensions) referenced within a toctree, it should use the order specified in `file_extension_precedence` to resolve which file to include. If no preference is specified, Sphinx should either follow a default order or explicitly log a warning indicating the ambiguity and the chosen file, advising the user to specify their preference to avoid unexpected behavior."
