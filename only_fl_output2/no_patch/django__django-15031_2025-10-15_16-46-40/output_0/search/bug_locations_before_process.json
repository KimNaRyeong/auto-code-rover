        "intended_behavior": "The method prepare_lookup_value, as it currently stands, splits the value string on commas for keys ending in __in. This behavior needs to be enhanced to allow values to include commas. A possible solution could involve a custom escape character for commas within values or a different serialization method for list-like GET parameters that can safely encode and decode such values. The intended enhancement should ensure that when a value intended to be a single entity contains a comma, it is not incorrectly split into multiple values. This change should preserve all existing functionalities for keys not ending in __in and for __in keys where the values do not contain commas. This may require introducing additional parsing logic to detect and correctly handle escaped commas or adopting a different delimiter for separating items in the list that is less likely to appear in actual data."
