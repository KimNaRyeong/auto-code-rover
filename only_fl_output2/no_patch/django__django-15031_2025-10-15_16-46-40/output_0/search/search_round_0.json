Notably, it allows you to filter the records by multiple values (if the field's value is one of the specified value options, then such record is considered matching).\nFor example, you can test it with a query string like this:\n/admin/auth/user/?username__in=johnny,viola,gordon\nUnfortunately, there is a big limitation at the moment: you can't include a value option that contains a comma (or a few).\nThe function that splits the string is prepare_lookup_value, found in \u200bcontrib.admin.util.\n</issue>"

Search for the `prepare_lookup_value` method in the entire codebase, as it is directly related to the issue mentioned. This call will help us identify the file or class where this method is defined.\n   - `search_method(\"prepare_lookup_value\")`\n\n2. Given that the issue is related to the Django admin and specifically mentions the `contrib.admin.util`, it would be valuable to search for relevant classes within this module. However, without the exact class name, searching for the method within this context is our primary approach. Still, knowing that `contrib.admin.util` was mentioned, it might be worthwhile to look into specific util classes or methods related to filtering or admin modifications.\n   \n3. Since the issue describes a problem with the handling of comma-separated values in query strings, it could also be useful to search for any code snippets that handle URL query strings or filters in the admin section.\n   - `search_code(\"request.GET\")`\n   - `search_code(\"queryset.filter\")`\n\nThese calls aim to find the relevant sections of the codebase that handle filtering in the Django admin, focus specifically on the function that needs to be patched, and explore how query parameters are parsed and utilized in filtering operations within the Django admin framework."
