        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `get_itrs` method to accept an optional `location` argument that allows for the computation of topocentric ITRS positions relative to the provided `location`. This `location` could be another `EarthLocation` instance. When a `location` is provided, calculate the difference between the coordinates of the `EarthLocation` instance the method is called on and the `location` provided. This difference should be used to return a topocentric ITRS frame. If no `location` is provided, the method should continue to operate as it currently does, returning the geocentric position of the `EarthLocation` instance in the ITRS frame. This enhancement will require adjustments to the method's logic to incorporate the calculation of the differential position when a `location` is provided and to ensure that the existing functionality remains unaffected when no `location` is specified."
