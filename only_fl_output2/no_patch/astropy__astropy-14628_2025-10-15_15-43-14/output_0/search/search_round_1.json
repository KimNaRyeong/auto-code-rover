        "content": "<issue>Make getting a topocentric ITRS position easier\n### What is the problem this feature will solve?\nRight now, it is not easy to create ITRS coordinates for sources relative to a given location (rather than geocentric), to the level that we have specific instructions on how to calculate relative `CartesianCoordinates` and then put these into an `ITRS`: https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/coordinates/common_errors.html#altaz-calculations-for-earth-based-objects\nThis has led to numerous issues, the latest of which is #12678\n### Describe the desired outcome\nIt would be nice if as part of `EarthLocation.get_itrs()` it would be possible to get a topocentric rather than a geocentric position. In #12678, @tomfelker and @mkbrewer [suggested](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/12678#issuecomment-1463366166) (and below) to extend `.get_itrs()` to take not just an `obstime` but also a `location` argument, with an implementation along [the following lines](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/12678#issuecomment-1464065862):\n> the idea would be to simply add a `location` argument to `get_itrs()` that defaults to `None`. Then if a location is provided, `get_itrs()` would return a topocentric ITRS frame containing the difference between the object's position and that of the `location` argument. One could also use `EARTH_CENTER` as the default and always return the difference.\n### Additional context\nSee #12768. Labeling this a good first issue since it is easy code wise. However, writing the tests and documentation will require understanding of how ITRS and the associated coordinate transformations work.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the collected context from the API search results, here's an analysis focusing on the three questions posed:\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `EarthLocation` class in `astropy/coordinates/earth.py` represents a specific location on or above/below the Earth's surface in various coordinate systems. It can be initialized using geocentric (x, y, z) coordinates, geodetic (longitude, latitude, height) coordinates, by specifying a site name from a registry, or by specifying an address. This class provides methods to convert between geocentric and geodetic coordinate systems, to access gravitational redshift calculations, and to represent the location in different coordinate frames, including the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) through its `get_itrs()` method.\n\nThe `get_itrs()` method converts the `EarthLocation` instance to an `ITRS` object, which represents coordinates in the International Terrestrial Reference System. The `obstime` (observation time) parameter determines the time at which the ITRS coordinates are valid. If `obstime` is not specified, a default time is used.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue is not technically a bug but a feature request aimed at improving the user experience with the Astropy library. The current `get_itrs()` method allows creating an `ITRS` object for the EarthLocation instance it is called on but does not directly support generating a topocentric position (relative to a user-specified location). The feature request suggests enhancing `get_itrs()` by adding an optional `location` parameter. This enhancement will facilitate computing the ITRS position of an object relative to a specified location on Earth more straightforwardly, primarily addressing ease of use concerning topocentric versus geocentric positions.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior, post-feature implementation, would be an extension of the `get_itrs()` method to:\n\n- Accept an additional `location` parameter that could be another `EarthLocation` instance or similar, representing the point relative to which the topocentric ITRS position should be calculated.\n- If a `location` is specified, `get_itrs()` should compute the difference between the EarthLocation instance it's called on and the specified `location`, returning a topocentric ITRS frame.\n- If no `location` is provided, the method will behave as it currently does, returning a geocentric ITRS position based on the EarthLocation instance itself.\n\nThis enhancement would streamline tasks where computing relative positions is required, making it more accessible and reducing the need for users to manually calculate these differences outside the library."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This `location` could be another `EarthLocation` instance. When a `location` is provided, calculate the difference between the coordinates of the `EarthLocation` instance the method is called on and the `location` provided. This difference should be used to return a topocentric ITRS frame. If no `location` is provided, the method should continue to operate as it currently does, returning the geocentric position of the `EarthLocation` instance in the ITRS frame. This enhancement will require adjustments to the method's logic to incorporate the calculation of the differential position when a `location` is provided and to ensure that the existing functionality remains unaffected when no `location` is specified."
