        "intended_behavior": "The `fit` method should be updated to flexibly validate the `X` input based on the capabilities of the base estimator. Instead of strictly requiring `X` to be a numeric array or sparse matrix, the method should validate `X` in a way that also allows it to accept other data types (e.g., lists of text blobs), provided the base estimator can handle such data types. This will likely involve conditionally calling a modified or different validation function that checks the type of base estimator and its data handling capabilities before applying specific validation rules on `X`."

        "method": "fit",
        "intended_behavior": "Similar to `AdaBoostClassifier`, the `fit` method in `AdaBoostRegressor` needs to be modified to allow for more flexibility in the type of `X` input it accepts. This modification means adjusting or bypassing certain validation steps that impose the current constraints on `X`. The method should ensure that the provided `X` is suitable for the base estimator being used, which may involve checking the base estimator's documentation or capabilities regarding accepted input types and adapting the input validation process accordingly."
