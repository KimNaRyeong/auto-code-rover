However, since the data is not processed directly by `AdaBoost*` but by its base estimator (on which `fit`, `predict_proba` and `predict` may be called), we should not need to constrain the data that much, allowing for `X` to be a list of text blobs or similar.\nSimilar may apply to other ensemble methods.\nDerived from #7767.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, let's break it down and determine the necessary code context:\n\n1. **AdaBoost modification to allow `X` to be a list of text blobs or similar**: We need to locate where the AdaBoost class validates `X`, particularly its methods that might be involved in early validation like `fit`, `predict_proba`, and `predict`.\n\n2. **Check if similar changes need to be applied to other ensemble methods**: This entails identifying other ensemble classes and their respective validation mechanisms for `X`.\n\nGiven these requirements, let's formulate the API calls:\n\n- We need to find the AdaBoost class, so we start with that:\n  - `search_class(\"AdaBoostClassifier\")`\n  - Since `AdaBoostRegressor` might also be affected, search for this class too: `search_class(\"AdaBoostRegressor\")`\n\n- After identifying the files containing these classes, we would need to examine the validation mechanism, commonly in the `fit` method. Depending on the file(s) we find the classes in:\n  - `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"AdaBoostClassifier\")`\n  - `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"AdaBoostRegressor\")`\n\n- Considering ensemble methods might share a common ancestor or utility functions for validation, let's also look for methods like `check_X_y` or similar utilities that are called within `fit`:\n  - `search_method(\"check_X_y\")`\n\nThese calls should provide us with sufficient context to understand how `X` is currently validated and how we might modify this behavior to allow more flexible input types, including lists of text blobs."
