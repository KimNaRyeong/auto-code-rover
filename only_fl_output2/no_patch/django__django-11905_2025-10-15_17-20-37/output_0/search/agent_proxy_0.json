Typically, this would involve query construction or query transformation logic in an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework or database-related code. Given that `__isnull` is a specific query keyword, it's likely part of a method that constructs or modifies queries based on field lookups.\n\nFirst, let's locate the core methods or classes that handle `__isnull` lookups. We do not have the exact class or method names, but we can make educated guesses based on common ORM structure patterns and naming conventions:\n\n1. `search_method(\"__isnull\")` - This will help us find methods that directly mention `__isnull`, which could be responsible for handling these lookup types.\n2. `search_code(\"lookup_type='__isnull'\")` - This code snippet might be used in the logic that handles different types of lookups, including `__isnull`. It's another way to find parts of the code where `__isnull` is specially treated.\n\nThese searches should give us a better understanding of where `__isnull` is processed and lead us to the relevant sections of the code for further analysis."
