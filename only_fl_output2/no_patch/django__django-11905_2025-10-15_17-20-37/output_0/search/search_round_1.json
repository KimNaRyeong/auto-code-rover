Typically, this would involve query construction or query transformation logic in an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework or database-related code. Given that `__isnull` is a specific query keyword, it's likely part of a method that constructs or modifies queries based on field lookups.\n\nFirst, let's locate the core methods or classes that handle `__isnull` lookups. We do not have the exact class or method names, but we can make educated guesses based on common ORM structure patterns and naming conventions:\n\n1. `search_method(\"__isnull\")` - This will help us find methods that directly mention `__isnull`, which could be responsible for handling these lookup types.\n2. `search_code(\"lookup_type='__isnull'\")` - This code snippet might be used in the logic that handles different types of lookups, including `__isnull`. It's another way to find parts of the code where `__isnull` is specially treated.\n\nThese searches should give us a better understanding of where `__isnull` is processed and lead us to the relevant sections of the code for further analysis."

Given this, we need to explore related areas:\n\n1. **Search for classes related to query construction or manipulation**: Lookups like `__isnull` are likely part of a system that constructs database queries from object-oriented code. Classes with names like `QuerySet`, `Query`, `Field`, or `Lookup` could be involved.\n\n2. **Search for methods that handle or register lookups**: There might be methods responsible for registering or handling various lookup types, including `__isnull`.\n\nLet's try these new search strategies:\n\n- `search_class(\"QuerySet\")`: Since `QuerySet` is a common class name in ORMs for handling sets of queries, any references or modifiers related to `__isnull` could be part of its implementation.\n- `search_class(\"Lookup\")`: If there's a generic lookup class or a class dedicated to handling field lookups, it might contain the logic or registration of the `__isnull` handler.\n- `search_method(\"register_lookup\")`: A method like this could be responsible for registering various lookup types, including `__isnull`. Understanding how lookups are registered might lead us to where they are validated and processed.\n\nThese searches aim to get us closer to the mechanisms that process `__isnull` lookups. After finding these mechanisms, we can better understand how to ensure that using non-boolean values with `__isnull` raises an error, addressing the issue described."
