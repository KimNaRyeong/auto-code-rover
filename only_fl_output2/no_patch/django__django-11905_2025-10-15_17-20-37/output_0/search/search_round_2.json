Typically, this would involve query construction or query transformation logic in an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework or database-related code.

We do not have the exact class or method names, but we can make educated guesses based on common ORM structure patterns and naming conventions:\n\n1. `search_method(\"__isnull\")` - This will help us find methods that directly mention `__isnull`, which could be responsible for handling these lookup types.\n2. `search_code(\"lookup_type='__isnull'\")` - This code snippet might be used in the logic that handles different types of lookups, including `__isnull`.

Classes with names like `QuerySet`, `Query`, `Field`, or `Lookup` could be involved.\n\n2. **Search for methods that handle or register lookups**: There might be methods responsible for registering or handling various lookup types, including `__isnull`.\n\nLet's try these new search strategies:\n\n- `search_class(\"QuerySet\")`: Since `QuerySet` is a common class name in ORMs for handling sets of queries, any references or modifiers related to `__isnull` could be part of its implementation.\n- `search_class(\"Lookup\")`: If there's a generic lookup class or a class dedicated to handling field lookups, it might contain the logic or registration of the `__isnull` handler.\n- `search_method(\"register_lookup\")`: A method like this could be responsible for registering various lookup types, including `__isnull`.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context reveals two potential areas involved in handling the `__isnull` lookup logic: the `QuerySet` class, which is a central part of Django's ORM for constructing and manipulating database queries, and the `Lookup` class, likely involved in the implementation of specific field lookups, including `__isnull`. The `register_lookup` method is used to register such lookups, further implicating these components in the issue at hand.\n\n1. **QuerySet class in `django/db/models/query.py`**:\n   - This class is a cornerstone of Django's ORM, enabling the construction, chaining, and execution of database queries using Python code. It does not directly handle `__isnull` logic based on the snippets provided but is crucial for executing queries constructed with various lookups.\n   - Since the issue revolves around preventing the `__isnull` lookup from being used with non-boolean values, the specific handling of this lookup might not be within `QuerySet` itself but rather in how lookups are processed and applied to construct queries.\n\n2. **Lookup class in `django/db/models/lookups.py`**:\n   - The `Lookup` class likely represents the base class for all lookup types, including `__isnull`. It defines how a lookup is processed, particularly how the right-hand side (rhs) of a lookup is processed and applied in a SQL statement.\n   - The relationship to the bug is direct: if the `__isnull` lookup is a subclass of `Lookup`, the validation of boolean-only values for `__isnull` should ideally occur here, preventing the use of non-boolean values at the fundamental level.\n   - The intended behavior would involve enforcing a validation step within either the `__init__` method (to check upon instantiation) or within `get_prep_lookup` or `process_rhs` methods to ensure `rhs` is strictly boolean when the `lookup_name` is `__isnull`. This is where the logic to raise an error for non-boolean values would be most effective and consistent.\n\n3. **register_lookup method in `django/db/models/query_utils.py`**:\n   - This method adds lookup classes to a registry, allowing them to be recognized and used within the ORM. It does not itself process lookup logic but enables the dynamic addition of lookup types.\n   - Though not directly related to processing `__isnull` lookups, understanding this mechanism is crucial for identifying how `__isnull` becomes available for use. It might be necessary to ensure that lookups, especially `__isnull`, are correctly registered with any required validation rules.\n\n**Summary of Necessary Changes**:\n- **Location 1**: File: `django/db/models/lookups.py`, Class: `Lookup`, Method(s): potentially `__init__`, `get_prep_lookup`, or `process_rhs`.\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Incorporate validation logic to ensure `rhs` is strictly boolean for `__isnull` lookups. This could involve raising a ValueError or TypeError if `rhs` is not a boolean value when `lookup_name == '__isnull'`.\n  \nImplementing these changes would directly address the issue by preventing the misuse of the `__isnull` lookup with non-boolean values and thereby preserving the integrity and consistency of query construction within Django's ORM."

This validation should raise an exception (e.g., `ValueError`) if the `rhs` is not a boolean for lookups where `lookup_name == '__isnull'`. This ensures that developers are notified of incorrect usage at the earliest opportunity, enhancing the robustness of the query construction process. The existing functionality for boolean values remains unaffected, preserving the ORM's interface and behavior for legitimate `__isnull` usage.\n\nThis approach directly addresses the issue by adding a safeguard against the misuse of the `__isnull` lookup with non-boolean values, ensuring the framework's behavior remains predictable and consistent with its documentation and intended use cases."
