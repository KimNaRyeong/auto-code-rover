Make sure to add `django` to your project dependencies and configure it appropriately before running this script. The script tries to invoke a Django command with a list argument in the way described in the issue. If the issue is present, it should raise an `AssertionError` or `CommandError`, printing the stack trace. If the issue is fixed, the command will run without errors, and the script will exit with code 0, printing "The issue has been fixed."
