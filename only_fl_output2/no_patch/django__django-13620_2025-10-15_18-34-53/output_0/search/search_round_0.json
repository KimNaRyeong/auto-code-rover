        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue regarding support for list arguments inside exclusive required groups in a Django command, the first step is to understand how arguments are added to commands and how `call_command` interprets these arguments. The issue explicitly mentions classes and methods from Django, so we will focus our search around these areas:\n\n1. **BaseCommand**: Since the issue arises in a class (`Command`) derived from `BaseCommand`, and involves the `add_arguments` method.\n2. **add_arguments**: This method is where arguments are added to the parser, including the creation of mutually exclusive groups.\n3. **call_command**: The issue occurs when calling `call_command` with list arguments, so we'll need to understand how it processes arguments internally.\n\nLet's structure our API search calls accordingly:\n\n- **search for `BaseCommand` class**: This will help understand the class structure and any relevant method definitions or comments about argument handling.\n- **search for `add_arguments` method in `BaseCommand`**: Since `add_arguments` is being overridden in the user's code, it's important to see its definition in `BaseCommand` or notes on how to properly override it.\n- **search for `call_command` method**: To address the specific problem with `call_command`, we need to see its implementation details, especially how it handles list parameters for options.\n\nAPI calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"BaseCommand\")`\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"add_arguments\", \"BaseCommand\")`\n3. `search_method(\"call_command\")`"
