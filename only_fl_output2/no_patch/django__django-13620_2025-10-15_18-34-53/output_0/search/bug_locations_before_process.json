        "intended_behavior": "The `call_command` function should be updated to correctly parse and handle list arguments for options specified with `nargs='+'`, especially when such arguments are part of mutually exclusive required groups. This involves ensuring that:\n- When a list is passed directly to `call_command` (e.g., `foo=[1, 2, 3]`), it should recognize and correctly format these arguments for the underlying command as if they were passed via the command line (e.g., translating to `--foo 1 --foo 2 --foo 3` internally).\n- The parsing logic (lines 115-172) needs to be adjusted to support converting passed list arguments into a format compatible with how argparse expects multiple values for a single option, without generating the `invalid int value` error. This might involve adjusting the `parse_args` reconstruction (around lines 142-150) and ensuring that the defaults merging (line 152) accounts for list arguments appropriately.\n- This modification should preserve the existing functionality, allowing other argument types (e.g., single values, constants) to behave as currently without introducing regressions."
