Given the feedback and the need for a Django environment for the test, a direct approach using Django's `call_command` function in a standalone script without a proper Django environment setup will lead to issues, like the improperly configured error seen earlier. To accurately reproduce the reported issue within a correctly configured Django setting, it's necessary to ensure Django is set up with minimal settings required for running commands. Let's adjust the approach by including minimal Django settings configuration within the script.

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import sys

# Setup minimal Django environment
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'reproducer_settings')
settings_config = """
from django.conf import settings
settings.configure(
    DEBUG=True,
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=(
        '__main__',  # This script acts as a standalone app
    ),
    # As of Django 3.2, the default primary key type is 'BigAutoField'
    # This setting ensures compatibility for Django 3.2 and later
    DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD='django.db.models.AutoField',
)
"""

# Create a temporary Django settings module
with open("reproducer_settings.py", "w") as fp:
    fp.write(settings_config)

from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand, CommandError
from django.core.management import call_command
from django.core import management
import django

django.setup()

class Command(BaseCommand):
    def add_arguments(self, parser):
        group = parser.add_mutually_exclusive_group(required=True)
        group.add_argument('--foo', nargs='+', type=int)

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        assert options['foo'] == [1, 2, 3], "The command did not receive the expected list for --foo"

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Dynamically adding the Command to the management commands
management.get_commands()  # Refresh command cache
management._commands['call_command_test'] = Command

try:
    call_command('call_command_test', '--foo=1', '--foo=2', '--foo=3')
    print("The issue has been fixed.")
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
```

This adjusted script includes a basic Django configuration setup within itself, aims to create an isolated Django environment on the fly, and defines a management command directly within it to reproduce the behavior mentioned concerning argument parsing and mutual exclusivity with `nargs='+'`.

Please run this script in an environment where Django is installed. This script assumes you have Django installed and are operating in a virtual environment or a Docker container where you have control over the installed packages.

This approach should better encapsulate the issue within a minimal but complete execution context, ensuring the Django framework's required components are initialized correctly before attempting to reproduce the issue.
