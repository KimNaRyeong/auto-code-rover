Given the constraints outlined, below is a corrected version of a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py`. This script is designed to faithfully reproduce the outlined issue involving Django command line argument processing specifically related to the use of list arguments within mutually exclusive groups. It simulates the problem scenario and checks if the error mentioned manifests. Then, it attempts to handle the error gracefully by outputting a stack trace if the issue occurs.

```python
# reproducer.py
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand
from django.core.management import call_command, CommandError

def setup_django_environment():
    settings.configure(
        DEBUG=True,
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': 'db.sqlite3',
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=(
            '__main__',  # This script acts as a standalone app
        ),
        SECRET_KEY='a-very-secret-key-for-testing',
    )

    django.setup()

class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = 'Test command for reproducing list argument issue in exclusive required groups.'

    def add_arguments(self, parser):
        group = parser.add_mutually_exclusive_group(required=True)
        group.add_argument('--foo', nargs='+', type=int)

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        assert options.get('foo') == [1, 2, 3], "The command did not receive the expected list for --foo"

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    setup_django_environment()

    # Creating a temporary management command to be executed
    try:
        call_command(Command(), foo=[1, 2, 3])
        print("The test executed successfully. The issue seems to be fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        sys.exit(0)  # Exiting normally even if assertion fails, indicating the test found the issue.
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
```

**How to Use:**

1. **Preparation**: Ensure you have Django installed in your environment (`pip install django`).
2. **Place the Script**: Save this script as `reproducer.py` at the root of your project or any working directory.
3. **Execute**: Run the script using your environment's Python interpreter: `python3 reproducer.py`.

This script:
- Configures a minimal Django environment.
- Defines a custom command that demonstrates the issue with list arguments in mutually exclusive groups.
- Attempts to call the command in a way that would trigger the error.
- Catches and prints the stack trace if an unexpected error occurs, or exits with code 0 if the specific assertion failure is catched (indicating the presence of the reported issue).
