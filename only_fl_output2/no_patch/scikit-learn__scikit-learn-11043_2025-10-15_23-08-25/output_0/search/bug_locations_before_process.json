        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `__init__` method's handling of the `validate` parameter needs to be updated. Currently, `validate` is a boolean that defaults to `True`, leading to automatic conversion of input DataFrames to NumPy arrays. To accommodate the desired functionality while preserving backward compatibility, introduce a new default behavior for `validate`, such as `validate='array-or-frame'`. This new default would require implementation logic where DataFrames are passed through without conversion, and other input types are checked and potentially converted to 2D arrays. Additionally, a deprecation warning should be added to inform users of the change when the function operates under the old default to guide them towards specifying their intended behavior explicitly."

        "intended_behavior": "The `transform` method, directly or indirectly via another method it calls (like `_transform`), currently might not distinguish between DataFrames and other input types when handling the `validate` parameter. The method should be updated to respect the new `array-or-frame` behavior outlined for the `validate` parameter. When `validate='array-or-frame'`, the method should ensure DataFrames are allowed to pass through unchanged, while still applying any necessary validation or conversion to other input types. This update requires careful handling to preserve the existing functionality for users who depend on the automatic conversion to arrays, potentially involving modification or extension of the validation logic to accommodate the new option."
