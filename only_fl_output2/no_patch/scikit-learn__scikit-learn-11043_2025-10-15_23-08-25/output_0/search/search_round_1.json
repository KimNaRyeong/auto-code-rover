As noted in #10648, it can be easy for users to miss that they need to set validate=False to pass through a DataFrame without converting it to a NumPy array. I think it would be more user-friendly to have `validate='array-or-frame'` by default, which would pass through DataFrames to the function, but otherwise convert its input to a 2d array. For strict backwards compatibility, the default should be changed through a deprecation cycle, warning whenever using the default validation means a DataFrame is currently converted to an array.\nDo others agree?\n</issue>"

What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `FunctionTransformer` class is a part of scikit-learn's preprocessing module, designed to apply a user-defined function to input data as part of its preprocessing pipeline. The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `FunctionTransformer` class, setting up various parameters that define its behavior:\n\n- `func`: The function to apply to the input data.\n- `inverse_func`: The reverse transformation function.\n- `validate`: Whether to check the input and convert it to an array or not. It is set to `True` by default.\n- `accept_sparse`: Whether sparse matrices are accepted.\n- `pass_y`: Deprecated parameter, not relevant to the current discussion.\n- `check_inverse`: If the inverse transformation should be checked.\n- `kw_args`: Keyword arguments to be passed to the `func`.\n- `inv_kw_args`: Keyword arguments to be passed to the `inverse_func`.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue centers around the `validate` parameter's default behavior, which is currently set to `True`, causing input Pandas DataFrames to be automatically converted to NumPy arrays before the function application. This behavior can obstruct users who wish to apply a function directly to a DataFrame utilizing its inherent methods and thereby maintain the DataFrame structure through the transformation process.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior, based on the issue description, is to modify the default behavior of the `validate` parameter to better support DataFrames. Instead of defaulting to `True`, which converts all inputs to arrays, a new default setting (potentially named `array-or-frame`) should be introduced. This setting will allow DataFrames to pass through the transformation process untouched, but still convert other input types into 2D arrays for consistency. Such a change accepts the versatility of input types while providing special consideration for DataFrames, which are a common data structure in data science, and often benefit from being operated on directly due to their rich API.\n\nGiven this analysis, additional necessary API calls would be to:\n\n- Search within the `FunctionTransformer` class for how `validate` is used throughout to understand its current operation fully.\n- Find where in the pipeline the conversion between DataFrame and array is explicitly handled, and understand if the logic is directly within this class or abstracted away.\n\nHere are the concrete API calls:\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"transform\", \"FunctionTransformer\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_transform\", \"FunctionTransformer\")`\n\nThese methods are where the actual transformation and potentially the conversion (as hinted by the issue) are most likely to occur. Understanding their implementation will clarify how `validate` influences the conversion process and where the adjustment for the proposed `array-or-frame` behavior would be most effectively implemented."

Currently, `validate` is a boolean that defaults to `True`, leading to automatic conversion of input DataFrames to NumPy arrays. To accommodate the desired functionality while preserving backward compatibility, introduce a new default behavior for `validate`, such as `validate='array-or-frame'`. This new default would require implementation logic where DataFrames are passed through without conversion, and other input types are checked and potentially converted to 2D arrays. Additionally, a deprecation warning should be added to inform users of the change when the function operates under the old default to guide them towards specifying their intended behavior explicitly.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**  \n  **File:** `sklearn/preprocessing/_function_transformer.py`  \n  **Class:** `FunctionTransformer`  \n  **Method:** `transform`  \n  **Intended Behavior:** The `transform` method, directly or indirectly via another method it calls (like `_transform`), currently might not distinguish between DataFrames and other input types when handling the `validate` parameter. The method should be updated to respect the new `array-or-frame` behavior outlined for the `validate` parameter. When `validate='array-or-frame'`, the method should ensure DataFrames are allowed to pass through unchanged, while still applying any necessary validation or conversion to other input types. This update requires careful handling to preserve the existing functionality for users who depend on the automatic conversion to arrays, potentially involving modification or extension of the validation logic to accommodate the new option.\n\nThe intended behavior modifications focus on enhancing user-friendliness and flexibility by acknowledging and supporting the direct use of DataFrames within the `FunctionTransformer` processing while actively maintaining backward compatibility through a guided deprecation cycle and clear communication of the new behavior."
