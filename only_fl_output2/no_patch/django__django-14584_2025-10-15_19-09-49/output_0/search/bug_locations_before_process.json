This could likely be achieved by modifying the log message structure to add `alias` information available within the context or from the database connection itself. This enhancement should preserve the existing logging functionalities such as logging the query and its parameters while including the database alias in the log output for clarity."

        "intended_behavior": "In the `BaseDatabaseWrapper` class, enhance or implement a method that is responsible for emitting log messages related to database operations to include the `alias` information. This method should either directly use the `alias` available upon initialization or provide a mechanism to ensure that any database operation logging emitted from instances of this class (or its subclasses) inclusively reports which database alias the operation pertains to. This method should work harmoniously with the existing logging setup to augment log messages with the database alias without altering the fundamental logging mechanism's behavior."
