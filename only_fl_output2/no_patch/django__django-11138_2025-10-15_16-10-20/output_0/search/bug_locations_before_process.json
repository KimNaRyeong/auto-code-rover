        "intended_behavior": "The method _convert_field_to_tz should be updated to intelligently handle time zone conversions by considering the database's configured TIME_ZONE setting if available. Specifically, this method needs to perform the following actions to resolve the issue: 1. Check Database-specific TIME_ZONE Setting: Before applying the CONVERT_TZ function with 'UTC' as the source timezone, the method should verify if a specific TIME_ZONE is configured for the database in use. This would involve accessing the TIME_ZONE setting from the DATABASES configuration in Django settings if it exists for the current database connection. 2. Adjust Source Timezone for Conversion: If a database-specific TIME_ZONE is configured and differs from the application's timezone, the method should use this timezone as the source in CONVERT_TZ instead of hardcoded 'UTC'. This adjustment ensures that datetime fields are converted correctly between the database's timezone and the application's timezone. 3. Avoid Unnecessary Timezone Conversion: If the database's TIME_ZONE and the application's timezone (settings.TIME_ZONE) are the same or if USE_TZ is False, avoid applying CONVERT_TZ to prevent unnecessary conversions that could lead to incorrect date/time values in queries. This step is crucial for handling databases that store datetimes in non-UTC timezones and where no conversion is actually needed because the application operates in the same timezone."
