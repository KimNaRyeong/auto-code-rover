To create a standalone Python script that captures the essence of trying to replicate the reported issue and adheres to your instructions, one can encapsulate the testing logic within a well-defined structure. Given your precise specifications, here's how the `reproducer.py` script could be crafted to achieve the desired functionality â€” both capturing and responding to the scenario where the issue is present or has been resolved:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_inset_axes_creation():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.inset_locator import inset_axes

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=[5.5, 2.8])

    try:
        axins = inset_axes(ax, width="30%", height="30%", loc='upper right')
        plt.close(fig)  # Properly close the plot to free memory/resources
        return True
    except Exception as e:  # Catching a more general exception
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

def main():
    result = test_inset_axes_creation()
    
    if not result:
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.")
    else:
        print("The issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script has a more generalized exception handling approach, aiming to capture any exception, not only `AttributeError`, that might be raised during the inset creation process. Additionally, it ensures proper resource management by closing the figure after the test, which is a good practice especially when running tests or scripts that generate many figures.

Remember, the script presumes that if any exception is caught during the attempt to create an inset axis using `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.inset_locator.inset_axes`, the encountered issue persists, and accordingly, it will print the stack trace and raise an `AssertionError`. Conversely, if the inset is created without error, the script concludes the issue has been resolved and exits with code 0, indicating success.
