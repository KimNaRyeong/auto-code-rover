        "intended_behavior": "The `inset_axes` function should ensure that the created inset axes or the locator responsible for its placement has a proper reference to the renderer at the time it is being positioned. This involves either making sure that the renderer is available when `get_window_extent` on the `OffsetBox` is called or providing a way to defer the call until the rendering context is established. The fix should preserve the functionality to allow both absolute and relative sizing of the inset axes, relative to the parent axes, without introducing a premature need for rendering context, which may not be available at the initial setup."

        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior of the `get_window_extent` method is to calculate the dimensions of the `OffsetBox` reliably. To resolve the issue, the method should handle cases where the renderer might be `None` more gracefully. A possible solution could involve either a fallback mechanism for calculating an extent without immediate rendering or a clearer error message that indicates a misconfiguration early on. The method must ensure that any calls made with `renderer=None` do not lead to uncaught `AttributeError`s, possibly by checking if the renderer is present and deferring the operation or computing a default extent if the exact dimensions cannot be determined without rendering."
