Certainly! Below is the `reproducer.py` file that you requested. This script will attempt to reproduce the specified issue and will raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is encountered. If the issue is fixed, the script should run without issues and exit with code 0.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.inset_locator import inset_axes

        fig, (ax, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=[5.5, 2.8])
        axins = inset_axes(ax, width=1.3, height=0.9)
        plt.show()

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.") from e

    print("The issue is fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script uses the `print_stacktrace` function to display a stack trace clearly if an exception is caught during execution. When the bug mentioned is present, the script will catch an exception, print the stack trace, and raise an `AssertionError`. On the other hand, if the issue has been resolved (i.e., no exception is raised during the script execution), it will print "The issue is fixed." and exit gracefully.
