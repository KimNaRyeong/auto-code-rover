Given the nature of your request and the desire to accurately simulate the issue to verify its presence or resolution, the script below is designed to intentionally reproduce the problem as described. If the issue persists, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print the related stack trace using your specified function. On the other hand, if the issue is resolved (i.e., the script does not catch an exception), it will exit with code 0, signaling that the problem is no longer present.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_inset_axes_creation():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.inset_locator import inset_axes

    fig, (ax, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=[5.5, 2.8])

    try:
        axins = inset_axes(ax, width=1.3, height=0.9)
        # since the bug is about an execution error during plotting, assert here
        assert axins is not None, "Inset axes not created successfully."
        return True
    except AttributeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

def main():
    if not test_inset_axes_creation():
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.")
    else:
        print("The issue is fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script attempts to reproduce the error reported by trying to create inset axes within a Matplotlib figure. The presence of the `AttributeError` is checked to determine whether the bug still exists. If the exception is raised, the script will catch it, print a detailed stack trace for debugging purposes, and assert that the problem exists. Conversely, if the operation succeeds without any exceptions, the script assumes the issue has been resolved and exits normally with a positive message.
