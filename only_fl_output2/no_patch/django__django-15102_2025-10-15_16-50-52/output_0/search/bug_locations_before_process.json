This implies that instead of copying all permission bits directly, the method should: - Use the system's `umask` to filter out undesired permission bits systematically, ensuring that files are created with permissions that consider both the template's permissions and the current `umask` setting. Essentially, the file creation process should end up more in line with expected Unix/Linux behavior, where `umask` dictates the permission bits that are removed from newly created files."
