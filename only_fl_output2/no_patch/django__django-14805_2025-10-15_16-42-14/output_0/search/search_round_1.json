It would be nice for scripting purposes if there could be some kind of output. When writing a script that helps manage migrations, it would be nice to be able to detect that the migrations needed input from the developer so that the script can fail gracefully and inform the developer that manual intervention is required. Right now the options seem to be to not use the --noinput options and have the prompt interrupt the script, or to use the option and have no idea when migrations failed because they required input.\nI'm not very picky as far as how this functionality should be implemented goes. I would think that a little warning like\n\"No migrations run because input was required but --noinput option was specified.\"\nwould be sufficient. This could be output to stdout or stderr, either all the time or perhaps only if an additional option was set.\n</issue>"

It handles the creation of project states before migrations are applied and runs the necessary database operations. \n   - The relationship between this code and the bug is indirect. While this code is responsible for executing the migrations, the issue is more about the interaction and feedback provided by the `makemigrations` and `migrate` commands when the `--noinput` option is applied.\n   - The intended behavior, given the issue description, would involve modifying either this code or more likely, the command interface code that calls these methods to ensure that output is provided even when `--noinput` is used, specifically regarding when input is required but suppressed.\n\n2. **Code Snippets Containing `--noinput`**:\n   - These snippets are spread across different management commands and show where the `--noinput` flag is utilized within the Django framework. \n   - The direct relationship to the bug is that these locations are likely where the issue's described behavior can be modified. Because `--noinput` is involved, we're particularly interested in how it is handled within the `migrate` and `makemigrations` commands.\n   - The intended behavior, with respect to the issue, would involve ensuring that, in these locations, specifically within `migrate.py` and `makemigrations.py`, there is logic to provide adequate feedback/output even when `--noinput` is set. This is to inform the user/script about the need for input which is being suppressed.\n\nGiven this analysis, we need to examine the actual handling of `--noinput` within `migrate.py` and `makemigrations.py` to figure out how to adjust the commands to implement the requested feature. Specifically, we're looking into how the `--noinput` flag is currently processed and determining where and how to introduce output messages indicating when input would be required but is being skipped due to the `--noinput` flag.\n\nTo advance this investigation, we should make the following specific API calls:\n- `search_code_in_file(\"--noinput\", \"django/core/management/commands/migrate.py\")`: This call will allow us to look closer at how `--noinput` is handled within the `migrate` command.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"--noinput\", \"django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py\")`: Similarly, this will help us understand the handling of `--noinput` within `makemigrations`.\n\nThese calls will provide the immediate context needed to propose changes satisfying the issue's request."

While preserving its existing functionality, the command should be enhanced to check if situations arise that would normally require user input (such as conflicts in migration names or missing migration dependencies) and, in such cases, output a informational message to stdout or stderr. This message could be along the lines of \"Input required, but --noinput option specified; manual intervention may be necessary.\"\n\n- **Location 2**: File: django/core/management/commands/migrate.py\n  - **Intended Behavior**: This command should also be updated to recognize situations where input from the user would normally be required (e.g., unapplied migrations that could lead to data loss). In the context of the `--noinput` flag, it should produce a warning or informational message to the user. The functionality here would likewise be preserved, with the addition of an output warning in situations where the absence of user input (due to `--noinput`) might lead to incomplete or unexecuted migrations. The message here could be similar, indicating that input was needed but not provided, and suggesting manual review.\n\nIn both locations, the goal is to maintain the functionality of the `--noinput` flag (i.e., not prompting the user for input and potentially stalling automated scripts) while providing adequate feedback about the operation's success or necessity for manual intervention. This ensures that automated deployment or management scripts can make informed decisions based on the commands' output, improving the reliability and transparency of database migrations within a Django project."
