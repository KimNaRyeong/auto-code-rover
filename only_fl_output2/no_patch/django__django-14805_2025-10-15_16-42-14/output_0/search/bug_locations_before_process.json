While preserving its existing functionality, the command should be enhanced to check if situations arise that would normally require user input (such as conflicts in migration names or missing migration dependencies) and, in such cases, output a informational message to stdout or stderr. This message could be along the lines of 'Input required, but --noinput option specified; manual intervention may be necessary.'"

In the context of the `--noinput` flag, it should produce a warning or informational message to the user. The functionality here would likewise be preserved, with the addition of an output warning in situations where the absence of user input (due to `--noinput`) might lead to incomplete or unexecuted migrations. The message here could be similar, indicating that input was needed but not provided, and suggesting manual review."
