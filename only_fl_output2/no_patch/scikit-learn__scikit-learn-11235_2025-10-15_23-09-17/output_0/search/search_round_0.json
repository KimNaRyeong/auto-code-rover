Does it make sense to support this case. It will return the identity matrix which is not the use case for the `StandardScaler`. If we wish a transformer to do so, one should use the `FunctionTransformer` I assume.\n2. If we consider this behaviour normal, we need to:\n* In the dense case, force `self.mean_` to be `None` after each iteration of `partial_fit`.\n* In the sparse case, compute the non-NaNs values and update `self.n_samples_seen_` which is not computed. It leads currently to an error if calling twice `fit` (i.e. `del self.n_samples_seen_` will fail).\nIMO, we should make a checking at `fit` raise an error.\n@jnothman @ogrisel WDYT?\n</issue>"
