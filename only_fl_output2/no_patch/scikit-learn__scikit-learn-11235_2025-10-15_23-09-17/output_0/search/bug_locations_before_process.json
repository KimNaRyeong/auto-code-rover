        "intended_behavior": "The `partial_fit` method needs additional logic to handle the case when both `with_mean=False` and `with_std=False`. Specifically, for both sparse and dense matrices, if both flags are `False`, the method should bypass the computation and updating of `mean_`, `var_`, and `n_samples_seen_` entirely, effectively performing no operation. This preserves the identity transformation behavior expected in this scenario without unnecessary computation or state modification. An additional improvement could be implementing an early check to raise a descriptive error (or warning) when both parameters are `False`, suggesting the use of `FunctionTransformer` for intended identity transformations. This guides user expectations and usage more effectively."

        "method": "fit",
        "intended_behavior": "While the primary logic resides in `partial_fit`, ensuring `fit` reflects the same understanding or handling of the `with_mean=False` and `with_std=False` scenario directly might be necessary. Given `fit` calls `partial_fit`, this might merely involve ensuring that any checks or errors raised in `partial_fit` for these parameter combinations are properly communicated to users during the `fit` operation as well. However, considering `fit` largely delegates to `partial_fit`, significant changes here may not be needed if `partial_fit` is properly adjusted. An explicit check could still be added to `fit` for consistency, especially if it performs any preprocessing or checks before delegating to `partial_fit`."
