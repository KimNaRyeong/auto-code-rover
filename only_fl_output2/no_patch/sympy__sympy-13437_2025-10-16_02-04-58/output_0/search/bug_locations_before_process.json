        "intended_behavior": "The `limit` function should be enhanced to properly compute the limit of the Bell numbers as `n` approaches infinity. The current heuristic or algorithm (likely the Gruntz algorithm referenced in the comments) should be examined and potentially updated to ensure that when dealing with Bell numbers or similar sequences, the computation correctly concludes that the limit is infinity (`oo`). This involves recognizing the Bell number sequence in the heuristic or improving the algorithm's handling of such expressions, ensuring that `limit(bell(n), n, oo)` evaluates to `oo`. The enhancement should not interfere with or alter the existing functionality for computing the limits of other expressions, preserving the current behavior for all cases not explicitly being modified."
