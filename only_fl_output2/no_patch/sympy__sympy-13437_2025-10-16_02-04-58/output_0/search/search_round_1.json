The `bell` function couldn't be found using the `search_method` API call, which means it could be implemented under a different name, might not be directly exposed as a method, or could be part of a larger class where `bell` numbers are computed. This suggests we might need to look into classes or modules related to special functions or sequences in SymPy, focusing on where numeric sequences are managed or generated.\n\n2. The inability to find the specific code snippet `limit(n, oo)` indicates that this form of limit computation (with parameters tending towards infinity) is either part of a generic `limit` method handling or is specialized and not directly exposed or searchable using the provided snippet. This implies that the limit functionality for handling infinity is integrated into the general limit computation logic and does not have a simple, easily located interface for this specific case.\n\n3. The `limit` method has been found in several files, which gives us a direction:\n   - `sympy/matrices/matrices.py`: The `limit` methods here are likely related to computing limits of expressions involving matrices. This is probably not directly related to our issue, unless the `bell` function has a matrix-related implementation or usage that affects its limit behavior.\n   - `sympy/series/limits.py`: This is the most likely place where the logic for computing limits, especially those involving special functions like `bell`, would reside. It's a strong candidate for where the issue might be addressed.\n   - `sympy/functions/special/hyper.py`: Given that this file involves special and hypergeometric functions, there may be a connection if the `bell` numbers or their limit computations involve special functions' properties or representations.\n   - `sympy/core/expr.py`: Since this involves core expression functionalities, the `limit` method here is likely to be foundational for limit computations across the library. Any changes or issues in how limits are computed, especially in generic cases like with infinity, could stem from or be addressed here.\n\nGiven this analysis, immediate next steps should involve:\n- Investigating `sympy/series/limits.py` to understand how limits are computed, specifically looking for the logic that might affect `bell` numbers when their limits are taken as `n` approaches infinity.\n- Looking into `sympy/core/expr.py` to understand the generic implementation of the `limit` method, which might give insights into why `bell(oo)` is returned instead of `oo` as expected.\n\nTo proceed, focusing on `sympy/series/limits.py` and `sympy/core/expr.py` seems to be the most relevant course of action to understand and potentially fix the issue."
