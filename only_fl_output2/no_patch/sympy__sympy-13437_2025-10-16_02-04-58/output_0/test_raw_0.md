Here is how you can create the `reproducer.py` file to demonstrate the described issue with the Bell numbers in SymPy. The script checks whether the limit of the Bell number as `n` approaches infinity is evaluated as infinity. When the issue persists, it raises an `AssertionError`, and if fixed, it exits cleanly with code 0. The provided function to print the stack trace has been added to aid in debugging if needed.

```python
from sympy import symbols, bell, oo

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    n = symbols('n')
    try:
        result = bell(n).limit(n, oo)
        # Check if the result is infinity, which is the expected correct behavior
        assert result == oo, f"Expected bell(n).limit(n, oo) to be oo, got {result}"
        print("The issue is fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Save this as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project. Execute it with Python 3 to reproduce the issue. When the issue is present, the script raises an `AssertionError` showing that the expected behavior (evaluation to infinity) does not match the current incorrect behavior (returning unevaluated `bell(oo)`). When the issue is fixed, it will print "The issue is fixed." and exit with code 0.
