Given the specific requirements for writing a standalone `reproducer.py` file that aims to reproduce the issue under the given conditions and exits with the appropriate codes based on whether the issue is present or resolved, the below script is crafted for this purpose. It intends to demonstrate the problem described with `astropy`'s handling of format specifications in HTML output, raising an `AssertionError` if the formatting applied via the `formats` dict does not affect the HTML output as expected.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from astropy.table import Table
    from io import StringIO
    import re

    # Create a table to output.
    t = Table([(1.23875234858e-24, 3.2348748432e-15), (2, 4)], names=('a', 'b'))
    tc = t.copy()  # copy table

    # Attempt to write HTML table with formatting
    with StringIO() as sp:
        tc.write(sp, format="html", formats={"a": "{:.2e}".format})
        html_output = sp.getvalue()

        # Search for expected formatted string in HTML output
        expected_pattern = re.compile(r"1\.24e-24")  # Regex pattern for expected formatted output
        match = expected_pattern.search(html_output)

        # Verify if the formatting was applied correctly
        assert match, "HTML output did not respect formatting"

        print("Test passed: HTML output respects formatting.")

try:
    main()
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)
else:
    exit(0)
```

This script checks specifically for correctly formatted output in the HTML string generated by `astropy.table.Table.write()` method. It raises an `AssertionError` if the formatting specified in the `formats` dictionary is not reflected in the HTML output, which replicates the behavior described in the issue. The `try-except` block is used to catch any exception, print a detailed stack trace using `print_stacktrace()`, and exit with code 1 to indicate failure. If the program executes successfully and the assertion does not fail, it prints a confirmation message and exits with code 0, indicating the absence of the issue.
