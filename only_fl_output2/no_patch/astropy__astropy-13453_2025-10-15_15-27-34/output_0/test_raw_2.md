To create a standalone Python script `reproducer.py` that reproduces the described issue and follows your specific instructions for error handling and outcome reporting, including the provided function to print stack traces, see the modified script below. This script tries to format the output of an Astropy table to HTML using specified formats, raises an `AssertionError` if the format does not apply, and is designed to exit with code 0 if and when the issue is resolved.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from astropy.table import Table
    from io import StringIO

    # Create an Astropy Table
    t = Table([(1.23875234858e-24, 3.2348748432e-15), (2, 4)], names=('a', 'b'))
    
    # Attempt to write table to an HTML string with custom formatting for column 'a'.
    with StringIO() as sp:
        t.write(sp, format='html', formats={'a': '{:.2e}'.format})
        html_output = sp.getvalue()

        # Check if formatting is correct in the HTML string
        if '1.24e-24' not in html_output:
            raise AssertionError("Formatting issue: expected '1.24e-24' in HTML output.")

    print("HTML output formatting issue resolved.")

try:
    main()
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)
else:
    exit(0)
```

This script targets the specific problem of HTML output formatting mentioned in your issue description, checking for the correct application of formats. If the output does not meet expectations (indicating the issue is still present), an `AssertionError` will be raised, and a stack trace printed via the `print_stacktrace` function. The script exits with code 1 if it catches an exception, signaling a problem, and exits with code 0 if the issue is fixed (i.e., when the formatting is correctly applied and no exceptions are raised), reflecting the state of issue resolution.
