Specifically, we'll need information about the `Table` class, the `write` method, and how formats are processed differently for HTML output compared to CSV or ASCII formats. Given the details from the issue, here are the API calls we'll start with:\n\n1. Search for the `Table` class to understand its structure and associated methods:\n   - `search_class(\"Table\")`\n\n2. Search for the `write` method within the `Table` class or the general codebase to see how it's implemented:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"write\", \"Table\")`\n\n3. Since the issue describes a difference in behavior between HTML and other formats, it's useful to find where the formats for HTML are being processed:\n   - `search_code(\"format=\\\"html\\\"\")`\n\nThese searches should give us a reasonable starting point to understand how the `Table` class and its `write` method work, especially how they handle format specifications for different output types including HTML."
