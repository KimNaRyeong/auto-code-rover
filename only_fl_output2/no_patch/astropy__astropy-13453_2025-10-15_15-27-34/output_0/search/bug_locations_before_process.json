        "intended_behavior": "The `__call__` method in the `TableWrite` class should ensure that for `format=\"html\"`, the `formats` argument is meticulously processed and applied. This would mean adjusting the implementation to explicitly check for the `formats` argument when `format=\"html\"` is specified, and then applying the specified formatting to each column in the table based on the rules defined within `formats`. This behavior should be consistent with how formats are applied in other output types, thus fixing the inconsistency and respecting the users' formatting wishes without disrupting the handling of other supported formats."
