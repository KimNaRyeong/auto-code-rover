To create a correct standalone Python script that reproduces the Django issue about passing `NULL` to the `IN` lookup with `prefetch_related` and exit behaviors based on the presence of the issue, we need a file that configures Django settings in-line, defines the models, triggers the problematic behavior, and handles assertions properly. Let's address the initial setup problem and ensure it correctly demonstrates the issue when executed.

    Book.objects.create(title='Book Two', author=None)  # Creates a scenario with NULL

    # Attempt to reproduce the issue
    try:
        books = Book.objects.prefetch_related('author').all()
        for book in books:
            pass  # Trigger the prefetch

        # Check the last query
        last_query = connections['default'].queries[-1]['sql']
        if 'IN (NULL,' in last_query:
            raise AssertionError("Issue present: NULL found in IN clause")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with an error code if issue is present
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("No issue found. Exiting normally.")

```

This script thoroughly sets up a Django environment in-memory (for simplicity and clean-up purposes), defines two simple models to represent the issue context, attempts an operation that would expose the problem, and checks the SQL query to assert the presence of `NULL` in an `IN` clause. However, be aware that in actual usage, Django applications have a more complex configuration and are run differently than a standalone script. This exemplifies one way to reproduce a specific issue.
