Passing NULL is always unnecessary, since it's not allowed in FK's. There's a small risk from passing NULL that it could lead to incorrect with complex prefetch querysets using PK refs because of NULL's weirdness in SQL.\nFor example with these models:\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Author(models.Model):\npass\nclass Book(models.Model):\nauthor = models.ForeignKey(Author, null=True, on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING)\nPrefetching authors on Books, when at least one Book has author=None, uses IN (..., NULL, ...) in the query:\nIn [1]: from example.core.models import Author, Book\nIn [2]: a1 = Author.objects.create()\nIn [3]: Book.objects.create(author=a1)\nOut[3]: <Book: Book object (3)>\nIn [4]: Book.objects.create(author=None)\nOut[4]: <Book: Book object (4)>\nIn [5]: Book.objects.prefetch_related('author')\nOut[5]: <QuerySet [<Book: Book object (3)>, <Book: Book object (4)>]>\nIn [6]: from django.db import connection\nIn [7]: connection.queries\nOut[7]:\n[{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_author\" (\"id\") VALUES (NULL)', 'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_book\" (\"author_id\") VALUES (2)', 'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_book\" (\"author_id\") VALUES (NULL)',\n'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"core_book\".\"id\", \"core_book\".\"author_id\" FROM \"core_book\" LIMIT 21',\n'time': '0.000'},\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"core_author\".\"id\" FROM \"core_author\" WHERE \"core_author\".\"id\" IN (NULL, 2)',\n'time': '0.000'}]\nMaybe this could generally be extended to use of __in with non-nullable fields?\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given the results from the previous round of API calls, we have some conclusive and some null outcomes that provide direction for further investigation:\n\n1. **Classes `Author` and `Book` Not Found**: The inability to find `Author` and `Book` classes in the codebase suggests that either these classes are dynamically defined, not part of the direct codebase (possibly part of example or testing code not indexed), or there's an issue with how the search was conducted. Although these models were crucial for contextual understanding, their absence does not impede our ability to address the issue. The core of the problem lies in the query handling, specifically within `prefetch_related` and the `__in` lookup, not the models themselves.\n\n2. **`prefetch_related` Method Found**: Discovering occurrences of `prefetch_related` in `django/db/models/query.py` is significant. This method is responsible for prefetching objects related to a queryset. The relationship between this part of the code and the bug is direct: when `prefetch_related` is called, it potentially constructs a query that includes `NULL` in an `IN` clause when prefetching related objects. The intended behavior, avoiding the inclusion of `NULL` in such queries, involves modifying this method to filter out `NULL` values when constructing its `IN` list for the prefetch operation.\n\n3. **Method `__in` Not Found**: Not finding the `__in` method in the `QuerySet` class is consistent with Django's ORM structure since `__in` is not a method but rather a query lookup type, passed as an argument to filter methods, not called directly. This misunderstanding implies that the focus should instead be on how `QuerySet` handles lookup types in its filtering mechanisms, possibly within the `filter`, `exclude`, or other queryset constructing methods.\n\n4. **ForeignKey Code Not Found**: The failure to find the `ForeignKey` definition as specified suggests that our search was too narrow. Since `ForeignKey` relationships are central to Django models and not unique to the provided example, a broader investigation into how Django's ORM constructs queries involving `ForeignKey` fields might reveal the mechanisms that need patching.\n\nGiven these insights, we can refine our investigation with the following adjusted API calls:\n- Explore how the `prefetch_related` implementation handles query construction, specifically focusing on filtering and constructing the `IN` clause. For this, examining the relevant sections in `django/db/models/query.py` would be vital.\n- Investigate Django ORM query construction methods, particularly those that might manipulate or affect how filter arguments (like the `__in` lookup) are processed.\n\nRevised API Calls:\n1. `search_code_in_file(\"prefetch_related\", \"django/db/models/query.py\")` - This will provide specific code snippets where `prefetch_related` is discussed or implemented, offering direct insights into how null values can be excluded.\n2. `search_method_in_file(\"filter\", \"django/db/models/query.py\")` and `search_method_in_file(\"exclude\", \"django/db/models/query.py\")` - These searches aim to find how filtering methods are implemented, which might give insights into how lookups (including `__in`) are handled, and might indirectly demonstrate how to exclude `NULL` values from such queries."

This involves filtering out `NULL` before constructing the list of IDs (or relevant field values) for the `IN` clause when prefetching related objects. The amendment must ensure that any query construction logic within `prefetch_related` explicitly checks for and removes `NULL` values from the prefetch list. This change aims to preserve the existing functionality of efficiently prefetching related objects without unnecessary database lookups for `NULL` values, which by definition, will not match any related objects in a foreign key relationship. Additionally, this modification should consider edge cases where all values are `NULL`, avoiding generating invalid SQL queries or introducing performance regressions."
