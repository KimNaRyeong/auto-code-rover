Let's correct the approach to reproduce the issue without using incorrect API calls for Django, such as `models.Model.metadata.create_all`, which doesn't exist in Django's ORM. Instead, we use Django's standard practices for creating models and running migrations in memory for testing purposes. We'll use Django's test framework utilities correctly within a standalone script to reproduce the described issue, focusing on avoiding `NULL` in the `IN` lookup when using `prefetch_related`.

This revised script correctly sets up a Django environment to run in-memory using SQLite for simplification. It then creates two simple models, `Author` and `Book`, where `Book` can have an `Author` as a nullable foreign key. The script then inserts data to reproduce the scenario detailed in the issue description. After running the query that would demonstrate the problem, it asserts whether the `'NULL'` literal is part of the SQL command issued by Django to retrieve related authors. If the assertion fails (meaning `NULL` was included in the command), it raises an `AssertionError` and prints the stack trace accordingly. This script is designed to exit with code 0 only if the issue is fixed, ensuring clear feedback on the status of the reported problem.
