        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior is to modify the invocation of check_array(X, dtype=float) to allow sparse matrices. This can be done by changing this line to X = check_array(X, dtype=float, accept_sparse='csr'). It ensures that the method supports sparse matrices as input, aligning with the documentation's promise. The choice of CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) format is based on common usage and efficiency for sparse matrix operations in Scikit-learn. This modification should preserve the existing functionality for dense arrays while extending support for sparse inputs."

        "intended_behavior": "Similarly, the call to X = check_array(X) within _fit_transform needs to be modified to accept sparse matrices by changing it to X = check_array(X, accept_sparse='csr'). As with the LocallyLinearEmbedding class, this modification enables Isomap to handle sparse matrices according to its documentation, using CSR format for efficiency and compatibility. This change allows keeping the functionality intact for dense matrices while enabling sparse matrix support."
