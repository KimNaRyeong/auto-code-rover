If such a class exists, it could be closely related to the issue at hand, especially regarding character interpretation.\n\n3. `search_code(\"mathematica('\u03bb')\")`: Since the issue specifically mentions the inability to parse Greek characters, searching for similar snippets that successfully parse such characters (using the old `mathematica` function) could provide hints on what's missing or changed in the new implementation."
