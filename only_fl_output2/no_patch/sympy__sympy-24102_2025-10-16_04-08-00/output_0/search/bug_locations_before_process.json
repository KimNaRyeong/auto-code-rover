The intended change must ensure that characters like '\u03bb' are not lost or cause errors during tokenization, enabling accurate parsing and conversion into SymPy syntax. This improvement must preserve the method's ability to tokenize the wide range of mathematic expressions currently supported."

        "intended_behavior": "While the primary issue likely lies in the tokenization process, ensuring that the `parse` method (which utilizes the output from tokenization) correctly interprets and translates tokens representing Greek or special characters into their SymPy equivalents is crucial. Any corrections here should aim at preserving the functionality for existing symbol sets while extending support to previously unhandled characters. The method should maintain compatibility with all Mathematica expressions, correctly handling the broader set of characters without introducing regressions for previously supported syntax."
