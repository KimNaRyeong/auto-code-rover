To address the specific request of reproducing an issue related to `count_ops` being slow for large expressions, here's an updated script that includes your function to print a stack trace:

```python
import time
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_performance():
    from sympy import symbols, sin
    from sympy.core.function import count_ops

    x = symbols('x')
    
    # Generate a large expression by raising sin(x) to a high power
    expr = sin(x)**100

    # Start timing
    start_time = time.time()

    # Count the number of operations
    ops_count = count_ops(expr, visual=False)
    
    # End timing
    end_time = time.time()

    # Calculate the elapsed time
    elapsed_time = end_time - start_time

    print("Elapsed time:", elapsed_time)
    print("Operations count:", ops_count)

    # Check if the operation takes more than a certain threshold (e.g., 5 seconds)
    if elapsed_time > 5:
        raise AssertionError("count_ops is slow for large expressions")

def main():
    try:
        test_performance()

    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Issue detected:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # indicates failure

    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected exception occurred:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # indicates failure

    print("No issues detected.")
    sys.exit(0)  # indicates success

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script aims to directly target the reported issue by:
1. Generating a large symbolic expression.
2. Measuring the time taken by `count_ops` to process this expression.
3. Raising an `AssertionError` if the operation takes longer than some threshold, which is arbitrarily set as 5 seconds in this example. Adjust this threshold based on expected performance metrics or previous benchmarks.
4. Utilizing the provided `print_stacktrace` function to print detailed error information if the performance issue is detected or any other unexpected exception occurs.
5. Exiting with code `0` or `1` to indicate success (no issues detected) or failure (issue detected or unexpected error), respectively.

Please ensure you adjust the threshold (5 seconds in this example) based on realistic expectations for your use case or system capabilities.
