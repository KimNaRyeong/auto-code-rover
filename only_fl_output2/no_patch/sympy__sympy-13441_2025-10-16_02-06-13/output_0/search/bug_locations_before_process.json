        "intended_behavior": "Given the performance issue identified with `count_ops` in processing large expressions, the method might need optimization for handling complex and large-scale symbolic expressions more efficiently. This could include optimizing the way operations are counted in expressions, potentially through more effective traversal strategies, caching results for identical sub-expressions, or minimizing recursion depth. The objective would be to reduce the computational overhead without impacting the accuracy of the operation count."

        "intended_behavior": "The issue seems to suggest the `jacobian` method computation becomes significantly slower with an increase in expression complexity, like what's observed with larger pendulum systems. The intended behavior here would include optimizing the method for handling large symbolic matrices more efficiently. This might entail implementing more efficient algorithms for symbolic differentiation or the use of sparse matrix representations where applicable. The performance improvement should not compromise the mathematical accuracy but should reduce the time complexity of calculating the Jacobian for large systems."
