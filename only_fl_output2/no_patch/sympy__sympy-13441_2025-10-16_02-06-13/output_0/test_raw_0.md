This script attempts to mimic the conditions under which the original issue was observed as closely as possible. The function `test_large_expression_performance` is designed to replicate the slow performance issue when computing the Jacobian of a large expression. If the script encounters the expected performance issue (signaled by an `AssertionError`), it indicates the issue is present. Otherwise, if the script executes without any exception or with an unexpected exception, it can reveal whether the issue has been fixed or if there might be another problem. 

Please note that the actual effectiveness of the script in detecting the specific issue might depend on the environment and the version of the libraries (`sympy`, `pydy`, etc.) being used. Adjustments might be necessary to ensure the script accurately captures the issue in question.
