In the script above, an attempt to create a `Float` with binary precision is made by passing a custom precision value directly to the `prec` argument. The script assumes that an `AssertionError` is the expected outcome when the issue is present because it supposes the `Float` constructor does not correctly interpret binary precision via the `prec` attribute.

The script checks if the `_prec` attribute of the created `Float` object matches the expected binary precision. If the binary precision is correctly set (that is, the issue has been fixed in a newer version of the library that might handle the `prec` parameter as binary precision), the script prints a success message and exits normally. If an exception is raised (either because the feature is not implemented or due to another problem), it prints a stack trace to help identify the issue's location.

Remember, accessing private attributes (like `_prec` in this script) is generally not recommended for production code as it breaks the encapsulation principle and might lead to compatibility issues in the future. This script does it for demonstration and testing purposes, assuming intimate knowledge of the internal workings of the `Float` class.
