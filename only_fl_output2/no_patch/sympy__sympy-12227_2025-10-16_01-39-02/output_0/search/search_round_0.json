        "content": "<issue>Float constructor should allow to set binary precision\nI discussed this in some other issues, but I don't think I've opened an issue for it.\nThe Float constructor only allows you to set the decimal precision. It then converts this to binary precision and saves that in `Float._prec`.\nThe problem here is that there are fewer decimal precisions than binary precisions. For example:\n```\nIn [9]: Float(1.0, 15)._prec\nOut[9]: 53\nIn [10]: Float(1.0, 16)._prec\nOut[10]: 56\n```\nSo for instance, if you had a float that used 54 binary digits, it would be difficult to create a Float from it. I'm not even sure if it's possible, since in the current constructor, the `prec` argument overrides the fourth argument of a tuple input.\nOne issue here is that everywhere else in the\u00a0Sympy and mpmath code, `prec` refers to binary precision and `dps` refers to decimal precision. But currently, the second argument to `Float` is called `prec`, but refers to the decimal precision. So ideally, it should be\n```\nFloat(s, dps=15, prec=53)\n```\nwhere `Float(s, prec=54)` would override the default value of `dps=15`, and calling both (even consistently), like `Float(s, dps=15, prec=54)` would be an error.\nSince the keyword argument name has to change, it would be a backwards compatibility break for anyone who calls Float like `Float(s, prec=20)`.  Ideally this would require a deprecation cycle, but it's not possible to detect if someone is calling `Float(s, prec=20)` meaning the old way (20 decimal digits) or the new way (20 binary digits). The good news is that `N` and `evalf` call this argument `n`, so there's no need to change things there.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue efficiently, we need to understand the current implementation of the `Float` class constructor and how it handles the `prec` parameter. Given the details mentioned, it's clear that modifications are required in both the constructor handling and potentially how `_prec` is set or interpreted within the class. Let's start by gathering more context on the `Float` class and its constructor method:\n\n- `search_class(\"Float\")`: This call will help us locate the `Float` class within the project files, giving us a starting point to further explore how the `prec` parameter is currently being handled.\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"Float\", \"__init__\")`: With this call, we aim to find the constructor of the `Float` class, which is crucial to understand how precision is currently being set and how it interprets the `prec` and potentially the `dps` arguments.\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_set_prec\", \"Float\")`: This method call might not directly correspond to an existing method, given the context provided in the issue doesn't specify it. Nevertheless, the investigation into how `_prec` is set or modified within the `Float` class could benefit from understanding any internal methods that adjust precision, hence this speculative query.\n\nBy beginning our investigation with these calls, we should be able to collect enough context around the current implementation patterns to guide the required modifications for addressing the precision handling within the `Float` class."
