        "intended_behavior": "The `__new__` method needs to accurately process and distinguish between binary precision (`prec`) and decimal precision (`dps`). Modifications should include:\n- Explicitly accepting both a `prec` and `dps` keyword argument, with checks to ensure that both are not provided simultaneously (to avoid ambiguity).\n- If `dps` is provided, convert it to binary precision internally, but only if `prec` is not specified, using the appropriate conversion mechanism from decimal to binary precision as guided by mpmath documentation or internal SymPy utility functions.\n- Raise a clear error if both `prec` and `dps` are provided, indicating the usage mistake to the user.\n- Ensure that the binary precision (`_prec`) is set based on `prec` directly if provided, or from the converted `dps` otherwise.\n- Maintain backward compatibility where possible but prioritize clear, explicit precision specification in the API.\n\nThis behavior will resolve the ambiguity concerning precision specification in the `Float` constructor and align `Float` with the binary and decimal precision conventions used elsewhere in SymPy and mpmath, enhancing clarity and usability."
