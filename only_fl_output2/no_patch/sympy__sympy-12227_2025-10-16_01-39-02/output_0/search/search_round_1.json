        "content": "<issue>Float constructor should allow to set binary precision\nI discussed this in some other issues, but I don't think I've opened an issue for it.\nThe Float constructor only allows you to set the decimal precision. It then converts this to binary precision and saves that in `Float._prec`.\nThe problem here is that there are fewer decimal precisions than binary precisions. For example:\n```\nIn [9]: Float(1.0, 15)._prec\nOut[9]: 53\nIn [10]: Float(1.0, 16)._prec\nOut[10]: 56\n```\nSo for instance, if you had a float that used 54 binary digits, it would be difficult to create a Float from it. I'm not even sure if it's possible, since in the current constructor, the `prec` argument overrides the fourth argument of a tuple input.\nOne issue here is that everywhere else in the\u00a0Sympy and mpmath code, `prec` refers to binary precision and `dps` refers to decimal precision. But currently, the second argument to `Float` is called `prec`, but refers to the decimal precision. So ideally, it should be\n```\nFloat(s, dps=15, prec=53)\n```\nwhere `Float(s, prec=54)` would override the default value of `dps=15`, and calling both (even consistently), like `Float(s, dps=15, prec=54)` would be an error.\nSince the keyword argument name has to change, it would be a backwards compatibility break for anyone who calls Float like `Float(s, prec=20)`.  Ideally this would require a deprecation cycle, but it's not possible to detect if someone is calling `Float(s, prec=20)` meaning the old way (20 decimal digits) or the new way (20 binary digits). The good news is that `N` and `evalf` call this argument `n`, so there's no need to change things there.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n### Float Class Context\n\nThe provided information from `search_class(\"Float\")` shows us the basic structure of the `Float` class located in `sympy/core/numbers.py`. The class defines several properties and methods that indicate its capabilities to interact with floating-point numbers, including operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The presence of methods for handling floor, ceiling, various comparisons, and conversion to different numeric formats suggests a comprehensive implementation for floating-point arithmetic within the Sympy library.\n\n### Relationship with the Bug\n\nThe bug is specifically concerned with the way the `Float` class handles precision, both binary and decimal (`dps`). The information that `prec=None` is an argument in what appears to be the constructor method (mentioned as `__new__` rather than `__init__` which is a common pattern in Python for immutable types like those in Sympy) hints at the entry point for addressing the bug. Since the issue outlines confusion and potential inconsistency in how decimal and binary precisions are set and interpreted in the construction of `Float` instances, this constructor's handling of precision is directly involved.\n\n### Intended Behavior\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior seems to be a more flexible and clear way to specify either decimal (`dps`) or binary (`prec`) precision when creating a `Float` object, without the ambiguity currently present. This means altering how the constructor (`__new__`) interprets its arguments, potentially to support separate and explicit arguments for decimal and binary precision, handling them in a manner consistent with their designation.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven the above analysis and the failure of our search for the `__init__` method (which should have been a search for `__new__`) and the non-existent `_set_prec` method (potentially an incorrect speculative query), the next steps would involve:\n\n1. **Clarifying the Constructor**: We need to directly examine the implementation of `__new__` in the `Float` class to understand its current handling of precision. This would help to plan modifications or enhancements.\n\n2. **Understanding Precision Handling**: Since `_set_prec` was not found, it's likely that precision setting is either handled inline within `__new__` or by another method we have not yet identified. We need to explore how `_prec` is currently being set or modified.\n\nGiven these considerations, the following API calls would be sensible:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"__new__\", \"sympy/core/numbers.py\")`: To get the implementation details of the `Float` constructor.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"_prec\", \"sympy/core/numbers.py\")`: To explore how the `_prec` attribute is handled within the file, which might give insights into precision management.\n\nThese calls aim to clarify the implementation details that are critical for addressing the issue."

This includes:\n  - Accepting `dps` as an additional keyword argument, separate from `prec`.\n  - Implementing logic to convert `dps` to binary precision, when `dps` is provided and `prec` is not. The conversion should follow the existing rules present in mpmath or other parts of SymPy that handle such conversions.\n  - Raising an error if both `dps` and `prec` are provided, to avoid ambiguity.\n  - Preserving backward compatibility to the extent possible by distinguishing between the old behavior (using `prec` as decimal precision) and the new behavior (using `prec` for binary precision explicitly). This can be challenging and may involve heuristic-based approaches or deprecation warnings where ambiguity cannot be resolved.\n  \n  **Background**: This modification directly addresses the issue's core concerns by clarifying how precision is specified for `Float` objects and removing the ambiguity and limitations of the current implementation. Since `Float` objects are foundational within the Sympy library for representing real numbers with arbitrary precision, these changes will facilitate more precise and predictable numerical computations, align the behavior of the `Float` class with the binary precision-focused design of the underlying mpmath library, and eliminate confusion among users regarding precision specification."
