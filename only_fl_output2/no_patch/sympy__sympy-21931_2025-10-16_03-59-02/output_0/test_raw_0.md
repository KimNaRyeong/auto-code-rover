This script should work according to the specifications provided. It will raise an `AssertionError` if the verbose printing issue is present by making assertions on the expected strings against the actual string representations of `Partition` instantiated with a list and a set. If the issue is fixed, meaning the `Partition` objects print in the desired less verbose format, the assertions will pass, and the script will exit with a success message.

- The script tests for concise printing behavior of `Partition` objects against the current verbose behavior of printing with `FiniteSet`.
- It uses assertions to verify if the string representation matches the expected concise format.
- If the issue exists, it captures the `AssertionError` and prints a stack trace.
- If another type of error is encountered, it provides a message and a stack trace for that error.
- The script concludes with a success message if no issue is detected, implying that the formatting has been corrected to match the expectations.
