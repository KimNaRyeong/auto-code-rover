        "intended_behavior": "Implement a `__str__` or `__repr__` method (whichever is more appropriate according to SymPy's conventions for printable representations). This method should override the inherited behavior from `FiniteSet` to provide a representation of the `Partition` object in a less verbose manner. The implementation should preserve the existing functionality where the mathematical correctness of representing the partition as a set is maintained while making the output easier to read and more intuitive. For example, it could return a string representation like `\"Partition({1, 2})\"` for a set input or `\"Partition([1, 2])\"` for a list input, with the decision on whether to use lists or sets in the representation possibly being informed by how the `Partition` was constructed or by community preference. The key here is to ensure that while making the printing \"nicer\" or less verbose, the method does not lose info on the nature of the partition it represents."
