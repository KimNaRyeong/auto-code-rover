Given the feedback, it seems that there was a problem with the module import due to the project structure not being properly handled within the script. Let's address this by adjusting the script to be self-contained, thus not relying on external files for the class definitions. We will define `Parent` and `Child` classes directly within the `reproducer.py` script to eliminate the dependency on a specific project structure. 

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class Parent:
    @classmethod
    def method(cls) -> int:
        """Return an integer."""
        return 17

class Child(Parent):
    @classmethod
    def method(cls):
        return 42

def main():
    import inspect

    # Check if documentation is inherited for classmethod
    parent_doc = inspect.getdoc(Parent.method)
    child_doc = inspect.getdoc(Child.method)

    try:
        assert child_doc == parent_doc, "Child classmethod did not inherit parent documentation"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise SystemExit(1)
    
    print("Test passed: Overridden classmethod documentation inherited from parent class.")
    raise SystemExit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This adjusted version of the `reproducer.py` script should now correctly attempt to reproduce the issue related to documentation inheritance in overridden classmethods when executed in any Python environment, without relying on a specific directory structure or external files. It dynamically checks if the documentation string of the `method` classmethod in the `Child` class is inherited from the `Parent` class, raising an `AssertionError` with a stack trace if it is not.
