This script is intended to be executed from the root directory of a project structured as described in the issue. It tries to reproduce the issue of a child class's classmethod not inheriting the documentation from the parent class's classmethod. The script raises an `AssertionError` if the documentation is not inherited as expected, which triggers printing a stack trace detailing where the problem occurred. Conversely, it will exit with code 0 indicating success if the issue is fixed.
