        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to `QuerySet.aggregate()` mixing annotated fields, we need to focus on the Django ORM components that handle query composition, particularly around annotation and aggregation. Specifically, we need to understand how the `aggregate()` and `annotate()` methods are implemented and how they interact with field references within a query.\n\nBased on the issue description, we are interested in the following:\n1. The `QuerySet` class, where `annotate()` and `aggregate()` methods are defined.\n2. How `F` objects and the aggregation functions like `Max` and `Sum` are processed within queries.\n3. The underlying mechanism that generates SQL from Django ORM queries, potentially within the `Query` class or related components, responsible for constructing the SQL subquery.\n\nGiven this, our API calls would be:\n\n1. Search for the `QuerySet` class to understand its structure and methods.\n2. Search for the methods `annotate` and `aggregate` within the `QuerySet` class to understand their implementations.\n3. Search for the `F` class to see how field references are handled.\n4. Search for the classes or methods that handle `Max` and `Sum` aggregation functions.\n5. Search for the `Query` class or similar, to understand how Django composes SQL queries.\n\nLet's formulate the API calls:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class(\"QuerySet\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"annotate\", \"QuerySet\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"aggregate\", \"QuerySet\")\nsearch_class(\"F\")\nsearch_class(\"Max\")\nsearch_class(\"Sum\")\nsearch_class(\"Query\")\n```\n\nThese calls will provide a good starting point for understanding the problem and identifying where the issue with field name handling in the generated SQL may lie."
