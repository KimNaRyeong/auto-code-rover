        "intended_behavior": "The `__new__` method within the `MatrixSymbol` class should be updated to ensure that its first argument, `name`, accepts a string (`Str`) as its name instead of a `Symbol`. This adjustment will involve: - Validating that the `name` argument provided to `MatrixSymbol` is indeed a string. If not, appropriate error handling or conversion logic needs to be implemented. - Ensuring all instances and usages of `MatrixSymbol` throughout the codebase are consistent with this change. This includes reviewing any documentation or examples to align with the updated argument type. - Preserving all existing functionalities of the `MatrixSymbol` class by ensuring that the `name` attribute's behavior remains unchanged besides accepting a different type. This will likely involve checking how `name` is used within methods of `MatrixSymbol` and in other parts of the codebase. Making `MatrixSymbol` store names as strings directly aligns with Python's dynamic nature and simplifies interface interactions where symbolic name handling is not strictly required to be of type `Symbol`; this change will potentially enhance usability and decrease complexity for certain use cases."
