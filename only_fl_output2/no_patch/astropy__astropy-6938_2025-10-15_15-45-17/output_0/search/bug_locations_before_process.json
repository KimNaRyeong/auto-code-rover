        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue where the 'D' exponent is not being properly replaced in the ASCII representations of floating-point numbers, it is necessary to ensure that changes made by the `replace` method are actually applied to `output_field`. Given that `replace` might not operate in-place but rather return a new modified array, the intended behavior here should be capturing the result of the `replace` method and ensuring it is assigned back to `output_field` effectively. This adjustment ensures that the replacement operation's result is retained and applied, making sure floating-point numbers in the output adhere to the FITS standard."
