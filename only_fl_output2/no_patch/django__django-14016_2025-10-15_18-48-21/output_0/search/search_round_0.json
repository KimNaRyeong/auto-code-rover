        "content": "To address the issue effectively, I need to understand how `Q` objects handle the `|` operator and how they serialize or pickle themselves, as the problem seems to stem from there. The `|` operator's behavior likely depends on the `Q` class and possibly a specific method for handling the or operation or serialization.\n\nLet's start by investigating the `Q` class and methods related to pickling or serialization, and the implementation of the `|` operator in the context of `Q` objects:\n\n1. Search for the `Q` class in the Django codebase to understand its structure and find relevant methods: `search_class(\"Q\")`.\n2. Given that the issue is related to the `|` operator, which is represented by the `__or__` method in Python, search for this method within the `Q` class to see how it's implemented: `search_method_in_class(\"__or__\", \"Q\")`.\n3. Since the issue involves pickling and the error message mentions that a `dict_keys` object cannot be pickled, search for any methods within the `Q` class that might involve serialization or pickling, such as methods that explicitly deal with the state of the object for pickling: `search_method_in_class(\"__getstate__\", \"Q\")`.\n4. Also search for `__setstate__` in case the `Q` class is customizing its pickling behavior: `search_method_in_class(\"__setstate__\", \"Q\")`.\n\nThese API calls should give us a good starting point by providing the relevant sections of the code where changes may need to be made to resolve the issue."
