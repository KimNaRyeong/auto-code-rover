        "intended_behavior": "The `Q` class should ensure that its instances, when participating in operations like `|` (or), do not raise serialization-related errors due to containing non-pickleable objects like `dict_keys`. The intended behavior is to modify or extend the `Q` class to either: Handle serialization of non-pickleable objects gracefully by converting them to a pickleable format within the `__or__` method or any relevant method that combines `Q` objects. For example, `dict_keys` could be converted to a list before being processed. Implement custom `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods (or equivalent functionality) to manage serialization manually. This would explicitly define how `Q` objects are to be pickled, ensuring any non-pickleable content is handled appropriately. The solution should preserve the ability of `Q` objects to be combined using logical operators and ensure they can be serialized/deserialized without error, maintaining backward compatibility and existing functionalities."
