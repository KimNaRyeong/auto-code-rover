        "content": "To address the issue effectively, I need to understand how `Q` objects handle the `|` operator and how they serialize or pickle themselves, as the problem seems to stem from there. The `|` operator's behavior likely depends on the `Q` class and possibly a specific method for handling the or operation or serialization.\n\nLet's start by investigating the `Q` class and methods related to pickling or serialization, and the implementation of the `|` operator in the context of `Q` objects:\n\n1. Search for the `Q` class in the Django codebase to understand its structure and find relevant methods: `search_class(\"Q\")`.\n2. Given that the issue is related to the `|` operator, which is represented by the `__or__` method in Python, search for this method within the `Q` class to see how it's implemented: `search_method_in_class(\"__or__\", \"Q\")`.\n3. Since the issue involves pickling and the error message mentions that a `dict_keys` object cannot be pickled, search for any methods within the `Q` class that might involve serialization or pickling, such as methods that explicitly deal with the state of the object for pickling: `search_method_in_class(\"__getstate__\", \"Q\")`.\n4. Also search for `__setstate__` in case the `Q` class is customizing its pickling behavior: `search_method_in_class(\"__setstate__\", \"Q\")`.\n\nThese API calls should give us a good starting point by providing the relevant sections of the code where changes may need to be made to resolve the issue."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context sheds light on the implementation of the `Q` class and the `__or__` method within it, which are integral to understanding and resolving the issue at hand.\n\n1. **Analysis of the `Q` class**: \n   The `Q` class is a part of `django/db/models/query_utils.py` and inherits from `tree.Node`. It's designed to encapsulate a SQL query's conditions, allowing complex database queries to be constructed through logical operators like AND and OR. It supports methods for combining `Q` objects (`_combine`), logical operations (`__or__`, `__and__`), negation (`__invert__`), and others. The absence of `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods suggests that it does not implement custom pickling behavior.\n\n2. **Relationship between `__or__` method and the bug**:\n   The `__or__` method combines two `Q` objects with an OR condition. It's directly related to the issue described, as the error occurs when using the `|` operator, which Python translates to the `__or__` method call. Since the error mentions pickling, and there are no custom `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods defined in the `Q` class, the issue likely arises from how Python's default pickling attempts to serialize the `Q` object or its contents. Specifically, it seems that the presence of `dict_keys` within a `Q` object's parameters might be incompatible with Python's default pickling mechanism, causing the \"TypeError: cannot pickle 'dict_keys' object\" message.\n\n3. **Intended behavior of the `__or__` method given the issue**:\n   Ideally, the `__or__` method should allow the combination of two `Q` objects, regardless of whether they contain references to non-pickleable objects like `dict_keys`. Since the problem seems to involve serialization implicitly triggered by the use of `|`, the intended behavior should ensure that combining `Q` objects with `|` does not lead into a context where non-pickleable types lead to errors, even if that means implementing custom serialization logic (like defining `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods) or preprocessing the contents of `Q` objects to ensure compatibility with Python's pickling.\n\nGiven the absence of custom pickling methods in the `Q` class, it might be worth exploring two avenues:\n1. Adding custom `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods to handle the serialization of `Q` objects properly when they contain non-pickleable types.\n2. Examining how `Q` objects are used in conjunction with Python's default serialization mechanisms and identifying if there is a need to preprocess or transform types like `dict_keys` before they cause issues.\n\nTo further investigate these options, it would be useful to:\n- Examine how `Q` objects are serialized implicitly, such as when used with multiprocessing or in other scenarios requiring pickling.\n- Investigate the underlying tree.Node class for potential leads on serialization behavior that could affect `Q` objects.\n\nLet's proceed with investigating how `Q` objects are possibly serialized by searching for any code that might try to serialize `Q` objects or related serialization concerns in the codebase involving `Q`. Additionally, looking into the `tree.Node` class might provide insights into inherited serialization behavior, if any:\n\n- `search_class(\"Node\")`\n- `search_code(\"pickle\")`"

The intended behavior is to modify or extend the `Q` class to either:\n   - Handle serialization of non-pickleable objects gracefully by converting them to a pickleable format within the `__or__` method or any relevant method that combines `Q` objects. For example, `dict_keys` could be converted to a list before being processed.\n   - Implement custom `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods (or equivalent functionality) to manage serialization manually. This would explicitly define how `Q` objects are to be pickled, ensuring any non-pickleable content is handled appropriately.\n\n   The solution should preserve the ability of `Q` objects to be combined using logical operators and ensure they can be serialized/deserialized without error, maintaining backward compatibility and existing functionalities."
