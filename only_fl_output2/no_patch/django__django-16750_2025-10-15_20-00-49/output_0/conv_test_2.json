        "content": "Given the issue encountered in the previous attempt to run the standalone script due to the Django model's initialization occurring before Django's app registry is ready, we need to modify the approach. The corrective strategy involves ensuring Django's setup process is correctly initialized within the script. This setup includes configuring Django's settings and initializing the app registry before defining any models or running any queries.\n\nBelow is the revised standalone `reproducer.py` script. This script properly sets up Django, eliminating the `AppRegistryNotReady` issue and focusing on reproducing the reported annotation error with `Chr` and `Value`.\n\n```python\nimport django\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.core.management import execute_from_command_line\nfrom django.db.models.functions import Chr\nfrom django.db.models import Value\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\n# Settings for Django to run standalone scripts\nBASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\nsettings.configure(\n    DEBUG=True,\n    DATABASES={\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',\n            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),\n        }\n    },\n    INSTALLED_APPS=(\n        '__main__', # For simplicity, we tell Django that this script is its own app.\n    ),\n    USE_TZ=True,\n)\n\ndjango.setup() # This is crucial to setup Django's app registry and other configurations.\n\nclass Author(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\n# Simulate the Django command-line environment to handle migrations.\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    execute_from_command_line(['manage.py', 'migrate'])\n\n    try:\n        # Attempt to reproduce the issue as described.\n        Author.objects.annotate(first_letter=Chr(Value(77)))\n        # If no error is raised, the issue is considered resolved.\n        print(\"No issue detected. Exiting normally.\")\n        sys.exit(0)\n    except ValueError as ve:\n        print_stacktrace(ve)\n        # Ensure specific error pattern is matched before considering the issue reproduced.\n        assert \"invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'M'\" in str(ve), \"The issue wasn't reproduced as expected.\"\n        sys.exit(0) # Exiting with code 0, as the issue was successfully reproduced.\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"An unexpected error occurred.\", file=sys.stderr)\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        sys.exit(1) # Exiting with error code upon encountering an unexpected issue.\n```\n\nEnsure this script is placed at the root of a Django project setup, where it is meant to be executed as `python3 reproducer.py`. The script closely mirrors the Django application initialization sequence, including settings setup and migrations, before attempting to reproduce the reported issue with `Chr` and `Value`."
