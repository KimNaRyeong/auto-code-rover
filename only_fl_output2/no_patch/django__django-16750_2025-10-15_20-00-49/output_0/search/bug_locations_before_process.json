        "intended_behavior": "The `Chr` function should explicitly define its output as a character field by setting `output_field=CharField()` within its implementation. This change will instruct Django's ORM to treat the output of the `Chr` function as text, thereby avoiding the `ValueError` when an attempt is made to interpret a non-integer value ('M' in the context of the bug report) as an integer. This adjustment should maintain the existing functionality of `Chr` for intended use cases, ensuring it can still be used wherever character representation of numeric values is required within Django model queries."
