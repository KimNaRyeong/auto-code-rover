To address the feedback and correct the oversight, it's crucial to adjust the initial approach and directly target the specific issue with the `Chr` function as described, ensuring an accurate reproduction of the error and appropriate handling. We'll refine the standalone Python script to more specifically and accurately reproduce the issue relating to the `Chr` function and `ValueError`.

Please replace the previous version of `reproducer.py` with the following corrected and targeted version to replicate the reported issue accurately:

```python
"""
reproducer.py
Script to reproduce the issue where annotating with Chr raises ValueError.

        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)

        result = Author.objects.annotate(first_letter=Chr(Value('77'))).first()
        if result:
            print(result.first_letter)
        print("No ValueError detected. This may indicate the issue has been resolved.")
    except ValueError as ve:
        print_stacktrace(ve)
        # Assuming the specific issue is about a failure in the original context, the assertion will pass.
        assert "invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'M'" in str(ve), "The specific ValueError was not reproduced."
        raise AssertionError("The issue was reproduced successfully, but this should have raised ValueError.")
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected exception occurred:", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
```

This script specifically targets the context of the reported issue, trying to annotate a model's field with `Chr` constructed with `Value`, which seems to have been misunderstood or incorrectly coded in the original attempt. It replicates the environment closely tied to the reported stack trace and operational context, aiming to either catch the exact sort of ValueError described or succeed in operation should the issue not be present, providing direct feedback through stdout or stderr regarding the occurrence of an error.
