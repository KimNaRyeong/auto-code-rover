        "intended_behavior": "The `ccode` function should be enhanced to handle `sinc(x)` expressions by either directly supporting them through an internal piecewise representation `(sin(x)/x, Ne(x, 0))` or by leveraging the `user_functions` mechanism to allow users to specify how `sinc` should be translated to C code. This enhancement must preserve all existing functionalities of `ccode`, including handling of other functions, expressions, and its extensibility via `user_functions`. Specifically, when encountering `sinc(x)`, it should check if a user-defined representation exists in `user_functions`; if not, it should default to translating `sinc(x)` to a piecewise expression or a similar construct that avoids generating unsupported C code. This requires modifying the function to recognize `sinc` expressions and properly format them into C-compatible code snippets, while making sure such translations are in line with C standards and practices (e.g., ensuring the generated code checks for `x != 0` before doing division)."
