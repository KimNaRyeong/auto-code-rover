        "content": "To address the issue described, where invoking `ccode(sinc(x))` does not generate C code compatible with `math.h` for the `sinc` function, and considering the suggestion to handle it like a piecewise function, the following API calls will provide more context:\n\n1. Search for the `ccode` function to understand how it processes mathematical expressions and handles unsupported functions:\n   - `search_method(\"ccode\")`\n\n2. Given that the issue suggests an implementation using `Piecewise` as a workaround, it is also beneficial to search for how `Piecewise` expressions are transformed into C code to identify if there is a specialized handling that could be adapted or extended for `sinc`:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"Piecewise\", \"ccode\")`\n\n3. Search for the `sinc` function or its handling in the codebase to see if there are existing implementations or special cases for `sinc` that don't work as expected:\n   - `search_method(\"sinc\")`\n\n4. Because the `sinc` function is not directly supported by `math.h`, we should also find out if there's a mechanism to extend `ccode` with unsupported functions or if there's a pattern for adding support for new functions:\n   - `search_code(\"Not supported in C\")`\n\nThese API calls focus on understanding the current implementation of the `ccode` function, how it handles instances of `Piecewise`, whether there's existing support for `sinc`, and how unsupported functions are noted. This information will be critical in devising a patch to properly generate C code for the `sinc` function."
