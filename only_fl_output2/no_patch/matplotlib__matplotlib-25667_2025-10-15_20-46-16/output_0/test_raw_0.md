This script attempts to reproduce the issue described. If the problem persists, it intentionally raises an `AssertionError`, catching any exceptions and printing a stack trace for clarity, following the given format for better readability during debugging.

It's important to note that in real-world scenarios, especially dealing with graphical output like from Matplotlib, asserting a fix might depend on reviewing output images or changes in behavior rather than catching exceptions. This script simulates an approach by forcing an error if the issue is assumed to still be present, given the known bug description.
