        "content": "To address this issue effectively, we need to gather more context about the underlying implementation of `bar` and `barh` methods in Matplotlib and also understand how the datetime units handling is currently implemented in the library. Here are the API calls that could help us achieve this:\n\n1. Search for the `bar` method across the codebase to understand its current implementation and how it processes the `bottom` parameter.\n2. Search for the `barh` method across the codebase to understand its current implementation and how it processes the `left` parameter.\n3. Since the issue mentions that forcing the x-axis to be times by using a plot method with datetime objects works as expected, it would be helpful to understand how datetimes are handled differently in the `plot` method. Therefore, we will search for the implementation of `plot`.\n4. The issue suggests that there's a specific handling for datetime units through `plt.rcParams['date.converter'] = 'concise'`. It would be beneficial to understand how this setting is applied in the context of axis conversion. Thus, we should search for the code where `date.converter` setting from `rcParams` is accessed or used.\n5. Given that converters might play a crucial role in this issue, looking into how Matplotlib manages converters for datetime objects would be useful. Searching for instances where converters are applied to axes might provide insights.\n\nGiven these considerations, we will make the following API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"bar\")`\n- `search_method(\"barh\")`\n- `search_method(\"plot\")`\n- `search_code(\"rcParams['date.converter']\")`\n- `search_code(\"converters\")`"
