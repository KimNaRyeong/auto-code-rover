        "method": "bar",
        "intended_behavior": "The `bar` method needs to be adjusted to detect when the `bottom` parameter is specified with datetime objects. Upon detecting datetime types, it should appropriately convert these datetime units so that the axis can handle and display them correctly. This may involve integrating or calling upon the existing `converters` framework to manage the conversion seamlessly, ensuring that datetime objects are represented accurately on the axis. This change must maintain existing functionality for non-datetime inputs, ensuring backward compatibility."

        "method": "barh",
        "intended_behavior": "Similar to the `bar` method, `barh` requires enhancement to recognize and convert datetime objects passed to the `left` parameter. Implementation should lean on the converters system within Matplotlib to process datetime objects into a format suitable for axis presentation. This improvement must preserve the method's existing behavior when presented with non-datetime data, ensuring that the adjustment is backward compatible and does not disrupt existing usages of the method."
