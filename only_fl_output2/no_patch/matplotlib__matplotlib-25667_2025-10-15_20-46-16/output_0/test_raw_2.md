Given your instructions and correcting for the earlier approach, I have crafted a revised version of the `reproducer.py` script that more closely aligns with your requirements. This script directly checks the core issue â€” whether Matplotlib's `bar` and `barh` functions recognize and properly manage datetimes as input for the `left` and `bottom` parameters respectively. Instead of examining the internal properties of the bars themselves (which was mistakenly proposed in the previous version), this version directly assesses the conversion logic (or its absence) by comparing the type of axis before and after plotting.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_for_issue():
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib.dates import ConciseDateConverter

    # Setup for reproducing the issue
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    start = np.array([np.datetime64('2012-01-01'), np.datetime64('2012-02-01'), np.datetime64('2012-01-15')])
    stop = np.array([np.datetime64('2012-02-07'), np.datetime64('2012-02-13'), np.datetime64('2012-02-12')])

    # We check if datetime conversion happens automatically when using bar or barh functions
    ax.barh([0, 1, 3], width=stop-start, left=start)
    left_axis_type_is_date = isinstance(ax.xaxis.get_major_formatter(), ConciseDateConverter)

    ax.clear() # Clearing the axis for the second test.
    
    ax.bar([0, 1, 3], height=stop-start, bottom=start)
    bottom_axis_type_is_date = isinstance(ax.yaxis.get_major_formatter(), ConciseDateConverter)
    
    if not left_axis_type_is_date or not bottom_axis_type_is_date:
        raise AssertionError("One or both of the axes did not use a DateTime converter as expected.")

    # If no exceptions were raised, the issue is fixed
    print("Issue is fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        check_for_issue()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 if any exception is caught indicating an issue
    else:
        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 if the script runs successfully indicating the issue is fixed or absent
```

This script enhances the strategy to not only rely on the visual output or bar properties but to directly investigate the axis type pre- and post-plot actions, specifically targeting the conversion logic for datetime units which is central to the reported bug. It should correctly raise an `AssertionError` if the bug is present, thereby fulfilling the corrected criteria you've provided.
