Given the initial misunderstanding and the goal to reproduce the issue specifically related to the handling of `keep_empty` by `PdfPages` in Matplotlib, let's approach this with a correct understanding that the desired behavior is `keep_empty=False` by default. The script should check if the file is not created when no figures are added (reflecting a fixed issue) or if the file still gets created (indicating the presence of the issue). 

Please note, the previous script misinterpreted the check due to an incorrect assertion about the `keep_empty` flag and its expected effects. Here's an updated version designed to accurately test the behavior, considering the feedback:

```python
# reproducer.py
import matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf as pdf_backend
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_pdfpages_keep_empty_behavior():
    output_filename = "test_output.pdf"

    try:
        # Intentionally not using the keep_empty argument to test the default behavior
        with pdf_backend.PdfPages(output_filename) as pdf:
            pass  # Implicitly tests the default behavior of keep_empty

        # The issue states that an empty PDF should not be created by default
        # So, if it exists, the behavior hasn't been fixed
        is_file_created = os.path.exists(output_filename)
        assert not is_file_created, "Empty PDF was created; the default behavior might not be keep_empty=False."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(0)  # Exit with 0 to indicate the issue is reproduced when an AssertionError occurs

    finally:
        # Cleanup: remove the created file if it was created
        if os.path.exists(output_filename):
            os.remove(output_filename)

    print("The issue has been fixed.")  # Printed if the AssertionError is not raised

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_pdfpages_keep_empty_behavior()
```

This script specifically checks for the presence of the empty PDF file as a means to verify if the default `keep_empty` behavior is indeed `False`, as proposed for future releases. If the file does not exist, it conclusively indicates the default behavior has been successfully set to `keep_empty=False`, or the issue has been fixed, thereby not reproducing the issue and exiting normally. If an error occurs indicating the file does exist, it prints the stack trace and exits with code 0, signaling that the issue is present.

Remember, the actual implementation of checking the PDF's validity is not included in this script. It uses file existence as a proxy to determine the state of `keep_empty` behavior.
