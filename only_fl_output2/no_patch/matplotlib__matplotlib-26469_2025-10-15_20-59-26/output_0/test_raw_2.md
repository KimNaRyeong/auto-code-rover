Based on the requirements to reproduce the issue with `keep_empty` default behavior in the `PdfPages` class from Matplotlib, we need to create a script that specifically checks whether a PDF file is created or not when no figures are saved. The existing state of the issue implies that such a file should not be created by default, reflecting a desired change in default behavior to `keep_empty=False`.

Here's a Python script designed to meet these criteria:

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
from matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf import PdfPages

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_pdfpages_default_behavior():
    filename = "empty_test.pdf"
    try:
        # Default behavior should no longer create an empty file
        with PdfPages(filename) as pdf:
            pass

        # After closing the context, check if the file exists
        # The presence of the file indicates the issue is present (keep_empty default is True)
        if os.path.exists(filename):
            raise AssertionError("An empty PDF file was created; indicating that the default keep_empty behavior is True, which is not aligned with the desired default behavior.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        os.remove(filename)  # Ensure to clean up even when an error occurs
        exit(1)  # Use exit code 1 to indicate an assertion/error occurred

    finally:
        if os.path.exists(filename):
            os.remove(filename)  # Clean up the file if it was created

    # If the script reaches this point, it means the issue has been addressed
    print("The issue has been fixed. No empty PDF file was created by default.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_pdfpages_default_behavior()
```

This script will create a PDF file using `PdfPages` without adding any figures and will then check if the file exists. The existence of the file would indicate that the default behavior is indeed to keep an empty file (`keep_empty=True`), which goes against the proposed change.

- If the file is not created (desired behavior), it prints a message indicating that the issue has been fixed.
- If an `AssertionError` is raised due to the file's existence, it prints a detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function, then cleans up the created file and exits with code `1` to signal the presence of the issue.

This script should be run in the environment where Matplotlib is installed and can be executed to verify that the desired default behavior of not keeping empty PDF files is in place.
