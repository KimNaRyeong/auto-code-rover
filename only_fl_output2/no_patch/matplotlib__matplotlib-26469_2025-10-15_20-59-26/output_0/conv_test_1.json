This was introduced in #2453; previously PdfPages behaved as if `keep_empty=True` (and this was left the default to maintain backcompat).\r\n\r\nIn fact, a pdf file with zero pages is simply not a valid pdf document.  See e.g. the pdf standard (https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf) p. 33: \"A PDF document consists of a collection of objects that together describe the appearance of *one or more pages*...\" (emphasis mine).  Or one can simply check that the empty file created by `PdfPages(\"/tmp/foo.pdf\").close()` is indeed deemed invalid (error-on-open) by at least Acrobat, mupdf, and xpdf.\r\n\r\nThus I propose to eventually stop generating such invalid files at all via switching the default value to `keep_empty=False` and eventually killing the kwarg (deprecation strategy TBD, perhaps warn (with a suppress_warning kwarg) if such a file would have been created, yada yada).\r\n\r\n(Apparently multipage support in mplcairo is getting used, and cairo cannot generate zero-page pdfs, so that's how I found out about this...)\n"

If the behavior of `PdfPages` with `keep_empty=False` by default has not been implemented yet, creating an empty PDF would succeed, which according to the issue described, is not the expected behavior. This script will catch that behavior as an `AssertionError` and print the stack trace for debugging purposes. \n\n**Important Notes:**\n- It assumes the issue is \"present\" if `PdfPages` allows creating an empty PDF with `keep_empty=True`.\n- Once the default is changed to `keep_empty=False`, and the code logically prevents empty PDFs from being generated, the assertion should fail to trigger, meaning the issue has been addressed.\n- The script may need adjustments based on the exact environment or library versions. This example assumes that `matplotlib` and its PDF backend are installed and functioning as expected."
