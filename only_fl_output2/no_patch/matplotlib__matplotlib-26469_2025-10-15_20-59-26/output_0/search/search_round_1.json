        "content": "<issue>Change PdfPages to default to keep_empty=False and eventually deprecate keep_empty\nPdfPages has an option, `keep_empty`, that sets whether a PdfPages object with *zero* figures is written to the disk at all or not.  This was introduced in #2453; previously PdfPages behaved as if `keep_empty=True` (and this was left the default to maintain backcompat).\nIn fact, a pdf file with zero pages is simply not a valid pdf document.  See e.g. the pdf standard (https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf) p. 33: \"A PDF document consists of a collection of objects that together describe the appearance of *one or more pages*...\" (emphasis mine).  Or one can simply check that the empty file created by `PdfPages(\"/tmp/foo.pdf\").close()` is indeed deemed invalid (error-on-open) by at least Acrobat, mupdf, and xpdf.\nThus I propose to eventually stop generating such invalid files at all via switching the default value to `keep_empty=False` and eventually killing the kwarg (deprecation strategy TBD, perhaps warn (with a suppress_warning kwarg) if such a file would have been created, yada yada).\n(Apparently multipage support in mplcairo is getting used, and cairo cannot generate zero-page pdfs, so that's how I found out about this...)\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insights into how `PdfPages` and the `keep_empty` flag are implemented and used within the project, specifically within `backend_pdf.py` and `backend_pgf.py` files. Let's break down the analysis based on the provided questions:\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\n- **`PdfPages` Class (`backend_pdf.py` and `backend_pgf.py`):** These classes manage the creation and manipulation of PDF files. The presence of the `PdfPages` class in two different backends (`backend_pdf` and `backend_pgf`) suggests that the project supports different methods for PDF generation, likely catering to different use cases or providing various backend implementations.\n\n- **`keep_empty` Flag:** This flag determines whether an empty PDF (a PDF without any pages) should be written to disk. It defaults to `True`, meaning the behavior up until now has been to allow the creation of such empty PDF files.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe bug, or more accurately, the issue, is concerned with the creation of invalid PDF files \u2014 specifically, PDFs that contain zero pages. According to the PDF specification, a valid PDF file must contain at least one page, making the current behavior (which allows the creation of zero-page PDFs when `keep_empty=True`) non-compliant with the PDF standard.\n\nThe `close` methods in both `backend_pdf.py` and `backend_pgf.py` files are directly related to the issue. They finalize the PDF file, and their behavior depends on the `keep_empty` flag and the number of figures/pages included in the file.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior proposed in the issue is to change the default value of `keep_empty` to `False`, preventing the creation of invalid zero-page PDF documents. This implies modifying the default parameter value in the `__init__` method of both `PdfPages` implementations and adjusting the logic within the `close` method to reflect this new default. Eventually, the goal is to deprecate the `keep_empty` flag entirely, necessitating a strategy to warn users about this upcoming change and guide them towards compliance with the PDF standard.\n\nBased on this analysis, further steps would involve:\n\n- Modifying the default value of `keep_empty` in the `__init__` method to `False` for both `backend_pdf.py` and `backend_pgf.py` files.\n- Adjusting the logic in the `close` method to ensure that empty PDFs are not created when `keep_empty=False`, taking into account the current behavior and any differences between the PDF and PGF backends.\n- Considering a deprecation strategy for the `keep_empty` flag, which might involve warnings when `keep_empty=True` would lead to the creation of an invalid file, and introducing a `suppress_warning` flag for transitional purposes.\n\nThis change will likely require careful documentation and communication with users, as it affects the default behavior of the `PdfPages` class and could impact existing workflows."

        "content": "1. \n\n2. **Bug Locations:**\n\n    - **Location 1:**\n      - **File:** `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py`\n      - **Class:** `PdfPages`\n      - **Method:** `__init__`\n      - **Intended Behavior:** The default value of the `keep_empty` parameter should be changed from `True` to `False`. This modification ensures that by default, `PdfPages` will not generate empty PDF files, aligning with the PDF standard that requires at least one page in a valid PDF document. This change must preserve the ability for users to explicitly set `keep_empty=True` if they desire, until its complete deprecation.\n    \n    - **Location 2:**\n      - **File:** `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py`\n      - **Class:** `PdfPages`\n      - **Method:** `close`\n      - **Intended Behavior:** Update the logic to reflect the new default behavior (`keep_empty=False`). This means that if a PDF file has zero pages, it should not be written to disk unless `keep_empty` has been explicitly set to `True` by the user. Additional consideration should be given to how the removal of the file (in case of zero pages and `keep_empty=False`) is communicated or logged, ensuring clarity for the end-user.\n    \n    - **Location 3:**\n      - **File:** `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pgf.py`\n      - **Class:** `PdfPages`\n      - **Method:** `__init__`\n      - **Intended Behavior:** Similarly, change the default value of `keep_empty` to `False`. Despite the different backend, consistency in how empty PDFs are handled across the project is crucial. This change will ensure that `PdfPages` instances in the PGF backend also do not create invalid zero-page PDF files by default.\n\n    - **Location 4:**\n      - **File:** `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pgf.py`\n      - **Class:** `PdfPages`\n      - **Method:** `close`\n      - **Intended Behavior:** Adjust to prevent the creation of a file when no figures have been added and `keep_empty=False`. This method should similarly respect the user's choice if `keep_empty=True` is explicitly set, maintaining backward compatibility during the deprecation phase. Given that PGF backend might handle file creation differently (especially with the involvement of LaTeX), the logic must ensure that an empty document is not created or saved under the new default configuration.\n\nThis approach addresses the core of the issue: enforcing the PDF standard requirement of at least one page per document while allowing for a transition period where users can adapt to the new behavior. Future documentation and warnings should guide users toward compliance and inform them of the upcoming deprecation of the `keep_empty` parameter."
