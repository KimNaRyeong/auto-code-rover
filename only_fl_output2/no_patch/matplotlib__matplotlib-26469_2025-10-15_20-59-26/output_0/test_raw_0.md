This script attempts to reproduce the issue discussed. If the behavior of `PdfPages` with `keep_empty=False` by default has not been implemented yet, creating an empty PDF would succeed, which according to the issue described, is not the expected behavior. This script will catch that behavior as an `AssertionError` and print the stack trace for debugging purposes. 

**Important Notes:**
- It assumes the issue is "present" if `PdfPages` allows creating an empty PDF with `keep_empty=True`.
- Once the default is changed to `keep_empty=False`, and the code logically prevents empty PDFs from being generated, the assertion should fail to trigger, meaning the issue has been addressed.
- The script may need adjustments based on the exact environment or library versions. This example assumes that `matplotlib` and its PDF backend are installed and functioning as expected.
