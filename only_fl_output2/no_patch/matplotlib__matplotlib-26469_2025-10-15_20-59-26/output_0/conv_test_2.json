        "content": "Here is an issue:\n\nChange PdfPages to default to keep_empty=False and eventually deprecate keep_empty\nPdfPages has an option, `keep_empty`, that sets whether a PdfPages object with *zero* figures is written to the disk at all or not.  This was introduced in #2453; previously PdfPages behaved as if `keep_empty=True` (and this was left the default to maintain backcompat).\r\n\r\nIn fact, a pdf file with zero pages is simply not a valid pdf document.  See e.g. the pdf standard (https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf) p. 33: \"A PDF document consists of a collection of objects that together describe the appearance of *one or more pages*...\" (emphasis mine).  Or one can simply check that the empty file created by `PdfPages(\"/tmp/foo.pdf\").close()` is indeed deemed invalid (error-on-open) by at least Acrobat, mupdf, and xpdf.\r\n\r\nThus I propose to eventually stop generating such invalid files at all via switching the default value to `keep_empty=False` and eventually killing the kwarg (deprecation strategy TBD, perhaps warn (with a suppress_warning kwarg) if such a file would have been created, yada yada).\r\n\r\n(Apparently multipage support in mplcairo is getting used, and cairo cannot generate zero-page pdfs, so that's how I found out about this...)\n"

        "content": "Given the initial misunderstanding and the goal to reproduce the issue specifically related to the handling of `keep_empty` by `PdfPages` in Matplotlib, let's approach this with a correct understanding that the desired behavior is `keep_empty=False` by default. The script should check if the file is not created when no figures are added (reflecting a fixed issue) or if the file still gets created (indicating the presence of the issue). \n\nPlease note, the previous script misinterpreted the check due to an incorrect assertion about the `keep_empty` flag and its expected effects. Here's an updated version designed to accurately test the behavior, considering the feedback:\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\nimport matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf as pdf_backend\nimport os\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef test_pdfpages_keep_empty_behavior():\n    output_filename = \"test_output.pdf\"\n\n    try:\n        # Intentionally not using the keep_empty argument to test the default behavior\n        with pdf_backend.PdfPages(output_filename) as pdf:\n            pass  # Implicitly tests the default behavior of keep_empty\n\n        # The issue states that an empty PDF should not be created by default\n        # So, if it exists, the behavior hasn't been fixed\n        is_file_created = os.path.exists(output_filename)\n        assert not is_file_created, \"Empty PDF was created; the default behavior might not be keep_empty=False.\"\n\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(0)  # Exit with 0 to indicate the issue is reproduced when an AssertionError occurs\n\n    finally:\n        # Cleanup: remove the created file if it was created\n        if os.path.exists(output_filename):\n            os.remove(output_filename)\n\n    print(\"The issue has been fixed.\")  # Printed if the AssertionError is not raised\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_pdfpages_keep_empty_behavior()\n```\n\nThis script specifically checks for the presence of the empty PDF file as a means to verify if the default `keep_empty` behavior is indeed `False`, as proposed for future releases. If the file does not exist, it conclusively indicates the default behavior has been successfully set to `keep_empty=False`, or the issue has been fixed, thereby not reproducing the issue and exiting normally. If an error occurs indicating the file does exist, it prints the stack trace and exits with code 0, signaling that the issue is present.\n\nRemember, the actual implementation of checking the PDF's validity is not included in this script. It uses file existence as a proxy to determine the state of `keep_empty` behavior."
