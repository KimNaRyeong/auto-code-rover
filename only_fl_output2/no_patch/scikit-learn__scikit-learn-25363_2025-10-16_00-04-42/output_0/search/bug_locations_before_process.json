        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior here is to ensure that configurations, especially those crucial for the operation of Parallel executed tasks, are explicitly passed to each delayed call. This might require wrapping the delayed function calls within a context that ensures the current configuration state is captured and then applied within each parallelly executed task. In essence, the fix involves ensuring that any configuration context is not just assumed but is explicitly conveyed and reconstructed within each task's execution environment."

This may include augmenting the delayed call to ensure it carries over or applies the current configuration settings within each executed task, preventing misconfigurations when tasks run in threads/processes different from the main thread initializing them."
