It makes sure that it will turn into an error if we forget to pass the config to `delayed`. The code will still be working if `joblib` decides to provide a way to provide a `context` and a `config`.\n</issue>"

        "content": "For analyzing and resolving the issue involving passing explicit configuration to `delayed` in a context related to `Parallel` execution possibly with `joblib`, the following API calls are relevant:\n\n1. To understand how `Parallel` is being used and possibly where `delayed` is involved, I will search for occurrences of `Parallel` and `delayed` in the codebase:\n   - `search_code(\"Parallel(\")`\n   - `search_code(\"delayed(\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a configuration that is obtained by a thread and explicitly passed, it's crucial to locate the part of the code responsible for handling configuration or context management for parallel execution. Therefore, finding where a configuration or context may be set or obtained is necessary:\n   - `search_code(\"config\")`\n   - `search_code(\"context\")`\n\n3. Given the mention of scikit-learn and the potential issue related to different threads, it's plausible there's specific interaction or integration code with scikit-learn that needs to be reviewed. Therefore, it could be worthwhile to look for explicit mentions of scikit-learn, although without a direct API or specific function name, this may be a broader search:\n   - `search_code(\"scikit-learn\")`\n\n4. To ensure completeness, since the issue mentions raising a warning if the configuration is not passed correctly, searching for the implementation of this warning could provide insight into where the checks are made:\n   - `search_code(\"warning\")`\n\nPlease execute these API calls to gather the necessary code context to address the issue effectively."
