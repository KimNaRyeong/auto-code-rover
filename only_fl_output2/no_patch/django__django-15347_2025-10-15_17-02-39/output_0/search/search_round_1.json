This is because MessageEncoder checks for the truthyness of extra_tags rather than checking it is not None.\nTo replicate this bug\n>>> from django.conf import settings\n>>> settings.configure() # Just to allow the following import\n>>> from django.contrib.messages.storage.base import Message\n>>> from django.contrib.messages.storage.cookie import MessageEncoder, MessageDecoder\n>>> original_message = Message(10, \"Here is a message\", extra_tags=\"\")\n>>> encoded_message = MessageEncoder().encode(original_message)\n>>> decoded_message = MessageDecoder().decode(encoded_message)\n>>> original_message.extra_tags == \"\"\nTrue\n>>> decoded_message.extra_tags is None\nTrue\nEffect of the bug in application behaviour\nThis error occurred in the wild with a template tag similar to the following:\n{% if x not in message.extra_tags %}\nWhen the message was displayed as part of a redirect, it had been serialised and deserialized which meant that extra_tags was None instead of the empty string. This caused an error.\nIt's important to note that this bug affects all of the standard API (messages.debug, messages.info etc. all have a default value of extra_tags equal to \"\").\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analyzing Collected Context\n\n#### Class: `Message`\nThe `Message` class, located in `django/contrib/messages/storage/base.py`, is fundamental in constructing messages with a level, message text, and `extra_tags`. The initializer `__init__` accepts `extra_tags` with a default value of `None`. This class's design serves as the basis for how messages are structured across Django's messaging framework.\n\n**Relation to the bug:** \nWhile the `Message` class accepts `extra_tags` and likely processes it appropriately within the Django framework, the bug description indicates a problem when serializing and deserializing these objects, particularly with `extra_tags` becoming `None` when originally an empty string. Given the issue description and the class's role, we can infer that while the class correctly handles `extra_tags`, the serialization process needs to be examined closely, especially in `MessageEncoder` and `MessageDecoder`.\n\n#### Classes: `MessageEncoder` and `MessageDecoder`\nThese classes, found in `django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py`, handle the serialization (`MessageEncoder`) and deserialization (`MessageDecoder`) of `Message` instances for cookie storage.\n\n- **MessageEncoder:** It didn't explicitly show an `encode` method within the provided context, indicating the custom encoding may largely depend on the overridden `default` method not detailed in the results. This method is crucial for transforming `Message` objects into a JSON serializable format.\n\n- **MessageDecoder:** The `decode` method (lines 45-47) extends `json.JSONDecoder.decode`, processing the decoded message through `process_messages`. This is significant because the issue arises during the deserialization process, specifically when `extra_tags=\"\"` transforms into `None`.\n\n**Relation to the bug and intended behavior:**\n1. **What they do:** These components encode a `Message` object into a JSON-compatible format and decode it back into a `Message` object, respectively.\n2. **Relationship to the bug:** Given the bug revolves around the incorrect handling of `extra_tags` during the serialization/deserialization process, `MessageEncoder` needs to ensure `extra_tags` is serialized correctly, and `MessageDecoder` should accurately restore `extra_tags` to its original state, be it `None` or an empty string.\n3. **Intended behavior:** The intended behavior would be for `MessageEncoder` to serialize `Message` objects without changing the logical representation of its attributes (empty strings should remain so), and for `MessageDecoder` to reconstruct the object fully respecting the original `extra_tags` value, distinguishing between `None` and empty strings.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the missing context on how `MessageEncoder` specifically handles the encoding and what modifications might be needed to address the issue, as well as more details on `MessageDecoder`'s `process_messages` method, we should look further into:\n\n1. `MessageEncoder`'s `default` method (or any method responsible for handling `extra_tags` during serialization).\n2. `MessageDecoder`'s `process_messages` method to understand how `extra_tags` are reconstructed.\n\nTherefore, necessary follow-up API calls include:\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"default\", \"MessageEncoder\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"process_messages\", \"MessageDecoder\")`"

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

This might involve modifying the serialization process to distinguish between `None` and an empty string, ensuring `extra_tags=\"\"` does not become `None` after serialization and deserialization.\n\n   **Location 2:**\n   - **File:** `django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py`\n   - **Class:** `MessageDecoder`\n   - **Method:** `process_messages`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** The `process_messages` method should include logic to correctly handle `extra_tags` during the deserialization process, ensuring that if an `extra_tags` was serialized as an empty string, it is deserialized back to an empty string, not `None`. This might involve checking the serialized data for a specific placeholder or marker that indicates an empty string versus `None`."
