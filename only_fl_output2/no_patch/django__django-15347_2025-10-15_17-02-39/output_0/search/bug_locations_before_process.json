This could involve replacing the truthy check in line 22 with a condition that checks if `extra_tags` is not `None`. This would ensure that `extra_tags` is serialized as an empty string (\"\") rather than being omitted, which currently leads to it being interpreted as `None` upon deserialization."

This may involve altering how `Message` instances are reconstructed from the serialized list, ensuring that when `extra_tags` is supposed to be an empty string, it's explicitly handled and set as such, instead of defaulting to `None`."
