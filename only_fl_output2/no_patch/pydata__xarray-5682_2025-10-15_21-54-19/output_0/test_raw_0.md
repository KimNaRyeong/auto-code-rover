To address your request, I've created a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that attempts to reproduce the given issue involving the incorrect rendering of complex LaTeX expressions in `long_name`s when plotting with xarray. When the issue is present, it will use the provided `print_stacktrace` function to print a stack trace. If fixed, it should exit with code 0 without raising any assertions.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    import xarray as xr
    da = xr.DataArray(range(5), dims="x", coords=dict(x=range(5)))
    name = r"$Ra_s = \mathrm{mean}(\epsilon_k) / \mu M^2_\infty$"
    da.x.attrs['long_name'] = name
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    da.plot(ax=ax)

    # Now check if the xlabel is rendered correctly (matplotlib likely needs a renderer to actually render text)
    renderer = fig.canvas.get_renderer()
    
    xlabel_text = ax.get_xlabel()
    expected_string = name  # The exact LaTeX string

    try:
        assert xlabel_text == expected_string, "Latex expression not rendered correctly in xarray plot."
        print("Issue fixed, LaTeX expression rendered correctly.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This script first tries to plot a variable with a `long_name` set to a complex LaTeX expression using xarray. Then, it checks if the label (which should contain the LaTeX expression) has been correctly rendered by comparing the label text with the expected LaTeX string. If the expression is not correctly rendered, it will assert and print a stack trace using the `print_stacktrace` function. If the issue is fixed, it will print a confirmation message and exit with code 0. 

Since matplotlib's renderer may require an actual graphical environment to render and measure text (which might not be present in all environments, such as headless servers), the script assumes labels are processed directly into their text representations, which might not accurately capture all cases where LaTeX rendering is involved. Adjustments might be necessary based on the specifics of the rendering environment and the nature of the issue.
