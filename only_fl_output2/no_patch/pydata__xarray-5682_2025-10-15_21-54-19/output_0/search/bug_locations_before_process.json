This means specifically checking for attributes that contain LaTeX strings and ensuring that matplotlib's rendering engine is explicitly instructed to interpret them as LaTeX. This may involve ensuring that the text properties passed to matplotlib plotting functions (like `xlabel`) correctly signal matplotlib to render the text as LaTeX, potentially by setting appropriate rcParams or directly formatting text labels."

When attributes are extracted and processed for plotting labels, the code should ensure that LaTeX strings are recognized and retained in a format that matplotlib can render as LaTeX. This could involve detecting LaTeX in strings and ensuring they are formatted correctly for matplotlib (e.g., wrapping in `$` if not already done so) and not escaping special characters accidentally."
