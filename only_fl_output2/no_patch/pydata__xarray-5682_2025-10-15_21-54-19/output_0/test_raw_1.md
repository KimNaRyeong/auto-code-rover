Given the requirement to adjust the script for accurate reproducibility of the issue, let's rewrite the `reproducer.py` considering the specific details that need addressing. The updated script will again attempt to plot complex LaTeX expressions in `long_name`s with xarray, aiming to demonstrate whether these expressions are rendered correctly or not.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    import xarray as xr
    da = xr.DataArray(np.random.rand(5), dims="x", coords=dict(x=range(5)))
    name = r"$Ra_s = \frac{\mathrm{mean}(\epsilon_k)}{\mu M^2_\infty}$"
    da.x.attrs['long_name'] = name
    
    plt.figure()
    da.plot()
    
    try:
        # Trying to capture the very last figure to access its axes
        fig = plt.gcf()
        ax = fig.axes[0] if fig.axes else None
        if ax:
            xlabel_text = ax.get_xlabel()
            assert xlabel_text == name, "LaTeX expression not correctly rendered in xarray plot."
            print("Issue not present, expected behavior verified.")
            exit(0)
        else:
            raise Exception("No axes found in the plot.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revision emphasizes capturing the plot's axes after plotting with xarray to verify the `xlabel` rendering directly. Please note, since graphical rendering of LaTeX might not complete until the plot is drawn (possibly requiring a display environment), asserting directly on the text content may not always accurately capture LaTeX rendering issues. Consideration of environment-specific factors such as display availability and the functionality of the backend renderer is essential when encountering discrepancies in LaTeX handling between different plotting interfaces or libraries.
