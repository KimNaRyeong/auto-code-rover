        "intended_behavior": "Modify the initialization method of `CharField` to conditionally append `MaxLengthValidator` to the list of validators only if `max_length` is not `None`. This ensures that a `MaxLengthValidator` is only attached when a maximum length is specified, preventing the instantiation of unnecessary validators which cause inefficiency and potential errors when `max_length` is not applicable, such as when a `CharField` is dynamically created without a maximum length by `Value._resolve_output_field`. This change preserves the functionality of enforcing maximum length where specified while optimizing performance and correctness in cases where it is not."
