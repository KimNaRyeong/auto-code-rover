        "intended_behavior": "Before the creation of the `ArrayDataset64` instance, the function `make_dataset` should ensure that the input array `X` is C-contiguous. This could be achieved by incorporating a check or conversion step using `check_array` from `sklearn.utils.validation`. The check should enforce C-contiguity (`order='C'`) and convert the array if necessary. This validation step should be integrated in such a way that it preserves the current functionality for all input types, including both sparse and dense arrays, without altering the intended flow or output of the function. It should be a seamless preprocessing check specifically for the scikit-learn's internal requirements when dealing with dense data arrays, especially when the `sag` solver is used which might not handle non-C-contiguous arrays well. This step would rectify the `ValueError: ndarray is not C-contiguous` encountered, ensuring compatibility and preventing the error for any similar future scenarios where data may not inherently be in the required format."
