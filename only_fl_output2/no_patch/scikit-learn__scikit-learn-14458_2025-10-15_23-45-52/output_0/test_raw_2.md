Certainly, I'll create an improved standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` for the direct execution. This script will specifically aim to reproduce the issue related to the non-C-contiguous array error when fitting a Ridge regression model using the `sag` solver. The script raises an `AssertionError` if the issue occurs and prints a detailed stack trace. It will exit with code 0 upon a successful fix of the issue.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
    from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
    import pandas as pd

    try:
        # Attempt to fetch a dataset and select specific numerical columns
        census = fetch_openml(data_id=534, as_frame=True)
        X, y = census.data, census.target
        numerical_cols = ['AGE', 'EDUCATION', 'EXPERIENCE']

        # Transform the DataFrame to ensure it's not C-contiguous
        # This mimics the potential state of data that can lead to the issue.
        X_selected = X[numerical_cols]
        X_discontiguous = pd.DataFrame(X_selected.to_numpy(), columns=numerical_cols)

        # Attempt to fit the model which may lead to ValueError if the input array is not C-contiguous
        model = Ridge(solver='sag').fit(X_discontiguous, y)

        # If the problem is fixed, the following line will execute.
        print("Success: Issue regarding C-contiguity seems to be resolved.")
        exit(0)

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Check for the specific error related to C-contiguity to confirm the issue.
        assert "ndarray is not C-contiguous" in str(e), "Unexpected error, was looking for C-contiguity issue."
        print("AssertionError: Detected the non-C-contiguous array issue as expected.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script is specifically designed to identify and assert the non-C-contiguous array issue when attempting to fit a Ridge regression model with the `sag` solver on selected numerical columns from a dataset. It uses the `print_stacktrace` function to cleanly output any traceback, adhering to the requirements for readability and precise error identification. In case the issue has been resolved (no error is raised by the `.fit()` method), the script will acknowledge the success and terminate with a 0 exit code.
