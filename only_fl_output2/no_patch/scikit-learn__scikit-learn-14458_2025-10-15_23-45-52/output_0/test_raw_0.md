Below is the standalone `reproducer.py` file designed to replicate the reported issue. Make sure to execute this script in the root directory of your project with `python3 reproducer.py`. The script will assert the presence of the issue by expecting an `AssertionError` when the reported problem occurs. If the issue is fixed (meaning no error upon execution), the script will exit normally with code 0 after printing a relevant message. In case of an error, it utilizes the provided `print_stacktrace` function for clearer visibility of the traceback.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
    from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge

    try:
        census = fetch_openml(data_id=534, as_frame=True)
        X, y = census.data, census.target
        numerical_cols = ['AGE', 'EDUCATION', 'EXPERIENCE']
        model = Ridge(solver='sag').fit(X[numerical_cols], y)
        print("Issue seems to be fixed, exiting with code 0.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert isinstance(e, ValueError), "The error is expected to be a ValueError related to non C-contiguous arrays."
        if "ndarray is not C-contiguous" in str(e):
            print("Reproduced the reported issue successfully. Please proceed with the fix.")
        else:
            print("Encountered an unexpected error, not related to the reported issue.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script is crafted to specifically catch and assert the `ValueError` relating to non-C-contiguous ndarray issues. If the error matches the one reported, it acknowledges successful reproduction of the issue; otherwise, it advises further investigation for unrelated errors.
