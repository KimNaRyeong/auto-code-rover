The code should explicitly differentiate between `fields` being `None` (which means no filtering is applied and all fields should be included) and `fields` being an empty list (which implies that no fields are requested). Therefore, the condition `if fields and f.name not in fields:` should be updated to `if fields is not None and f.name not in fields:`. This change ensures that if `model_to_dict` is called with `fields=[]`, it returns an empty dictionary, reflecting the caller's intention to include no fields."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to the `model_to_dict` function, the `_save_m2m` method's handling of the `fields` parameter needs to be updated for consistency and to avoid potential future issues. The condition `if fields and f.name not in fields:` should be revised to `if fields is not None and f.name not in fields:`. This adjustment ensures that specifying an empty list for `fields` explicitly excludes all fields, aligning the method's behavior with the corrected logic in `model_to_dict` and other parts of the codebase that correctly differentiate between `None` and an empty list for the `fields` parameter."
