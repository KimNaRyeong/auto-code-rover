        "content": "Given the description of the issue, we are dealing with a function named `model_to_dict` that should behave differently when called with an empty list for the `fields` parameter. The problem arises from a conditional check in the function. To properly address this issue and gather the necessary context, we'll need to know where `model_to_dict` is implemented, inspect its current implementation, and understand how it is supposed to handle the `fields` parameter. \n\nHere are the API calls I'd like to make to gather the required context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"model_to_dict\")` - This will help us find where the method is defined in the codebase.\n2. `search_code(\"if fields and f.name not in fields:\")` - We specifically look for the problematic condition mentioned in the issue to locate the exact part of the code that needs modification.\n3. `search_code(\"if fields is not None and f.name not in fields:\")` - Although this is the proposed solution, searching for this snippet will help us check if similar logic is applied elsewhere in the codebase or if there's any prior attempt or related solution in the context of handling empty parameters."
