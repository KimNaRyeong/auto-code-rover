Acknowledging your request for a refined attempt, I'm drafting a revised `reproducer.py` script. This script aims directly to demonstrate the reported issue with specific attention to triggering an `AssertionError` if the script manages to reproduce the inconsistency you've observed. The issue pertains to the handling of symbolic substitutions involving infinity (`oo`) with SymPy, and different outcomes between expressions that are seemingly similar in their expected behavior towards infinity.

```python
import sympy as sp

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_incorrect_evaluation():
    x = sp.symbols('x')
    expr1 = (x + sp.cos(x)).subs(x, sp.oo)
    expr2 = (sp.exp(x) + sp.cos(x)).subs(x, sp.oo)
    try:
        # The expected behavior is for both expressions to ideally resolve in a manner reflecting their limit at infinity.
        # The assertion below checks expr1 directly against oo, its most straightforward expectation.
        assert expr1 == sp.oo, f"Incorrect evaluation for x + cos(x) at infinity: {expr1}"
        
        # For expr2, the expectation might involve more nuanced handling, but for consistency and clarity in reproducing the issue:
        # We are checking against the failure to resolve to a finite or meaningful limit rather than a specific outcome based on the earlier attempt discussion.
        assert expr2 != sp.AccumBounds(-sp.oo, sp.oo), f"Expression exp(x) + cos(x) should not return AccumBounds at infinity, got: {expr2}"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_incorrect_evaluation()
```

The intention here is to closely examine why `(x + cos(x)).subs(x, oo)` returns `oo` directly, aligning with expectations, whereas `(exp(x) + cos(x)).subs(x, oo)` diverges into an `AccumBounds` response, which might not align with intuitive expectations for behavior at infinity.

Execution of this script should:

- Verify the proper handling or mis-handling of infinite substitutions within SymPy expressions.
- Raise and present detailed traceback information for an `AssertionError` if the substitutions deviate from expected results.
- Exit with a code signaling error (non-zero) when the issue is present, and a normal exit (code 0) if and when the issue is resolved or if the behavior is as expected.

Please replace the specific assertion for `expr2` with the appropriate logic reflecting the correct behavior or outcome as needed for your context or for what you're specifically testing against.
