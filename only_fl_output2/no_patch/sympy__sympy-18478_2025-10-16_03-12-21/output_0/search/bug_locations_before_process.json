The intended behavior here is to ensure consistency in how expressions involving infinity are simplified or evaluated, possibly by refining how mathematical functions like `exp` and `cos` handle substitutions involving `oo`. This might involve checking if additional conditions or special handling for infinite substitutions need to be integrated into the `.subs()` method to accommodate the mathematical properties of these functions consistently."

Since `cos(x)` doesn't have a limit as `x` approaches infinity, the substitution might either need to prevent simplistic numerical evaluations or work cohesively with constructs like `AccumBounds` to present a result that accurately represents the function's behavior at infinity."
