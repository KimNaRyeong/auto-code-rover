        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the `.subs()` method works, specifically when it is used with infinite values like `oo` (which represents infinity in SymPy), and how it interacts with different types of functions, such as `x + cos(x)` and `exp(x) + cos(x)`. It's also crucial to understand why the substitution of `x` with infinity (`oo`) results in `oo` for the first expression and `AccumBounds` for the second. This suggests that there could be varying handling mechanisms for different functions or a potential inconsistency in evaluating limits or infinite values within the `.subs()` method or the related evaluation routines.\n\nTo gather more context on how these are implemented or processed, we should look at the definitions and implementations of the `.subs()` method, the handling of expressions involving infinity, and possibly the implementation of `exp`, `cos`, and their behavior when `x` is substituted with `oo`. Additionally, understanding where `AccumBounds` comes from will also be helpful.\n\nGiven these needs, the following API calls will help gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the `.subs()` method in the entire codebase.**\n   - This will help understand its general implementation and if there are any specific branches or logic for handling expressions with infinity.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"subs\")\n```\n\n2. **Search for the class definitions of `exp` and `cos` functions.**\n   - This will provide insights into how these mathematical functions are implemented and if they have special handling for when their arguments tend towards infinity.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"exp\")\nsearch_class(\"cos\")\n```\n\n3. **Search for any code snippets involving `AccumBounds`.**\n   - Since `AccumBounds` is the result for one of the expressions involving infinity, it's important to understand how and when it is used within the codebase.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"AccumBounds\")\n```\n\n4. **Search for the implementation of Infinity (`oo`).**\n   - Understanding how infinity is represented and handled can shed light on why substituting `x` with `oo` behaves differently across expressions.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"oo\")\n```\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive context surrounding the handling of `.subs()` with infinite values, how mathematical functions are evaluated at infinity, and why there's a difference in the output for similar expressions involving `oo`."
