Certainly, I will prepare a `reproducer.py` script that will demonstrate the issue as you've described. It should attempt to perform symbolic substitutions using `sympy`, and it will check if the results match the expected behaviorâ€”if not, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace.

```python
import sympy as sp

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_subs_infinity():
    x = sp.symbols('x')
    expr1 = x + sp.cos(x)
    expr2 = sp.exp(x) + sp.cos(x)
    
    result1 = expr1.subs(x, sp.oo)
    result2 = expr2.subs(x, sp.oo)
    
    try:
        assert result1 == sp.oo, "For (x + cos(x)).subs(x, oo), expected oo but got {}".format(result1)
        assert isinstance(result2, sp.AccumBounds), "For (exp(x) + cos(x)).subs(x, oo), expected an AccumBounds instance but got {}".format(type(result2))
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_subs_infinity()
```

This script will:

1. Define two expressions, `(x + cos(x))` and `(exp(x) + cos(x))`.
2. Substitute `x` with `oo` (infinity) in both expressions.
3. Check if the first substitution results in `oo` and if the second results in an `AccumBounds` instance, which is the expected behavior to indicate that the limit cannot be determined precisely.
4. If the condition is not met, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function.

To run this script, you should place it in the root directory of your project and execute it with Python 3. If the issue exists as described, it will terminate with an error and provide a stack trace. Once the issue is addressed in the software (e.g., `sympy` in this case), the assertions should pass, and the script should complete without errors, exiting with code 0.
