This script aims directly to demonstrate the reported issue with specific attention to triggering an `AssertionError` if the script manages to reproduce the inconsistency you've observed. The issue pertains to the handling of symbolic substitutions involving infinity (`oo`) with SymPy, and different outcomes between expressions that are seemingly similar in their expected behavior towards infinity.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef test_incorrect_evaluation():\n    x = sp.symbols('x')\n    expr1 = (x + sp.cos(x)).subs(x, sp.oo)\n    expr2 = (sp.exp(x) + sp.cos(x)).subs(x, sp.oo)\n    try:\n        # The expected behavior is for both expressions to ideally resolve in a manner reflecting their limit at infinity.\n        # The assertion below checks expr1 directly against oo, its most straightforward expectation.\n        assert expr1 == sp.oo, f\"Incorrect evaluation for x + cos(x) at infinity: {expr1}\"\n        \n        # For expr2, the expectation might involve more nuanced handling, but for consistency and clarity in reproducing the issue:\n        # We are checking against the failure to resolve to a finite or meaningful limit rather than a specific outcome based on the earlier attempt discussion.\n        assert expr2 != sp.AccumBounds(-sp.oo, sp.oo), f\"Expression exp(x) + cos(x) should not return AccumBounds at infinity, got: {expr2}\"\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_incorrect_evaluation()\n```\n\nThe intention here is to closely examine why `(x + cos(x)).subs(x, oo)` returns `oo` directly, aligning with expectations, whereas `(exp(x) + cos(x)).subs(x, oo)` diverges into an `AccumBounds` response, which might not align with intuitive expectations for behavior at infinity.\n\nExecution of this script should:\n\n- Verify the proper handling or mis-handling of infinite substitutions within SymPy expressions.\n- Raise and present detailed traceback information for an `AssertionError` if the substitutions deviate from expected results.\n- Exit with a code signaling error (non-zero) when the issue is present, and a normal exit (code 0) if and when the issue is resolved or if the behavior is as expected.\n\nPlease replace the specific assertion for `expr2` with the appropriate logic reflecting the correct behavior or outcome as needed for your context or for what you're specifically testing against."
