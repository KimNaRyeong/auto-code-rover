Understood, I'll reconstruct the `reproducer.py` Python script with a direct focus on reproducing and validating the specific issue you've presented:

```python
import sympy as sp

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_expression_evaluation():
    x = sp.symbols('x')
    
    # Evaluating (x + cos(x)) at infinity
    expr1_result = (x + sp.cos(x)).subs(x, sp.oo)
    
    # Evaluating (exp(x) + cos(x)) at infinity
    expr2_result = (sp.exp(x) + sp.cos(x)).subs(x, sp.oo)
    
    try:
        # Check if the first evaluation gives oo as expected
        assert expr1_result == sp.oo, f"(x + cos(x)).subs(x,oo) evaluation resulted in {expr1_result}, expected oo"
        
        # Check if the second evaluation does not return AccumBounds, as that would indicate inconsistency
        assert expr2_result != sp.AccumBounds(-sp.oo, sp.oo), f"(exp(x) + cos(x)).subs(x,oo) evaluation resulted in {expr2_result}, expected a specific value or oo, not AccumBounds"
        
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise
    else:
        print("All tests passed successfully.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_expression_evaluation()
```

The objective of this script is to specifically evaluate and highlight the discrepancy in handling substitutions involving infinity `oo` with Sympy, for the given expressions. The assertion errors are designed to trigger if the outcomes do not align with expected or consistent behavior:

1. `(x + cos(x)).subs(x,oo)` should ideally result in `oo`.
2. `(exp(x) + cos(x)).subs(x,oo)` should not result in `AccumBounds` if we are expecting a defined behavior similar to the first expression.

It's important to remember that Python and the libraries utilized, such as SymPy, are in constant development. Discrepancies like these could stem from temporary inconsistencies or intended behavior that necessitates closer investigation.
