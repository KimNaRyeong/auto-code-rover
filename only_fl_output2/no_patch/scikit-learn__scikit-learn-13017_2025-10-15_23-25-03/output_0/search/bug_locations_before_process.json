        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `fit_transform` method, or more specifically the underlying mechanisms it depends on for column indexing, should be adjusted to consistently handle negative indexes. The existing functionality allows for columns to be specified using positive indexes, which the method processes to apply transformations correctly. The behavior should be extended to correctly interpret negative indexes as counting from the end of the array or DataFrame, aligning it with common Python indexing semantics.\n\nThis means that if a negative index is specified, the method should translate this to the corresponding positive index based on the total number of columns before invoking any transformations. This adjustment ensures that negative indexes lead to the same results as their positive counterparts, preserving the method's intent and functionality of transforming specified columns.\n\nPossible Steps for Resolution:\n- Implement a pre-check or conversion within the `_validate_column_callables` or another appropriate preprocessing step to interpret negative indexes correctly.\n- Ensure that any index conversion or validation does not disrupt the handling of other valid column specifiers, such as column names in a DataFrame or callable selectors.\n- Comprehensive testing should be conducted to verify that the intended behavior is achieved without introducing regressions or affecting performance notably."
