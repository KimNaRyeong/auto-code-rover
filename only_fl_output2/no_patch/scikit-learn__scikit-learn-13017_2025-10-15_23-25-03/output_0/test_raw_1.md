Based on the instructions and the previous issues, it seems the error is not directly related to the issue you're hoping to reproduce but rather to a problem with the scikit-learn build environment in the provided execution context. However, I'll provide an updated version of the `reproducer.py` script that follows your guidelines and includes the correct handling to print a stack trace upon encountering an `AssertionError`, which would be raised if the behavior discrepancy specified in the provided issue persists. If there were any issues with the library import or environment itself, those should be resolved by ensuring scikit-learn is correctly installed and built within the environment where the script is executed.

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

def main():
    try:
        X = np.random.randn(2, 2)
        X_categories = np.array([[1], [2]])
        X = np.concatenate([X, X_categories], axis=1)

        ohe = OneHotEncoder(categories='auto')
        tf_1 = ColumnTransformer([('ohe', ohe, [-1])], remainder='passthrough')
        result_with_negative_index = tf_1.fit_transform(X)

        tf_2 = ColumnTransformer([('ohe', ohe, [2])], remainder='passthrough')
        result_with_positive_index = tf_2.fit_transform(X)

        # Validate if the result shape differs, which is part of the reported issue
        if result_with_negative_index.shape[1] != result_with_positive_index.shape[1]:
            raise AssertionError("ColumnTransformer results with negative index don't match positive index result shapes")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    else:
        print("No issue detected.")
        exit(0)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script will attempt to reproduce the issue as described by comparing the shapes of the results produced by `ColumnTransformer` when using negative versus positive column indexing. Please ensure that your Python environment has scikit-learn correctly installed and built to avoid the previously encountered module import errors.
