        "intended_behavior": "The `new_method_proxy` function should be modified to ensure the existence of the method on the wrapped object before attempting to call it. After the `_setup` method is triggered and before executing `return func(self._wrapped, *args)`, an additional check should be introduced to verify that `func` is indeed an attribute or method of `self._wrapped` and is callable. If the check fails, meaning the `func` does not exist on `self._wrapped` or is not callable, `new_method_proxy` should raise a descriptive exception or handle the case gracefully in a way that avoids misleading the user into thinking an operation is supported when it's not. This could involve returning `NotImplementedError`, `AttributeError`, or a custom, informative error message specifying that the method is unsupported by the wrapped object. This modification aims to respond directly to the problem described in the issue: it prevents `TypeError` when accessing methods via `LazyObject` that don't exist on the wrapped object."
