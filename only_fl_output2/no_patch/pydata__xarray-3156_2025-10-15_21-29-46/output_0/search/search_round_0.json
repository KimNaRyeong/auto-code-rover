It should raise a more meaningful error.\nIn particular, I had this issue in a function I was calling inside of a generator, so the StopIteration just broke out of the generator and it took some digging to figure out what was going wrong in my code.\n#### Output of ``xr.show_versions()``\n<details>\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\n------------------\ncommit: None\npython: 3.6.5.final.0\npython-bits: 64\nOS: Linux\nOS-release: 3.10.0-862.14.4.el7.x86_64\nmachine: x86_64\nprocessor: x86_64\nbyteorder: little\nLC_ALL: None\nLANG: en_US.utf8\nLOCALE: en_US.UTF-8\nxarray: 0.10.7\npandas: 0.23.0\nnumpy: 1.14.3\nscipy: 1.1.0\nnetCDF4: 1.4.0\nh5netcdf: 0.6.1\nh5py: 2.7.1\nNio: None\nzarr: None\nbottleneck: 1.2.1\ncyordereddict: None\ndask: 0.17.5\ndistributed: 1.21.8\nmatplotlib: 2.2.2\ncartopy: None\nseaborn: 0.8.1\nsetuptools: 39.1.0\npip: 10.0.1\nconda: None\npytest: 3.5.1\nIPython: 6.4.0\nsphinx: 1.7.4\n</details>\n</issue>"

Search for the `groupby` method in the `DataArray` class to see how it operates, especially with empty arrays.\n3. Search for the `mean` method within the context of the result of a `groupby`, which might be another class after the grouping is done.\n\nAPI calls:\n- search_class(\"DataArray\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"groupby\", \"DataArray\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"mean\", \"DataArray\")"
