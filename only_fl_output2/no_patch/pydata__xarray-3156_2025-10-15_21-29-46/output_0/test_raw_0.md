In this script, an attempt is made to replicate the reported issue where using `groupby` on an empty `DataArray` raises a `StopIteration` exception. This behavior is not expected and should ideally raise a more informative error. The script checks for this specific error and uses the provided function to print a detailed stack trace. If a `StopIteration` is caught, it raises an `AssertionError` to indicate the presence of the issue. If a different type of error is caught, it assumes that the behavior might have changed due to a fix or update to the library, prints a message to indicate a possible change, and exits successfully. If no exception is raised, it also considers the issue fixed and exits successfully.
