        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `__init__` method of the `BaseConstraint` class to make `name` and `violation_error_message` keyword-only arguments. This adjustment ensures that any instantiation of `BaseConstraint` or its subclasses explicitly names these parameters, enhancing code readability and maintainability. This change preserves existing functionality by still accepting the same parameters but requires them to be passed as keyword arguments. The modification aims for consistency with the subclassing practices observed across the Django codebase, wherein `name` and `violation_error_message` are already treated as keyword-only arguments."
