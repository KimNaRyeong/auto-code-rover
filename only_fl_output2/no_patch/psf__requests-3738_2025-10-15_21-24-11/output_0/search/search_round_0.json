This may break some more benign uses such as `http+unix`, which wanted to add parameters to their URLs.\nWhile this is inline with our intended policies (we do not understand URLs that have schemes we don't know anything about), this, along with the IDNA behaviour in v2.12.{0,1} will probably have broken a whole bunch of people using these non-standard URL schemes.\nWe should consider whether Session objects should have a registry of places to look for URL preparation based on scheme. This will allow people to opt-in to the HTTP-like processing of URLs, as well as to register their own.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, I will need to first gather some context about where and how URLs are processed within the `Requests` library, especially focusing on how it handles parameters for different URL schemes. The classes and methods that might be relevant include those related to managing sessions and preparing URLs. Given the mention of \"Session objects\" and URL preparation based on scheme, my search will focus around these areas.\n\nHere are the API calls I would make to gather the required context:\n\n1. Search for the `Session` class to understand its structure and any relevant methods that might deal with URL preparation or scheme handling.\n    ```\n    search_class(class_name=\"Session\")\n    ```\n\n2. Since the issue involves the way parameters are added to URLs and might involve methods related to URL preparation or parameter handling, we should look for methods within the `Session` class that could be responsible for this functionality.\n    ```\n    search_method_in_class(method_name=\"prepare_request\", class_name=\"Session\")\n    search_method_in_class(method_name=\"add_params_to_url\", class_name=\"Session\")  # This is a guess; the actual method name might differ.\n    ```\n\n3. The issue description also suggests that there could be a place in the code where it explicitly handles or ignores URL schemes. It might not be directly mentioned with a straightforward method name, so we need to search for a snippet of code that deals with scheme handling. Since we don't have a specific method name for handling schemes, I'll search for a general piece of code that checks URL schemes across the codebase.\n    ```\n    search_code(code_str=\"schemes\")\n    ```\n\n4. Finally, understanding how the `Requests` library decides to ignore or process certain URL schemes might require looking into functions that parse URLs or determine their validity. Searching for such a function or a method might provide insights into how the handling of unknown schemes changed.\n    ```\n    search_method(method_name=\"urlparse\")\n    search_method(method_name=\"parse_url\")\n    ```\n\nThese API calls aim to collect comprehensive context around session management, URL preparation, parameter addition, and scheme handling, which are all relevant to resolving the described issue."
