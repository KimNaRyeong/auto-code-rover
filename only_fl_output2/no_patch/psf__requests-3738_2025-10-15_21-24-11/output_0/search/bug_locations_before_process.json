        "intended_behavior": "This method currently prepares requests by merging session and request configurations, including parameters. To resolve the issue, it should be modified or extended to handle URLs with schemes not traditionally recognized by the requests library (such as `http+unix`). Specifically, there should be a mechanism, perhaps a scheme registry as part of the session or a globally accessible configuration, that allows for the specification of how to treat unknown schemes. This registry could map schemes to a handler that prepares URLs in a manner appropriate for the scheme, including parameter handling. The `prepare_request` method would then check this registry when preparing URLs and apply any registered handlers for unrecognized schemes. The existing functionality for recognized schemes (primarily HTTP and HTTPS) must remain unchanged, ensuring that this extension only expands the library's capabilities without altering its existing behavior."
