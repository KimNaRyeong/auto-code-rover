This may break some more benign uses such as `http+unix`, which wanted to add parameters to their URLs.\nWhile this is inline with our intended policies (we do not understand URLs that have schemes we don't know anything about), this, along with the IDNA behaviour in v2.12.{0,1} will probably have broken a whole bunch of people using these non-standard URL schemes.\nWe should consider whether Session objects should have a registry of places to look for URL preparation based on scheme.

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "### Analyzing the Collected Context\n\n#### 1. `Session` Class Details:\n- **What it does**: The `Session` class in `requests/sessions.py` is central to the Requests library, managing request settings and providing methods for making HTTP requests. It allows for persistent settings across requests and offers convenience methods for different HTTP request types (`get`, `post`, etc.). The `prepare_request` method is of particular interest, as it prepares a `Request` instance for transmission by constructing a `PreparedRequest` object with settings merged from the session.\n- **Relation to the bug**: The issue involves how parameters are added to URLs, especially for unrecognized schemes. The `Session` class, through its `prepare_request` method, plays a pivotal role in preparing requests, which includes handling URL parameters. However, there isn't a direct indication of handling unrecognized URL schemes here.\n- **Intended behavior**: Ideally, the `Session` class or a related component should gracefully handle parameter addition to URLs even with non-standard schemes, possibly through a registry mechanism that allows for opting into HTTP-like processing for custom schemes.\n\n#### 2. `prepare_request` Method:\n- **What it does**: This method constructs a `PreparedRequest` for transmission by merging settings from both the `Request` instance and the `Session` instance. This includes merging cookies, authentication settings, and crucially for this issue, parameters (the `params` setting).\n- **Relation to the bug**: Directly relevant since it deals with preparing URLs (including parameters) for requests. However, it primarily focuses on merging existing session and request configurations without specific handling for different URL schemes.\n- **Intended behavior**: This method should perhaps include or interact with mechanisms that allow unrecognized URL schemes to have their URLs prepared with parameters in a manner similar to recognized schemes, if the user opts in.\n\n#### 3. Search Results for \"schemes\":\n- **Returned several matches across files like `adapters.py`, `utils.py`, `models.py`, and more**: These snippets likely involve parsing, validating, or otherwise working with URL schemes. The presence of matches in multiple components suggests that URL scheme handling is distributed across the library.\n- **Relation to the bug**: Given the distributed nature of scheme handling as indicated by the search results, implementing a registry for URL preparation as suggested in the issue may require modifications or extensions in several places. Specific locations and implementations may dictate how parameters are handled for different schemes.\n- **Intended behavior**: Components involved in URL scheme handling (as found in search results) could interact with a new or modified component responsible for deciding how to prepare URLs based on their scheme, including when to add parameters.\n\n#### 4. `parse_url` Method:\n- **What it does**: Parses a given URL string into its components, with best-effort handling for incomplete URLs. Does not directly modify or prepare URLs but provides a parsed representation.\n- **Relation to the bug**: While not directly modifying URLs, understanding URL parsing is crucial since scheme recognition or lack thereof could influence how parameters are added or processed. Any changes to accommodate unrecognized schemes might require adjustments in how URLs are parsed or interpreted in subsequent processing steps.\n- **Intended behavior**: While `parse_url` itself might not need modification, understanding its output is essential for any part of the library that might decide how to handle unrecognized schemes.\n\n### Next Steps:\nGiven this analysis, it seems clear modifications are needed in how the library handles URLs with unrecognized schemes, possibly by introducing a registry mechanism as suggested in the issue. This could involve extensions or alterations in parts of the code that deal with URL preparation and parameter handling, influenced by URL parsing outputs. Additional context might be necessary specifically around how adapters (`adapters.py`) and utility functions (`utils.py`) handle schemes, as these are likely areas where scheme-specific logic could be introduced or expanded.\n\nFurther investigation could involve diving deeper into the files and code snippets related to scheme handling (`adapters.py`, `utils.py`, etc.) to understand their current mechanism of handling URL schemes and parameters. Since \"add_params_to_url\" was not found, understanding existing mechanisms for parameter addition and how they might be scheme-aware or scheme-agnostic is crucial."

To resolve the issue, it should be modified or extended to handle URLs with schemes not traditionally recognized by the requests library (such as `http+unix`). Specifically, there should be a mechanism, perhaps a scheme registry as part of the session or a globally accessible configuration, that allows for the specification of how to treat unknown schemes. This registry could map schemes to a handler that prepares URLs in a manner appropriate for the scheme, including parameter handling. The `prepare_request` method would then check this registry when preparing URLs and apply any registered handlers for unrecognized schemes. The existing functionality for recognized schemes (primarily HTTP and HTTPS) must remain unchanged, ensuring that this extension only expands the library's capabilities without altering its existing behavior.\n\n**Summary**: The core of the issue lies in the handling of parameter addition to URLs with unrecognized schemes. To address this, we suggest extending the `prepare_request` method inside the `Session` class to consult a registry for handling custom URL schemes. This approach maintains the current functionality for standard schemes while providing a flexible mechanism for extending support to non-standard schemes, aligning with the needs described in the issue."
