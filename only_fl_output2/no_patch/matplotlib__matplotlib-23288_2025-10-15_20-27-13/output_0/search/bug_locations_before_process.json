To resolve the issue, this method needs to be adjusted (or supplemented by changes in lower-level methods/classes it relies on) to accurately calculate and apply the \"QuadPoints\" for the text's clickable area in a PDF, reflecting the text's rotation. While retaining its current functionality for settings where URLs aren't used or rotation isn't applied, it should ensure that when a URL is attached to rotated text, the clickable area is correctly rotated in conjunction with the text for PDF outputs."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to `axes/_axes.py`, the `text` method in `pyplot.py` acts as a wrapper to create text objects, potentially with URLs. Since `pyplot` functions are often entry points for users creating plots in a more procedural manner, it's critical this method also ensures any URLs assigned to text objects respect the rotation of the text in PDF outputs. This might require ensuring that the underlying mechanisms (potentially within matplotlib's backend for PDFs) properly calculate the \"QuadPoints\" or equivalent functionality to define the clickable regions based on text rotation."
