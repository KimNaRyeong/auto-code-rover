QuadPoints\nshall be ignored if any coordinate in the array lies outside the region\nspecified by Rect.\nSo one would also need to provide a larger Rect, which, for viewers not supporting QuadPoints will lead to that the total rectangle outlined by the rotated text will be clickable.\nThis also holds for mathtexts.\n### Operating system\n_No response_\n### Matplotlib Version\nmain\n### Matplotlib Backend\n_No response_\n### Python version\n_No response_\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\ngit checkout\n</issue>"

Here is the plan for our API calls:\n\n1. Since the issue occurs when saving a figure to a PDF, we first need to find the classes and methods involved in the PDF rendering process. We know matplotlib uses a backend mechanism to handle different output formats, including PDF.\n\n2. The issue description points to a key PDF concept, \"QuadPoints\", for specifying clickable regions accurately despite rotations. We should look into the PDF rendering backend to see how URLs are linked to text elements and how the rotation is currently applied to text but not to its clickable area.\n\nGiven these points, our API calls will focus on finding the relevant classes and methods within matplotlib's PDF backend. We'll start by identifying classes related to PDF rendering and text handling, as well as any explicit mentions of handling URLs or \"QuadPoints\".\n\n- **Search for the PDF backend classes**: This provides an entry point to the PDF rendering logic.\n- **Search for methods related to text rendering in the PDF backend**: This helps in finding how text elements are drawn and how URLs might be associated with them.\n- **Search for explicit codes relating to \"QuadPoints\" or URL assignment in text rendering**: This checks if the current implementation already tries to address \"QuadPoints\" or how URLs are linked to text entities, potentially pinpointing where the rotation issue occurs.\n\nLet's start with the following API calls:\n- search_class(\"PDF\")\n- search_method(\"text\")\n- search_code(\"QuadPoints\")\n- search_code(\"url=\")"

        "content": "Analyzing the results from the initial set of API calls gives us the following insights:\n\n1. **PDF Class Search Failure**: The search for a class named \"PDF\" yielded no results. This indicates that the handling of PDFs in matplotlib might not be encapsulated in a single class named \"PDF\" or is organized differently, possibly within a module or a more complex class structure focused on backend rendering.\n\n2. **Text Method Search Results**: The methods named \"text\" are distributed across multiple modules and files within matplotlib. Given their presence in critical files such as `axes3d.py`, `widgets.py`, `figure.py`, `pyplot.py`, and `_axes.py`, it's clear that these methods are fundamental to rendering text elements across various plotting contexts. The bug is directly related to how these `text` methods handle URL linking and rotation, particularly when outputting to PDF. Understanding how text rotation and URL linking are implemented in these methods would be crucial to addressing the bug.\n\n3. **QuadPoints Code Search Failure**: The absence of \"QuadPoints\" in the search result indicates that the current matplotlib implementation doesn't explicitly use QuadPoints for clickable URL areas in PDF outputs. This is a central aspect of the issue since QuadPoints allow for a fine-grained definition of clickable areas that respect text rotation.\n\n4. **URL Assignment Code Snippets**: The code snippets containing `url=` are found in different parts of the codebase, including `pyplot.py` and `_axes.py`. These locations are promising since they may reveal how URLs are attached to text objects and whether these methods consider the rotation of the text or simply apply URLs based on the non-rotated bounding box.\n\nGiven these insights, the next steps should focus on understanding the implementation details of how matplotlib handles text rendering to PDF with URLs. Here's how we can proceed with additional API calls:\n\n- Since there's no direct class named \"PDF\", it's likely the PDF rendering functionality is part of matplotlib's backend architecture. We should search for files or modules specifically related to the PDF backend. For matplotlib, backends are often named with a pattern like `backend_<format>.py`. Let's look for files related to the PDF backend specifically.\n- Dive deeper into the `text` methods in `_axes.py` and `pyplot.py` where URL assignments are found, to see how text objects are created and manipulated, especially focusing on properties like rotation and URL linking.\n\nWe'll need to adjust our API calls to gather this specific information:\n- search_code_in_file(\"PDF\", \"lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py\")\n- search_method_in_file(\"text\", \"lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py\")\n- search_method_in_file(\"text\", \"lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py\")"

To resolve the issue, this method needs to be adjusted (or supplemented by changes in lower-level methods/classes it relies on) to accurately calculate and apply the \"QuadPoints\" for the text's clickable area in a PDF, reflecting the text's rotation. While retaining its current functionality for settings where URLs aren't used or rotation isn't applied, it should ensure that when a URL is attached to rotated text, the clickable area is correctly rotated in conjunction with the text for PDF outputs.\n\n- **Location 2: File: lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py, Method: text**\n    - **Intended Behavior:** Similar to `axes/_axes.py`, the `text` method in `pyplot.py` acts as a wrapper to create text objects, potentially with URLs. Since `pyplot` functions are often entry points for users creating plots in a more procedural manner, it's critical this method also ensures any URLs assigned to text objects respect the rotation of the text in PDF outputs. This might require ensuring that the underlying mechanisms (potentially within matplotlib's backend for PDFs) properly calculate the \"QuadPoints\" or equivalent functionality to define the clickable regions based on text rotation.\n\nConsidering that the specific implementation of \"QuadPoints\" in the context of matplotlib's PDF rendering backends (such as `backend_pdf.py`) wasn't directly uncovered through the API search, ensuring the correct behavior might involve extending or adjusting lower-level PDF rendering mechanisms. This could include adding support for \"QuadPoints\" in text rendering to the PDF backend, ensuring compatibility with PDF 1.6+ standards while keeping backward compatibility with viewers that do not support \"QuadPoints\" by also defining a rectilinear \"Rect\" that encompasses the rotated text's area."
