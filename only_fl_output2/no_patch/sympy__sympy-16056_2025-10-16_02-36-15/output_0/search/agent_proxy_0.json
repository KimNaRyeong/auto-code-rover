Given that the issue points out their usage in `.py` files and the necessity for a configurable standard, we should prioritize finding where these LaTeX commands are implemented in the source code. Let's start by searching the codebase to identify key locations where `\\mathrm` and `\\text` are used, and if there exist any centralized printing or configuration routines related to LaTeX.\n\nFirst, we need to find instances of `\\mathrm` and `\\text` in the code to understand their context and implementation:\n\n1. `search_code(\"\\\\mathrm\")`\n2. `search_code(\"\\\\text\")`\n\nUnderstanding whether a centralized mechanism exists for handling LaTeX printing, potentially through a helper function as suggested, is crucial. We must check if there's already an existing functionality that relates to text printing in LaTeX contexts within the project. Since the suggestion was to create a new helper function like `print_text`, it implies there might not be one yet. However, checking for any LaTeX or printing-related helper functions that are currently in use could provide valuable insights:\n\n3. `search_code(\"print_text\")`\n4. `search_code(\"latex_print\")`\n\nThese searches will help us understand the current implementation and provide a basis for addressing the issue comprehensively."
