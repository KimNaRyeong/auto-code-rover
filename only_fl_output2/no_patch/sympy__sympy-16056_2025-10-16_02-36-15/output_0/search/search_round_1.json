It seems like there should be one that is standard and that it should be possible to change that by configuration.\n### \\text\n* **Pro** adapts the font to the used math-font, not necessarily a Roman font\n* **Con** Relies on the `amsmath` (or some other `ams*` package\n### \\mathrm\n* **Pro** works in default LaTeX without importing any packages\n* **Con** always gives a Roman (Serif) font, even if the current math font is not Roman\nSome quick grep:ing tells us that there are 123 instances of `\\mathrm` and 46 instances of `\\text` in the .py-files.\nIdeally, this should be configurable, but even then we need to decide on a standard. Personally, I will set it to `\\text` the second it is implemented, but the package dependency may be confusing for newer users. (It seems like both options works in e.g. iPython but I have not explicitly tested, just not noted any issue.)\nProbably the easiest way to implement it is to add a helper function `print_text` or something so people do not have to test at every single instance.\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### `\\mathrm` and `\\text` Usages in the Codebase\n\nThe search results for `\\mathrm` have located its usage within the `sympy/functions/special/error_functions.py` file, specifically in the docstrings of helper functions designed to make certain mathematical functions (like `erf`, `Ei`, and `li`) more manageable for the Gruntz algorithm. This denotes that `\\mathrm` is used to ensure these functions are represented with a Roman (Serif) font in LaTeX-rendered documentation or outputs, aligning with its described behavior.\n\nThe search results for `\\text` have pinpointed its use within the `sympy/integrals/meijerint_doc.py` file, for embedding text representations within mathematical expressions, illustrating its role in adapting the font to the used math font, not necessarily a Roman font, and providing textual conditions or descriptions within mathematical LaTeX structures.\n\n**Relationship with the Issue:**\nThe issue describes a mix of uses between `\\mathrm` and `\\text` across the project, which might not only affect consistency in how textual content is presented in LaTeX outputs but could also potentially lead to dependency issues or unexpected font styling, depending on whether the `amsmath` package is utilized or not. The current usage patterns reflect this inconsistency, with `\\mathrm` being used for specific mathematical function representations and `\\text` for condition descriptions within mathematical documentation.\n\n**Intended Behavior Post-Issue Resolution:**\nIdeally, the code should adopt a uniform approach to rendering text within mathematical expressions in LaTeX. Making this behavior configurable\u2014as the issue suggests\u2014would allow users to choose between `\\mathrm` and `\\text` based on their preferences or requirements. This implies developing a new functionality or enhancing existing mechanisms to allow for a global setting that dictates the choice between `\\mathrm` and `\\text`.\n\n#### Absence of `print_text` and Presence of `latex_print`\n\nThe search did not find any instances of `print_text`, indicating there's no existing helper function by this name for handling text printing in LaTeX contexts. This aligns with the issue's suggestion to introduce a new helper function to standardize the handling of textual content in LaTeX expressions.\n\nHowever, the presence of `latex_print` in multiple files suggests there is already some centralized mechanism for handling LaTeX printing in the project, particularly within interactive sessions and vector printing modules. \n\n**Next Steps Based on Analysis:**\n\n- **Understanding `latex_print` Functionality:** Given that `latex_print` exists and is used across different modules, it's essential to understand how it works and whether it can be extended or adapted to include the configurable handling of `\\mathrm` vs. `\\text`. This will require examining the implementations of `latex_print` to see if it provides a viable starting point for the proposed feature.\n  \n- **Proposal for a Helper Function or Configuration Option:** Based on the insights gained from analyzing `latex_print`, a proposal can be formulated on how to introduce a configurable option for LaTeX text rendering. This might involve extending `latex_print`, creating a new helper function, or introducing a configuration setting within the existing printing framework.\n\nTo better understand `latex_print` and its potential for addressing the issue, the following API calls would be beneficial:\n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"latex_print\", \"sympy/interactive/printing.py\")`\n2. `search_method_in_file(\"latex_print\", \"sympy/interactive/session.py\")`\n3. `search_method_in_file(\"latex_print\", \"sympy/physics/vector/printing.py\")`\n\nThese calls aim to gather detailed information about the `latex_print` method's implementation, usage, and possible extension points to accommodate the requirement for configurable `\\mathrm` vs. `\\text` handling."
