        "intended_behavior": "Before attempting to read from `self.raw`, the code should check whether `self.raw` is `None`. If `self.raw` is `None`, the method should either raise a more informative error indicating that the response content could not be read because the underlying file-like object is missing, or it should handle this case gracefully if a scenario exists where `self.raw` can be legitimately `None` without indicating a fault (though this seems unlikely given the context). This preventive check will avoid the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'read'` and give users or developers clearer insight into what went wrong. The existing functionality of reading and yielding chunks of the response content should be preserved when `self.raw` is not `None`."
