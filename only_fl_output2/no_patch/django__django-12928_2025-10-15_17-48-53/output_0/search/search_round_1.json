It turns out it's possible with just a few changes.\nBecause it's not really possible to configure the cached template loader I did have to base this patch on the fix for #25788. Enabling autoreloading for the cached template loader would work like this:\nTEMPLATES = [{\n'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',\n'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],\n'APP_DIRS': True\n'OPTIONS': {\n'cache_templates': True,\n'autoreload': DEBUG\n}\n}]\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary context to address the issue regarding implementing autoreload behavior for the cached template loader in Django, we should focus on identifying the relevant classes, methods, and code snippets related to the template loading and caching mechanism in Django. Here are the API calls that would be useful:\n\n1. Search for the class responsible for handling template backends, which is likely `DjangoTemplates`:\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"DjangoTemplates\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions the cached template loader, searching for classes related to caching and template loading could provide insight into where modifications are required. The class name is not directly provided, but it could be something like `CachedLoader` or similar, so we can try to search for relevant classes:\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"CachedLoader\")\n   ```\n\n3. Also, the issue description suggests that there is a need to modify or extend the configuration settings for the template loaders to include `autoreload`. It's essential to understand how the `TEMPLATES` configuration is processed, so searching for the code that handles the `TEMPLATES` settings could be useful:\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"TEMPLATES = [\")\n   ```\n\n4. Since the functionality seems related to the development environment, indicated by the use of `DEBUG` in the configuration, it would be relevant to see if there's any specific handling for when `DEBUG` is `True` regarding templates:\n   ```python\n   search_code('autoreload': DEBUG)\n   ```\n\n5. It's possible the change might require adjustments in how templates are loaded or reloaded, so looking into methods that handle template loading could also provide important context:\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"get_template\")\n   search_method(\"load_template\")\n   ```\n\nThese search API calls are designed to gather detailed information about where and how templates are loaded and cached, the structure of the `DjangoTemplates` backend, and any existing logic that could relate to the autoreload behavior. This context is important for crafting a patch to enable the desired functionality in a way that aligns with Django's existing architecture and coding practices."

        "content": "Based on the results from the search API calls, let's analyze the collected context and its relation to implementing autoreload behavior for the cached template loader in a Django project.\n\n**1. DjangoTemplates Class (in django/template/backends/django.py and django/forms/renderers.py):**\n- The `DjangoTemplates` class in `django/template/backends/django.py` is likely the relevant one since it references template processing directly within Django's template system. It's part of the backend machinery that handles template loading and rendering.\n- Relationship to the bug: This class would be directly affected by the implementation of an autoreload feature for cached templates since it involves how templates are loaded and rendered. Adjusting or extending functionality within this class (or related mechanics) could enable detecting template changes without needing to restart the server.\n- Intended behavior: To modify or extend this class to check for template modifications when `autoreload` is enabled in the `TEMPLATES` setting and `cache_templates` is `True`, thus reloading the template automatically.\n\n**2. Absence of CachedLoader Class:**\n- Since no `CachedLoader` class was found, it might be that the caching mechanism uses a different name, or template caching is implemented as part of a broader class or method.\n- It might be worth searching for related terms such as \"cache\" within template loading contexts or investigating classes and methods mentioned in the search results that handle templates, such as loaders in `django/template/loader.py`.\n\n**3. TEMPLATES Setting (django/conf/global_settings.py):**\n- The `TEMPLATES` setting doesn\u2019t have the autoreload option; this is the default configuration placeholder showing where to specify backend options, confirming that adding 'autoreload': DEBUG needs custom implementation.\n- Relationship to the bug: Directly related, as implementing autoreload behavior requires modifying how this setting is processed, particularly when the `cache_templates` option is used.\n- Intended behavior: The settings processing mechanism should recognize `autoreload` and `cache_templates` options and appropriately configure the template loading backend to handle template changes dynamically in the development environment.\n\n**4. Absence of `'autoreload': DEBUG` in the Codebase:**\n- This confirms that autoreload functionality tied directly to the `DEBUG` setting for template caching isn't currently implemented in Django by default. This gap indicates where new functionality should be introduced.\n\n**5. get_template Method:**\n- It\u2019s found in multiple backend and loader classes. This method likely plays a central role in how templates are fetched for rendering.\n- Relationship to the bug: This or similar methods could be key interception points for implementing autoreload logic, given that they're involved in template retrieval.\n- Intended behavior: Enhancing `get_template` or related code paths to check if templates have been modified since last load when `autoreload` and `cache_templates` are enabled.\n\n**Next Steps Based on the Analysis:**\nGiven the absence of certain expected classes and the clear lead from the search results, the next steps in gathering context might include:\n- Examining the `get_template` method in `django/template/backends/django.py` to understand its role in template loading and potential places for introducing autoreload logic.\n- Searching for any existing caching mechanisms within the template loading process, possibly by examining the `django/template/loaders/cached.py` file, given that caching and autoreloading are closely related functionalities.\n\nBased on this analysis, additional API calls that could provide valuable context might include:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"get_template\", \"django/template/backends/django.py\")` to understand how the DjangoTemplates backend loads templates.\n- `search_method_in_file(\"get_template\", \"django/template/loaders/cached.py\")` and `search_code_in_file(\"cache\", \"django/template/loaders/cached.py\")` to explore how caching is currently implemented and where there might be opportunities to introduce autoreload capabilities."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

If both are True and the application is in DEBUG mode, the method should verify if the requested template has been modified since its last load. If it has been modified, the method should bypass the cache and reload the template from its source. This behavior ensures that developers get the benefit of cached templates without needing to restart the server after every template change during development. The modification should carefully preserve the method's existing functionality for cases where `autoreload` is not enabled or not applicable.\n\n- **Location 2:**  \n  **File:** django/template/loaders/cached.py  \n  **Intended Behavior:** Given that the `CachedLoader` class was expected but not found, the focus shifts to potentially adding or modifying functionality within this file related to caching. The intended behavior here would involve implementing or extending logic to support checking for template modifications when caching is enabled, specifically when `autoreload` is set to True. This might involve adding a new cache backend or extending the functionality of existing caching mechanisms to be more dynamic in development environments. The change would involve making the cache check for file changes before returning a cached template, reloading the template from disk if a change is detected."
