If both are True and the application is in DEBUG mode, the method should verify if the requested template has been modified since its last load. If it has been modified, the method should bypass the cache and reload the template from its source. This behavior ensures that developers get the benefit of cached templates without needing to restart the server after every template change during development. The modification should carefully preserve the method's existing functionality for cases where `autoreload` is not enabled or not applicable."

        "intended_behavior": "Given that the `CachedLoader` class was expected but not found, the focus shifts to potentially adding or modifying functionality within this file related to caching. The intended behavior here would involve implementing or extending logic to support checking for template modifications when caching is enabled, specifically when `autoreload` is set to True. This might involve adding a new cache backend or extending the functionality of existing caching mechanisms to be more dynamic in development environments. The change would involve making the cache check for file changes before returning a cached template, reloading the template from disk if a change is detected."
