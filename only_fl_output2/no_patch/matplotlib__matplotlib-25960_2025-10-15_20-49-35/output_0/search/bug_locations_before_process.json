        "intended_behavior": "The `subfigures` method needs to correctly interpret and apply the `wspace` and `hspace` parameters to adjust the spacing between subfigures horizontally and vertically, respectively. This involves ensuring that these parameters influence the layout of the subfigures within a figure, such that changing the values of `wspace` and `hspace` changes how closely subfigures are positioned to one another. The existing functionality, which allows for the creation of nested subfigures, should be preserved while adding the capability to control the spacing between these subfigures effectively. This might involve adjusting internal layout calculations or constraints to respect `wspace` and `hspace` values when determining the positioning of subfigures."
