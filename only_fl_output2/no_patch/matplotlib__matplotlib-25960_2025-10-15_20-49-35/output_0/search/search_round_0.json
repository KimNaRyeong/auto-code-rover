        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to `wspace` and `hspace` in `Figure.subfigures` not working as expected in matplotlib, the following API calls would be necessary:\n\n1. Search the `Figure` class in the matplotlib codebase to understand its structure and relevant methods:\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Figure\")\n```\n\n2. Search for the `subfigures` method within the `Figure` class, as this is where the issue likely originates from or is related to:\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"subfigures\", \"Figure\")\n```\n\n3. Get the code around the given line in the `Figure` class file to check how `wspace` and `hspace` are implemented or if they are considered at all in the current logic. The GitHub issue points to lines `1550-1554` but without specifying the exact file name. Assuming the file name can be inferred from the class search results or is known to be `figure.py`, which is standard for this class:\n```python\nget_code_around_line(\"lib/matplotlib/figure.py\", 1552, 10)\n```\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive view of how the `subfigures` function is designed and how `wspace` and `hspace` parameters are handled within the matplotlib's `Figure` class, facilitating a starting point for debugging and potentially fixing the issue."
