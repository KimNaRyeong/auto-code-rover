If we could, I'd be happy to provide a PR to do so\n</issue>"

Given the situation, the following API calls would be necessary to pinpoint the locations and usage patterns of `CalibratedClassifierCV` and `check_array` within the project:\n\n1. `search_class(\"CalibratedClassifierCV\")` - This will help us find the file(s) where `CalibratedClassifierCV` is defined.\n2. `search_method(\"check_array\")` - To understand how `check_array` is used across the project and if it's called directly by `CalibratedClassifierCV` or through some other method invocation chain.\n3. `search_code(\"CalibratedClassifierCV(check_array\")` - This specific search might help us quickly locate where inside the `CalibratedClassifierCV` class or its methods the `check_array` function is being used, assuming that the issue's context directly calls `check_array` in its implementation.\n\nThese steps are designed to gather the necessary code context around the usage of `check_array` within the `CalibratedClassifierCV` functionality, to assess the feasibility and impact of making `check_array` more tolerant of 3D inputs."
