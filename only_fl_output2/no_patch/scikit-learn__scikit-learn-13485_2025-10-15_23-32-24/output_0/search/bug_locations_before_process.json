        "intended_behavior": "The `fit` method should incorporate a check or a mechanism to handle 3D input arrays appropriately. Since the `fit` method involves input validation, it should either bypass the 2D constraint imposed by `check_array` when necessary (by setting `allow_nd=True` for cases that need it) or preprocess 3D inputs into a compatible format without losing the essence of the 3D structure. The change must ensure that current functionalities for 2D inputs remain unaffected for scenarios outside the Metric-Learn use case."

        "method": "predict_proba",
        "intended_behavior": "Similar to the `fit` method, `predict_proba` must be adapted to correctly handle or validate 3D inputs if it involves any form of input validation that currently assumes 2D input. The adaptation should allow for processing 3D arrays directly or converting them in a way that the 3D structure's informational content is preserved for the probability prediction process, while still supporting the original 2D functionality seamlessly."
