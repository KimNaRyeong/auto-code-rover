If we could, I'd be happy to provide a PR to do so\n</issue>"

        "content": "The information gathered from the API calls provides us with a starting point for understanding and addressing the issue reported regarding the `CalibratedClassifierCV` class and its handling of 3D inputs, which is relevant for the Metric-Learn project.\n\n### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### `CalibratedClassifierCV` Class\n- **Location**: `sklearn/calibration.py`\n- **Methods**: `__init__`, `fit`, `predict_proba`, `predict`\n- **What it does**: This class is implemented for calibrating classifiers to provide probability estimates for predictions. It wraps around a base estimator and applies calibration techniques to output more accurate probabilistic predictions.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: The issue at hand suggests that `CalibratedClassifierCV` is not capable of handling 3D inputs directly because of its use (direct or indirect) of the `check_array` utility, which, by default, does not allow inputs with more than 2 dimensions.\n\n#### `check_array` Function\n- **Location**: `sklearn/utils/validation.py`\n- **Parameters of interest**: `ensure_2d`, `allow_nd`\n- **What it does**: This function validates an input array, list, or sparse matrix according to various criteria such as data type, order, sparsity, dimensionality (2D by default), etc. It raises errors or converts the data format based on these criteria.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: The `check_array` function by default ensures that input arrays are 2D, which is determined by the parameter `ensure_2d=True` unless explicitly overridden. This default behavior contradicts with the Metric-Learn project's requirements, which involves 3D input arrays.\n- **Intended behavior**: In the context of the reported issue, the intended behavior would be to allow `check_array` to process 3D arrays when used within the `CalibratedClassifierCV` class, or to bypass or modify this check specifically for cases that necessitate higher-dimensional input.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven the collected context, and focusing on the goal to make `CalibratedClassifierCV` more tolerant of 3D inputs, it appears necessary to trace exactly how `CalibratedClassifierCV` interacts with `check_array` during its operations (e.g., during `fit`, `predict_proba`, or `predict` method calls). Since the direct search for `CalibratedClassifierCV(check_array` returned no results, it suggests that `CalibratedClassifierCV` does not directly call `check_array` with a simple code snippet that could be identified by the provided search string.\n\nTherefore, we should investigate further into the methods of `CalibratedClassifierCV`, particularly `fit` and `predict_proba`, to understand how data validation is performed within these methods. This requires inspecting the implementations of these methods more closely:\n\n1. `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"CalibratedClassifierCV\")` - To find out how the `fit` method validates its input `X` and to see if it directly calls `check_array` or invokes another method that might do so.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"predict_proba\", \"CalibratedClassifierCV\")` - Similarly, to investigate how `predict_proba` handles input validation.\n\nThese steps should provide the needed insight into how `CalibratedClassifierCV` can be adapted to accommodate 3D inputs, either by altering how `check_array` is invoked or by modifying validation logic within the class itself to bypass the 2D restriction when appropriate."

Since the `fit` method involves input validation, it should either bypass the 2D constraint imposed by `check_array` when necessary (by setting `allow_nd=True` for cases that need it) or preprocess 3D inputs into a compatible format without losing the essence of the 3D structure. The change must ensure that current functionalities for 2D inputs remain unaffected for scenarios outside the Metric-Learn use case.\n   \n   - **Location 2**: \n     - **File**: `sklearn/calibration.py`\n     - **Class**: `CalibratedClassifierCV`\n     - **Method**: `predict_proba`\n     - **Intended Behavior**: Similar to the `fit` method, `predict_proba` must be adapted to correctly handle or validate 3D inputs if it involves any form of input validation that currently assumes 2D input. The adaptation should allow for processing 3D arrays directly or converting them in a way that the 3D structure's informational content is preserved for the probability prediction process, while still supporting the original 2D functionality seamlessly.\n   \nThese adjustments will address the issue by making `CalibratedClassifierCV` compatible with 3D inputs, thus extending its applicability to scenarios like those encountered in the Metric-Learn project, without disrupting its utility for existing 2D use cases."
