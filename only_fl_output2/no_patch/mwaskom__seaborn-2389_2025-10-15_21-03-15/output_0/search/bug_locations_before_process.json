        "intended_behavior": "The method `_preprocess_colors` is designed to preprocess color information for plots by ensuring any missing values in the `colors` argument are filled with a default value ('white'). To resolve the issue without raising a `ValueError` when 'white' is not an existing category in categorical data types, the method should be adapted as follows:\n\n- **For Non-Categorical Data:** If `colors` is not categorical (e.g., a continuous scale or untyped list/array), the existing behavior of filling missing values with 'white' should be preserved as is, using `colors.fillna('white')`.\n\n- **For Categorical Data:** Before filling missing values:\n  - Check if `colors` is a pandas Categorical series or dataframe column.\n  - If yes, and if 'white' is not already a category, safely add 'white' to the categories without altering the existing categories' order or values. This could involve appending 'white' to the list of categories and then using `fillna('white')`, ensuring that the operation does not fail due to 'white' not being an original category.\n  - After ensuring 'white' is a valid category for filling, proceed with the `fillna('white')` operation.\n\nThis approach allows for a default background color to be assigned to missing values without disrupting the data's original categorization structure and avoids the `ValueError` currently being raised. This preserves the existing functionality for non-categorical data, while extending support to handle categorical data types gracefully."
