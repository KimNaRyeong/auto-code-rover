Here is a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that is designed to reproduce the described issue. This script assumes you have a Django environment setup where it is executed, as it relies on Django's template engine and internationalization features to simulate the error scenario.

```python
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.template import Context, Engine
from django.utils.translation import gettext as _

def setup_django_environment():
    settings.configure(
        USE_I18N=True,
        LANGUAGE_CODE='ru',
        LOCALE_PATHS=(
            os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'locale'),  # Assuming 'locale' dir is in the same dir as this script
        ),
        TEMPLATES=[{
            'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        }],
    )
    django.setup()

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    template_str = '''
    {% load i18n %}
    {% blocktrans count counter=distance|floatformat:0 %}
        {{ counter }} mile away
    {% plural %}
        {{ counter }} miles away
    {% endblocktrans %}
    '''
    
    # Mocking a situation where a float is passed, simulating the issue presented.
    context = Context({'distance': 1.5})
    
    engine = Engine()
    template = engine.from_string(template_str)
    try:
        rendered = template.render(context)
        if 'миль' not in rendered:
            raise AssertionError("Issue not reproduced, expected failure from rendering with float value.")
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue reproduced successfully.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    setup_django_environment()
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(0)
```

This script does the following:
- Sets up a minimal Django environment necessary for rendering templates and using internationalization.
- Provides the `print_stacktrace` function as requested to display error stack traces clearly.
- Tries to render a Django template that utilizes `{% blocktrans %}` with a `float` value, reproducing the issue.
- Catches `TypeError` exceptions specifically to confirm that the issue is reproduced as described.

Before running the script, ensure the Django project is correctly configured and that you have the appropriate locale files (`django.po` and `django.mo`) in the expected directory (`locale/ru/LC_MESSAGES/` relative to the script, with proper translations for the issue to manifest).

**Note:** This script assumes you're familiar with Django setup and its internationalization mechanics. The `AssertionError` is raised intentionally when the issue is present, demonstrating the failure condition. If the issue is fixed (by addressing float formatting in Django's `blocktrans` tag processing or by catching and handling `TypeError` more gracefully), the script is expected not to raise an error.
