        "content": "To address the issue related to string formatting errors when passing floats as values in `{% blocktrans %}` tags, especially within the context of gettext string formatting in a Django-like environment, the following context is critical:\n\n1. Gathering context on how `{% blocktrans %}` tags are processed in the codebase. This involves understanding the implementation of the `blocktrans` tag, which is likely handled by a specific method or class in the Django templating system.\n\n2. Since the error occurs when rendering the template with a float and it points to a potential issue within the string formatting process of gettext, examining any customization or wrappers around gettext's string formatting might give insight.\n\n3. The proposed solutions suggest either adjusting error handling or actively checking type compatibility. Therefore, locating where the translation and formatting are performed would be beneficial to see how the current system handles errors and type checking.\n\nBased on these needs, the appropriate search API calls would be:\n\n- `search_code(\"{% blocktrans %}\")`: To find how the `blocktrans` template tag is implemented or processed.\n- `search_method(\"do_translate\")`: Given the suggestion in the issue about making sure nothing else in `do_translate` throws a similar exception, it's crucial to examine this method.\n- `search_code(\"gettext\")`: Since the problem involves gettext string formatting, finding how gettext is used across the project could uncover customization or relevant utility functions.\n- `search_method(\"floatformat\")`: Exploring how the `floatformat` filter is implemented may provide clues about how it interacts with gettext and whether it contributes to the issue.\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive view of how translation and string formatting are handled, particularly with the `blocktrans` tag and floats, to diagnose and eventually resolve the issue."
