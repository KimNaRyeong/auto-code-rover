        "intended_behavior": "The method's intended behavior should remain as formatting a float to a specified number of decimal places. To resolve the issue, the method could ensure that the produced string is always compatible with gettext for translation tasks. This might involve either making sure the resulting string adheres to a format expected by gettext (e.g., ensuring it does not produce scientific notation for floats which gettext might not handle well) or enhancing the method to detect context in which it's being used (translation context) and adjust its behavior accordingly. The compatibility with gettext's string formatting needs to be seamless, presenting numbers in a format that doesn't break when passed to gettext functions."

        "intended_behavior": "Since `do_translate` involves processing translation tags, an enhancement or check could be added to ensure numeric values, especially floats formatted by `floatformat`, are correctly processed. This might involve adding a mechanism to pre-process or validate formatted strings for compatibility with gettext before attempting translation. Additionally, if a TypeError is detected during the translation process, it could catch this error and provide a more helpful error message, suggesting the use of `floatformat` or checking the format of numeric values in translated strings. This approach preserves existing functionality while enhancing error messaging and robustness in handling floats in translations."
