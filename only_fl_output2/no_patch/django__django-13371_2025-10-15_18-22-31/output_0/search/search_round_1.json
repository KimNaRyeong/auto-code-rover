        "content": "Analyzing the provided context, here's what we have and some insights on each point:\n\n### 1. No \"Row\" Class Found\n\nThe search for the `Row` class did not yield any results. This suggests that the `Row` class, as mentioned in the issue, might not exist explicitly by that name within the Django codebase or that it's dynamically created or aliased in some way, making it harder to find directly. Given the error message in the issue, it's likely that `Row` is a dynamically created type or a namedtuple that isn't directly referenced as a class in the codebase.\n\n### 2. `values_list` in `QuerySet`\n\nThe `values_list` method:\n- Accepts any number of field arguments.\n- Has boolean options `flat` and `named` that cannot be used together.\n- Creates a clone of the current QuerySet (`clone = self._values(*_fields, **expressions)`).\n- Determines the iterable class for the clone based on the `flat` and `named` flags.\n\nFor named tuples, the code indicates the returned QuerySet will use `NamedValuesListIterable` as its iterable class. This suggests that the `named=True` parameter in `values_list` leads to the creation of named tuples, potentially the `Row` mentioned in the issue. These named tuples then can't be pickled, which points towards either the namedtuple class not being pickleable inherently or a specific issue with how Django sets up or uses these named tuples.\n\n### Relationship with the Bug\n\nThe bug is directly related to the `values_list` function when used with `named=True`, as this setup fails to produce pickleable objects. This part of the code initializes the conditions under which these non-pickleable objects are created. Since the `Row` class wasn't found directly, and given Django's use of named tuples for named lists, it is likely that these dynamically named tuples lack a proper setup or method for pickling, which is required for serialization.\n\n### Intended Behavior\n\nThe intended behavior would be for any object returned by `values_list(named=True)` to be pickleable, allowing these objects to be serialized and deserialized without error. This is crucial for caching mechanisms and any form of data transfer or storage where serialization is necessary.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven that the `Row` named tuples are likely dynamically generated and the source of pickle errors, a possible solution could involve ensuring these dynamically named tuples (or the equivalent `Row` objects) have a suitable `__reduce__` method or are otherwise made pickleable. This might involve:\n- Implementing or ensuring that a `__reduce__` method is properly utilized for these objects.\n- Further investigating how `NamedValuesListIterable` handles the creation of these named tuples and ensuring it includes necessary hooks or methods for pickling.\n\nTherefore, additional context might be obtained from:\n- Investigating `NamedValuesListIterable` and how it creates named tuples.\n- Exploring how Django's model or field instances use `__reduce__` to handle pickling, which might give insights into implementing a similar solution for the `Row` objects.\n\nGiven this analysis, a follow-up API call could be to search for the `NamedValuesListIterable` class in the codebase to understand how it manages the `named=True` tuples.\n\n`search_class(\"NamedValuesListIterable\")`\n\nAnd potentially examining `__reduce__` methods in models to see if there's a reusable pattern:\n\n`search_method_in_file(\"__reduce__\", \"django/db/models/base.py\")`"

This would likely involve ensuring the dynamically created `Row` or equivalent named tuple objects have a proper `__reduce__` method or similar mechanism enabling them to be serialized via pickle. The existing functionality, which allows for retrieving values from a QuerySet as named tuples for ease of use and readability, should be preserved without altering how queries are constructed or results are fetched. The fix should specifically aim to make the serialization process compatible with Python's pickle module, thus resolving the issue for caching operations and other use cases requiring serialization.\n\n**Bug Location 2:**\n- File: `django/db/models/query.py`\n- Class: This location is yet to identify precisely but would involve the details of `NamedValuesListIterable` or wherever the named tuple for `values_list(named=True)` is defined or managed.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\nFor the second location, once identified (presumably within the handling of `NamedValuesListIterable`), the intended behavior would be to ensure that the creation process of named tuples includes pickle-compatible methods or properties. It's possible that enhancing the named tuple definition or its creation process to include a custom `__reduce__` method (or ensure it's appropriately applied) could resolve the pickling issue. The key is to maintain the functional requirements and performance characteristics of `values_list` method outputs while ensuring they are fully compatible with being pickled and unpickled.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the Django team can resolve the issue without affecting existing functionality but ensuring that users can serialize the results of `values_list(named=True)` for caching or other purposes where serializability is a requirement."
