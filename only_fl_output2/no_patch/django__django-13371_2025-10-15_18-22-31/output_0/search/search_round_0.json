        "content": "To address the issue of `django.db.models.query.Row` not being pickleable, which is critical for ensuring that named tuples returned by `QuerySet.values_list()` can be efficiently serialized (for caching purposes, among other things), we need to gather more context around the areas of Django involved with this functionality. Specifically, it's essential to understand how Django creates these `Row` instances and any related mechanisms for serialization.\n\nBased on the issue description, the following API calls would be necessary to gather sufficient context:\n\n1. Search for the `Row` class within the Django codebase to understand its definition and any relevant serialization logic that might be missing or malfunctioning.\n   \n   `search_class(\"Row\")`\n\n2. The `values_list` method of `QuerySet` is directly mentioned as the source of the issue. Looking for its implementation could provide insights into how `Row` instances are created and potentially hint at why they're not pickleable.\n\n   `search_method_in_class(\"values_list\", \"QuerySet\")`\n\n3. Given that the error message points to a failure in looking up the `Row` attribute within `django.db.models.query`, investigating the specific code file for this module might reveal the missing links for making `Row` pickleable.\n\n   `search_code_in_file(\"class Row\", \"django/db/models/query.py\")`\n\n4. Since the issue also mentions that this affects compatibility with the `cacheops` package, understanding how `Row` instances are meant to be serialized might require looking into any Django mechanism (or decorators) used to enable object pickling. There might be a need for a custom pickling method or modifications to the `Row` class.\n\n   `search_method(\"__reduce__\")`\n\nThese API calls are targeted at uncovering the structure and functionality that lead to the problem, as well as at providing clues for how Django handles serialization for complex objects like the ones returned by `values_list(named=True)`."
