        "intended_behavior": "The method 'create_namedtuple_class' within the 'NamedValuesListIterable' class should be adjusted or extended to ensure that the namedtuple classes it generates include necessary mechanisms (like a '__reduce__' method) for serialization via pickle. The process for creating these namedtuple classes must not only generate types that maintain their named field accessibilities (which it currently does) but also ensure these types are fully pickleable, thus supporting caching and other serialization-dependent features without raising errors. This might involve defining a custom namedtuple class or extending the base 'collections.namedtuple' to include pickling support directly within the generated class definition."

        "intended_behavior": "While the 'values_list' method itself might not contain the direct bug, its use of 'NamedValuesListIterable' when 'named=True' indicates a need for careful integration ensuring serialized compatibility. The intended behavior here is to ensure that any changes or enhancements made to support pickling in 'NamedValuesListIterable' are fully compatible with how 'values_list' is used. Specifically, adjustments in 'values_list' might be necessary to ensure that the QuerySet clones it creates, which use 'NamedValuesListIterable', properly handle the serialization of returned named tuples. This would involve ensuring that the logic which sets '_iterable_class' to 'NamedValuesListIterable' for named tuples fully supports the new pickleable characteristics introduced in 'NamedValuesListIterable'. Implementing these changes should resolve the pickling errors mentioned in the issue while preserving the existing functionality and performance of 'values_list(named=True)'."
