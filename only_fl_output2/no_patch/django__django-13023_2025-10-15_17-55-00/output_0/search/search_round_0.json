This is a problem, for example, when you try to save a model object, and a decimal field got set to a dictionary by mistake. The TypeError exception that comes back makes it hard to track the problem to the field if the object has a lot of fields.\nI am proposing a patch to fix it:\n\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/13023\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue about `DecimalField.to_python()` raising a `TypeError` on dict values in Django, we need to focus on finding the relevant pieces of code. Specifically, we need to look into the implementation of `DecimalField` and its `to_python` method. Given the nature of the issue, it's also pertinent to understand how validation errors are handled or should be handled in similar contexts. Here's how we can approach it with the search APIs:\n\n1. **Search for the DecimalField class**: This will help us find where `DecimalField` is defined.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"DecimalField\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the to_python method in the DecimalField class**: Since the issue is specifically with the `to_python` method when a dictionary is passed as a value, we need to look at its current implementation to see why it's not raising a `ValidationError`.\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"to_python\", \"DecimalField\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for the ValidationError class**: It is mentioned in the issue that a `ValidationError` should be raised, so understanding where and how `ValidationError` is used in similar contexts could be beneficial.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"ValidationError\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls will provide initial context necessary to understand the structure around the `DecimalField` class, its `to_python` method, and how errors are typically handled. This information will serve as a foundation for proposing a fix."
