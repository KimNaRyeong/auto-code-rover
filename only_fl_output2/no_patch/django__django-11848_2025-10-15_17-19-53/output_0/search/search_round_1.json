        "content": "Analyzing the obtained code context from `django/utils/http.py`, specifically from the `parse_http_date` function, provides insight into how Django handles HTTP date parsing, which is essential for resolving the reported issue.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n   The `parse_http_date` function parses dates in HTTP header format, as specified by HTTP RFC 7231 section 7.1.1.1. It handles three different date formats, but only one (the first) is commonly in use today. The function returns the parsed date as an integer expressed in seconds since the epoch, in UTC.\n\n   To parse the date, it sequentially tries to match the given date string against regular expressions for the allowed date formats (RFC1123, RFC850, and ASCTIME). Upon finding a match, it attempts to extract the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second from the date. Notably, for years represented with two digits, it determines the century by adding 2000 to years less than 70 and 1900 to years 70 and above.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   The issue description indicates that the method for interpreting two-digit years is incorrect according to newer RFCs, which state that if a two-digit year appears to be more than 50 years in the future, it should be interpreted as the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits. The current logic in `parse_http_date`, which simply adds 2000 to years less than 70 and 1900 to years 70 and above, does not comply with this guideline. Thus, this part of the code is directly related to the bug because it is where the flawed logic resides.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   The intended behavior would involve modifying the year interpretation logic to dynamically calculate the century based on the current year. Rather than having a hard cutoff that assigns a century based on whether the year is above or below 70, the logic should determine if the parsed two-digit year mapped to either the 1900s or 2000s (or potentially the 2100s in the future) would appear to be more than 50 years in the future from the current year. If so, it should be adjusted to reflect the most recent past year with the same last two digits. Essentially, this involves implementing a calculation that considers the current year when interpreting two-digit years.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next step toward resolving the issue involves adjusting the logic in lines 178-183 of `parse_http_date` to implement the correct interpretation of two-digit years as described in the relevant RFCs. This adjustment requires a comparison against the current year to determine the appropriate century for the two-digit year."

Bug Location:\n   - File: django/utils/http.py\n   - Method: parse_http_date\n\n   Intended Behavior:\n   To resolve the issue within the `parse_http_date` method, the logic for handling two-digit years needs to be updated to comply with the guidelines outlined in the RFCs. Specifically, when a two-digit year is encountered, the method should no longer apply a simple rule of adding 2000 for years below 70 and 1900 for years 70 and above. Instead, it should:\n\n   - Calculate the full year based on the current date and deduce what century the two digits should belong to, ensuring that if the resulting year is more than 50 years in the future, it is interpreted as being in the past century.\n   - Maintain the existing functionality for parsing dates, only modifying the logic for determining the century of two-digit years.\n   - This adjustment involves adding a dynamic comparison against the current year (possibly involving getting the current year via `datetime.datetime.now().year` or a similar function) to decide whether to interpret the two-digit year as belonging to the 1900s, 2000s, or even retroactively adjusting for other centuries as we move forward in time. \n\nImplementing this change ensures that the `parse_http_date` function remains compliant with the more recent specifications, thereby accurately parsing dates that use a two-digit year format."
