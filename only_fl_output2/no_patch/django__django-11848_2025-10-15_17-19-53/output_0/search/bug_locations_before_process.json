        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue within the `parse_http_date` method, the logic for handling two-digit years needs to be updated to comply with the guidelines outlined in the RFCs. Specifically, when a two-digit year is encountered, the method should no longer apply a simple rule of adding 2000 for years below 70 and 1900 for years 70 and above. Instead, it should:\n\n- Calculate the full year based on the current date and deduce what century the two digits should belong to, ensuring that if the resulting year is more than 50 years in the future, it is interpreted as being in the past century.\n- Maintain the existing functionality for parsing dates, only modifying the logic for determining the century of two-digit years.\n- This adjustment involves adding a dynamic comparison against the current year (possibly involving getting the current year via `datetime.datetime.now().year` or a similar function) to decide whether to interpret the two-digit year as belonging to the 1900s, 2000s, or even retroactively adjusting for other centuries as we move forward in time."
