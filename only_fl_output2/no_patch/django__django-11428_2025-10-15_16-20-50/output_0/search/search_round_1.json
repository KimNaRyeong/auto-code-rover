The consequence is that you just get a TypeError exception about __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'other_thing' and it completely masks the original exception.\nNote that this behavior was changed in c8720e7696ca41f3262d5369365cc1bd72a216ca, it used to just re-raise the exception value. I don't know why it was changed.\nI noticed this issue as a result of \u200bhttps://gitlab.com/alantrick/django-vox/issues/9\n</issue>"

The implementation of the `raise_last_exception` method in `django.utils.autoreload` to understand how it currently attempts to re-raise exceptions.\n2. Any code snippet involving the instantiation of exceptions within `django.utils.autoreload`, especially how it handles custom exceptions with non-standard signatures.\n3. The AppConfig class and ready method to see if there's any specific handling of exceptions that might be relevant to this issue.\n4. The definition of a custom Exception (`MyException`) to understand how exceptions are being declared and any custom logic within their `__init__` methods.\n\nBased on these requirements, let's make the following API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"raise_last_exception\")`: This will help us locate the method within the Django codebase that is responsible for re-raising exceptions, as mentioned in the issue.\n\n- `search_class(\"AppConfig\")`: Since the issue involves a custom app configuration class that extends `AppConfig` and its `ready` method, we need to understand how `AppConfig` is implemented.\n\n- `search_code(\"class MyException(Exception)\")`: This call will provide context on how custom exceptions are typically defined within the project or by Django itself, which might give clues on handling exceptions with custom signatures.\n\nThese searches should provide a broad context around the components mentioned in the issue, allowing for a more targeted inspection and subsequent development of a patch."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n### 1. `raise_last_exception` in `django/utils/autoreload.py`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `raise_last_exception` function is designed to re-raise the last exception caught by the Django autoreloader. It does so by constructing a new instance of the exception with its original argument (`_exception[1]`) and attaching the original traceback (`_exception[2]`).\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nThis part of the code is directly related to the bug. The issue arises when this function attempts to re-instantiate a custom exception that requires more than one argument in its constructor, leading to a `TypeError` because the function only provides one argument.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nThe intended behavior would be for `raise_last_exception` to accurately re-raise exceptions, including those with custom signatures, without losing the original exception information or leading to a `TypeError`. This might require a mechanism to store and re-create exceptions with all their original arguments and possibly keyword arguments.\n\n### 2. `AppConfig` in `django/apps/config.py`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n`AppConfig` is a class in Django that allows developers to configure application properties. It includes methods for setup tasks, such as initializing app-specific settings, importing models, and running ready() methods when Django starts up.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nThe relationship to the bug comes from the use of the `ready` method in a user-defined `AppConfig` subclass to raise a custom exception. This scenario highlights the need for the Django autoreloader (and related exception handling mechanisms) to correctly handle user-defined exceptions raised during app initialization.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nThe `AppConfig` and its `ready` method should allow for custom initialization code, including the possibility of raising exceptions, without inadvertently leading to masking errors due to limitations in Django\u2019s error handling mechanisms. Custom exceptions raised should be propagated accurately to alert developers of configuration or initialization errors.\n\n### Missing Context\n\nGiven the `search_code(\"class MyException(Exception)\")` did not return results, it highlights a gap in our understanding of how custom exceptions are typically constructed and utilized in the project. This gap is crucial because the bug specifically involves custom exceptions with non-standard signatures.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context\n\nTo address the missing context, we could:\n- Trace back to where custom exceptions might be declared that are used with Django's AppConfig or in paths that involve autoloading/reloading of modules. However, since this specific `MyException` example was used to illustrate the issue and may not exist in Django's source code, we should focus on understanding Django's handling and instantiation of exceptions in general.\n- Look into Django\u2019s documentation or source code comments for any references to handling custom exceptions, especially in the context of app loading and autoreloading mechanisms.\n- Search for any Django mechanisms that handle exception serialization or reconstruction, which could provide insights into handling exceptions with multiple arguments or custom constructors more gracefully.\n\nGiven the direct relationship of the problem with `raise_last_exception` and the lack of information on handling custom exceptions within Django's autoreload mechanism, our primary focus would likely be on proposing a modification to `raise_last_exception` to better handle exceptions with varied constructors."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

To resolve the issue without breaking existing functionality, the method should:\n\n   - Detect the signature of the exception constructor (`__init__`) to properly re-instantiate exceptions with all the original arguments and keyword arguments, handling cases where the exception might have more than one required argument.\n   - Use introspection or a similar mechanism to accurately recreate the exception with its original constructor arguments, ensuring custom exception classes with non-standard signatures are supported. This can involve storing the full argument list and keyword arguments (if any) when the exception is first caught, then using these to re-construct the exception instance during re-raising.\n   - Ensure that this changes doesn't negatively impact the current handling of standard exceptions or alter the traceback, preserving the original traceback for clarity during debugging.\n\n   This adjustment is crucial for developers working with Django, especially when developing or using third-party apps that may define custom exceptions. By enhancing how exceptions are re-raised, Django can provide clearer, more accurate error information during the development and debugging process, particularly when using the autoreloader feature."
