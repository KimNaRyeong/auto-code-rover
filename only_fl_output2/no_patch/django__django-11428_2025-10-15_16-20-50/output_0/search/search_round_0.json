The consequence is that you just get a TypeError exception about __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'other_thing' and it completely masks the original exception.\nNote that this behavior was changed in c8720e7696ca41f3262d5369365cc1bd72a216ca, it used to just re-raise the exception value. I don't know why it was changed.\nI noticed this issue as a result of \u200bhttps://gitlab.com/alantrick/django-vox/issues/9\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary context to address the issue with the autoreloader crashing on re-raising exceptions with custom signatures, we need to investigate the following:\n\n1. The implementation of the `raise_last_exception` method in `django.utils.autoreload` to understand how it currently attempts to re-raise exceptions.\n2. Any code snippet involving the instantiation of exceptions within `django.utils.autoreload`, especially how it handles custom exceptions with non-standard signatures.\n3. The AppConfig class and ready method to see if there's any specific handling of exceptions that might be relevant to this issue.\n4. The definition of a custom Exception (`MyException`) to understand how exceptions are being declared and any custom logic within their `__init__` methods.\n\nBased on these requirements, let's make the following API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"raise_last_exception\")`: This will help us locate the method within the Django codebase that is responsible for re-raising exceptions, as mentioned in the issue.\n\n- `search_class(\"AppConfig\")`: Since the issue involves a custom app configuration class that extends `AppConfig` and its `ready` method, we need to understand how `AppConfig` is implemented.\n\n- `search_code(\"class MyException(Exception)\")`: This call will provide context on how custom exceptions are typically defined within the project or by Django itself, which might give clues on handling exceptions with custom signatures.\n\nThese searches should provide a broad context around the components mentioned in the issue, allowing for a more targeted inspection and subsequent development of a patch."
