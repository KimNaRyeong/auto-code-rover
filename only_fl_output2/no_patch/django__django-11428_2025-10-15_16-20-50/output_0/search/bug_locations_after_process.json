        "intended_behavior": "The raise_last_exception needs to be modified to preserve its functionality of re-raising exceptions while also handling custom exceptions with any number of arguments. To resolve the issue without breaking existing functionality, the method should: - Detect the signature of the exception constructor (__init__) to properly re-instantiate exceptions with all the original arguments and keyword arguments, handling cases where the exception might have more than one required argument. - Use introspection or a similar mechanism to accurately recreate the exception with its original constructor arguments, ensuring custom exception classes with non-standard signatures are supported. This can involve storing the full argument list and keyword arguments (if any) when the exception is first caught, then using these to re-construct the exception instance during re-raising. - Ensure that this changes doesn't negatively impact the current handling of standard exceptions or alter the traceback, preserving the original traceback for clarity during debugging. This adjustment is crucial for developers working with Django, especially when developing or using third-party apps that may define custom exceptions. By enhancing how exceptions are re-raised, Django can provide clearer, more accurate error information during the development and debugging process, particularly when using the autoreloader feature."
