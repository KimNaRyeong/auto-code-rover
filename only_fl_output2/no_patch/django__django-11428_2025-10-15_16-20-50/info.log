This can involve storing the full argument list and keyword arguments (if any) when the exception is first caught, then using these to re-construct the exception instance during re-raising. - Ensure that this changes doesn't negatively impact the current handling of standard exceptions or alter the traceback, preserving the original traceback for clarity during debugging.
