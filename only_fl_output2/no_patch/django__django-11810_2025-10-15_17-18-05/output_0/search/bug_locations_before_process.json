        "intended_behavior": "The `select_related` method is designed to return a new `QuerySet` instance that will select related objects. To avoid mutating the original `QuerySet`, the method should ensure that the creation of the `obj` variable through `self._chain()` produces an entirely new `QuerySet` instance that does not share mutable state with the original. The intended behavior should preserve the capability to specify related fields to be included in the selection, or to clear the selection if `None` is specified. However, the cloning process must be reviewed or adjusted to ensure that subsequent changes to the new `QuerySet` do not impact the original one. This might involve a deeper examination or adjustment of the `self._chain()` or the underlying cloning mechanism to fully isolate the cloned `QuerySet`."

        "intended_behavior": "The `_clone` method is aimed at producing a copy of the current `QuerySet` as a lightweight alternative to `deepcopy`. However, to resolve the issue, the method must guarantee that this copy is entirely independent of the original `QuerySet`. This includes ensuring that all attributes, especially those related to selected related objects via `select_related`, are safely cloned in a way that mutations in the cloned `QuerySet` do not propagate back to the original `QuerySet`. The cloning process, particularly how `self.query.chain()` is used to create a copy of the query, may need refinement to establish this independence more robustly. Any shared references between the original and cloned queries should be closely examined and eliminated if they are identified as the source of the mutation issue."
