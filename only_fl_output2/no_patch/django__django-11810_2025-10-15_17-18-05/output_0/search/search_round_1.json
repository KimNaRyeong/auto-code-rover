        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### `select_related` Method\n\nThe `select_related` method in `django/db/models/query.py` is designed to return a new `QuerySet` instance that will select related objects. This method uses the `_chain` method to create what is intended to be a new instance of `QuerySet`. The critical part of this method, from the issue's perspective, lies in how it aims to return a new `QuerySet` instance without affecting the original one. This behavior is crucial since it ensures that operations on the derived `QuerySet` do not impact the original one.\n\n**Relation to the Bug:** The described bug suggests that applying `select_related` on a derived `QuerySet` mutates the original `QuerySet`, which contradicts the intended isolation of changes between the original and derived `QuerySet` instances. The mechanism through which `select_related` attempts to return a new instance, specifically `self._chain()`, should maintain this isolation but seems to fail according to the issue description.\n\n**Intended Behavior:** Ideally, modifications made to the derived `QuerySet` (like adding extra `select_related` calls) should not reflect on the original `QuerySet`. This isolation supports flexible query composition without unintended side effects across different parts of an application.\n\n#### `QuerySet` Class and `_clone` Method\n\nThe `QuerySet` class is a comprehensive class providing various query-building capabilities in Django. The `_clone` method specifically is documented to return a copy of the current `QuerySet`, serving as a lightweight alternative to `deepcopy`.\n\n**Relation to the Bug:** The issue suggests a breakdown in what `_clone` is supposed to ensure: the creation of an independent copy of a `QuerySet` that can be modified without affecting the original `QuerySet`. The `_clone` method uses the `self.query.chain()` to presumably make a new copy of the current query, assigning it to a new `QuerySet` instance. However, the bug implies that this mechanism does not achieve true independence between the original and the cloned `QuerySet`.\n\n**Intended Behavior:** The `_clone` method should ensure that any `QuerySet` derived from another via cloning (implicitly done in `select_related`) is entirely independent of its source. Any modifications to this cloned `QuerySet`, including further `select_related` calls, should not propagate back to affect the original `QuerySet`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe relationship between the described bug and the `select_related` implementation, along with the cloning behavior encapsulated in `_clone`, is direct. The code analysis suggests that both these components work as intended to create and manipulate independent `QuerySet` instances. However, the behavior observed in the issue indicates a failure in maintaining this independence, possibly due to a nuanced oversight in how cloning is performed or how `QuerySet` instances reference their underlying query objects.\n\nGiven the issue, a deeper dive into how `self.query.chain()` creates a new query copy in `_clone` and how `_chain` utilizes `_clone` might surface the root cause of the mutation issue, potentially revealing if the cloned `QuerySet` retains references that should have been severed or if there's a deeper issue in how query objects handle their state when cloned."

To avoid mutating the original `QuerySet`, the method should ensure that the creation of the `obj` variable through `self._chain()` produces an entirely new `QuerySet` instance that does not share mutable state with the original. The intended behavior should preserve the capability to specify related fields to be included in the selection, or to clear the selection if `None` is specified. However, the cloning process must be reviewed or adjusted to ensure that subsequent changes to the new `QuerySet` do not impact the original one. This might involve a deeper examination or adjustment of the `self._chain()` or the underlying cloning mechanism to fully isolate the cloned `QuerySet`.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/db/models/query.py`\n  - **Class:** `QuerySet`\n  - **Method:** `_clone`\n  \n  - **Intended Behavior:** The `_clone` method is aimed at producing a copy of the current `QuerySet` as a lightweight alternative to `deepcopy`. However, to resolve the issue, the method must guarantee that this copy is entirely independent of the original `QuerySet`. This includes ensuring that all attributes, especially those related to selected related objects via `select_related`, are safely cloned in a way that mutations in the cloned `QuerySet` do not propagate back to the original `QuerySet`. The cloning process, particularly how `self.query.chain()` is used to create a copy of the query, may need refinement to establish this independence more robustly. Any shared references between the original and cloned queries should be closely examined and eliminated if they are identified as the source of the mutation issue.\n\nThe resolution to the issue requires confirming that the `select_related` method's and `_clone` method's functionality indeed leads to truly independent `QuerySet` instances when cloning, especially in scenarios where `select_related` or similar methods are used on cloned instances."
