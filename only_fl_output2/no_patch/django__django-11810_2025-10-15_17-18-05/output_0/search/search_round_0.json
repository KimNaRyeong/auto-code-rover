The two queries are the same !!!\\n')\noutput\nQUERY 1: SELECT \"foobar_modelc\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\", \"foobar_modela\".\"id\" FROM \"foobar_modelc\" INNER JOIN \"foobar_modela\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\" = \"foobar_modela\".\"id\")\nQUERY 2: SELECT \"foobar_modelc\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\", \"foobar_modela\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelb\".\"id\" FROM \"foobar_modelc\" INNER JOIN \"foobar_modela\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\" = \"foobar_modela\".\"id\") INNER JOIN \"foobar_modelb\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\" = \"foobar_modelb\".\"id\")\nQUERY 1: SELECT \"foobar_modelc\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\", \"foobar_modela\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelb\".\"id\" FROM \"foobar_modelc\" INNER JOIN \"foobar_modela\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\" = \"foobar_modela\".\"id\") INNER JOIN \"foobar_modelb\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\" = \"foobar_modelb\".\"id\")\n!!! The two queries are the same !!!\nThe expectation is that the original QuerySet is not mutated, and the two queries are different. This behavior also happens with 'prefetch_related'.\nSince the QuerySet methods call 'self._clone()', and state that they return 'a new QuerySet instance', this behavior does not seem correct.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to examine the implementation of `select_related` method and how Django's ORM handles cloning of `QuerySet` objects to ensure a new instance is returned rather than modifying the original instance. Let's start with these specific search API calls:\n\n1. **Search for `select_related` method in the entire codebase**: This will help us understand its implementation and interactions with `QuerySet` cloning.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_method('select_related')\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for `QuerySet` class in the codebase**: Since the issue mentions that calling `select_related` on a `QuerySet` should return a new instance, understanding how `QuerySet` is defined will be crucial. This includes looking into how cloning is implemented.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class('QuerySet')\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for `_clone` method in `QuerySet` class**: As the issue description implies that cloning is not performed correctly, inspecting the `_clone` method is essential to identify potential issues in how new `QuerySet` instances are created.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class('_clone', 'QuerySet')\n   ```\n\nThese API calls should give us a comprehensive understanding of how `select_related` operates, how `QuerySet` objects are expected to be cloned, and whether there's an anomaly in the cloning process that could cause the described issue."
