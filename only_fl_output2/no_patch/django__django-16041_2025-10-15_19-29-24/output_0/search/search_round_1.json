The class responsible for creating formsets could either be `BaseFormSet` or a similar class that extends it. \n\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"BaseFormSet\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Search for the method handling `empty_form`**: Understanding how `empty_form` is generated or manipulated will provide insight into where the error might occur and how to address it. `empty_form` is a property or method of the formset class that needs to be investigated.\n\n    ```python\n    search_method_in_class(\"empty_form\", \"BaseFormSet\")\n    ```\n\n3. **Search for the method applying `form_kwargs` to forms in the formset**: Since the issue arises when `empty_permitted` is passed via `form_kwargs`, knowing how these kwargs are applied to the forms in a formset will help understand how to exclude `empty_form` from being affected or how to correctly handle `empty_permitted`.\n\n    ```python\n    search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"BaseFormSet\")\n    ```\n\nThese API calls should provide a solid foundation to understand the problem's context by highlighting how formsets and their `empty_forms` are constructed and manipulated, especially in relation to `form_kwargs`."

        "content": "The analysis of the collected context from the `BaseFormSet` class reveals the following insights concerning the encountered bug and the intended behavior of the Django formsets:\n\n### `BaseFormSet` constructor (`__init__` method)\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The constructor initializes a formset instance with several parameters, including `form_kwargs` which can contain custom keyword arguments passed to each form in the formset. It processes various initialization tasks like setting the prefix, handling bound status (whether data has been submitted), and setting initial data and custom error messages.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The `form_kwargs` are stored and later passed to each form constructed by the formset. This mechanism is working as intended; however, the bug arises when `empty_permitted` passed via `form_kwargs` is also applied to the `empty_form`, which apparently shouldn't be the case because `empty_form` is a template for client-side generated forms and not directly used for form submission or validation.\n\n3. **Intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Ideally, the `__init__` method should continue to initialize formsets while handling `form_kwargs` appropriately. The intended behavior should ensure that any `form_kwargs` specifically not suitable for `empty_form` (like `empty_permitted`) are either disregarded or handled in a way that prevents runtime errors when `empty_form` is rendered.\n\n### `BaseFormSet.empty_form` property\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - This property generates a template form (known as `empty_form`) that can be used on the client side to add new forms dynamically. This form is pre-configured (not bound to any data) and includes settings derived from `form_kwargs` and other formset configurations.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Directly related, as it applies `empty_permitted=True`, and any `form_kwargs` passed during formset initialization. Here lies the root of the issue: irrespective of the `empty_permitted` value in `form_kwargs`, it sets `empty_permitted=True`, which conceptually conflicts with explicitly setting `empty_permitted=False` in `form_kwargs` for `empty_form`.\n\n3. **Intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The `empty_form` should ignore `empty_permitted` from `form_kwargs` since its purpose is to provide a template for additional forms added client-side, nullifying the need for its validation (`empty_permitted` is about validation). Thus, when `empty_form` is rendered, it should either strip `empty_permitted` from the `form_kwargs` or safely ignore it without causing errors.\n\nGiven the analysis, the patch needs to address how `empty_form` processes `form_kwargs` to either ignore or selectively apply `empty_permitted`, ensuring it doesn't contradict the explicit settings passed by users while preserving the intended functionality of generating client-side templates for new forms.\n"

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This can be done by modifying the method to selectively ignore the `empty_permitted` key from `form_kwargs` when constructing the `empty_form`. This ensures that `empty_form` remains functional for its intended purpose as a template for creating additional forms on the client side, without being subjected to server-side validation controls that are irrelevant to it. A possible approach could involve a conditional removal or override of the `empty_permitted` key in the `form_kwargs` before passing them to the form constructor within `empty_form`. This change would enable the `empty_form` to be rendered without raising a `KeyError` due to conflicting `empty_permitted` values and preserve its intended use-case within the formset."
