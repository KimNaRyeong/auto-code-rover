        "content": "To address this issue effectively, we need to understand how the `empty_form` of a formset is generated and handled in Django, especially when `form_kwargs` such as `empty_permitted` are applied. To gather the necessary context, we can make the following API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the class generating the formset**: Since the issue involves formsets, it's likely part of the forms framework in Django. The class responsible for creating formsets could either be `BaseFormSet` or a similar class that extends it. \n\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"BaseFormSet\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Search for the method handling `empty_form`**: Understanding how `empty_form` is generated or manipulated will provide insight into where the error might occur and how to address it. `empty_form` is a property or method of the formset class that needs to be investigated.\n\n    ```python\n    search_method_in_class(\"empty_form\", \"BaseFormSet\")\n    ```\n\n3. **Search for the method applying `form_kwargs` to forms in the formset**: Since the issue arises when `empty_permitted` is passed via `form_kwargs`, knowing how these kwargs are applied to the forms in a formset will help understand how to exclude `empty_form` from being affected or how to correctly handle `empty_permitted`.\n\n    ```python\n    search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"BaseFormSet\")\n    ```\n\nThese API calls should provide a solid foundation to understand the problem's context by highlighting how formsets and their `empty_forms` are constructed and manipulated, especially in relation to `form_kwargs`."
