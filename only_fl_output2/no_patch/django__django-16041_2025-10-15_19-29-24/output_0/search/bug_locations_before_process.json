        "intended_behavior": "The `empty_form` property should be modified to ensure that `empty_permitted` passed in `form_kwargs` does not apply to it. This can be done by modifying the method to selectively ignore the `empty_permitted` key from `form_kwargs` when constructing the `empty_form`. This ensures that `empty_form` remains functional for its intended purpose as a template for creating additional forms on the client side, without being subjected to server-side validation controls that are irrelevant to it. A possible approach could involve a conditional removal or override of the `empty_permitted` key in the `form_kwargs` before passing them to the form constructor within `empty_form`. This change would enable the `empty_form` to be rendered without raising a `KeyError` due to conflicting `empty_permitted` values and preserve its intended use-case within the formset."
