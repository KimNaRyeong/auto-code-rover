        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue regarding enhancing the `QuantileTransformer` documentation, specifically its implementation details and the process it uses to map to a uniform distribution, the following API calls would be essential:\n\n1. Start by finding the implementation file of the `QuantileTransformer`, since we need to understand how it\u2019s implemented to enhance the documentation accurately.\n\n2. Then, search for specific methods within that class or file that might relate to computing the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) or its mapping to a uniform distribution, as the issue description seems to suggest there's a misunderstanding or lack of clarity about this process.\n\nGiven these considerations, here are the API calls that would provide the necessary code context:\n\n- `search_class(class_name: \"QuantileTransformer\")`: To get the file or files where the `QuantileTransformer` class is defined.\n\n- `search_method_in_class(method_name: \"fit\", class_name: \"QuantileTransformer\")`: Since the `fit` method might be where the empirical CDF computation or mapping to a uniform distribution is implemented, getting its details can be crucial.\n\n- `search_method_in_class(method_name: \"transform\", class_name: \"QuantileTransformer\")`: The `transform` method is likely where data gets mapped to a new distribution; details from this method could clarify the implementation question.\n\n- `search_code(code_str: \"empirical cdf\")`: This call might help find code snippets or comments related to how the empirical CDF is computed within the project, if the specific method calls above don't capture it."
