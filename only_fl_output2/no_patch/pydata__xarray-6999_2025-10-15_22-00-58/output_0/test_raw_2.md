Certainly. Based on your request, here's a standalone Python file, `reproducer.py`, designed to replicate the reported issue within an environment set up as described.

```python
# reproducer.py

import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    data = xr.DataArray([5, 6, 7], coords={"c": ("x", [1, 2, 3])}, dims="x")
    data_renamed = data.rename({"c": "x"})
    assert 'x' in data_renamed.indexes, "Index for 'x' was not created as expected following rename operation."

    data_renamed.sel(x=2)
    print("Operation successful: Index was found and `sel` operation on 'x' did not raise KeyError.")

except AssertionError as ae:
    print_stacktrace(ae)
    exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate assertion failure
except KeyError as ke:
    print_stacktrace(ke)
    exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate the specific issue with selection
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Catchall for any other exceptions that might occur

exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 if the script ran successfully without encountering the issue.
```

This file will attempt to recreate the provided scenario where renaming a coordinate to a dimension coordinate does not create an index, causing further operations like `sel` to fail with a `KeyError`. It explicitly checks for the index's presence after renaming and tries a selection operation to confirm the issue. If the conditions are met to reproduce the issue, it will print a detailed stack trace. If the issue is fixed (i.e., the index exists, and the `sel` operation succeeds), the script exits with code 0, signaling success.
