Given the feedback and the importance of accuracy and clarity in reproducing the bug accurately, I'll write a corrected standalone python file, ensuring that it follows the given structure for `print_stacktrace` and attempts to reproduce the issue based on the description provided. This revised version will correct any errors and directly aim to demonstrate the issue with `rename_vars` not creating an index on xarray objects.

```python
# reproducer.py

import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    data = xr.DataArray([5, 6, 7], coords={"c": ("x", [1, 2, 3])}, dims="x")
    data_renamed = data.rename({"c": "x"})
    # Attempt to access the indexes property. If the issue exists, this will not contain the expected index for 'x'.
    assert 'x' in data_renamed.indexes, "Index for 'x' was not created"
    # Further operations like sel should now work without raising an error if the issue is not present.
    selected = data_renamed.sel(x=2)
    print("Test passed: Index was created, and `sel` operation succeeded.")
except AssertionError as e:
    raise e
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise AssertionError("An unexpected error occurred. See stack trace above.")
```

This script explicitly tests the creation of an index following the `rename` operation, asserts that the index must exist for proper selection, and outputs an error message and a stack trace if an unexpected error occurs. It's meant to be run in the project's root directory with Python 3, ensuring that the environment matches the reported xarray and its dependencies' versions.
