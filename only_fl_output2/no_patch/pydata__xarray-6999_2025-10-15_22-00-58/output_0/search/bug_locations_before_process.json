        "intended_behavior": "This method, when renaming coordinates into a dimension coordinate, should either automatically create an index for the new dimension coordinate or raise a warning/error advising the use of `set_index` for such operations. This change ensures that all dimension coordinates have appropriate indexes for subsequent data selection operations. If the former approach (automatic index creation) is chosen, it should be implemented in a way that does not disrupt existing functionality for users who do not require an index."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to `DataArray.rename`, `rename_vars` should handle the renaming of variables to dimension coordinates by ensuring that any such new dimension coordinate has an associated index. This could be achieved by automatic index creation or by warning/error pointing users towards `set_index`. The solution implemented should preserve the method's original functionality while enhancing it to cover the use case presented by the issue."
