Given the clarification and the objective to create a Python script (`reproducer.py`) that correctly captures the issue and its conditions, let's adjust the approach to reflect the actual occurrences of the described problems, ensuring to provoke an AssertionError under the circumstances of the detected issues. However, keeping in mind the feedback stating the tests passed without issues, indicating that the attempt might not have directly reproduced the expected warning or exception behavior, we'll refine the strategy to forcefully raise `AssertionError` when the conditions described in your issues are encountered and correctly use the custom `print_stacktrace` function for enhanced debugging output if needed.

This revised script will focus on accurately reflecting the raised `UserWarning` and `StopIteration` under their corresponding conditions:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def force_warning_check():
    """Ensure any UserWarning is caught when it shouldn't be."""
    from contextlib import contextmanager
    import warnings

    @contextmanager
    def assert_no_warnings():
        with warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as w:
            warnings.simplefilter("always")
            yield
            assert len(w) == 0, "Unexpected warning(s) encountered"

    return assert_no_warnings

# Reproduce UserWarning with all-nan values issue 
def test_userwarning_all_nan_values():
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    with force_warning_check():
        plt.figure()
        plt.scatter(np.ones(10), np.ones(10), c=np.full(10, np.nan))
        plt.close()

# Reproduce StopIteration with all-nan errorbars issue
def test_stopiteration_all_nan_errorbars():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)
    try:
        ax.errorbar([0], [0], yerr=[np.nan])
        plt.close()
    except StopIteration as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("StopIteration should not be raised with all NaN yerr") from e

try:
    test_userwarning_all_nan_values()
    test_stopiteration_all_nan_errorbars()
    print("Tests completed without issue")
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
```

In this revision:

- A context manager `force_warning_check` is introduced to ensure no warnings are passed silently, tailored to test the first condition where a `UserWarning` should not be occurring when all-nan values are passed to a plotting function.
- The `test_userwarning_all_nan_values` function is designed to run under the assumption that no warnings are expected, and the presence of any will lead to an `AssertionError`.
- For the `test_stopiteration_all_nan_errorbars` function, it properly captures the specific condition related to `StopIteration`, aiming to reproduce the scenario accurately.

Execution of this script with `python3 reproducer.py` will enforce the verification of both issues and is expected to exit with code 0 when the issues are either not present or correctly handled otherwise.
