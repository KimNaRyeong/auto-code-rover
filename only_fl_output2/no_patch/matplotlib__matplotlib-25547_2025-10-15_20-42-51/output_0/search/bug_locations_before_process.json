        "intended_behavior": "The method should ensure uniform handling of \"bad\" values such as `np.nan`, specifically when all values are \"bad\". It should either suppress warnings for `np.nan` values uniformly or handle them in a way that doesn't result in unexpected warnings for the user. This might include checking the array for all `np.nan` values and applying a consistent handling strategy that matches cases where only some values are \"bad\"."

        "intended_behavior": "`_upcast_err` is designed to upcast error inputs, but it should be enhanced to handle cases where `yerr` or `xerr` consists entirely of `np.nan` values without resulting in a `StopIteration` error. This could involve implementing a check before attempting to find a first finite element within the error arrays. If all elements are identified as `np.nan` (or equivalently \"bad\"), the method could return a default or designated \"safe\" value that prevents the `StopIteration`. This behavior preserves the functionality of generating error bars while dealing gracefully with datasets that might include missing or undefined error values."
