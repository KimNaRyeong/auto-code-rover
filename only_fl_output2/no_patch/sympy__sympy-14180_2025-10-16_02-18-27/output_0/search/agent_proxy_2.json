If no dedicated method for logarithmic functions exists, modifications would likely be within `_print_Function`, ensuring proper handling of the natural logarithm.\n\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Within the method responsible for handling the printing of logarithmic expressions specifically (or within a general function printing method if a dedicated one does not exist), the code should be adjusted to:\n    1. Detect when the function is a natural logarithm (`ln`).\n    2. Render `ln` using LaTeX's `\\ln{}` command instead of `\\log{}` to accurately reflect the intention of representing a natural logarithm.\n    3. This adjustment must preserve the handling of other logarithmic bases and functions, only altering the output for natural logarithms.\n    4. Ensure compatibility with the various settings and modes the `LatexPrinter` class supports, such as `mode`, `fold_frac_powers`, etc.\n\nGiven the comprehensive handling of mathematical expressions by the `LatexPrinter` class, care should be taken to isolate this change to affect only the conversion of `ln` without inadvertently altering the treatment of other expressions or functions."
