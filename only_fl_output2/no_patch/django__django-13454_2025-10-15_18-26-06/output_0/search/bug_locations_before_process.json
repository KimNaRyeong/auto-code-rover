        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `EmptyFieldListFilter` class needs to implement a check or workaround for handling `GenericForeignKey`. Specifically, during initialization or within any method that relies on `empty_strings_allowed`, the filter should detect if the field is a `GenericForeignKey` and handle it in a manner that does not require `empty_strings_allowed`. This could mean defaulting to a behavior that correctly interprets the \"emptiness\" of a generic relation field, perhaps based on whether the related object ID is `None` or not."

        "intended_behavior": "The `GenericForeignKey` class should be extended to include an `empty_strings_allowed` attribute or a method that mimics its logic for fields that use `GenericForeignKey`. This would directly address the compatibility issue with `EmptyFieldListFilter` by aligning with the expected interface. Alternatively, if modifying `GenericForeignKey` directly is not feasible due to potential side effects elsewhere, ensuring that `EmptyFieldListFilter` and similar components correctly interpret or bypass the need for `empty_strings_allowed` on `GenericForeignKey` fields is essential. This approach preserves the existing functionality while making `EmptyFieldListFilter` more robust and compatible with a wider range of field types."
