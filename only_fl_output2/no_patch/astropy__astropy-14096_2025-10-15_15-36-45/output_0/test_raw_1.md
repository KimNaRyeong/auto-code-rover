To address the request accurately, let's revise the Python script for `reproducer.py` considering the error handling and clarity in stack trace reporting as previously discussed. This version is crafted to specifically capture the essence of the reported issue regarding misleading attribute access messages within a subclass of `SkyCoord`. The script now includes comprehensive error checking and uses the `print_stacktrace` function to elucidate the encountered errorâ€™s nature.

```python
import astropy.coordinates as coord
import sys


class CustomCoord(coord.SkyCoord):
    @property
    def prop(self):
        return self.random_attr


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    # Providing a clearer description of the caught exception
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def main():
    try:
        c = CustomCoord('00h42m30s', '+41d12m00s', frame='icrs')
        _ = c.prop
    except AttributeError as e:
        # Checking if the error message is the one expected when the issue is present
        if "has no attribute 'random_attr'" in str(e):
            print("The AttributeError is as expected.", file=sys.stderr)
            sys.exit(0)  # Issue is not present, or it's behaving as expected
        else:
            # If the error message is not as expected, it signifies the presence of the issue.
            print_stacktrace(e)
            assert str(e) == "'CustomCoord' object has no attribute 'prop'", "Unexpected error message."
            sys.exit(1)  # Exiting with code 1 to indicate the issue is present
    except Exception as e:
        # Handling any other unexpected exceptions and printing their stack trace.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exiting with code 1 as the execution didn't lead to expected results

    # If no exception is raised, that's an unexpected situation, hence assert failure.
    raise AssertionError("No AttributeError raised for 'random_attr'.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code aims to accurately reproduce the issue by instantiating `CustomCoord` and accessing the `prop` property, which in turn tries to access a non-existent attribute `random_attr`. If the erroneous message accentuates that `prop` is missing rather than `random_attr`, the script will detect it and confirm the issue through the assertion and exit codes.
