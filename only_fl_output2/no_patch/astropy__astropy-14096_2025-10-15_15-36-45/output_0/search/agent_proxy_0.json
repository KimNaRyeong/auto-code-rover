Search for the `SkyCoord` class to understand its structure and methods, especially those that might interfere or relate to attribute access and error messaging.\n2. Search for the `__getattr__` method within the `SkyCoord` class or its file, as this seems to be directly involved in the issue.\n3. Investigate how properties are handled in `SkyCoord` to gather context on how the subclass might be misinterpreting or misrouting attribute access.\n\nTherefore, the API calls I would invoke are:\n\n- `search_class(\"SkyCoord\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__getattr__\", \"SkyCoord\")`"
