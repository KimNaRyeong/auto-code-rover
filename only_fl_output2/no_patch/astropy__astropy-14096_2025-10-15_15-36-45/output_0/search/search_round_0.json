This all seems to be working fine, but when I have a custom property (`prop` below) that tries to access a non-existent attribute (`random_attr`) below, the error message is misleading because it says `prop` doesn't exist, where it should say `random_attr` doesn't exist.\n```python\nimport astropy.coordinates as coord\nclass custom_coord(coord.SkyCoord):\n@property\ndef prop(self):\nreturn self.random_attr\nc = custom_coord('00h42m30s', '+41d12m00s', frame='icrs')\nc.prop\n```\nraises\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"test.py\", line 11, in <module>\nc.prop\nFile \"/Users/dstansby/miniconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/astropy/coordinates/sky_coordinate.py\", line 600, in __getattr__\n.format(self.__class__.__name__, attr))\nAttributeError: 'custom_coord' object has no attribute 'prop'\n```\n</issue>"

Search for the `SkyCoord` class to understand its structure and methods, especially those that might interfere or relate to attribute access and error messaging.\n2. Search for the `__getattr__` method within the `SkyCoord` class or its file, as this seems to be directly involved in the issue.\n3. Investigate how properties are handled in `SkyCoord` to gather context on how the subclass might be misinterpreting or misrouting attribute access.\n\nTherefore, the API calls I would invoke are:\n\n- `search_class(\"SkyCoord\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__getattr__\", \"SkyCoord\")`"
