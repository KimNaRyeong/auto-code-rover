Let's analyze this information based on the questions outlined:\n\n### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `__getattr__` method in the `SkyCoord` class is designed to handle attribute access for the instance. The method is overridden to provide several functionalities:\n1. **Coordinate Transformation:** It allows returning coordinates that can be transformed based on an alias attribute in the primary transform graph.\n2. **Frame Attributes Handling:** If an attribute belongs to the frame attributes, it's either retrieved directly from the current frame or, if not applicable, from a prefixed internal attribute.\n3. **Access to Frame Instance Attributes:** It also tries to access attributes from the internal `_sky_coord_frame` if they don't begin with an underscore and the attribute exists on the `_sky_coord_frame`.\n4. **Frame Transformation:** Attempts to interpret the attribute as a request for frame transformation if it's recognized as the name of a transformable frame.\n5. **Attribute Error:** If none of the above conditions are met, it finally raises an `AttributeError`, stating that the `SkyCoord` object has no attribute with the specified name.\n\n### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe bug occurs when the `AttributeError` is raised: Instead of accurately reporting that a non-existent attribute (in this case `random_attr` mentioned in the user's class) is missing, it mistakenly reports that the overridden property `prop` doesn't exist. This misdirection is possibly due to the way attribute lookup and error messaging are being handled in the `__getattr__` method.\n\n### Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior, when an attribute does not exist, is to accurately reflect which attribute is causing the issue. In the case described in the issue, the error message should indicate that the attribute `random_attr` is missing, not the `prop` that is being accessed, which correctly exists and is trying to access `random_attr`.\n\n### Potential Solution Approach\n\nGiven the analysis, a potential solution could involve refining the error handling within `__getattr__` to catch the exact attribute causing the issue and accurately report it in the error message. This might necessitate checking whether the attribute being accessed directly is part of a custom property or method within the subclass and is trying to access another missing attribute, hence distinguishing between genuine attribute misses on the `SkyCoord` object itself and those resulting from internal property logic.\n\nTo implement this solution, additional context might be required regarding how Python's attribute access and error mechanisms work, especially in the context of subclassing and attribute lookup procedures. Additional code or mechanisms within `SkyCoord` that deal with attribute handling, beyond what's covered by `__getattr__`, could also be relevant."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Bug Location:\n- File: astropy/coordinates/sky_coordinate.py\n- Class: SkyCoord\n- Method: __getattr__\n\nIntended Behavior: The `__getattr__` method should accurately report when a non-existent attribute is accessed through a custom property or directly. While the existing error handling functionality needs to be preserved for its current capabilities (like coordinate transformation, frame attributes handling, etc.), an improvement should be made to distinguish between missing attributes referenced by custom subclass properties and those genuinely missing on the `SkyCoord` object itself. This would involve potentially checking the traceback within `__getattr__` to identify if the missing attribute access is originating from within a custom property or method. Upon determining this, the error message should dynamically reflect the precise missing attribute (`random_attr` in the user's scenario), instead of misleadingly pointing to the custom property (`prop`). This tailored reporting should significantly reduce confusion and offer clearer guidance on the actual source of the problem without affecting the existing functionalities and behaviors of the `__getattr__` method in the SkyCoord class."
