        "intended_behavior": "The `__getattr__` method should accurately report when a non-existent attribute is accessed through a custom property or directly. While the existing error handling functionality needs to be preserved for its current capabilities (like coordinate transformation, frame attributes handling, etc.), an improvement should be made to distinguish between missing attributes referenced by custom subclass properties and those genuinely missing on the `SkyCoord` object itself. This would involve potentially checking the traceback within `__getattr__` to identify if the missing attribute access is originating from within a custom property or method. Upon determining this, the error message should dynamically reflect the precise missing attribute (`random_attr` in the user's scenario), instead of misleadingly pointing to the custom property (`prop`). This tailored reporting should significantly reduce confusion and offer clearer guidance on the actual source of the problem without affecting the existing functionalities and behaviors of the `__getattr__` method in the SkyCoord class."
