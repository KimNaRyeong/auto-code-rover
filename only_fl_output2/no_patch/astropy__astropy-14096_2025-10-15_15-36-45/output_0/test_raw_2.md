Given the instructions and the aim to reproduce the original issue faithfully, I have crafted a new Python script as requested. This script directly addresses the reported issue involving subclassing `SkyCoord` and the misleading attribute access message. It will correctly exit with code 0 when the issue has been resolved and will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue persists, adhering to the functionality specified for printing a detailed stack trace of exceptions encountered during its execution.

```python
# reproducser.py
import astropy.coordinates as coord
import sys


class MyCustomCoord(coord.SkyCoord):
    @property
    def prop(self):
        return self.random_attr


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def main():
    try:
        c = MyCustomCoord('00h42m30s', '+41d12m00s', frame='icrs')
        print(c.prop)  # Attempt to access the custom property. 
    except AttributeError as e:
        correct_message = "'MyCustomCoord' object has no attribute 'random_attr'"
        if correct_message in str(e):
            # This is the corrected or expected error message.
            sys.exit(0)
        else:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            assert False, "The error message is not as expected."
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    # If no AttributeError is raised, that means the `random_attr` issue is not triggered.
    # That's an indication the subclassing issue might have been resolved differently or is not present.
    assert False, "AttributeError for 'random_attr' was not raised as expected."


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script, when placed in the root of your Python project and executed, is designed to check for the specific subclassing issue with `SkyCoord` from Astropy. It should help diagnose whether the misleading attribute access error message has been corrected by asserting the existence of the original issue through the specified `AssertionError` conditions or exiting gracefully with code 0 when the issue is fixed.
