Given the outcome of the previous attempt and the errors highlighted regarding the `antlr4` package, it's necessary to ensure the environment has all required dependencies installed before attempting to parse LaTeX expressions with SymPy. However, since dependency resolution is outside the scope of the script itself, the revised script below will proceed under the assumption that necessary dependencies, specifically `antlr4-python3-runtime` for Python 3, are installed in the environment. If not already installed, you should install them using `pip install antlr4-python3-runtime` prior to running this script.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy.parsing.latex import parse_latex
    # Latex expression
    latex_str = "\\frac{\\frac{a^3+b}{c}}{\\frac{1}{c^2}}"
    # Expected result
    expected_result = "((a**3 + b)/c)/(1/(c**2))"
    
    try:
        # Parse the LaTeX string
        parsed = parse_latex(latex_str)
        # Check if the output matches the expected result
        assert str(parsed) == expected_result, "Parsed expression does not match the expected result."
        print("Test passed. The issue is not present.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred:", str(e))
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Before running the script:
- Ensure all dependencies, especially `antlr4-python3-runtime`, are properly installed in your Python environment.
- If the environment lacks necessary packages, the script will not accurately reproduce or test for the specific LaTeX parsing issue.
- This script raises an `AssertionError` if the parsed LaTeX expression does not match the expected structure, aiming to directly illustrate the parsing issue reported.
