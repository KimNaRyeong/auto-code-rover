        "intended_behavior": "The method should correctly interpret nested fractions in LaTeX syntax and convert them into the corresponding SymPy expression while preserving the mathematical precedence and associations. The specific issue arises when parsing nested fractions, where the denominator should be treated as a whole unit rather than being separated, leading to incorrect mathematical interpretation. Ensuring that the conversion process respects the nesting of fractions will resolve the issue. This might involve adjusting how mathematical relations are interpreted and converted (convert_relation involved in the process), possibly by implementing enhanced logic to handle nested structures more explicitly."
