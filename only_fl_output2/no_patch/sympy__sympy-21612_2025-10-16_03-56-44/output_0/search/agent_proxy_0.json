Given the use of `parse_latex(\"\\\\frac{\\\\frac{a^3+b}{c}}{\\\\frac{1}{c^2}}\")` in the issue description, let's start by focusing on the `parse_latex` method and the class it might belong to. We will:\n\n1. Search for the method `parse_latex` to understand its general implementation and locate the file it resides in.\n2. Given the latex parsing issue is specifically related to fractions, it's also useful to identify how fractions are handled in the parsing process. For this, searching for code snippets related to fractions in latex processing will help.\n\nHere are the search API calls reflecting our strategy:\n\n- `search_method(\"parse_latex\")`\n- `search_code(\"\\\\frac\")`"
