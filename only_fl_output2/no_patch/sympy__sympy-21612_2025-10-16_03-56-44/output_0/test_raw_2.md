To create a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that reproduces the issue with the LaTeX parsing in SymPy, and properly handles the `AssertionError` with a detailed stack trace as requested, please see the adjusted script below. This version includes the function to print a stack trace for clarity on where exactly the error occurs if the asserted condition (i.e., the parsed LaTeX expression not matching the expected output) fails. Given that prior attempts ran into issues with the environment setup, this script assumes that all required packages, including `sympy` and any of its dependencies, are correctly installed and set up in the Python environment where it runs.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy.parsing.latex import parse_latex
    from sympy import symbols, Rational

    # Defining symbols to be used in sympy expression comparison
    a, b, c = symbols('a b c')
    
    # The LaTeX string presenting the fraction problem
    latex_str = "\\frac{\\frac{a^3+b}{c}}{\\frac{1}{c^2}}"
    
    # We create the expected sympy expression for comparison
    expected_expression = ((a**3 + b)/c)/(1/(c**2))
    
    try:
        # Parse the LaTeX string to sympy expression
        parsed_expression = parse_latex(latex_str)

        # Check if the parsed expression mathematically equals the expected expression
        assert parsed_expression.equals(expected_expression), "Parsed expression does not match the expected result."

        print("Test passed. The issue is not present.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred:", str(e))
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Notes before running the script:**

- Ensure that `sympy` and `antlr4-python3-runtime` (or the appropriate version for your Python) are installed in the environment. You can install them using pip:
  - `pip install sympy`
  - `pip install antlr4-python3-runtime`
- This script checks for a mathematical equality using the `.equals()` method rather than a direct string comparison to account for valid differences in expression structures that are mathematically equivalent.
- The script will exit with code 0 and print "Test passed. The issue is not present." if the issue is fixed, otherwise, it will raise an `AssertionError` with a detailed traceback.
