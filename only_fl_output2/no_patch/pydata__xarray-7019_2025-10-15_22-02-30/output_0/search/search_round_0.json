        "content": "<issue>Alternative parallel execution frameworks in xarray\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?\nSince early on the project xarray has supported wrapping `dask.array` objects in a first-class manner. However recent work on flexible array wrapping has made it possible to wrap all sorts of array types (and with #6804 we should support wrapping any array that conforms to the [array API standard](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/index.html)).\nCurrently though the only way to parallelize array operations with xarray \"automatically\" is to use dask. (You could use [xarray-beam](https://github.com/google/xarray-beam) or other options too but they don't \"automatically\" generate the computation for you like dask does.)\nWhen dask is the only type of parallel framework exposing an array-like API then there is no need for flexibility, but now we have nascent projects like [cubed](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed) to consider too. @tomwhite\n### Describe the solution you'd like\nRefactor the internals so that dask is one option among many, and that any newer options can plug in in an extensible way.\nIn particular cubed deliberately uses the same API as `dask.array`, exposing:\n1) the methods needed to conform to the array API standard\n2) a `.chunk` and `.compute` method, which we could dispatch to\n3) dask-like functions to create computation graphs including [`blockwise`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/400dc9adcf21c8b468fce9f24e8d4b8cb9ef2f11/cubed/core/ops.py#L43), [`map_blocks`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/400dc9adcf21c8b468fce9f24e8d4b8cb9ef2f11/cubed/core/ops.py#L221), and [`rechunk`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/main/cubed/primitive/rechunk.py)\nI would like to see xarray able to wrap any array-like object which offers this set of methods / functions, and call the corresponding version of that method for the correct library (i.e. dask vs cubed) automatically.\nThat way users could try different parallel execution frameworks simply via a switch like\n```python\nds.chunk(**chunk_pattern, manager=\"dask\")\n```\nand see which one works best for their particular problem.\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\nIf we leave it the way it is now then xarray will not be truly flexible in this respect.\nAny library can wrap (or subclass if they are really brave) xarray objects to provide parallelism but that's not the same level of flexibility.\n### Additional context\n[cubed repo](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed)\n[PR](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/6804) about making xarray able to wrap objects conforming to the new [array API standard](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/index.html)\ncc @shoyer @rabernat @dcherian @keewis\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue, we need to focus on understanding how xarray currently integrates with dask and how it could be refactored to support alternative parallel execution frameworks like cubed, following the desires outlined in the feature request. Therefore, we'll need to look at:\n\n1. How xarray currently wraps dask arrays to parallelize array operations.\n2. Explore possible integration points in xarray's codebase for introducing a more flexible system that could accommodate other libraries such as cubed.\n3. Identify the existing mechanisms (like methods or classes) xarray uses to handle chunk and compute operations which are crucial for processing dask arrays.\n\nGiven these points, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n- To understand how xarray wraps dask arrays: `search_code(\"dask.array\")`\n- To find potential points where the parallelization abstraction might be improved: `search_method(\"chunk\")`, `search_method(\"compute\")`\n- To inspect specific implementations of handling chunk operations possibly to see how they could be adapted or extended: `search_method_in_class(\"chunk\", \"DataArray\")`, `search_method_in_class(\"compute\", \"DataArray\")`\n- Also, to find out if there are specific classes designed for managing these kinds of operations, which could be relevant for the refactor: `search_class(\"ArrayWrapper\")`, suggesting there may be an existing wrapper mechanism that could be extended for compatibility with other array libraries beyond dask.\n\nThese searches should reveal code snippets, methods, and classes involved in managing dask arrays and parallel operations in xarray, which are vital for scoping the needed changes to introduce a flexible, extensible backend system for alternative parallel execution frameworks like cubed."
