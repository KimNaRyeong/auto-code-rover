This includes: 1. Defining a base class or interface for backend operations. 2. Implementing subclass(es) for each supported backend (e.g., dask, cubed). 3. Providing a mechanism (e.g., a backend registry) that allows for selecting and dynamically switching between backends based on user preferences or configuration. 4. Ensuring backward compatibility with existing dask operations while allowing for the integration of new backends."
