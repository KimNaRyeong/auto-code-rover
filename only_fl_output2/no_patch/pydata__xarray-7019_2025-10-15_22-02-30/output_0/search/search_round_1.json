        "content": "<issue>Alternative parallel execution frameworks in xarray\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?\nSince early on the project xarray has supported wrapping `dask.array` objects in a first-class manner. However recent work on flexible array wrapping has made it possible to wrap all sorts of array types (and with #6804 we should support wrapping any array that conforms to the [array API standard](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/index.html)).\nCurrently though the only way to parallelize array operations with xarray \"automatically\" is to use dask. (You could use [xarray-beam](https://github.com/google/xarray-beam) or other options too but they don't \"automatically\" generate the computation for you like dask does.)\nWhen dask is the only type of parallel framework exposing an array-like API then there is no need for flexibility, but now we have nascent projects like [cubed](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed) to consider too. @tomwhite\n### Describe the solution you'd like\nRefactor the internals so that dask is one option among many, and that any newer options can plug in in an extensible way.\nIn particular cubed deliberately uses the same API as `dask.array`, exposing:\n1) the methods needed to conform to the array API standard\n2) a `.chunk` and `.compute` method, which we could dispatch to\n3) dask-like functions to create computation graphs including [`blockwise`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/400dc9adcf21c8b468fce9f24e8d4b8cb9ef2f11/cubed/core/ops.py#L43), [`map_blocks`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/400dc9adcf21c8b468fce9f24e8d4b8cb9ef2f11/cubed/core/ops.py#L221), and [`rechunk`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/main/cubed/primitive/rechunk.py)\nI would like to see xarray able to wrap any array-like object which offers this set of methods / functions, and call the corresponding version of that method for the correct library (i.e. dask vs cubed) automatically.\nThat way users could try different parallel execution frameworks simply via a switch like\n```python\nds.chunk(**chunk_pattern, manager=\"dask\")\n```\nand see which one works best for their particular problem.\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\nIf we leave it the way it is now then xarray will not be truly flexible in this respect.\nAny library can wrap (or subclass if they are really brave) xarray objects to provide parallelism but that's not the same level of flexibility.\n### Additional context\n[cubed repo](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed)\n[PR](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/6804) about making xarray able to wrap objects conforming to the new [array API standard](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/index.html)\ncc @shoyer @rabernat @dcherian @keewis\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context in relation to the feature request for alternative parallel execution frameworks in xarray, let's delve into specifics.\n\n### Analyzing `dask.array` Usage\n\nThe search for `dask.array` usage within the xarray codebase returned a wide variety of files, demonstrating that dask integration is extensive and deeply embedded across multiple components of xarray including data manipulation, backend storage, and computational operations. This extensive integration suggests that currently, dask is not just an optional add-on but a core part of xarray's functionality for parallel computation.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   The code snippets featuring `dask.array` are likely responsible for wrapping dask arrays as xarray objects (DataArrays or Datasets), performing operations on these objects, and possibly converting xarray objects back to dask arrays for computation. This includes re-chunking, performing arithmetic operations, aggregating, and so on.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the issue?**\n   Given the issue's focus on making xarray's parallel computation more flexible, this extensive use of `dask.array` highlights the key areas that need to be refactored to abstract away the direct dependency on dask, thereby allowing other parallel frameworks like cubed to integrate smoothly.\n\n3. **Intended behavior in light of the issue**\n   The intended behavior post-refactoring would be a more modular and flexible system that can accept not just `dask.array` but also other array objects conforming to a specified interface, enabling parallel computation. This suggests a move towards a more plugin-like architecture for handling computations on array-like objects.\n\n### `chunk` and `compute` Methods\n\nThe found instances of `chunk` and `compute` methods in DataArray and Dataset classes give concrete examples of how xarray currently interfaces with dask to manage data chunking and computation.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `chunk` method is used for chunking or re-chunking data into dask arrays with specified chunk sizes, making the data ready for parallel computation.\n   - The `compute` method triggers the computation of dask arrays, converting them from lazy objects into concrete results held in memory.\n\n2. **Relationship with the issue:**\n   These methods represent the critical interface points where xarray interacts with parallel computation frameworks. To support frameworks like cubed alongside dask, these methods (or the system behind them) would need to be made abstract enough to interact with multiple backend libraries, not just dask.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n   Ideally, the refactoring would allow these methods to dynamically dispatch the compute and chunk operations based on the underlying library specified by the user (dask, cubed, etc.), without changing the high-level API for xarray users.\n\n### Missing `ArrayWrapper`\n\nThe lack of results for `ArrayWrapper` indicates there's no direct class with this name handling the wrapping of array objects. This missing piece suggests either the initial query was based on an incorrect assumption about the naming, or xarray currently doesn't have a singular, clear class dedicated to the abstraction of different array-like objects, which is exactly what's needed for the proposed feature.\n\n1. **Intended behavior:**\n   For the issue's goal, an `ArrayWrapper`-like abstraction (though not necessarily named as such) would encapsulate the functionality for wrapping various array types, abstracting away specific calls to dask, cubed, or other array libraries. This would centralize the logic for handling different array objects, making it easier to extend xarray's compatibility with other parallel execution frameworks.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven the focus on making xarray's parallel execution framework agnostic, a few next steps are apparent:\n\n- **Abstracting `chunk` and `compute`:** Investigate and potentially refactor these methods (and others closely related) to enable them to work with a variety of backend libraries, not just dask.\n- **Identifying or Creating Abstraction Layers:** Since the search for `ArrayWrapper` yielded no results, explore the current implementation to identify existing abstraction mechanisms or the need to create new ones that can manage different array types efficiently.\n- **Further API Searches:** Consider searching for interfaces or methods that are specifically used for managing or interacting with dask objects, to understand better how they might be generalized or abstracted to work with other libraries.\n\nThis approach would lay the groundwork for addressing the feature request, pivoting xarray towards a more flexible, extensible system for parallel computation with varied backend libraries."

However, based on the current understanding, we have sufficient context to identify probable locations that would need updates or refactoring to achieve the desired functionality of supporting alternative parallel execution frameworks like cubed alongside dask.\n\n2. **Where are bug locations:**\n\n    - **Location 1:** \n      - File: `xarray/core/dataarray.py`\n      - Class: `DataArray`\n      - Method: `chunk`\n      - **Intended Behavior:** This method, which currently handles chunking for dask arrays, should be refactored to abstract away direct dask calls. Instead, it should dynamically dispatch chunk operations based on the backend library specified (e.g., dask, cubed). The underlying chunking mechanism should detect the specified manager (\"dask\", \"cubed\", etc.) and invoke the corresponding chunk method from the appropriate library. This change would maintain existing functionality for dask while extending support to cubed and potentially other libraries.\n\n    - **Location 2:** \n      - File: `xarray/core/dataarray.py`\n      - Class: `DataArray`\n      - Method: `compute`\n      - **Intended Behavior:** Similar to the `chunk` method, `compute` should also be refactored to support dynamic dispatch based on the specified backend library for computation. The method should abstract the compute calls, allowing for a seamless interchange between dask and other conforming libraries like cubed. The functionality for dask computations remains intact, while the method extends support for alternative libraries following the same or compatible API patterns.\n\n    - **General Refactoring:** Beyond specific methods, the issue hints at a broader refactoring effort across several files and classes (`Dataset` and `Variable` classes might also be involved, given their close relation to `DataArray`). The refactor should aim to introduce an abstraction layer (or utilize an existing pattern) that can generically handle array-like objects from multiple libraries, not limited to dask. This might involve creating new classes or interfaces that abstract the operations required for parallel computations, such as chunking and computing, in a library-agnostic manner.\n\nThese locations and changes aim to preserve existing functionality for users relying on dask, while opening up the architecture to integrate cubed or other libraries as alternative backends for parallel computing within xarray. This strategy enables a plug-and-play model for computational backends, enhancing xarray's flexibility and utility in processing large datasets with diverse computational needs."
