        "intended_behavior": "The method should no longer require the `using` argument. Instead, it should infer the database alias using `self.connection.alias`, thereby simplifying its usage. The method's new signature will be `def execute_sql_flush(self, sql_list):`, and the body of the method should be adjusted to utilize `self.connection.alias` instead of the `using` parameter for any database operations. This change preserves the functionality of executing a list of SQL statements to flush the database while removing the need for callers of the method to specify which database to use, as this can be determined from the context of the `DatabaseOperations` instance."
