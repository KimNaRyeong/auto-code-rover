Given the previous misunderstanding, let's adjust the approach for reproducing the issue. This time, we'll directly target the mechanism of how `@classmethod` and `@property` should be documented, specifically focusing on the problem encountered with Sphinx, based on the context provided.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def inspect_class_property_documentation(cls, property_name):
    """
    Inspect whether the documentation string of a class property (decorated with both @classmethod and @property) is accessible.
    """
    try:
        # Attempt to access the documentation of the class property.
        doc = getattr(cls, property_name).__doc__
        if doc is None:
            raise ValueError(f"Documentation for {cls.__name__}.{property_name} is missing.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False
    return True


class MyClass:
    @classmethod
    @property
    def class_property(cls):
        """This is a class property."""
        return "This should be documented."


def main():
    property_name = 'class_property'
    
    if not inspect_class_property_documentation(MyClass, property_name):
        raise AssertionError(f"Failed to document {MyClass.__name__}.{property_name} correctly.")
    
    print(f"{MyClass.__name__}.{property_name} is documented correctly. Issue either fixed or not reproducible.")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    else:
        exit(0)
```

This script aims to check if the documentation of a class property, decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property`, is accessible through the way Sphinx would attempt to access it. If the documentation string is not accessible (or `None`), it's assumed the issue is present, and the script raises an `AssertionError` along with a descriptive stack trace. Conversely, if the documentation is accessible, the issue might have been fixed in the environment the script is run, or somehow the specific reproduction scenario does not trigger the issue.
