Given the nature of the issue regarding documentation generation with Sphinx and class decorators, a true reproduction outside of using Sphinx to generate documentation might not be feasible. However, one approach to emulate the reproduction scenario as closely as possible in a standalone script involves trying to mimic how Sphinx discovers and documents class properties. This includes reflecting on docstrings for properties decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property`.

The script below simulates this reflection process and will raise an error if it cannot find the documented class method decorated as a property, which mirrors the failure to document in Sphinx described in the issue.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class MyClass:
    _class_property = "This should be documented."
    
    @classmethod
    @property
    def class_property(cls):
        """This is a class property."""
        return cls._class_property

def main():
    # Simulate Sphinx's process to collect documentation strings
    try:
        prop = MyClass.class_property
        doc = MyClass.__dict__['class_property'].__doc__
        if not doc:
            raise AssertionError("Documentation string for MyClass.class_property not found.")

        # Accessing __doc__ directly on the property should also work, but the issue described suggests problems with this approach
        direct_doc = MyClass.class_property.__doc__
        if not direct_doc:
            raise AssertionError("Direct access to documentation string for MyClass.class_property failed.")

        print(f"Documentation found: {doc}")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code if there's an issue

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
    exit(0)  # Exit successfully if no exceptions were raised
```

This script will attempt to access the documentation of a class property marked with both @classmethod and @property in a way similar to how Sphinx would during documentation generation. The critical part of this reproduction is the attempt to access `__doc__` for the property correctly, which is where the original issue arises. If the script can access the documentation string (`__doc__`), it indicates that in this simplified scenario, the problem might not manifest as it does within the Sphinx environment. This script exits successfully if it manages to find and print the documentation string, suggesting the issue would not be reproducible in this direct manner.
