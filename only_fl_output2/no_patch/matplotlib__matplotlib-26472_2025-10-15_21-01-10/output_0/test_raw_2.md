Given the context and requirements around recreating the original issue more accurately and considering the feedback on the previous attempt, below is a refined standalone Python file designed to follow your specifications. Due to the nature of the issue focusing on Jupyter notebook behavior and matplotlib backends, this script attempts to emulate the backend switching process closely. However, accurately simulating or detecting the closing of GUI windows via a script run outside of a Jupyter environment is inherently limited.

This revised script, `reproducer.py`, attempts to replicate the conditions under which the issue occurs as closely as possible within a standalone execution context:

```python
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import traceback
import sys

# Function to print a formatted stack trace for caught exceptions
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_backend_switch():
    try:
        # Attempt to switch to Qt5Agg backend
        matplotlib.use('Qt5Agg')
        plt.figure()
        plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])
        plt.show()

        # Switch back to inline backend
        matplotlib.use('module://ipykernel.pylab.backend_inline')
        plt.figure()
        plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    
    # This part of the code should assert a condition that reflects the GUI window staying open
    # However, as noted, accurately capturing GUI window status here is not feasible.
    # One might consider checking backend types as a proxy for successful switching,
    # even though it doesn't capture the GUI aspect.
    current_backend = matplotlib.get_backend()
    assert current_backend == 'module://ipykernel.pylab.backend_inline', "Backend did not switch back to inline as expected."
    
    print(f"Success: Backend is currently {current_backend}. GUI window behavior cannot be accurately verified in this script.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_backend_switch()
```

Please note the following important considerations:
1. **GUI Window Persistence**: This script cannot accurately verify whether the GUI windows remain open after switching back to the `inline` backend because it doesn't run within a Jupyter Notebook context where the GUI (e.g., Qt5 windows) and `inline` backend switching dynamically interact.

2. **Environment Compatibility**: The script assumes the necessary environment (e.g., availability of 'Qt5Agg' backend and a non-headless execution environment where GUI windows can be created).

3. **Execution Context**: Realistically, reproducing and testing the nuanced behavior described—especially observing GUI windows alongside dynamic backend switching—is inherently suited for a notebook environment rather than a standalone script due to the graphical and interactive nature of the problem.
