Certainly! Below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py`. This script attempts to test the reported issue by switching between `qt5` and `inline` matplotlib backends and asserting whether a plot window remains open or not after the switch. Please note that to effectively check if the GUI window stays open programmatically requires a bit of a workaround, as there is no direct matplotlib API function to list all open figures in a GUI-friendly manner, especially after backend switches. Here, I'm using `plt.get_fignums()` as a proxy to verify if figures are considered open by matplotlib, even though this is more of a check on the matplotlib figure registry than on the actual GUI window state.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from contextlib import contextmanager
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

@contextmanager
def window(block=False):
    try:
        # Switch to qt5 backend
        plt.switch_backend('Qt5Agg')
        plt.ioff()  # Turn interactive mode off
        yield
        plt.show()
        # Assert the figure is considered open before switching back
        assert len(plt.get_fignums()) > 0, "No figures are considered open after plotting with qt5 backend."
        
        # Switch back to inline, expected to close the GUI window
        plt.switch_backend('module://ipykernel.pylab.backend_inline')
        plt.ion()  # Turn interactive mode back on
        assert len(plt.get_fignums()) == 0, "Figures are unexpectedly considered open after switching back to inline."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

def main():
    with window():
        plt.figure()
        plt.plot([1, 3, 2])
    print("Success: The issue is fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script tries to encapsulate the issue into a reproducible scenario and checks the status of opened figure windows via `plt.get_fignums()`. It's important to note, however, this isn't a perfect method for verifying whether the actual GUI windows remain open or not, as `plt.get_fignums()` more directly checks if matplotlib considers figures "open" in its internal registry, which may not perfectly reflect the GUI state post-backend-switch. Due to limitations in programmatically interacting with the GUI from a script, especially across potentially headless execution environments (like CI pipelines or servers), this script aims to approximate the state based on available matplotlib APIs. 

Remember, the script execution conditions and expectations might need adjustments based on the actual graphical and interactive capabilities of the execution environment and the precise behaviors of the matplotlib backends.
