This parameter should default to the current behavior (closing all figures) to preserve backward compatibility but can be set to keep figures open if requested by the user. This modification addresses the primary concern of the bug report by preventing the forced closure of figures on a backend switch, allowing for a more flexible workflow within Jupyter notebooks."

        "intended_behavior": "Enhancing how matplotlib integrates with Jupyter's display mechanisms might be necessary. This might not require a change at a singular method level but could involve a more extensive integration strategy that better supports dynamic backend switching in a notebook environment. This could include detecting when a backend switch is made within a Jupyter notebook and applying different figure handling logic (such as not closing figures or reattaching them to the session) to accommodate the switch."
