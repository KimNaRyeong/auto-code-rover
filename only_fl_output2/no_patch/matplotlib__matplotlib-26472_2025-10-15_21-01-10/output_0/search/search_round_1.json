        "content": "<issue>Switching to inline backend closes GUI windows\n### Bug report\n**Bug summary**\nWhen a plot is made with the `qt5` backend on and then the backend is changed to `inline`, the active plot window(s) are closed. This makes it very difficult to switch cleanly between backends within a notebook. The two mediocre workarounds I can see are:\n- always specify the backend before plotting (since you can't automatically \"switch back\")\n- use `plt.show(block=True)` and switch back to `inline` after the user is done with the GUI figure. This has the downside of locking the Notebook execution while the figure is live.\n**Code for reproduction**\nThe linked gist shows what I'd like to accomplish which is a context manager that enables matplotlib plotting in a GUI window from within a Notebook that is otherwise using the `inline` backend. Basically I want the notebook to use inline (for a variety of reasons), but I occasionally wish I could interact with the data in a separate figure.\nhttps://gist.github.com/flutefreak7/65d824358122360911e2d4c43085007a\nAs a side note, easy switching between `inline` and `notebook`/`widget` backends would also scratch part of this itch, but the interactive notebook backends still don't enable full screen usage or easily throwing a plot on another monitor. `ipyvolume` has full screen figured out, so that seems doable.\nHere's the context manager I wish worked:\n```python\n# Paste your code here\n@contextmanager\ndef window(block=False):\n%matplotlib qt5\nplt.ioff()\nyield\nplt.show()\n# The switch back to inline closes the qt5 plot\nplt.ion()\n%matplotlib inline\nwith window():\nplt.plot([1, 3, 2])\n```\n**Actual outcome**\nThe outcome of the above code is that a plot window flashes into existence for a split second, then is closed when the `%matplotlib inline` call is processed.\n**Expected outcome**\nIt would be great if plots created with the qt5 backend could stay visible while other plots with the inline backend were also being created.  If use `%gui qt` (to establish a reliable event loop) and create a bunch of Qt windows by other means, they live concurrently with the Notebook as long as the kernel is alive. I'd like matplotlib GUI figures to be able to live on regardless of the current backend.\n**Matplotlib version**\n* Operating system:\n* Matplotlib version: 3.1.1\n* Matplotlib backend (`print(matplotlib.get_backend())`): `inline` and `qt5agg`\n* Python version: 3.7.3\n* Jupyter version (if applicable):\n```\njupyter                           1.0.0\njupyter-client                    5.3.4\njupyter-console                   6.0.0\njupyter-contrib-core              0.3.3\njupyter-contrib-nbextensions      0.5.1\njupyter-core                      4.6.0\njupyter-highlight-selected-word   0.2.0\njupyter-latex-envs                1.4.6\njupyter-nbextensions-configurator 0.4.1\njupyterlab                        1.0.5\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather enough context for resolving the issue, we need to understand how `matplotlib` handles backend switches, particularly how it transitions between `qt5` and `inline` backends within a Jupyter notebook. This involves understanding the implementation of backend switching, how plots are displayed when switching between these backends, and how context managers might be used to control this behavior. Given these considerations, here are the API calls that will help gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the part of the code that deals with backend switching within matplotlib: `search_code(\"%matplotlib inline\")` and `search_code(\"%matplotlib qt5\")`. This will help us understand how matplotlib interprets these magic commands to switch backends.\n\n2. Look into how matplotlib initializes or shuts down any Qt event loops when switching to or from the `qt5` backend. This is vital since the problem involves Qt windows being abruptly closed when switching back to the `inline` backend. We would search for methods involved in these processes: `search_method(\"switch_backend\")`, `search_method(\"plt.show\")`, and perhaps directly for Qt related initialization or shutdown methods within matplotlib if such exist: `search_code(\"QtCore.QCoreApplication.instance()\")`.\n\n3. Given the issue involves plotting within a Jupyter notebook, it's also worth looking into how matplotlib interacts with Jupyter's display mechanism: `search_code(\"IPython.display\")`.\n\n4. Lastly, to understand more about the context manager's functionality as described in the issue, especially how it fails to achieve the desired effect, we would search for the use of `plt.ion()` and `plt.ioff()` which are mentioned in the provided code snippet: `search_code(\"plt.ion()\")`, `search_code(\"plt.ioff()\")`.\n\nPerforming these searches should provide a comprehensive view of how backend switching is managed in matplotlib, how it interacts with the Qt backend, and potential reasons why switching back to the `inline` backend causes Qt windows to close. This context will be critical for developing a fix."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results, let's address these questions to understand the relationship between the found code and the reported bug, as well as identify potential areas of focus for a fix.\n\n### Analysis of `switch_backend` in `matplotlib/pyplot.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `switch_backend` function changes the plotting backend used by matplotlib. This change involves closing all open figures (as per line 292) when switching to a new backend, if it differs from the current backend.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - This function directly relates to the issue as it highlights a critical behavior: switching backends closes all open figures. The reported bug involves a window momentarily appearing and then closing when attempting to switch from the `qt5` backend to the `inline` backend, aligning with the described behavior of closing figures upon a backend switch.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Ideally, for the use case presented in the bug, the `switch_backend` functionality might preserve existing figures when switching to `inline` from `qt5`, or at least provide a mechanism to selectively preserve some figures if requested by the user. The current absolute approach of closing all figures may be too restrictive for certain workflows, like the one described.\n\n### Analysis of matplotlib interaction with IPython/Jupyter (`IPython.display`)\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The snippet from `backend_nbagg.py` shows how matplotlib integrates with Jupyter notebooks, using `IPython.display` to display plots inline within notebook cells. \n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - This integration is key to understanding how the `inline` backend displays figures within Jupyter notebooks and may provide insight into why switching back to `inline` from `qt5` behaves as it does. The issue may stem from how the transition between backends is handled, particularly in the context of interactive session management within notebooks.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would allow for seamless switching between backends without disrupting the user's workflow. When switching back to the `inline` backend, figures created with `qt5` would ideally remain accessible or visible, rather than being closed outright.\n\n### Analysis of `plt.ion()` and `plt.ioff()`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - These functions toggle matplotlib's interactive mode. When interactive mode is on (`ion`), figures are drawn automatically. In contrast, with interactive mode off (`ioff`), figures are not shown until explicitly requested (e.g., via `plt.show()`).\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - This functionality is relevant because the bug report mentions using `plt.show(block=True)` as a workaround for keeping GUI figures open. The use of `ion()` and `ioff()` within a context manager aimed at creating a temporary plotting environment suggests a misunderstanding or a workaround rather than a direct solution to the issue.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - In the context of the reported issue, the correct use of `ion()` and `ioff()` within the workflow would manage the interactive drawing of figures such that switching back to the `inline` backend wouldn't necessitate closing the `qt5` figures. Thus, a seamless transition that respects the user\u2019s in-notebook workflow and external GUI interactions is the goal.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven the above analysis, a potential fix could focus on modifying how `switch_backend` handles the closing of figures, perhaps introducing a parameter or mechanism that allows certain figures to remain open upon a backend switch. Additionally, further investigation into how `backend_nbagg.py` manages figures in the Jupyter notebook context could reveal opportunities to support more flexible backend transitions, accommodating workflows that involve frequent backend switching.\n\nSince we didn't find direct references to the Qt event loop initialization/shutdown through `QtCore.QCoreApplication.instance()` search, and `plt.show()` wasn't found directly, we should investigate further how matplotlib's Qt5 backend starts and stops its event loop, as understanding this could be crucial to crafting a workaround or solution. This would involve deeper exploration into both matplotlib's core backend transition mechanisms and its integration with Jupyter's event loop."

This modification addresses the primary concern of the bug report by preventing the forced closure of figures on a backend switch, allowing for a more flexible workflow within Jupyter notebooks.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py`\n  - **Method:** None specified, but considering integration with Jupyter.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Although a specific method within this file isn't pinpointed for the second bug location, enhancing how matplotlib integrates with Jupyter's display mechanisms might be necessary. This might not require a change at a singular method level but could involve a more extensive integration strategy that better supports dynamic backend switching in a notebook environment. This could include detecting when a backend switch is made within a Jupyter notebook and applying different figure handling logic (such as not closing figures or reattaching them to the session) to accommodate the switch.\n\nThe overarching goal for both locations is to refine matplotlib's backend switch functionality to better serve interactive and dynamic plotting workflows, as commonly encountered in Jupyter notebook environments, without disrupting current functionality for other use cases."
