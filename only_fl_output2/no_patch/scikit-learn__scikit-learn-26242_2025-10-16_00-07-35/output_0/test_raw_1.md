Given your clarification and requirements, let's revise the `reproducer.py` script accordingly. This script below is updated to faithfully use the function you provided for stack trace printing. The core aim is to attempt to instantiate an `AdaBoostClassifier` with `base_estimator=None` and to trigger an `AssertionError` if the issue remains, or to silently succeed if the problem is fixed.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
        # Attempt to initialize AdaBoostClassifier with base_estimator set to None
        clf = AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator=None)
        clf.fit([[1]], [0])  # Trigger the fitting process with minimal example data
        print("No exception raised. Issue appears to be fixed.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "The AdaBoostClassifier 'base_estimator=None' issue is present."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script will check if the deprecation and validation handling for `base_estimator=None` in `AdaBoostClassifier` behaves correctly. If the specific error related to this issue is encountered, it will print the stack trace and exit with an assertion error. If the handling has been corrected, and no error occurs, the script will indicate that no exception was raised, suggesting the issue has been resolved. This way, the existence of the bug can be programmatically ascertained.
