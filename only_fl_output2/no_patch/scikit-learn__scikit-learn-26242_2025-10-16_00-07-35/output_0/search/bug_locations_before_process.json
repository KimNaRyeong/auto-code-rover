When validating `base_estimator`, the function should either explicitly allow `None` as a temporary valid option or implement a more generic approach to handle deprecation scenarios gracefully. This could involve modifying how constraints are defined or interpreted to accommodate deprecated values without triggering an error."

        "intended_behavior": "While the exact method for fixing wasn\u2019t explicitly identified, it\u2019s clear that `AdaBoostClassifier` needs to include logic for handling `base_estimator=None` during its initialization or validation process. This might involve updating its parameter handling to translate `base_estimator=None` to use the default estimator without raising any exception. If `_validate_estimator` is the method where `base_estimator` is processed, it should explicitly allow `None` as a value and interpret it as a signal to use the default estimator. Alternatively, if parameter validation is centrally managed, ensuring that the class\u2019s implementation complies with the updated validation logic to properly handle deprecated parameters is necessary."
