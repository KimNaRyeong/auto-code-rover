Because there are also validators in place, old code that explicitly defined `base_estimator=None` stopped working.\nA solution that fixes the deprecation is to add a possible `None` to a list allowed values in `_parameter_constraints`; I will do that in a PR.\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier\nclf = AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator=None)\nclf.fit([[1]], [0])\n```\n### Expected Results\nNo error is thrown.\n### Actual Results\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\nFile \"/Users/marko/opt/miniconda3/envs/orange310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sklearn/ensemble/_weight_boosting.py\", line 124, in fit\nself._validate_params()\nFile \"/Users/marko/opt/miniconda3/envs/orange310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sklearn/base.py\", line 600, in _validate_params\nvalidate_parameter_constraints(\nFile \"/Users/marko/opt/miniconda3/envs/orange310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sklearn/utils/_param_validation.py\", line 97, in validate_parameter_constraints\nraise InvalidParameterError(\nsklearn.utils._param_validation.InvalidParameterError: The 'base_estimator' parameter of AdaBoostClassifier must be an object implementing 'fit' and 'predict' or a str among {'deprecated'}.

        "content": "To effectively address the issue regarding the deprecation of \"base_estimator\" in favor of \"estimator\" and handling of `None` in `AdaBoostClassifier`, we need detailed insights into a few key components within the scikit-learn codebase. Specifically, the `AdaBoostClassifier` class itself, the method where parameter validation happens (likely `_validate_params`, as hinted in the traceback), and possibly any relevant utility functions involved in parameter constraint validation. Given these needs, I propose the following API calls to collect the required context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"AdaBoostClassifier\")`: This call aims to locate the `AdaBoostClassifier` class to understand its current implementation and surrounding code, especially any deprecation handling.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"_validate_params\", \"AdaBoostClassifier\")`: Since the bug references an issue arising from `_validate_params`, examining the implementation of this method within `AdaBoostClassifier` will give insights into how parameter validation and deprecation warnings are currently structured.\n\n3. `search_code(\"validate_parameter_constraints\")`: The exception trace references `validate_parameter_constraints` as the function call where the error is raised. Inspecting its usage will help us understand how parameter constraints are defined and validated across the codebase, which is crucial for introducing support for `base_estimator=None`.\n\nThese targeted searches are designed to piece together a comprehensive view of the relevant parts of the scikit-learn codebase implicated in this bug report, in turn facilitating a well-informed approach to resolving the issue."

        "content": "The information gathered provides insights into the structure of `AdaBoostClassifier` and its relation to the issue at hand. Let's analyze the collected context in relation to the questions above:\n\n### AdaBoostClassifier Class Structure\n\n#### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `AdaBoostClassifier` class code snippet shows the constructor (`__init__`) of the class, listing its parameters, including `base_estimator` marked as `\"deprecated\"` and a new `estimator` parameter that does not appear in the snippet. It also includes several methods like `_validate_estimator`, `_boost`, `_boost_real`, `_boost_discrete`, and various prediction methods.\n\n#### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe relation stems from the constructor parameter `base_estimator=\"deprecated\"`, which indicates an attempt to manage deprecation. Given the issue description, it seems the migration from `base_estimator` to `estimator` has not accounted for scenarios where `base_estimator` is explicitly set to `None` by the user. The code snippet doesn't directly show how `base_estimator=None` is handled, which is central to the bug. Since `_validate_params` wasn't found within `AdaBoostClassifier`, the validation and error message indicating the invalid parameter must be invoked elsewhere, likely within the base classes or utility functions used by AdaBoostClassifier.\n\n#### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior would ideally support a transition phase where `base_estimator=None` is explicitly handled, either by accepting it as a valid parameter value during the deprecation period or by providing a clear, user-friendly error or warning message indicating how to use the new `estimator` parameter instead. This would smooth the transition for existing code bases relying on the default behavior of `AdaBoostClassifier`.\n\n### validate_parameter_constraints Function\n\n#### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\n`validate_parameter_constraints` seems to be the function that performs parameter validation, including checking whether parameters fall within the allowed values or types. This function likely raises exceptions when parameters do not meet predefined constraints.\n\n#### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThis function is directly involved in the bug, as the error trace from the issue description points out that the exception is raised during the execution of `validate_parameter_constraints`. The bug occurs because the validation does not account for `base_estimator=None` as a valid option, despite it being a reasonable setting during the deprecation phase.\n\n#### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior would be to adjust `validate_parameter_constraints` or the parameter constraints definition to accept `None` as a valid value for `base_estimator` during deprecation, allowing for backward compatibility with existing code. This adjustment would prevent the `InvalidParameterError` exception from being raised in cases where `base_estimator=None` is explicitly stated.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the collected context is inadequate to directly address the bug (missing the detailed implementation of `_validate_params` and parameter validation handling), our next step should involve:\n\n1. **Exploring `validate_parameter_constraints` Implementation**: Specifically, we need the implementation details from `sklearn/utils/_param_validation.py` to understand the mechanism of parameter constraint validation and how to incorporate `None` as an accepted value for `base_estimator`.\n\n2. **Investigating Base Class or Utility Method for `_validate_params`**: Since `_validate_params` wasn't found in `AdaBoostClassifier`, it's probable that this validation is performed in a base class or through a utility method that is shared among estimators. It might be beneficial to search the base classes inferred from the snippets or directly explore `sklearn/base.py` for `_validate_params` or equivalent validation hooks.\n\nGiven these considerations, the next steps in API calls should focus on exploring `validate_parameter_constraints` within `sklearn/utils/_param_validation.py` and further investigating `sklearn/base.py` for missing validation logic."

If `base_estimator` is `None` or marks a deprecated usage, it should either be accepted (transitionally) without raising an exception or warn the user to switch to the new `estimator` parameter, rather than fail. This preserves the functionality for codes still using `base_estimator=None`.\n\n- **Expected Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `sklearn/utils/_param_validation.py`\n  - **Method:** `validate_parameter_constraints`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** This method needs to be adjusted to allow `None` as a potential valid value for `base_estimator` during the deprecation transition. Specifically, it should be updated to accept `None` for `base_estimator` as a special case, aligning with the expected behavior of being able to accept `None`.\n\n- **Expected Location 3:**\n  - **File:** `sklearn/base.py`\n  - **Method:** The method that calls `validate_parameter_constraints` or a base class method inherited by `AdaBoostClassifier` that is responsible for invoking parameter validation.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** If `_validate_params` is found here, the method should be updated or configured to correctly handle the deprecation of `base_estimator` specifically accommodating `None` as an accepted value during the deprecation period, thus preventing invalid parameter errors for this specific scenario.\n\nFurther analysis with the requested API calls will solidify these hypotheses and provide the precise locations for fixes."
