Specifically, the focus is on the `tex2uni` method within the `_mathtext_data.py` file. Our goal is to understand the current structure and content of this method to efficiently add the missing mathematical operations.\n\nLet's perform the following API calls for gathering the necessary code context:\n\n1. **Search for the file where the operations are defined**: Since the issue specifically mentions the `_mathtext_data.py` file, we'll first ensure this file contains the `tex2uni` method that we need to modify. A file search is not directly available, but we can infer the file's relevance by searching for the method within it.\n\n2. **Search for the `tex2uni` method within `_mathtext_data.py`**: This will give us an insight into how symbols are currently added and may provide a pattern or structure for adding new ones as listed in the issue.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"tex2uni\", \"_mathtext_data.py\")\n```"

The absence of the `tex2uni` method suggests that either the issue description contains a mistake regarding the method's name or file location, or the method could have been refactored or renamed.\n\nTo proceed, we can explore a few different strategies to get the relevant information:\n\n1. **Search for the `_mathtext_data.py` class**: Since the specific method `tex2uni` was not found, it might be helpful to look at the content of `_mathtext_data.py` to understand the structure and current mathematical operations definitions. This could provide clues about where and how to add the missing operations.\n\n2. **Search broadly for mathematical operations definitions**: It's possible that the method to define mathematical operations exists under a different name or is spread across multiple methods. Searching for code snippets related to mathematical operations or unicode handling might bring us closer to the relevant sections of the codebase.\n\n3. **Search for any class or method that might deal with \"math text\" or \"unicode\" conversions**: The functionality described in the issue is around converting TeX to Unicode, so methods or classes designed for handling mathematical text or Unicode conversions are likely candidates for where these missing operations should be added.\n\nLet's execute revised API calls based on these strategies:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"_mathtext_data\")\nsearch_code(\"math text\")\nsearch_code(\"unicode\")\n```"

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).
