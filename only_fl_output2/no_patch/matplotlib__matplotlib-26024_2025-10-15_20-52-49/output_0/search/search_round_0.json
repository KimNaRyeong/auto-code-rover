Specifically, the focus is on the `tex2uni` method within the `_mathtext_data.py` file. Our goal is to understand the current structure and content of this method to efficiently add the missing mathematical operations.\n\nLet's perform the following API calls for gathering the necessary code context:\n\n1. **Search for the file where the operations are defined**: Since the issue specifically mentions the `_mathtext_data.py` file, we'll first ensure this file contains the `tex2uni` method that we need to modify. A file search is not directly available, but we can infer the file's relevance by searching for the method within it.\n\n2. **Search for the `tex2uni` method within `_mathtext_data.py`**: This will give us an insight into how symbols are currently added and may provide a pattern or structure for adding new ones as listed in the issue.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"tex2uni\", \"_mathtext_data.py\")\n```"
