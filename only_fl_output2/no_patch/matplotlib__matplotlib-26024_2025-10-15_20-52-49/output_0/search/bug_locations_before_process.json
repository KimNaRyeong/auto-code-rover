        "intended_behavior": "The function `get_unicode_index` should be extended or its data source should be updated to include the missing Unicode mathematical symbols. This extension involves ensuring that for each of the new Unicode points specified in the issue, there is a corresponding entry or mechanism within the function or its related data structures that allows for the accurate identification and processing of these symbols as part of matplotlib's math text rendering workflow. The update should enable the system to seamlessly recognize and render these new symbols in math text without impacting the handling of currently supported symbols. This enhancement should be integrated in a way that maintains the general functionality and performance of math text processing within matplotlib."
