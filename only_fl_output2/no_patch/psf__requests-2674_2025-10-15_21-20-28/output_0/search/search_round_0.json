They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)\nThanks!\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue regarding `urllib3` exceptions passing through the `requests` API, we need to gather more context about how `requests` handles exceptions from `urllib3`. Specifically, we'll look for how `requests` wraps `urllib3` exceptions, and if there's handling for `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` from `urllib3`. Since the issue mentions `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` and `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError`, it would be useful to see how these specific exceptions are caught and re-raised within the `requests` codebase. To start, we'll search for the exception handling mechanism used by `requests` that might involve these `urllib3` exceptions.\n\n1. Search for how `requests` wraps or handles `urllib3` exceptions in general.\n   - `search_code(\"urllib3.exceptions\")`\n   \n2. Specifically look for the handling of `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` exceptions within the `requests` codebase.\n   - `search_code(\"urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError\")`\n   - `search_code(\"urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError\")`\n\nThese searches will help us identify where in the `requests` codebase there might be gaps in the wrapping of `urllib3` exceptions or if these exceptions are directly passed through which should not be the case based on the issue description."
