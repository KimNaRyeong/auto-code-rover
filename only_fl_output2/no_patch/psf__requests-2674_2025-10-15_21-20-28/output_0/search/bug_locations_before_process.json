For instance, introducing new exception classes like `RequestDecodeError` and `RequestTimeoutError` that inherit from a common requests exception class, or directly map these `urllib3` exceptions to existing `requests` exceptions that accurately describe the error scenario to the end-user. This would provide a consistent and user-friendly abstraction over `urllib3`."
