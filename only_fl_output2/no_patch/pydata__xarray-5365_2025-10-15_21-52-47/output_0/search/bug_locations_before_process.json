        "intended_behavior": "This file should include the implementation of a new function `cross` mirroring the structure and behavior of the existing `dot` function but specifically for computing vector cross products. It should use `apply_ufunc` internally with `np.cross`, handling dimensions and Dask arrays appropriately. The new function will enable cross product operations across xarray objects (e.g., `DataArray`) while respecting dimensionality, broadcasting rules, and parallel computation capabilities. This would not alter any existing functionality but add a new feature to the xarray library."

        "method": "cross",
        "intended_behavior": "Add a new method `cross` to the `DataArray` class, similar to `dot`. This method would leverage the cross product functionality (as implemented in `computation.py`) to provide a user-friendly interface for computing cross products of two `DataArray` objects. The method should properly validate inputs (e.g., ensuring they have the right dimensions for cross product operation), handle alignment and broadcasting as per xarray norms, and return a new `DataArray` object containing the result of the cross product. This enhancement would expand the mathematical capabilities of xarray objects without impacting existing functionalities."
