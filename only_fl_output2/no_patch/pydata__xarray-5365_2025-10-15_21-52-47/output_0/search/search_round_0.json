        "content": "<issue>Feature request: vector cross product\nxarray currently has the `xarray.dot()` function for calculating arbitrary dot products which is indeed very handy.\nSometimes, especially for physical applications I also need a vector cross product. I' wondering whether you would be interested in having ` xarray.cross` as a wrapper of [`numpy.cross`.](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.cross.html) I currently use the following implementation:\n```python\ndef cross(a, b, spatial_dim, output_dtype=None):\n\"\"\"xarray-compatible cross product\nCompatible with dask, parallelization uses a.dtype as output_dtype\n\"\"\"\n# TODO find spatial dim default by looking for unique 3(or 2)-valued dim?\nfor d in (a, b):\nif spatial_dim not in d.dims:\nraise ValueError('dimension {} not in {}'.format(spatial_dim, d))\nif d.sizes[spatial_dim] != 3:  #TODO handle 2-valued cases\nraise ValueError('dimension {} has not length 3 in {}'.format(d))\nif output_dtype is None:\noutput_dtype = a.dtype  # TODO some better way to determine default?\nc = xr.apply_ufunc(np.cross, a, b,\ninput_core_dims=[[spatial_dim], [spatial_dim]],\noutput_core_dims=[[spatial_dim]],\ndask='parallelized', output_dtypes=[output_dtype]\n)\nreturn c\n```\n#### Example usage\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport xarray as xr\na = xr.DataArray(np.empty((10, 3)), dims=['line', 'cartesian'])\nb = xr.full_like(a, 1)\nc = cross(a, b, 'cartesian')\n```\n#### Main question\nDo you want such a function (and possibly associated `DataArray.cross` methods) in the `xarray` namespace, or should it be in some other package?  I didn't find a package which would be a good fit as this is close to core numpy functionality and isn't as domain specific as some geo packages. I'm not aware of some \"xrphysics\" package.\nI could make a PR if you'd want to have it in `xarray` directly.\n#### Output of ``xr.show_versions()``\n<details>\n# Paste the output here xr.show_versions() here\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\n------------------\ncommit: None\npython: 3.7.3 (default, Mar 27 2019, 22:11:17)\n[GCC 7.3.0]\npython-bits: 64\nOS: Linux\nOS-release: 4.9.0-9-amd64\nmachine: x86_64\nprocessor:\nbyteorder: little\nLC_ALL: None\nLANG: en_US.UTF-8\nLOCALE: en_US.UTF-8\nlibhdf5: 1.10.4\nlibnetcdf: 4.6.1\nxarray: 0.12.3\npandas: 0.24.2\nnumpy: 1.16.4\nscipy: 1.3.0\nnetCDF4: 1.4.2\npydap: None\nh5netcdf: 0.7.4\nh5py: 2.9.0\nNio: None\nzarr: None\ncftime: 1.0.3.4\nnc_time_axis: None\nPseudoNetCDF: None\nrasterio: None\ncfgrib: None\niris: None\nbottleneck: 1.2.1\ndask: 2.1.0\ndistributed: 2.1.0\nmatplotlib: 3.1.0\ncartopy: None\nseaborn: 0.9.0\nnumbagg: None\nsetuptools: 41.0.1\npip: 19.1.1\nconda: 4.7.11\npytest: 5.0.1\nIPython: 7.6.1\nsphinx: 2.1.2\n</details>\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the feature request effectively, we should gather more context about how mathematical operations like dot products are currently implemented and integrated within the `xarray` library. The requester has provided an initial implementation using `xarray.apply_ufunc` to wrap `numpy.cross`. This suggests that understanding the integration and use of `apply_ufunc` could be crucial. Moreover, seeing how `dot` function is implemented and how it fits within the `xarray` structure (e.g., classes where it's used or defined) might provide insights into how best to introduce a cross-product feature. \n\nTherefore, let's perform the following searches:\n- To understand how `apply_ufunc` is used within `xarray`, especially in relation to mathematical operations.\n- To get context on the `dot` method's implementation to see if there's a pattern or a specific way mathematical functions are integrated into `xarray`.\n- To investigate if there are any utility methods or classes that would be relevant for integrating a new mathematical function like the vector cross product.\n\nLet's execute these API calls:\n- search_method(\"apply_ufunc\")\n- search_method(\"dot\")"
