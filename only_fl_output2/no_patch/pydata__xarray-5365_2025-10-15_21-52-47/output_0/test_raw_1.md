Given the context and the request, the previously provided script was designed to simulate the feature request and not directly to reproduce a bug or an issue that triggers an `AssertionError`. To align better with the instruction of reproducing an issue that should raise an `AssertionError` and provide a clearer indication of the feature's absence or presence, we initially need to modify the script to check if `xarray` has the `cross` method or function directly. This modification will aim to explicitly check for the presence of the `cross` functionality within `xarray`, demonstrating a proper way to identify if the feature request is implemented.

Here's an updated version of the script to check for the `cross` method's existence in `xarray`:

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    import xarray as xr
    # Directly check if 'cross' function is present in xarray
    if not hasattr(xr, 'cross'):
        raise AssertionError('xarray does not contain a cross function.')

except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exit with nonzero to indicate the absence of the requested feature
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exit with nonzero for other unhandled exceptions indicating issues

# If the script reaches this point, assume feature is present or issue is not found
print("Feature (xarray cross function) is present.")
exit(0)
```

This script checks for the existence of a `cross` method in the `xarray` namespace directly. If the method is not found, it raises an `AssertionError`, indicating the feature request (vector cross product functionality within `xarray`) has not been implemented. If the method exists, the script exits with code 0, indicating the feature is present or the issue is not found, aligning with the instructions given.
