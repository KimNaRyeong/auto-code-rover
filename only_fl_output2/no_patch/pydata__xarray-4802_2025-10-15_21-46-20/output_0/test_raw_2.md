Given the previous misunderstanding and to ensure correctness this time around, I'll provide you with a revised standalone Python script (`reproducer.py`) that aims to replicate the original issue surrounding `decode_cf` failing when `scale_factor` is a length-1 list. This script is expected to be executed in the root directory of the relevant project.

```python
# reproducer.py

import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    ds = xr.DataArray([0, 1, 2], name='foo',
                      attrs={'scale_factor': [0.01],
                             'add_offset': [1.0]}).to_dataset()
    try:
        xr.decode_cf(ds)
        print("No issue detected, the code executed successfully.")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

def main():
    issue_reproduced = not reproduce_issue()
    if issue_reproduced:
        raise AssertionError('Issue with scale_factor as a length-1 list detected.')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Instructions for Use**:
- Save the above script as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project where you encounter the issue.
- Execute the script by running `python3 reproducer.py`.
  - If the issue is still present, the script will raise an `AssertionError` after printing a detailed stack trace, which shows where the issue occurs.
  - If the issue has been resolved, it prints a message indicating successful execution and does not raise an error, signaling that the problem with handling `scale_factor` as a length-1 list has been fixed.

Note: This script uses the `print_stacktrace` function provided to ensure the stack trace is clearly displayed if an exception occurs, aiding in diagnosing and understanding the issue's context and the location within the code where the failure happens.
