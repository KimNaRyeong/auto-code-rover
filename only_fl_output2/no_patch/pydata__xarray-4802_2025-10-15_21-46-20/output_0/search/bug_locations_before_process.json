        "intended_behavior": "Within the decode method of the CFScaleOffsetCoder class, the process should be modified to handle scale_factor and add_offset attributes when they are provided as length-1 lists, in addition to their handling as scalars or NumPy arrays. The intended behavior should include: 1. Conditional Check for List: Before attempting to use .item() to extract scalar values from scale_factor and add_offset, add a conditional check to determine if these are stored in a list. If so, extract the first element of the list directly. 2. Preserve Existing Functionality: Ensure that the handling of these attributes when provided as NumPy arrays or scalars remains unchanged. This means implementing new logic in a way that it only affects cases where scale_factor and add_offset are indeed lists. For all other data types (e.g., scalar values, NumPy arrays), the existing decoding logic should be executed as before. 3. Robust Extraction: Implement robust extraction logic that handles not only length-1 lists but also performs necessary checks to ensure that lists are not empty and raises an informative error if the list length is greater than 1, as such cases would not be expected and might indicate an issue with the data or its encoding."
