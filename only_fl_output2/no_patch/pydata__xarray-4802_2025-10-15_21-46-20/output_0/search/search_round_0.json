The following code worked as of Xarray 0.16.1\n```python\nimport xarray as xr\nds = xr.DataArray([0, 1, 2], name='foo',\nattrs={'scale_factor': [0.01],\n'add_offset': [1.0]}).to_dataset()\nxr.decode_cf(ds)\n```\nIn 0.16.2 (just released) and current master, it fails with this error\n```\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-2-a0b01d6a314b> in <module>\n2                   attrs={'scale_factor': [0.01],\n3                          'add_offset': [1.0]}).to_dataset()\n----> 4 xr.decode_cf(ds)\n~/Code/xarray/xarray/conventions.py in decode_cf(obj, concat_characters, mask_and_scale, decode_times, decode_coords, drop_variables, use_cftime, decode_timedelta)\n587         raise TypeError(\"can only decode Dataset or DataStore objects\")\n588\n--> 589     vars, attrs, coord_names = decode_cf_variables(\n590         vars,\n591         attrs,\n~/Code/xarray/xarray/conventions.py in decode_cf_variables(variables, attributes, concat_characters, mask_and_scale, decode_times, decode_coords, drop_variables, use_cftime, decode_timedelta)\n490             and stackable(v.dims[-1])\n491         )\n--> 492         new_vars[k] = decode_cf_variable(\n493             k,\n494             v,\n~/Code/xarray/xarray/conventions.py in decode_cf_variable(name, var, concat_characters, mask_and_scale, decode_times, decode_endianness, stack_char_dim, use_cftime, decode_timedelta)\n333             variables.CFScaleOffsetCoder(),\n334         ]:\n--> 335             var = coder.decode(var, name=name)\n336\n337     if decode_timedelta:\n~/Code/xarray/xarray/coding/variables.py in decode(self, variable, name)\n271             dtype = _choose_float_dtype(data.dtype, \"add_offset\" in attrs)\n272             if np.ndim(scale_factor) > 0:\n--> 273                 scale_factor = scale_factor.item()\n274             if np.ndim(add_offset) > 0:\n275                 add_offset = add_offset.item()\nAttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'item'\n```\nI'm very confused, because this feels quite similar to #4471, and I thought it was resolved #4485.\nHowever, the behavior is different with `'scale_factor': np.array([0.01])`. That works fine--no error.\nHow might I end up with a dataset with `scale_factor` as a python list? It happens when I open a netcdf file using the `h5netcdf` engine (documented by @gerritholl in https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/4471#issuecomment-702018925) and then write it to zarr. The numpy array gets encoded as a list in the zarr json metadata. \ud83d\ude43\nThis problem would go away if we could resolve the discrepancies between the two engines' treatment of scalar attributes.\n</issue>"

Given the traceback provided in the issue, I will focus on the following areas:\n\n1. The `decode_cf` function in `conventions.py` as this is the top-level function called.\n2. The `decode_cf_variables` function in `conventions.py` as it's directly involved in the process.\n3. The `decode_cf_variable` function in `conventions.py` since the error traces back through here.\n4. The `decode` method of the class `CFScaleOffsetCoder` within `coding/variables.py` because the error specifically mentions this part of the code.\n5. Examination of how `scale_factor` and `add_offset` attributes are handled, especially when they are Python lists rather than NumPy arrays.\n6. Insight into how `item()` is used in relation to `scale_factor` and `add_offset`.\n  \nLet's initiate the API calls focused on these key points:\n\n- search_method(\"decode_cf\")\n- search_method_in_file(\"decode_cf_variables\", \"xarray/conventions.py\")\n- search_method_in_file(\"decode_cf_variable\", \"xarray/conventions.py\")\n- search_class_in_file(\"CFScaleOffsetCoder\", \"xarray/coding/variables.py\")\n- search_code(\"scale_factor = scale_factor.item()\")\n- search_code(\"add_offset = add_offset.item()\")"
