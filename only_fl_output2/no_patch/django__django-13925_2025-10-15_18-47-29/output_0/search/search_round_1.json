The main points involve models inheriting from other models with manually specified primary keys, along with the configuration related to `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` and how it's currently set or not set within the project's app configurations (`SpeedyCoreAccountsConfig`, `SpeedyCoreContactByFormConfig`, `SpeedyCoreMessagesConfig`, etc.).\n\nGiven these points, here's the plan to gather necessary context:\n\n1. Examine the base `Entity` class that `User` and possibly other models inherit from to see how the primary key is defined there.\n2. Review one or two child models' implementations (like `User`, `ReservedUsername`, and perhaps `FriendshipRequest`) to understand the inheritance and primary key specifications further.\n3. Check the configuration classes like `SpeedyCoreAccountsConfig` mentioned in the issue to see if they have a `default_auto_field` attribute set or need one.\n4. Since the issue mentions a change in behavior between Django versions, it might also be helpful to look for code snippets setting the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` in settings or similar configurations to understand the current setting.\n\nLet's start with the following specific API calls based on this plan:\n\n- `search_class(\"Entity\")`\n- `search_class(\"User\")`\n- `search_class(\"ReservedUsername\")`\n- `search_class(\"FriendshipRequest\")`\n- `search_class(\"SpeedyCoreAccountsConfig\")`\n- `search_class(\"SpeedyCoreContactByFormConfig\")`\n- `search_code(\"DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a broad understanding of how primary keys are being handled in inherited models and how Django's `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` is configured across the project."

        "content": "Analyzing the gathered context provides insights into the structure of the project and how it might be affected by the reported issue.\n\n### Analysis of Context\n\n#### Classes Not Found\nThe search API calls for specific classes like `Entity`, `ReservedUsername`, `FriendshipRequest`, `SpeedyCoreAccountsConfig`, and `SpeedyCoreContactByFormConfig` returned no results. This might indicate several possible scenarios:\n- These classes are dynamically created or not directly defined with typical class definitions, making them not easily detectable by a simple search call.\n- There might be a typo or misunderstanding about the class names.\n- The classes might be part of third-party packages that aren't indexed or are external to the main project codebase.\n\nSince the class `Entity` was specifically mentioned as a base class for `User` but wasn't found, it suggests that our understanding of the inheritance structure may need refinement or that the class is part of an external module not searched correctly.\n\n#### Found Class: `User`\nThe `User` class found in `django/contrib/auth/models.py` as an `AbstractUser` subclass is a default Django model used for authentication. The description does not provide information about how it inherits from `Entity` or a custom primary key definition, indicating that the issue might not be with Django's default `User` model but with a custom `User` model that wasn't found in the search.\n\n#### Code snippets containing `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`\nThe `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` settings were found in several Django core files. This finding is directly related to the warning messages reported in the issue. These settings and their documentation within the code could explain how Django expects `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` to be configured and its default behavior.\n\n### Moving Forward\n\nGiven the direct relation of the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` to the issue, analyzing snippets from files where it was mentioned could provide insight into how Django handles auto-generated primary keys and the impact of setting or not setting this attribute.\n\nHowever, since the initial search missed critical custom classes and configurations mentioned in the issue, further steps should include:\n\n1. Investigating project-specific settings files or configurations that might explicitly set `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` to understand its project-wide default configuration.\n   - A more targeted search in settings or configuration files might reveal where `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` is set within the project.\n\n2. Refining the search for custom models and configurations that were not found, possibly by inspecting imports in known models or configurations for clues to their locations.\n   - Given that specific config classes were not found, checking the project's apps configuration files could be insightful. Applications in Django projects typically have an `apps.py` file where such configurations might reside.\n\n3. Without direct access to these unavailable classes, an alternate approach would be to examine closely related components, such as looking at how `AbstractUser` (found within the Django core for the `User` model) is typically extended, which can offer clues on handling inheritance and primary keys in custom user models.\n\nGiven these points, a potential next step could be:\n- Searching for configuration patterns in commonly used Django settings files or specific application configuration files (`apps.py`) to discover where `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` might be set or overridden.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD\", \"settings.py\")` to check if there's a project-specific setting for `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.\n- Since specific configurations were not found, examining Django documentation or source code comments within the files that contain `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` could offer more generalized insights that need to be adapted to this project's context."

Given the available data and the nature of the issue, the exact locations of the bugs can't be precisely pinpointed without more detailed context or access to the project's codebase. However, based on the understanding of the issue, we can hypothesize the general areas where changes are likely required to address the problem described:\n\n### General Bug Location and Intended Behavior:\n\n- **Bug Location**: Not specifically identifiable without further context.\n- **Classes Involved**: Custom models inheriting from a base model (hypothetical absent model `Entity`), configuration classes such as those analogous to `SpeedyCoreAccountsConfig`, and potentially the project's global settings file (likely `settings.py`).\n\n### Intended Behavior for Hypothetical Bug Locations:\n\n1. **For Custom Models (e.g., `User`, `ReservedUsername`, etc.)**:\n   \n   - **Intended Behavior**: Ensure that models inheriting from a base model (like the missing `Entity` class) correctly inherit or define a primary key. If Django 3.2's check framework is incorrectly flagging these models due to a misinterpretation of their PK fields, verifying the inheritance hierarchy and explicitly stating the primary key field might be necessary. This may involve either confirming the use of `AutoField` or `BigAutoField` explicitly in base models or ensuring the child models do not inadvertently redefine a primary key, thus complicating the inheritance.\n\n2. **For Configuration Classes & Settings**:\n   \n   - **Intended Behavior**: Review and potentially adjust the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting within the project's settings (`settings.py`) or specific app configuration classes (e.g., `AppConfig` subclasses like `SpeedyCoreAccountsConfig`). The goal is to ensure it's set to a value that aligns with the project's needs (e.g., `django.db.models.BigAutoField`). This setting should provide a clear directive to Django on which type of auto-created primary key to use across the board unless overridden locally within models.\n   \n   Without direct access to or explicit mentions of the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting within the project's settings or relevant configuration snippets from the issue description, suggesting a general approach to addressing the warning is the best course of action. The project may need to update this setting to comply with Django 3.2's expectations, hence resolving the model warning `W042`. \n\nIn summary, resolving the issue requires ensuring proper inheritance of primary keys in models and potentially adjusting the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting in the project's configuration to align with Django 3.2's updated requirements. These actions are intended to maintain or enhance the project's functionality with respect to model inheritance and primary key handling."
