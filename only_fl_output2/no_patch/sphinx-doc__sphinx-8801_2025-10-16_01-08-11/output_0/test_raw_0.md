To create a standalone Python script (`reproducer.py`) that reproduces the issue as described, follow the structure below. This script programmatically uses Sphinx to generate documentation, and then checks if the attribute documentation is missing, which should not be the case according to the expected behavior. When the issue is present, it raises an `AssertionError`, and when the issue is fixed, it should exit with code 0 without any errors.

```python
# reproducer.py

def run_sphinx():
    import os
    from sphinx.application import Sphinx

    # Set up paths for Sphinx
    source_dir = 'temp'
    conf_dir = source_dir
    build_dir = os.path.join(source_dir, '_build')
    doctree_dir = os.path.join(build_dir, 'doctrees')

    # Create a minimal Sphinx configuration
    os.makedirs(source_dir, exist_ok=True)
    with open(os.path.join(source_dir, 'conf.py'), 'w') as conf_file:
        conf_file.write("extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']\n")
    
    # Create the Python module to document
    with open(os.path.join(source_dir, 'example.py'), 'w') as example_file:
        example_file.write('''class Foo:
    """docstring"""
    attr1: int  #: docstring

class Bar(Foo):
    """docstring"""
    attr2: str  #: docstring
''')

    # Create an index.rst file including the autoclass directive
    with open(os.path.join(source_dir, 'index.rst'), 'w') as index_file:
        index_file.write('''.. autoclass:: example.Bar
   :members:
   :inherited-members:
''')

    # Run Sphinx
    app = Sphinx(conf_dir, source_dir, build_dir, doctree_dir, 'html')
    app.build()

    return os.path.join(build_dir, 'html', 'index.html')

def check_documentation(html_file_path):
    with open(html_file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as html_file:
        content = html_file.read()

    # Assert that attr1 is documented
    assert 'attr1' in content, 'attr1 documentation is missing'

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        html_file_path = run_sphinx()
        check_documentation(html_file_path)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    else:
        print("Issue is fixed or could not be reproduced.")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script performs the following steps:

1. It sets up a temporary directory structure that Sphinx expects, including a minimal `conf.py` and an `index.rst` that uses the `autoclass` directive to include documentation from the Python module `example.py`.
2. It runs Sphinx to generate the HTML documentation.
3. It reads the generated `index.html` file to check if `attr1` from the `Foo` class is indeed documented as part of the `Bar` class documentation.
4. If `attr1` documentation is missing, it raises an assertion error; otherwise, it prints that the issue is fixed or could not be reproduced.

This approach programmatically automates the steps to reproduce the Sphinx documentation issue related to inherited member documentation being treated as undocumented.
