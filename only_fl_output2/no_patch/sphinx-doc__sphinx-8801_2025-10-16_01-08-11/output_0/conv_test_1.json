It sets up a temporary directory structure that Sphinx expects, including a minimal `conf.py` and an `index.rst` that uses the `autoclass` directive to include documentation from the Python module `example.py`.\n2. It runs Sphinx to generate the HTML documentation.\n3. It reads the generated `index.html` file to check if `attr1` from the `Foo` class is indeed documented as part of the `Bar` class documentation.\n4. If `attr1` documentation is missing, it raises an assertion error; otherwise, it prints that the issue is fixed or could not be reproduced.\n\nThis approach programmatically automates the steps to reproduce the Sphinx documentation issue related to inherited member documentation being treated as undocumented."
