It appears the provided scenario was misunderstood in your earlier request. Given your clarification, below is the revised standalone python file `reproducer.py` to reproduce the initial outlined issue. This script specifically targets the discrepancy in the shape of `coef_` for `linear_model.Lasso` when `fit_intercept=False`.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def main():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn import linear_model

    try:
        # Fitting model with intercept
        est_intercept = linear_model.Lasso(fit_intercept=True)
        est_intercept.fit(np.c_[np.ones(3)], np.ones(3))
        assert est_intercept.coef_.shape == (1, ), "Shape with intercept is incorrect"

        # Fitting model without intercept
        est_no_intercept = linear_model.Lasso(fit_intercept=False)
        est_no_intercept.fit(np.c_[np.ones(3)], np.ones(3))
        
        # This assertion checks if the issue is present
        assert est_no_intercept.coef_.shape == (1, ), "Shape without intercept is incorrect"
        
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exits with error status if the issue is present
    
    print("No issue detected.")
    sys.exit(0) # Exits with success status when issue is fixed

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script specifically asserts the shape of `coef_` for both cases where the model includes an intercept and does not include an intercept. According to the given issue, an `AssertionError` will be raised if the shape of `coef_` when `fit_intercept=False` is not `(1,)`, indicating the presence of the bug. The function `print_stacktrace` will help in debugging by printing the traceback of the error, making it easier to identify exactly where and why the error occurred.
