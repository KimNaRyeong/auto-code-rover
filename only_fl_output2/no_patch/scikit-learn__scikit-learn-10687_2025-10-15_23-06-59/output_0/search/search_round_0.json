        "content": "To address the issue involving the `linear_model.Lasso` class and its handling of `fit_intercept=False`, leading to an incorrect shape of `coef_`, let's define the sequence of API calls to gather the required context:\n\n1. **Search for the `Lasso` class to understand its definition and properties**: This will provide an overview of how the `Lasso` class is implemented, which is essential for understanding how the `fit` method operates, especially when `fit_intercept=False`.\n\n2. **Search for the `fit` method within the `Lasso` class**: This method is directly related to the issue, as it's where the model is trained and the `coef_` attribute is set. Understanding its implementation will help to pinpoint where the shape of `coef_` might be incorrectly handled.\n\n3. **Search for code snippets where `coef_` is being set or modified**: This can provide insights on how `coef_`'s shape is determined and under what conditions it might end up with an unexpected shape. \n\nHence, the API calls would be:\n\n- search_class(\"Lasso\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"Lasso\")\n- search_code(\"coef_\")"
