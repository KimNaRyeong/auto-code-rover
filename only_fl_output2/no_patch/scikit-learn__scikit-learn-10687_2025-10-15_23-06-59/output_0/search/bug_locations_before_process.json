        "intended_behavior": "The `fit` method (whether directly within `Lasso` or inherited from `ElasticNet`) should ensure that when `fit_intercept=False`, the shape of `coef_` is correctly managed as a 1-D numpy array even if the input data is a single feature in shape. This may involve adding conditional checks around the reshaping or setting of `coef_` depending on the `fit_intercept` flag. Any logic that directly influences the shape of `coef_` based on the `fit_intercept` parameter should explicitly ensure that the resulting shape of `coef_` matches the expectation for both cases where `fit_intercept` is `True` or `False`. This adjustment preserves the functionality of allowing users to specify whether an intercept should be fitted while maintaining the integrity and expected behavior of the `coef_` attribute post-fitting."
