Certainly! Below is the standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that is designed to reproduce the issue as described. This script will check if the result of `pairwise_distances` is correct when using the `cosine` metric with different values for `n_jobs`. It will raise an `AssertionError` if the results are zeroes when they shouldn't be, indicating that the issue is present. If the results match the expected output, the script will complete without error.

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_cosine_distances(n_jobs: int):
    X = np.array([
        [1, 3],
        [2, 1],
        [3, 2]
    ])
    distances = pairwise_distances(X, metric='cosine', n_jobs=n_jobs)
    
    # Asserting the correctness of the distances
    expected = np.array([
        [0., 0.29289322, 0.21064778],
        [0.29289322, 0., 0.00772212],
        [0.21064778, 0.00772212, 0.]
    ])
    
    assert np.allclose(distances, expected, atol=1e-7), f"Incorrect cosine distances with n_jobs={n_jobs}"

def main():
    try:
        for n_jobs in [-1, 1, 2]:
            test_cosine_distances(n_jobs)
        print("All tests passed. The issue is fixed or could not be reproduced.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

When executed `python3 reproducer.py`, this script runs the function `test_cosine_distances` with `n_jobs` set to -1, 1, and 2, to check the behavior of `pairwise_distances` with these settings. If the issue is present, it will print the stack trace of the AssertionError, helping to pinpoint the cause. If the issue is not encountered (indicating it may have been fixed or cannot be reproduced under the script's conditions), it will print a success message and exit with code 0.
