Using `n_jobs=1` calculates the expected results.\nUsing the metric `euclidean` returns non-zero results, but the values seem to be integers instead of floats.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances\nX = np.array([\n[1, 3],\n[2, 1],\n[3, 2]\n])\npairwise_distances(X, metric='cosine', n_jobs=-1)\n```\n#### Expected Results\n```\n[[0.         0.29289322 0.21064778]\n[0.29289322 0.         0.00772212]\n[0.21064778 0.00772212 0.        ]]\n```\n#### Actual Results\n```\n[[0 0 0]\n[0 0 0]\n[0 0 0]]\n```\n#### Details\nI executed `pairwise_distances` with different values for `metric` and `n_jobs`. The outputs were as follows:\n```\nX:\n[[1 3]\n[2 1]\n[3 2]]\nmetric=cosine, n_jobs=-1:\n[[0 0 0]\n[0 0 0]\n[0 0 0]]\nmetric=cosine, n_jobs=1:\n[[0.         0.29289322 0.21064778]\n[0.29289322 0.         0.00772212]\n[0.21064778 0.00772212 0.        ]]\nmetric=cosine, n_jobs=2:\n[[0 0 0]\n[0 0 0]\n[0 0 0]]\nmetric=euclidean, n_jobs=-1:\n[[0 2 2]\n[2 0 1]\n[2 1 0]]\nmetric=euclidean, n_jobs=1:\n[[0.         2.23606798 2.23606798]\n[2.23606798 0.         1.41421356]\n[2.23606798 1.41421356 0.        ]]\nmetric=euclidean, n_jobs=2:\n[[0 2 2]\n[2 0 1]\n[2 1 0]]\n```\n#### Versions\n```\nSystem:\npython: 3.6.7 (default, Nov 21 2018, 09:28:58)  [GCC 8.2.1 20180831]\nexecutable: /home/lennart/tool-playground/jupyter/.venv-3.6/bin/python3.6\nmachine: Linux-5.0.9-2-MANJARO-x86_64-with-arch-Manjaro-Linux\nBLAS:\nmacros: NO_ATLAS_INFO=1\nlib_dirs: /usr/lib64\ncblas_libs: cblas\nPython deps:\npip: 19.0.3\nsetuptools: 39.0.1\nsklearn: 0.21.0\nnumpy: 1.16.2\nscipy: 1.2.1\nCython: None\npandas: 0.24.1\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue related to the `pairwise_distances` function returning zeros when calculating `cosine` with `n_jobs` equal to -1 or greater than 2, and the incorrect integer results for the `euclidean` metric, we need to gather more context. Specifically, we should look into how parallel computation is implemented for the `pairwise_distances` function, as the problem seems to arise in parallel mode (`n_jobs=-1` or `n_jobs` greater than 2). Additionally, understanding how the `cosine` and `euclidean` metrics are calculated within this function could give us insights into why the results are incorrect. \n\nGiven these requirements, the following API calls would be relevant:\n\n1. `search_method(\"pairwise_distances\")` - This will help us find where the `pairwise_distances` function is defined, which is crucial since the issue is directly related to this function.\n\n2. `search_method(\"cosine\")` - Since the `cosine` metric calculation is producing zeros in parallel mode, finding where and how it's implemented might reveal potential bugs or miscalculations when `n_jobs` is set for parallel computation.\n\n3. `search_method(\"euclidean\")` - Similar to `cosine`, understanding how the `euclidean` metric is calculated and if it differs in implementation for parallel processing is important, especially since the issue mentions that it returns integers instead of floats.\n\n4. `search_code(\"n_jobs=-1\")` and `search_code(\"n_jobs>\")` - These searches might provide insights into how parallel computation is handled in the codebase and if there are specific conditions or configurations that lead to the observed issues.\n\nThese API calls are designed to collect information on how `pairwise_distances`, its metrics calculations, and parallel computing features are implemented, which is essential for diagnosing and fixing the reported bug."
