        "intended_behavior": "The `pairwise_distances` method should consistently compute the distance matrix for `cosine` and `euclidean` metrics in parallel, matching the results when computed in a non-parallel fashion (e.g., `n_jobs=1`). This implies ensuring that when `n_jobs=-1` or any number greater than 2, the parallel computation mechanism accurately partitions the data, computes distances across all partitions, and aggregates the results without any loss of numerical precision or incorrect handling that would lead to a matrix of zeros (in the case of `cosine`) or integer values (in the case of `euclidean`). The fix should preserve current functionality for all supported metrics, for both sparse and dense matrix inputs, and it should maintain performance optimizations wherever possible. The issue possibly lies in how individual jobs are handled in parallel (e.g., data partitioning, aggregation of results) or in a bug within the parallel backend mechanism that introduces a discrepancy in the calculation or handling of results when jobs are run concurrently."
