Based on the requirements you provided, here is the updated standalone Python file named `reproducer.py`. This script aims to test the behavior of `pairwise_distances` using the `cosine` and `euclidean` metrics with various settings of `n_jobs` and validate the output against the expected results. Upon detecting an anomaly (i.e., all zeros for cosine or integer results for euclidean distances), it prints a detailed stack trace that helps in diagnosing the problem. Here is your updated script:

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_cosine_distances(n_jobs: int):
    X = np.array([
        [1, 3],
        [2, 1],
        [3, 2]
    ])
    
    distances = pairwise_distances(X, metric='cosine', n_jobs=n_jobs)
    expected = np.array([
        [0., 0.29289322, 0.21064778],
        [0.29289322, 0., 0.00772212],
        [0.21064778, 0.00772212, 0.]
    ])
    
    if not np.allclose(distances, expected, atol=1e-7):
        raise AssertionError(f"Incorrect cosine distances with n_jobs={n_jobs}")

def test_euclidean_distances(n_jobs: int):
    X = np.array([
        [1, 3],
        [2, 1],
        [3, 2]
    ])
    
    distances = pairwise_distances(X, metric='euclidean', n_jobs=n_jobs)
    expected = np.array([
        [0., np.sqrt(5), np.sqrt(5)],
        [np.sqrt(5), 0., np.sqrt(2)],
        [np.sqrt(5), np.sqrt(2), 0.]
    ])
    
    if not np.allclose(distances, expected, atol=1e-7):
        raise AssertionError(f"Incorrect euclidean distances with n_jobs={n_jobs}")

def main():
    try:
        for n_jobs in [-1, 1, 2]:
            test_cosine_distances(n_jobs)
            test_euclidean_distances(n_jobs)
        print("All tests passed. The issue is either fixed or could not be reproduced.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script performs the following steps:

- Defines a function `test_cosine_distances` to compute and check the cosine distances for correctness with various `n_jobs` settings.
- Defines a function `test_euclidean_distances` to compute and validate the euclidean distances in the same manner.
- Both functions use `np.allclose` for numerical comparison, considering floating-point arithmetic's nature.
- The `main` function orchestrates these tests for `n_jobs` values of -1, 1, and 2, raising an `AssertionError` with a custom message if the output is incorrect.
- If an assertion is raised, it catches the exception and prints a detailed stack trace using `print_stacktrace`, designed to aid in debugging the issue.
- It ensures the script exits with a status code of 1 if an error occurs, signaling a failure in an automated test environment.

The script should raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present, signaling the presence of the bug under investigation. When executed in an environment where the bug has been fixed, all tests would pass, and it would exit with code 0.
