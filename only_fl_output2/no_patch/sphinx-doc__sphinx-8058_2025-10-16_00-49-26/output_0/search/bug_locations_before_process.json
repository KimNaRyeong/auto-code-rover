        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior in this file is to enhance the `gettext_compact` option to support the merging of all generated message catalogs into a single file for easier upload or distribution, as requested by the issue. This involves modifying or extending the functionality related to `gettext_compact` in a way that allows for compacting not just across similar files or within subsets but across the entire project's output. Preserving existing functionality means ensuring that when `gettext_compact` is set to its current states or default, the behavior remains unchanged, and only alters to merge all files into a single one when specifically requested by the user or configuration. This might involve adding a new method or modifying existing methods that handle the generation and compacting of gettext files, ensuring they can conditionally switch between the current compaction logic and the new, more comprehensive merging logic."
