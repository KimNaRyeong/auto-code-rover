The issue mentions a need for compaction of gettext files, which suggests we are looking for a method or a function responsible for handling gettext operations. Since the actual class, method, or file names were not directly mentioned, we'll need to perform searches based on the keywords and concepts provided in the issue. \n\nFirst, let's find where the `gettext_compact` option is handled or mentioned in the codebase. Then, we will look for functions or methods related to message catalog merging or handling to understand how they currently work.\n\n1. Search for any code snippets mentioning `gettext_compact` to understand where and how it is implemented or used.\n2. Search for classes or methods that might be involved in the compilation or handling of gettext files, given the context of merging message catalogs into a single file.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"gettext_compact\")\nsearch_method(\"merge_message_catalogs\")\n```"
