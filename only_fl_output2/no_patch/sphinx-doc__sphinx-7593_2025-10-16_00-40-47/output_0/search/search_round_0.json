Please describe.**\n[:kbd:](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/roles.html#role-kbd) describes \"a sequence of keystrokes\". Sphinx converts it to a single [`<kbd>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd) element:\n```\n:kbd:`Control-x Control-f`\n```\nbecomes\n```html\n<kbd>Control-x Control-f</kbd>\n```\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nPotentially sphinx could parse the `:kbd:` value and convert it to individual (or nested) `<kbd>` elements, which is what [MDN suggests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd#Representing_keystrokes_within_an_input) as a way to represent key combinations. Something like:\n```html\n<-- Individual -->\n<kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>f</kbd>\n<-- Nested -->\n<kbd>\n<kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>f</kbd>\n</kbd>\n```\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nAlternatively the sphinx user could rewrite their markup:\n```\n:kbd:`Control`\\ -\\ :kbd:`x` :kbd:`Control`\\ -\\ :kbd:`f`\n```\n**Related**\n- https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/3160\n- https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/4197\n</issue>"

Specifically, we need to identify the part of the Sphinx codebase responsible for parsing and converting reStructuredText roles into HTML. Based on the provided description, the relevant Sphinx functionality likely involves parsing reStructuredText syntax and generating corresponding HTML output.\n\nGiven this, here are the API calls I plan to make:\n1. Search for a class or method related to the parsing or rendering of roles in Sphinx. Since the issue describes a feature request about how a specific role `:kbd:` is handled, we're looking for something that processes roles.\n2. Search for any existing implementation or references to `:kbd:` in the Sphinx codebase to identify how it's currently handled.\n\nAPI calls:\n- search_code(\"roles.html#role-kbd\")\n- search_code(\":kbd:`\")\n\nThese searches aim to locate the parts of the Sphinx codebase that handle the `:kbd:` role specifically or roles in general, which will provide the necessary context for the task."
