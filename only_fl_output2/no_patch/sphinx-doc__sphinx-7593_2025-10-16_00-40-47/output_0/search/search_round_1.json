This involves identifying classes or methods responsible for:\n\n1. Parsing reST documents.\n2. Identifying and processing roles within reST (since `:kbd:` is a role).\n3. Converting identified roles into HTML elements.\n\nGiven this revised approach, here are the new API calls we'll make:\n- search_method(\"parse\")\n- search_class(\"HTMLTranslator\")\n- search_method(\"visit_role\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"visit_role\", \"HTMLTranslator\")\n\nThese calls aim to identify parts of the Sphinx codebase where reST is parsed, how roles are processed, and specifically, how documents are translated into HTML.

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

Since the specific search queries did not return results, and without direct access to actual search results from the Sphinx project's codebase, the detailed locations, classes, and methods cannot be accurately provided. However, based on standard Sphinx functionality and the nature of the issue described, we can hypothesize about the general locations and adjustments needed to address the feature request:\n\n- **Bug Location 1:**\n  - **File:** Potentially in a file related to reST parsing or HTML translation, e.g., `roles.py` or a similarly named file that handles the interpretation of roles in Sphinx.\n  - **Class/Method:** A class or method that handles the parsing of the `:kbd:` role specifically, or roles in general if parsing is done collectively.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Modify the existing parsing logic to detect the `:kbd:` role and split its content on spaces or specific delimiters (like `-` for key combinations). Then, for each part of the split content, generate individual `<kbd>` HTML elements or nest them within a parent `<kbd>` element, depending on the intended structure. The modification should ensure it does not affect the handling of other roles or elements negatively.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** In a file responsible for the final conversion of parsed reST elements into HTML, e,g., `html_translator.py` or something similar where the final HTML rendering of roles is handled.\n  - **Class/Method:** `HTMLTranslator` or a similar class with a method responsible for rendering the `:kbd:` role to HTML.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Enhance or add a method to convert the parsed `:kbd:` content (now possibly as a list of keys or commands) into the desired HTML structure. This may involve either appending multiple `<kbd>` tags together for individual keys or wrapping them in a single `<kbd>` tag for nested representation. The approach should be configurable or determined based on best practices or user preference.\n\nTo resolve the issue appropriately, direct analysis of Sphinx's source code might be required to pinpoint the exact locations for modifications. The intended behavior should emphasize backwards compatibility, ensuring that existing documentation using the `:kbd:` role without specifying individual keys continues to render correctly while providing an enhanced representation for more detailed key combinations as specified in the issue request."
