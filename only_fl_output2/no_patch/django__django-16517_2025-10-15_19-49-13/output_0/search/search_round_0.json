        "content": "Based on the description of the issue, we need to gather more context around how the Django admin documentation system interprets and routes view and template names, particularly how they are transformed into URLs. This involves examining the class `ViewDetailView` which is mentioned as the source of the 404 error, and also understanding the mechanism by which view names such as 'orders.views.Orders' are parsed, possibly normalized (to lowercase, as suggested by the issue), and resolved by the system.\n\nTo start, we'll fetch the code around the line attributed to be part of the problem in `django/contrib/admindocs/views.py` and also focus on finding the `_get_view_func` method that is suspected to be involved in changing the case of the view names.\n\n1. Fetch the code context around the mentioned line in the `views.py` file of the `django.contrib.admindocs` module: I am aiming to understand the broader implementation of the doc comment handling and URL resolution.\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"django/contrib/admindocs/views.py\", 168, 10)`\n\n2. The `_get_view_func` method is directly mentioned as a suspect for manipulating the case of the view names. Since it's unclear where this function is exactly defined (whether in the same file or elsewhere), I'll search for this method globally to ensure we find its definition:\n   - `search_method(\"_get_view_func\")`\n\n3. We also need to understand how `ViewDetailView` handles requests, as it's specified as the source of the 404 error. To do this, we'll get the definition of `ViewDetailView`:\n   - `search_class(\"ViewDetailView\")`\n\n4. It can also be useful to investigate how class-based views (such as `OrderSearch` mentioned in the issue) are registered or documented by the admindocs system. Although not directly specified, it would help to search for any code or method that might be handling or registering views for documentation, potentially affecting their resolution:\n   - `search_code(\"class-based view registration admindocs\")`\n\nThese initial queries should provide a good overview of the components involved and possibly highlight where the transformation or error in handling mixed-case view names originates from."
