        "content": "<issue>[ENH]: Allow override of contour level autoscaling\n### Problem\nIn Matplotlib 3, when using a list of values for the `levels` argument in `contour()`, the list of values is overridden in the case that all requested levels fall outside the data range. While this may be desirable for casually browsing data when the user is unfamiliar with the data range, it causes serious problems for batch applications where the user legitimately intends to use their list of levels but does not know whether every input array will produce contours.\nExample:\n```\nmyplot = plt.contour( x , y , data , levels = [100] )\nprint( myplot.levels )\n```\nThe above prints `[0.0]` when `data` is an array of values ranging from 0 to 50 (i.e., the requested contour level of 100 is outside the data range). As a result, the plot contains erroneous contours around near-zero values, presumably due to floating point precision.\nThis is a consequence of the change described here (https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_3.0.0.html?highlight=contour%20levels):\n> Selection of contour levels is now the same for contour and contourf; previously, for contour, levels outside the data range were deleted. **(Exception: if no contour levels are found within the data range, the levels attribute is replaced with a list holding only the minimum of the data range.)**\n### Proposed solution\nAdd a kwarg to `contour()` that overrides the autoscaling behavior. When the kwarg is set, it would trigger a flag in `_process_contour_level_args()` (https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/main/lib/matplotlib/contour.py):\n```\nif not self.filled:\ninside = (self.levels > self.zmin) & (self.levels < self.zmax)\nlevels_in = self.levels[inside]\nif len(levels_in) == 0 and not(OVERRIDE_AUTOSCALE_FLAG):\nself.levels = [self.zmin]\n_api.warn_external(\n\"No contour levels were found within the data range.\")\n```\n</issue>"

What does this part of the code do?\n\n- The `_process_contour_level_args` method is responsible for setting the contour levels based on the arguments provided by the user or defaults determined by the data itself. If `self.levels` is not set (i.e., `None`), it determines what the levels should be based on the input arguments (`args`) or the data type of the z-values (`z_dtype`).\n- For non-filled contours (`if not self.filled:`), it calculates which levels fall within the data range (`self.zmin` to `self.zmax`). If no user-defined levels fall within this range, it resets `self.levels` to a single value list containing `self.zmin`. This behavior is pointed out as problematic in the issue.\n- For filled contours, it enforces a requirement for at least two levels and ensures that all specified levels are in increasing order.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue arises from the automatic resetting of contour levels to `[self.zmin]` when none of the user-specified contour levels fall within the z-data range. This automatic adjustment can be misleading or incorrect for users who have specific needs for contour levels, especially in batch processing or automated plotting contexts. The code in question is directly responsible for this behavior:\n\n```python\nif not self.filled:\n    inside = (self.levels > self.zmin) & (self.levels < self.zmax)\n    levels_in = self.levels[inside]\n    if len(levels_in) == 0:\n        self.levels = [self.zmin]\n        _api.warn_external(\n            \"No contour levels were found within the data range.\")\n```\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior, as per the issue description, would involve modifying this section of the code to incorporate a mechanism (a keyword argument, as suggested) that allows users to override the automatic adjustment of contour levels. Thus, when the override is active, the method should retain the user-specified levels (even if they do not fall within the z-data range) instead of resetting to `[self.zmin]`. This would give users more control over the contour levels used in their plots, ensuring that the plotted data matches their expectations or requirements more closely.\n\nTo implement the proposed solution, one needs to add a new keyword argument that enables this override behavior and update the conditional logic within `_process_contour_level_args` to respect this new flag. This change would allow users to specify contour levels without Matplotlib adjusting them based on the data range, addressing the outlined concern."

This argument could be something like `override_autoscale`, which defaults to `False` to preserve existing functionality for users who rely on the current behavior.\n   - Incorporate conditional logic that checks the value of `override_autoscale`. When it is set to `True`, the method should retain the user-specified contour levels, even if they fall outside the z-data range. This change will ensure that the method does not automatically adjust the levels to `[self.zmin]` when all user-defined levels are outside the data range, thus preserving the user's intention in specifying contour levels.\n   - The existing functionality, such as error checking for filled contours requiring at least two levels and ensuring contour levels are in increasing order, should remain unaffected by this new keyword argument. This approach ensures that the fundamental validations and operational integrity of the `ContourSet` class are preserved.\n   - It is important to update the documentation of the method to include this new keyword argument, explaining its purpose and how it affects the behavior of contour level setting, so that users are well informed on how to use it."
