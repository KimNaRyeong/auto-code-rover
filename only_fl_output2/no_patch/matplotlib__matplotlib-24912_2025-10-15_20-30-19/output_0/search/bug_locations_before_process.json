        "intended_behavior": "The method `_process_contour_level_args` should be modified to accept a new keyword argument that allows users to override the default behavior of adjusting contour levels to fit within the data range. This argument could be something like `override_autoscale`, which defaults to `False` to preserve existing functionality for users who rely on the current behavior. Incorporate conditional logic that checks the value of `override_autoscale`. When it is set to `True`, the method should retain the user-specified contour levels, even if they fall outside the z-data range. This change will ensure that the method does not automatically adjust the levels to `[self.zmin]` when all user-defined levels are outside the data range, thus preserving the user's intention in specifying contour levels. The existing functionality, such as error checking for filled contours requiring at least two levels and ensuring contour levels are in increasing order, should remain unaffected by this new keyword argument. This approach ensures that the fundamental validations and operational integrity of the `ContourSet` class are preserved. It is important to update the documentation of the method to include this new keyword argument, explaining its purpose and how it affects the behavior of contour level setting, so that users are well informed on how to use it."
