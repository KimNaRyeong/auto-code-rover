        "content": "<issue>[ENH]: Allow override of contour level autoscaling\n### Problem\nIn Matplotlib 3, when using a list of values for the `levels` argument in `contour()`, the list of values is overridden in the case that all requested levels fall outside the data range. While this may be desirable for casually browsing data when the user is unfamiliar with the data range, it causes serious problems for batch applications where the user legitimately intends to use their list of levels but does not know whether every input array will produce contours.\nExample:\n```\nmyplot = plt.contour( x , y , data , levels = [100] )\nprint( myplot.levels )\n```\nThe above prints `[0.0]` when `data` is an array of values ranging from 0 to 50 (i.e., the requested contour level of 100 is outside the data range). As a result, the plot contains erroneous contours around near-zero values, presumably due to floating point precision.\nThis is a consequence of the change described here (https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_3.0.0.html?highlight=contour%20levels):\n> Selection of contour levels is now the same for contour and contourf; previously, for contour, levels outside the data range were deleted. **(Exception: if no contour levels are found within the data range, the levels attribute is replaced with a list holding only the minimum of the data range.)**\n### Proposed solution\nAdd a kwarg to `contour()` that overrides the autoscaling behavior. When the kwarg is set, it would trigger a flag in `_process_contour_level_args()` (https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/main/lib/matplotlib/contour.py):\n```\nif not self.filled:\ninside = (self.levels > self.zmin) & (self.levels < self.zmax)\nlevels_in = self.levels[inside]\nif len(levels_in) == 0 and not(OVERRIDE_AUTOSCALE_FLAG):\nself.levels = [self.zmin]\n_api.warn_external(\n\"No contour levels were found within the data range.\")\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "To effectively gather the necessary code context for resolving the issue regarding the override of contour level autoscaling in Matplotlib, I will perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `ContourSet` class because the method `_process_contour_level_args()` is likely to be a part of this class, given its functionality is closely related to how contour levels are processed and plotted:\n   ```\n   search_class(\"ContourSet\")\n   ```\n\n2. Search for the method `_process_contour_level_args()` within the entire codebase to confirm its location and to understand its current implementation, which will be crucial for adding the proposed feature without introducing regressions:\n   ```\n   search_method(\"_process_contour_level_args\")\n   ```\n\n3. Search for code snippets that include checks on contour levels against data ranges. This is essential for understanding how contour levels are currently validated and how to effectively inject the new functionality without disrupting existing logic:\n   ```\n   search_code(\"self.levels > self.zmin) & (self.levels < self.zmax\")\n   search_code(\"self.levels = [self.zmin]\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls are strategically chosen to explore the structure of the relevant Matplotlib component (ContourSet), understand the method where changes are proposed (`_process_contour_level_args()`), and gain insights into the current logic of handling contour levels with respect to provided data ranges. The outcomes of these calls will guide the development of the patch."
