Given the previous attempt didn't reproduce the issue as intended, let's construct another version of `reproducer.py` with attention to ensuring it accurately checks for the issue described. There seems to have been a misunderstanding in interpreting the outcome of the test. This time, we'll correct the assertion logic and ensure it fails under the conditions described in the issue.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
    y = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    Z = np.sin(X) * np.cos(Y)  # Generating a dataset that ranges between -1 and 1

    # Trying to create a contour plot with levels that are outside the range of Z
    try:
        plt.figure()
        cp = plt.contour(X, Y, Z, levels=[2])  # Setting level that does not exist in Z
        plt.close()
        # Checking if Matplotlib modifies the levels as described in the issue
        assert len(cp.levels) == 1 and cp.levels[0] == 2, "Matplotlib modifies the levels unexpectedly."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Issue Detected:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise  # This will ensure that the script exits with an error code if the issue is present.
    except Exception as e:
        print("Unexpected Error:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

    print("No issue detected with contour level autoscaling.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError:
        exit(1)  # Issue is present
    exit(0)  # No issue detected
```

This script specifically checks whether Matplotlib modifies the specified contour levels that are completely outside the data range, which relates directly to the documented issue. If the levels are incorrectly modified (i.e., the specified levels are not used), the script will raise an `AssertionError`, effectively reproducing the issue.
