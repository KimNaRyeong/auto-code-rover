Instead, it is much cleaner to display them using the PEP 604 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0604/) syntax:\n`Union[X, Y, Z]` -> `X | Y | Z`\n`Optional[X]` -> `X | None`\nAdditionally, for `Literal` it is cleaner to strip the text \"Literal\" and just display the literal value with normal Python syntax highlighting:\n`Literal[\"X\"]` -> `\"X\"`\nThis is implemented in the tensorstore documentation via an ast transformation:\nhttps://github.com/google/tensorstore/blob/1a59fcb310bc1feb13569f03f7134b4c3a5fa5f4/docs/tensorstore_sphinx_ext/autodoc.py#L259\nThis should be supported in Sphinx via a config option.  The other improvement, of using syntax highlighting for constants, should also be integrated.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue adequately, we need to gather context about how the Sphinx project currently parses and formats type annotations, particularly for `Union`, `Optional`, `Literal`, and constants. This will require a look at relevant classes or methods that handle such parsing and formatting. Given that the issue specifically mentions `sphinx.domains.python._parse_annotation`, we should start by exploring this method and its surroundings to understand its current implementation and think about how it might be modified to incorporate the requested feature.\n\nHere are the API calls that I would make based on the information provided:\n\n1. `search_class(\"PythonDomain\")`: Since Sphinx extensions are organized by domain, and the mention of `sphinx.domains.python` suggests that the relevant code might be part of a class handling Python domain specifics.\n2. `search_method(\"_parse_annotation\")`: To find where `_parse_annotation` is defined across the codebase, since this is the method specifically mentioned to be in need of improvement.\n3. `search_code(\"def _parse_annotation\")`: This could help pinpoint the exact locations where `_parse_annotation` is defined or overridden, giving a direct entry to the relevant code.\n4. `search_code(\"class PythonDomain\")`: In case the `PythonDomain` class needs to be directly inspected for how it handles or could handle the proposed syntax changes.\n\nThese calls are aimed to give us a broad view of how `_parse_annotation` fits into the larger Sphinx project, the specific file or files it's located in, and how Python domain-specific documentation is handled. Once we have this context, developing a strategy for implementing the changes will be more straightforward."
