        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior is to modify the `digits` function to accept an additional argument, `bits`, which is optional. When the `bits` parameter is provided, the function will prepend zeroes to the digit list such that the total length matches the specified `bits` length, not including the base element in the count. This modification should: Check if the `bits` argument is provided. If not, the function should behave as it currently does. If `bits` is provided, calculate the number of digits returned (excluding the base indicator at the beginning of the list). If the number of digits is less than `bits`, prepend the required number of zeros to meet the `bits` length. This change must ensure that it does not alter the function's behavior for existing callers not using the new `bits` argument, thus preserving backward compatibility. Ensure that the sign of the base (positive for positive numbers and negative for negative numbers) is correctly maintained at the start of the list, as per the current documentation and examples."
