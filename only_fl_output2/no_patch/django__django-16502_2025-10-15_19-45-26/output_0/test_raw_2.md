Based on the issue description and the requirement to check the behavior of Django's `runserver` with HTTP `HEAD` requests, below is a `reproducer.py` script that can be executed to reproduce the issue. This script is designed to automate the setup of a Django project, start the development server, send a `HEAD` request, and check if the response contains a body. It incorporates the specific function to print the stack trace clearly in case of failures or exceptions.

```python
import subprocess
import sys
import os
import http.client
import threading
import time
import traceback

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def make_head_request():
    """Function to make a HEAD request to the local Django development server."""
    conn = http.client.HTTPConnection("127.0.0.1", 8000)
    try:
        conn.request("HEAD", "/")
        response = conn.getresponse()
        data = response.read()
        return data
    finally:
        conn.close()

def run_django_server():
    """Function to start the Django development server."""
    subprocess.run([sys.executable, 'manage.py', 'runserver'])

def setup_django_project():
    """Function to set up a new Django project."""
    subprocess.run([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', 'Django>1.10,<1.11'])
    project_name = "django_test"
    subprocess.run([sys.executable, '-m', 'django', 'startproject', project_name])
    return project_name

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        project_name = setup_django_project()
        os.chdir(project_name)
        # Start Django development server in a new thread
        t = threading.Thread(target=run_django_server, daemon=True)
        t.start()
        time.sleep(5)  # Give the server some time to start

        body = make_head_request()

        # Check if the response body is empty
        assert body == b'', "HEAD request response must be empty as per RFC2616."
        print("Test passed: No response body returned for HEAD request.")
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(2)
    else:
        exit(0)
```

This script will:

1. Install the specified Django version (between 1.10 and 1.11) if it's not already present.
2. Create a new Django project named `django_test`.
3. Navigate into the project directory.
4. Start Django's development server (`runserver`) on a separate thread to avoid blocking the main script execution.
5. Make a `HEAD` request to the root URL (`/`) of the application.
6. Verify the expectation that the response body should be empty for a `HEAD` request.
7. Use the prescribed function to print detailed stack traces in case of any exceptions. 

Make sure to execute this script in an environment where Python and Django are correctly set up and where the script has permission to install packages and create files/directories.
