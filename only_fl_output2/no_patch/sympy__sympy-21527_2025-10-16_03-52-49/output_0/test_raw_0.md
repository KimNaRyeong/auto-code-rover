Below is the `reproducer.py` standalone Python file designed to reproduce the issue as specified. It attempts to solve several simple systems of linear equations using SymPy's `linsolve` and asserts that the solution should be consistent across the attempts. If the behavior is as expected, it exits with code 0, indicating no issue. If the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace, helping to debug the discrepancy observed in the solutions provided by `linsolve`.

```python
import sympy
from sympy import symbols, Eq, linsolve

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_linsolve_consistency():
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    results = []

    # Define the equations with slight variations in the multiplier of x
    multipliers = [0.0215, 0.0216, 0.0217]
    for multiplier in multipliers:
        result = linsolve([Eq(y, x), Eq(y, multiplier * x)], (x, y))
        results.append(result)

    # Expect all results to be the same, indicating consistent behavior
    try:
        assert results[0] == results[1] == results[2], "linsolve failed to maintain consistency across similar equations"
        print("No issue detected.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_linsolve_consistency()
```

This script checks for consistency in the behavior of `linsolve` across similar systems of equations by expecting all three tests to yield the same solution. If the solutions differ, suggesting a potential issue in how `linsolve` handles numerical coefficients near each other in value, it prints a detailed stack trace to aid in debugging.
