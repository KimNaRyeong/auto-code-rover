        "intended_behavior": "The `linsolve` method should more robustly handle floating-point coefficients close in value, ensuring consistent solutions across mathematically equivalent or very close systems of equations. Specifically, it should include a preprocessing step to detect if the equations involve floating-point coefficients that are close in value and, if so, apply an appropriate strategy to handle them consistently\u2014perhaps by using a symbolic or rational representation internally for greater numerical stability in solutions. This change must preserve `linsolve`'s existing functionality for all other cases while ensuring that the method returns consistent results for systems with slightly different floating-point coefficients."

        "intended_behavior": "Enhance the precision handling or representation of `Float` objects when used in symbolic equations, especially within the context of linear solvers like `linsolve`. The goal is to minimize the impact of floating-point arithmetic issues (like rounding errors) that may lead to inconsistencies in equation solving outcomes. This may involve implementing a check or conversion mechanism that ensures numerical precision is maintained or enhanced when floating-point numbers are part of a symbolic equation, without undermining the performance or general usability of the library."
