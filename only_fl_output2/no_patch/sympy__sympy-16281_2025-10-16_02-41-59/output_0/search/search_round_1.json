Keeping everything below the horizontal line is good, but the bottom looks asymmetric, and it makes the \u220f bigger than it needs to be.\n- The \u220f is too fat IMO.\n- It might look better if we extended the top bar. I'm unsure about this.\nCompare this\n```\n\u221e\n\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\n\u2502     \u2502  1\n\u2502     \u2502  \u2500\u2500\n\u2502     \u2502   2\n\u2502     \u2502  n\nn = 1\n```\nThat's still almost twice as wide as the equivalent Sum, but if you make it much skinnier it starts to look bad.\n```\n\u221e\n____\n\u2572\n\u2572   1\n\u2572  \u2500\u2500\n\u2571   2\n\u2571   n\n\u2571\n\u203e\u203e\u203e\u203e\nn = 1\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the obtained context:\n\n### 1. Product Class Definition in sympy/concrete/products.py\n\nThe `Product` class, found in `sympy/concrete/products.py`, is a subclass of `ExprWithIntLimits`, which suggests it is an expression with integral limits, fitting the description of symbolic products like those in the issue. It contains several methods related to product operations, optimizations, evaluations, and properties but does not directly implement a `pprint` method. \n\n**Relationship with the bug:** Since the `Product` class does not have a custom `pprint` method, the pretty printing functionality for objects of this class is likely handled by a more generic system within the codebase that deals with printing or presentation of symbolic expressions. \n\n**Intended behavior:** The intended behavior for the `Product` class in terms of pretty printing would be to format its output more compactly and symmetrically, as described in the issue.\n\n### 2. pprint Method\n\nThe search for a `pprint` method both within the `Product` class and in the general codebase yielded no direct hits. This hints that the pretty printing functionality may either be part of a larger system under a different name, or it could be relying on a visitor pattern or similar, where pretty printing is determined by type matching at runtime, rather than by direct method calls.\n\nGiven the lack of direct results for `pprint`, to progress:\n\n- We need to locate the system or module responsible for pretty printing. This could be part of a utility package, a visitor pattern implementation, or something like a printer or formatter class.\n- Since `pprint` is a common terminology but wasn't directly found, it's possible the functionality resides under a different naming convention or is part of a more generic printing or formatting system.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nConsidering the structure of libraries like SymPy, pretty printing capabilities are often implemented through a visitor pattern or through a dedicated printing system that handles various types of expressions dynamically. Knowing this, more specific steps could include:\n\n1. **Search for a printing or formatting system:** Since the direct `pprint` search was fruitless, identifying the subsystem responsible for formatting expressions is crucial. SymPy, for example, has a sophisticated printing system that could be managing this.\n\n2. **Investigate `ExprWithIntLimits` for clues on printing behavior:** As `Product` inherits from `ExprWithIntLimits`, any printing behavior impacting `Product` could potentially be defined or overridden in this superclass or related printing mechanisms.\n\nGiven the new direction:\n\n- **Search the codebase for clues related to printing mechanisms specific to SymPy** (or the relevant system). This could involve searching for classes or modules named along the lines of `Printer`, `Formatter`, or similar.\n- **Look into how `ExprWithIntLimits` interacts with the printing system**, which might involve searching for how instances of such classes are handled by the broader printing or formatting mechanism in the codebase.\n\nLet's make the following API calls:\n\n- `search_code(\"Printer\")`\n- `search_code(\"Formatter\")`\n- `search_class(\"ExprWithIntLimits\")`"

Since we do not have direct information on a specific part of the code responsible for the issue with pretty printing, identifying exact bug locations is challenging without additional context. However, based on the general knowledge of how libraries like SymPy operate, we can infer potential locations and describe intended behaviors for a hypothetical resolution:\n\n- **Buggy locations**: The specific file, class, or method cannot be pinpointed without additional details on the printing mechanism. However, it's likely that the changes needed to address the issue would be in a printing or formatting class or module that handles `Product` objects. Such a mechanism would be responsible for generating the string representation of `Product` objects in a pretty-printed format.\n\n- **Intended behavior**: To resolve the issue, the intended behavior would include:\n  - **Removing the additional empty line** beneath the bottom line of the product pretty print representation. This implies adjusting the logic that generates the bottom part of the pretty print output to ensure it matches the top part more symmetrically, making the overall representation more compact.\n  - **Making the \u220f symbol less fat**: This would involve adjusting the spacing and padding around the text to ensure that the symbol and surrounding characters are more proportionally spaced, improving readability and aesthetic appeal.\n  - **Extending the top bar optionally**: If feasible, providing an option to extend the top bar more symmetrically around the \u220f symbol might be desired for consistency with other symbolic representations. This could be an optional feature toggled by a parameter in the pretty print function call.\n  \nWithout access to specific code parts responsible for this functionality, these intended behaviors remain speculative and need validation against the actual printing mechanism's implementation."
