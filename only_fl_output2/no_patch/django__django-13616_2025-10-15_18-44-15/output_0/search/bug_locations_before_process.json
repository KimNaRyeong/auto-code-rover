        "intended_behavior": "This file should include improved error handling to provide a clearer and more actionable message when a `locale` directory is missing. Instead of failing silently or delivering a vague error message, it should: - Check for the existence of a `locale` directory within the application or project root (where `manage.py` resides). - If the directory is not found, the error message should suggest checking for the `locale` directory's existence and provide a hint or prompt to create one if it doesn't exist. - Additionally, it may be beneficial to include a verbose option or debug mode that outputs more detailed information about the directories being searched. This could aid in diagnosing path-related issues."
