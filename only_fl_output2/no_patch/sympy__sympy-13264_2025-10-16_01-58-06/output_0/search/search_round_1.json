Full script is attached in the .zip file:\n[simplify_last_step.zip](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/files/76131/simplify_last_step.zip)\n---\nI've been using Sympy to compute Laplacian in different geometrical coordinates system. This usually creates extremelly long expressions and simplify usually does a great job. However, I've come against one particular case where simplify does most of the job but doesn't perform the ultimate simplification step.\nI've reduced the problem set getting rid of all of the Derivative terms. The initial\nexpression is still huge (675 ops!):\n![initial_expression](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072960/a0c94034-b0b6-11e5-8626-90608bf70b84.png)\nA first call to `simplify` sucessfully reduces it to :\n![simplify](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072961/b681be7e-b0b6-11e5-9ddd-e5d077329773.png)\nWhich is great (23 ops), but somehow frustrating as we can factorize it a little more. If I apply `simplify` again, then I get the expression I wanted (7 ops):\n![simplify_bis](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072964/d2760f7c-b0b6-11e5-9562-37d4d32c9b88.png)\n---\nIf simplify worked perfectly, `simplify(simplify(expr))` shouldn't yield a different result from `simplify(expr)`\nFrom my understanding of how simplify works, it successively tries different simplification strategies  and compares them. In that case, the order of the different strategies matters. In my particular case, the strategy than eventually did the final factorisation step may have been called to early.\nI fixed that calling simplify again. We could fix it applying an optional recursive mode at the end of the simplify function:\n``` python\ndef simplify(expr, ratio=1.7, measure=count_ops, fu=False, max_rec_steps=0):\n\"\"\"\nSimplifies the given expression.\nInput\n========\nmax_rec_steps: int\nif >0, simplified is applied recursively with a maximum of 'max_rec_steps'\ntimes.\n(...)\n\"\"\"\n(...)\nif measure(expr) > ratio*measure(original_expr):\nexpr = original_expr\nif max_rec_steps>0 and measure(expr)<measure(original_expr):\nsexpr = simplify(expr, ratio, measure, fu, max_rec_steps=max_rec_steps-1)\nexpr = shorter(expr,sexpr)\nreturn expr\n```\nI can make the pull request if that helps.\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analysis of the Collected Context\n\n#### 1. Overview of the `simplify` Method Locations\n\nThe `simplify` method appears in numerous files throughout the Sympy codebase. However, the specific context of the issue points us towards the version in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`. This is presumably the most general-purpose version of `simplify`, applicable to a wide range of expressions, and the one most likely to be relevant to the issue described. The other instances of `simplify` across the codebase might be specialized for specific data types or mathematical structures like matrices, vectors, or boolean algebra.\n\n#### 2. The Specific `simplify` Implementation\n\nThe code snippet found in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` contains a conditional check that ensures the simplified expression does not have a larger complexity measure (typically counted by the number of operations) than the original expression multiplied by a given ratio. This is a safeguard to prevent the `simplify` function from returning a result more complex than the input, based on the specified `measure` function and `ratio`.\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThe conditional check at lines 610-611 acts as a fallback mechanism. If the simplification process results in an expression that is deemed more complex than the original (adjusted by the `ratio` parameter), the original expression is returned instead of the simplified one. This is meant to avoid situations where the simplification process inadvertently makes the expression more cumbersome.\n\n- **Relationship between this part of the code and the bug**\n\nThe issue described suggests that `simplify` doesn't always perform the last step of simplification that could lead to a further reduced form of the expression. The described behavior is not directly related to the safeguard mechanism found in the code snippet (the fallback to the original expression if the result is more complex). However, it points towards a missing or misprioritized simplification strategy within the `simplify` method's overall logic.\n\n- **Intended behavior of this part of the code given the issue description**\n\nWhile the specific code snippet is not where the bug fix would likely be applied, understanding its role is crucial for any modifications. Enhancing `simplify` to allow an optional recursive simplification process (as suggested in the issue) would involve additional logic both before and possibly after this fallback mechanism. The intended behavior would involve a controlled recursion where `simplify` can be reapplied under controlled conditions to further reduce the complexity of an expression. This would need to be implemented in a way that respects the original intent of the fallback mechanism\u2014preventing the return of more complex expressions than the input.\n\n### Next Steps in Context Gathering\n\nGiven our analysis, the next steps would involve examining how `simplify` decides on and applies different simplification strategies. Specifically:\n\n1. **Understand the Simplification Strategy Selection Process:**\n   - This would require examining the parts of the code that lead up to the decision point captured by the snippet in our results (lines 607-613). How does `simplify` choose which strategies to apply, and in what order?\n\n2. **Identify Where a Recursive Simplification Option Could be Integrated:**\n   - We need to locate the portion of the code where the addition of a recursive simplification parameter (`max_rec_steps`) could be logically and efficiently integrated.\n\nTo proceed, we should examine the broader structure and logic of the `simplify` method around and preceding the retrieved code snippet:\n\n- **Examine the Structure and Logic Around the Snippet:**\n   - Use `get_code_around_line(\"sympy/simplify/simplify.py\", 610, 20)` to see more context around the safeguard mechanism and possibly identify where in the code different simplification strategies are applied or selected."

To resolve the issue, the intended behavior would include an enhancement for supporting an optional recursive simplification mode. This means adding a mechanism to check if additional simplification passes can yield a simpler expression without increasing its operational complexity unjustifiably. The recursion should be carefully controlled by the newly introduced `max_rec_steps` parameter to avoid infinite recursion or excessive computation time. The modification should ensure that after each simplification cycle, the method checks whether the newly simplified expression is indeed simpler than the previous one, using the `measure` function for evaluation. If further simplification is possible (and `max_rec_steps` permits it), the method should recursively apply itself to the expression.\n\n   - To implement this, an additional check around or after the existing condition (lines 610-611) should be introduced to evaluate whether another pass of simplification could be beneficial, based upon the `max_rec_steps` parameter and current complexity measure of the expression. This recursion should be handled with caution to maintain the method's efficiency and ensure it does not lead to performance degradation for the majority of use cases.\n\n   This enhancement will address the issue by enabling `simplify` to perform multiple simplification steps when it's advantageous and permitted by parameters, hence potentially achieving simpler expressions in cases where a single application leaves room for further simplification."
