        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior is to enhance the `simplify` method to potentially invoke itself recursively for further simplification passes, controlled by a new argument `max_rec_steps`. This enhancement would allow `simplify` to iteratively apply its simplification strategies to the result of the previous iteration, further reducing the complexity of the expression when possible without degrading performance for general usage."
