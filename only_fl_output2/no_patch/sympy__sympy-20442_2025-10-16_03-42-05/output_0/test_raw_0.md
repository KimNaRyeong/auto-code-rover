This script attempts to reproduce the issue as described. It uses an assertion to check the output of the `convert_to` function in `sympy` when converting joules per second to joules. The expected behavior, based on the description, would be for this operation to incorrectly yield `joule**(7/9)`. If the operation does not yield this result due to a fix or misunderstanding of the issue, the assertion will fail, and the script will print a stack trace of the failure point, indicating the issue is either not present or has been addressed in versions of `sympy` beyond 1.4. The try-except blocks ensure meaningful error display and appropriate exit codes for automation scenarios.
