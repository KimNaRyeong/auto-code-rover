Specifically, when handling conversions that do not align directly with the target units, it should return expressions that respect the dimensions or raise informative errors if the conversion cannot be logically achieved. Enhancements may include refining the logic that handles dimensionality analysis and ensuring that unit conversion laws are adhered to rigorously."

Any improvements or checks added to the `util.py`'s `convert_to` should be reflected here as well. Moreover, there ought to be validations to confirm that the dimensions of the \"other\" (target units) indeed match the quantity's dimensions intending to be converted, and if not, proper error handling or informative messaging should be incorporated."
