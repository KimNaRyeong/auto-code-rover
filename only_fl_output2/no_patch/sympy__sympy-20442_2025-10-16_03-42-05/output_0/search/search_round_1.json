Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\n```\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\njoule**(7/9)\n```\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\n```\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\njoule*second\n```\n```\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\nkg*m**2/s\n```\n```\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\nJ*mins/60\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given the results from the API calls, let's break down the obtained context to answer the questions above and think about the possible next steps:\n\n1. **convert_to method locations**:\n    - `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py`: Units and quantities are fundamental to handling physical dimensions in sympy, so the occurrences here likely involve converting quantities with units to other units, which is directly related to the bug.\n    - `sympy/physics/units/util.py`: This might contain utility functions for unit conversion, offering a highly relevant context to the issue.\n    - `sympy/polys/domainmatrix.py`: The occurrences here may not be directly related to the physical unit conversion issue but more to internal representations of matrices within different domains, which could be orthogonal to the problem at hand.\n\n2. **Code snippets containing `joule`** and **`kg`**:\n    - The definition of `joule`, `kg`, and possibly other units within `sympy/physics/units/__init__.py`, `sympy/physics/units/systems/si.py`, and `sympy/physics/units/definitions/unit_definitions.py` is fundamental to understanding how sympy sets up its unit system. This connection is directly related to the bug since the issue involves an unexpected conversion involving joules.\n    - The `si.py` and `length_weight_time.py` files under `systems` likely define how the SI system is implemented and how length, weight, and time are treated in conversions. This is crucial for solving the issue, as the unexpected behavior occurs during a conversion involving these base units.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**:\n    - Based on the issue description, the `convert_to` method is expected to handle conversions between different units intelligently. For the case mentioned (`Joule*second` being converted to `Joule`), the expected behavior would involve either leaving the expression as it is, converting it appropriately to an equivalent expression in target units (if possible), or raising an informative error if the conversion doesn't make sense. The current behavior where `Joule*second` converts to `joule**(7/9)` is undoubtedly incorrect and suggests that the conversion logic fails to account for certain combinations of units or unit powers.\n\nGiven these insights, the following steps would be pertinent:\n\n1. **Investigate `convert_to` implementations** in `quantities.py` and `util.py` to understand the conversion logic and where it might be failing or becoming nonsensical for the issue's specific case.\n   \n2. **Review unit definitions** in `units/__init__.py`, `units/systems/si.py`, and `definitions/unit_definitions.py` to see how `Joule`, `kg`, `m`, and `s` (and their combinations) are defined since an oversight here could be contributing to improper conversions.\n\nFor a deeper analysis, additional API calls should focus on the content of `util.py` and `quantities.py` where `convert_to` is defined, as well as a detailed look into the definitions within the `si.py` and `definitions/unit_definitions.py` to gather context on how units are mathematically related within sympy's framework."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Thus, we do need more context to precisely identify and address the bug. Here are the API calls to make:\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"convert_to\", \"sympy/physics/units/quantities.py\")\nsearch_method_in_file(\"convert_to\", \"sympy/physics/units/util.py\")\n```\n\n2. **Bug Locations**\n\n- **Location 1**: \n   - **File**: `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py`\n   - **Class**: Potentially within any class related to quantities handling unit conversions.\n   - **Method**: `convert_to`\n   - **Intended Behavior**: This method should accurately convert between units, especially in cases involving complex units like Joules*second. It should either successfully convert to the desired unit if directly applicable, return the expression in equivalent base units if a direct conversion to the target unit is not possible, or raise a meaningful error for conversions that are impossible or ambiguous. It should ensure to handle power and multiplication operations between units correctly without introducing inaccurate simplifications or conversions.\n\n- **Location 2**:\n   - **File**: `sympy/physics/units/util.py`\n   - **Class**: N/A (Utility functions may not necessarily be within a class)\n   - **Method**: `convert_to`\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Similar to Location 1, the `convert_to` method in this utility file should be capable of handling unit conversions accurately. Given the peculiar conversion described in the issue (Joule*second to Joule resulting in Joule**(7/9)), this method should have logic to identify and correctly handle or flag conversions involving combinations of units that aren't straightforward or involve unclear dimensional analysis.\n\nThe resolution of the issue involves ensuring these `convert_to` methods correctly interpret and process complex unit expressions, adhering to dimensional analysis principles without introducing incorrect simplifications. This may involve patching the algorithm that powers the conversion to respect the natural limitations and expectations of physical unit conversions."
