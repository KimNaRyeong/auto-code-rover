        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue described, we need to locate where `pytest.raises` is being utilized in the manner described by the user. The issue revolves around a specific use case where a string comparison fails despite the strings appearing to be identical. This suggests a deeper inspection of the `pytest.raises` implementation or usage is necessary, especially in how it handles the `match` parameter with strings that contain parentheses.\n\nGiven the information, the integration with `pytest.raises` and the generation of the error message are key points of interest. The minimal example indicates the use of a custom exception (`MismatchedIndexValueError`) and assembling a dynamic message for the `match` parameter. The detailed description mentions a desire for `pytest.raises` to better handle situations where strings containing parentheses are involved, which suggests this is a problem related to regular expression processing of the `match` string.\n\nBased on this, the following search API calls are relevant:\n\n1. **Search for the custom exception definition**: If `MismatchedIndexValueError` is a custom exception used in the codebase, finding its definition could provide context on how exceptions are structured and potentially how they're being caught or raised within the `pytest.raises` context.\n   \n2. **Search for usage of `pytest.raises` with `MismatchedIndexValueError`**: Since the issue occurs within a `pytest.raises` block, specifically when using `MismatchedIndexValueError` and assembling a message for match, looking for this pattern could help find relevant usage examples or potentially problematic code paths.\n\n3. **Search for modifications or extensions of `pytest.raises`**: If the codebase has customized or extended `pytest.raises` functionality, there might be modifications relevant to the issue, especially regarding string matching and message generation.\n\nBased on these considerations, the concrete API calls would be:\n\n- `search_class(\"MismatchedIndexValueError\")`\n- `search_code(\"pytest.raises(MismatchedIndexValueError, match=\")`\n- `search_method(\"raises\")`\n\nThese searches aim to find where `MismatchedIndexValueError` is defined, how `pytest.raises` is used in conjunction with this exception and the `match` parameter, and if there are any custom implementations or wrappers around `pytest.raises` that could affect its behavior."

        "content": "Given the results from the search API calls, we have two main avenues of investigation: the lack of results for `MismatchedIndexValueError` both as a class and in context with `pytest.raises`, and the findings of methods named `raises` in `testing/code/test_excinfo.py` and `src/_pytest/python_api.py`.\n\n1. **`MismatchedIndexValueError` Not Found**: \n   - This implies that the error mentioned in the issue description may not be a custom exception defined within the codebase or was possibly mistyped. It suggests that the focus should shift towards how `pytest.raises` is generally used for string matching, particularly in cases where the match parameter is involved.\n   - The absence of `MismatchedIndexValueError` in search results disconnects it directly from the bug, suggesting either a misinterpretation or that our focus should be on the handling of the `match` parameter within `pytest.raises`.\n\n2. **Methods Named `raises` Found**:\n   - The files `testing/code/test_excinfo.py` and `src/_pytest/python_api.py` containing methods named `raises` are of significant interest. The `src/_pytest/python_api.py` file, in particular, sounds like it could contain the core functionality of `pytest.raises`, which is directly related to the issue at hand. The test file may provide examples of use or specific test cases covering the use of `raises`, but `python_api.py` is likely where the implementation resides.\n   - Considering the bug description, the intended behavior of the code found within these parts should allow for detailed, precise matching of error messages, even when those messages include characters that could be interpreted as special characters in regular expressions (like parentheses). The fact that an identical string is not matched suggests a problem in how regular expressions are compiled or matched within `raises`.\n\nTo further investigate, we would ideally look into how `pytest.raises` is implemented in `src/_pytest/python_api.py` to understand its matching logic, and how it handles strings with special characters. Additionally, inspecting the use and implementation of `raises` in `testing/code/test_excinfo.py` might reveal how it's tested and if there are any tests related to string matching that might highlight the issue described. \n\nGiven this analysis, the next logical steps would involve:\n- Inspecting the implementation of `raises` in `src/_pytest/python_api.py` to see how match parameters are handled.\n- Looking at tests involving `raises` in `testing/code/test_excinfo.py` could uncover how this functionality is expected to behave under various circumstances, possibly revealing assumptions or missed edge cases.\n\nTherefore, pertinent follow-up actions would be to:\n- Get more concrete context on the `raises` methods implementation from `src/_pytest/python_api.py`.\n- Investigate how `raises` is tested in `testing/code/test_excinfo.py`.\n\nThese steps should clarify the mechanisms at play and potentially identify the cause of the issue or at least narrow down the areas of concern."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

The issue suggests a problem with matching error messages that contain parentheses or other special regex characters. Thus, the intended behavior is to ensure that when a string containing special regex characters is passed to the `match` argument, it is either correctly escaped or appropriately handled so that the raw string comparison does not fail due to unescaped special characters. The implementation should preserve its ability to accept regex patterns for more flexible matching but also handle plain strings containing characters that could be misinterpreted by the regex engine without explicit escaping by the caller. This might involve automatically detecting whether the provided string is meant to be a regex or a plain string and processing it accordingly, or improving documentation and error messaging to guide users on how to properly escape strings when necessary. \n\nThis adjustment or improvement would address the confusion illustrated by the issue, where users expect a string match to work with plain strings, including those with special characters, without diving into regex syntax."
