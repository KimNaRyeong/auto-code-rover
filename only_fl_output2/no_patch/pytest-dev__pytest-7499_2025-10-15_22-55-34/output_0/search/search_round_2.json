The issue revolves around a specific use case where a string comparison fails despite the strings appearing to be identical. This suggests a deeper inspection of the `pytest.raises` implementation or usage is necessary, especially in how it handles the `match` parameter with strings that contain parentheses.\n\nGiven the information, the integration with `pytest.raises` and the generation of the error message are key points of interest. The minimal example indicates the use of a custom exception (`MismatchedIndexValueError`) and assembling a dynamic message for the `match` parameter. The detailed description mentions a desire for `pytest.raises` to better handle situations where strings containing parentheses are involved, which suggests this is a problem related to regular expression processing of the `match` string.\n\nBased on this, the following search API calls are relevant:\n\n1. **Search for the custom exception definition**: If `MismatchedIndexValueError` is a custom exception used in the codebase, finding its definition could provide context on how exceptions are structured and potentially how they're being caught or raised within the `pytest.raises` context.\n   \n2. **Search for usage of `pytest.raises` with `MismatchedIndexValueError`**: Since the issue occurs within a `pytest.raises` block, specifically when using `MismatchedIndexValueError` and assembling a message for match, looking for this pattern could help find relevant usage examples or potentially problematic code paths.\n\n3. **Search for modifications or extensions of `pytest.raises`**: If the codebase has customized or extended `pytest.raises` functionality, there might be modifications relevant to the issue, especially regarding string matching and message generation.\n\nBased on these considerations, the concrete API calls would be:\n\n- `search_class(\"MismatchedIndexValueError\")`\n- `search_code(\"pytest.raises(MismatchedIndexValueError, match=\")`\n- `search_method(\"raises\")`\n\nThese searches aim to find where `MismatchedIndexValueError` is defined, how `pytest.raises` is used in conjunction with this exception and the `match` parameter, and if there are any custom implementations or wrappers around `pytest.raises` that could affect its behavior."

It suggests that the focus should shift towards how `pytest.raises` is generally used for string matching, particularly in cases where the match parameter is involved.\n   - The absence of `MismatchedIndexValueError` in search results disconnects it directly from the bug, suggesting either a misinterpretation or that our focus should be on the handling of the `match` parameter within `pytest.raises`.\n\n2. **Methods Named `raises` Found**:\n   - The files `testing/code/test_excinfo.py` and `src/_pytest/python_api.py` containing methods named `raises` are of significant interest. The `src/_pytest/python_api.py` file, in particular, sounds like it could contain the core functionality of `pytest.raises`, which is directly related to the issue at hand. The test file may provide examples of use or specific test cases covering the use of `raises`, but `python_api.py` is likely where the implementation resides.\n   - Considering the bug description, the intended behavior of the code found within these parts should allow for detailed, precise matching of error messages, even when those messages include characters that could be interpreted as special characters in regular expressions (like parentheses). The fact that an identical string is not matched suggests a problem in how regular expressions are compiled or matched within `raises`.\n\nTo further investigate, we would ideally look into how `pytest.raises` is implemented in `src/_pytest/python_api.py` to understand its matching logic, and how it handles strings with special characters. Additionally, inspecting the use and implementation of `raises` in `testing/code/test_excinfo.py` might reveal how it's tested and if there are any tests related to string matching that might highlight the issue described. \n\nGiven this analysis, the next logical steps would involve:\n- Inspecting the implementation of `raises` in `src/_pytest/python_api.py` to see how match parameters are handled.\n- Looking at tests involving `raises` in `testing/code/test_excinfo.py` could uncover how this functionality is expected to behave under various circumstances, possibly revealing assumptions or missed edge cases.\n\nTherefore, pertinent follow-up actions would be to:\n- Get more concrete context on the `raises` methods implementation from `src/_pytest/python_api.py`.\n- Investigate how `raises` is tested in `testing/code/test_excinfo.py`.\n\nThese steps should clarify the mechanisms at play and potentially identify the cause of the issue or at least narrow down the areas of concern."

Thus, the intended behavior is to ensure that when a string containing special regex characters is passed to the `match` argument, it is either correctly escaped or appropriately handled so that the raw string comparison does not fail due to unescaped special characters. The implementation should preserve its ability to accept regex patterns for more flexible matching but also handle plain strings containing characters that could be misinterpreted by the regex engine without explicit escaping by the caller. This might involve automatically detecting whether the provided string is meant to be a regex or a plain string and processing it accordingly, or improving documentation and error messaging to guide users on how to properly escape strings when necessary. \n\nThis adjustment or improvement would address the confusion illustrated by the issue, where users expect a string match to work with plain strings, including those with special characters, without diving into regex syntax."

Let's analyze the context based on the provided code snippets and how they relate to the issue reported.\n\n### Analysis of Collected Code Snippets:\n\n- **Snippet 1 & 2 (Overloads):**\n  The first and second snippets appear to be function overloads of `raises`, which are used for type hinting and providing multiple ways to use the function. The first overload hints at a version of `raises` that is focused on the expected exception and an optional match parameter, likely intended for matching exception messages with a string or regex pattern. The second overload introduces another version that expects a callable along with any arguments, presumably the function to be executed and tested for raising exceptions.\n\n- **Snippet 3 (Implementation):**\n  The third snippet likely contains the actual implementation of `raises`. It accepts an expected exception (or a tuple of exceptions), arbitrary positional and keyword arguments. This flexibility suggests it's designed to handle the function execution and match exception messages dynamically.\n\n### Relation to the Bug:\n\nThe bug reported deals with the `match` parameter and its handling of strings with special characters like parentheses. Given the snippets, especially the first one showing the `match` parameter explicitly, the critical part of the code seems contained within or related to how the `match` parameter is processed to compare against an exception's message.\n\n### Intended Behavior Based on Issue Description:\n\n- **What it does**: From the context, the `raises` function is designed to assert that a specific exception is raised within a block of code or a callable passed to it. The `match` parameter's role is to further assert that the exception message matches a given string or regex pattern.\n  \n- **Relationship with the bug**: The issue arises in the handling or interpretation of the `match` parameter, specifically when the string to be matched contains characters that are special in the context of regular expressions (like parentheses). The reported bug highlights a failure in matching strings that visually appear identical.\n\n- **Intended behavior**: To resolve the reported issue, the `raises` function should either:\n  1. Automatically escape special regex characters in strings provided to the `match` parameter when it detects that the intention is a direct string match rather than a regex pattern. This would help prevent confusion when an apparently identical string does not match due to unescaped special characters.\n  2. Clearly document the behavior and expectations regarding the `match` parameter, indicating that users should manually escape special characters when intending a direct string match. Additionally, improving the error message to suggest this when a match fails could significantly enhance usability.\n  3. Implement a more intelligent detection system within `raises` that can infer whether the user intends a regex match or a literal string match and handle the input accordingly.\n\nImplementing any of these strategies would align with the intended behavior of making the match functionality more intuitive and less error-prone, especially for users unaware of the intricacies of Python's regular expressions when dealing with special characters."

This could be achieved by enforcing a modified behavior where:\n    1. Before performing the match operation, check if the `match` parameter is a plain string that includes characters that could be misinterpreted by the regex engine (e.g., parentheses, brackets). If such characters are detected, automatically escape them before proceeding with the match.\n    2. Enhance the documentation around the `match` argument inside the `raises` method documentation. Specifically, clarify that when passing a string to match against exception messages, special regex characters will be treated as part of the regex pattern unless escaped. Additionally, consider providing a utility function or a simpler interface for users who want to perform a literal match without manually escaping characters, thus improving the user experience and reducing the likelihood of confusion.\n    3. Optionally introduce logging or a more descriptive error message when matches fail, especially if it seems related to unescaped special characters. This could guide users towards the correct usage of the match parameter, enhancing clarity and decreasing user errors.\n  \n  This intended behavior preserves the existing functionality for users who are already using regex patterns with the `match` parameter. It also introduces a more intuitive behavior for new or less experienced users who might expect a plain string comparison to work without considering regex-specific characters. This approach balances the flexibility of regex pattern matching with the simplicity of direct string comparisons, reducing potential confusion and making the `match` feature more robust and user-friendly."
