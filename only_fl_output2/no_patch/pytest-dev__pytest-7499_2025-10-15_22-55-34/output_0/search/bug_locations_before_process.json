        "intended_behavior": "To address the issue, the implementation of the 'raises' method should be updated to deal with the match parameter more effectively. This could be achieved by enforcing a modified behavior where: 1. Before performing the match operation, check if the 'match' parameter is a plain string that includes characters that could be misinterpreted by the regex engine (e.g., parentheses, brackets). If such characters are detected, automatically escape them before proceeding with the match. 2. Enhance the documentation around the 'match' argument inside the 'raises' method documentation. Specifically, clarify that when passing a string to match against exception messages, special regex characters will be treated as part of the regex pattern unless escaped. Additionally, consider providing a utility function or a simpler interface for users who want to perform a literal match without manually escaping characters, thus improving the user experience and reducing the likelihood of confusion. 3. Optionally introduce logging or a more descriptive error message when matches fail, especially if it seems related to unescaped special characters. This could guide users towards the correct usage of the match parameter, enhancing clarity and decreasing user errors."
