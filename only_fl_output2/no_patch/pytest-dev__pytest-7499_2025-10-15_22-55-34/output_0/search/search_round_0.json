        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue described, we need to locate where `pytest.raises` is being utilized in the manner described by the user. The issue revolves around a specific use case where a string comparison fails despite the strings appearing to be identical. This suggests a deeper inspection of the `pytest.raises` implementation or usage is necessary, especially in how it handles the `match` parameter with strings that contain parentheses.\n\nGiven the information, the integration with `pytest.raises` and the generation of the error message are key points of interest. The minimal example indicates the use of a custom exception (`MismatchedIndexValueError`) and assembling a dynamic message for the `match` parameter. The detailed description mentions a desire for `pytest.raises` to better handle situations where strings containing parentheses are involved, which suggests this is a problem related to regular expression processing of the `match` string.\n\nBased on this, the following search API calls are relevant:\n\n1. **Search for the custom exception definition**: If `MismatchedIndexValueError` is a custom exception used in the codebase, finding its definition could provide context on how exceptions are structured and potentially how they're being caught or raised within the `pytest.raises` context.\n   \n2. **Search for usage of `pytest.raises` with `MismatchedIndexValueError`**: Since the issue occurs within a `pytest.raises` block, specifically when using `MismatchedIndexValueError` and assembling a message for match, looking for this pattern could help find relevant usage examples or potentially problematic code paths.\n\n3. **Search for modifications or extensions of `pytest.raises`**: If the codebase has customized or extended `pytest.raises` functionality, there might be modifications relevant to the issue, especially regarding string matching and message generation.\n\nBased on these considerations, the concrete API calls would be:\n\n- `search_class(\"MismatchedIndexValueError\")`\n- `search_code(\"pytest.raises(MismatchedIndexValueError, match=\")`\n- `search_method(\"raises\")`\n\nThese searches aim to find where `MismatchedIndexValueError` is defined, how `pytest.raises` is used in conjunction with this exception and the `match` parameter, and if there are any custom implementations or wrappers around `pytest.raises` that could affect its behavior."
