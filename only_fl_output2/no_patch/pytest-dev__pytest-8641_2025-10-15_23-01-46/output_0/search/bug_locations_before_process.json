This means adjusting the regex to recognize patterns like %(levelname)-5.5s and correctly apply them, ensuring that colorized output is provided regardless of these precision specifiers in the format string. The update should preserve the existing functionality for format strings without precision specifiers, maintaining backward compatibility and supporting all valid Python logging formatter specifications."

There's a need to make sure that any changes to LEVELNAME_FMT_REGEX are compatible with how the format method processes and colorizes log messages. If necessary, adjustments to the format method should be made to accommodate the enhanced regex matching capabilities, ensuring that log messages are colorized correctly when precision specifiers are used in the levelname portion of the format string."
