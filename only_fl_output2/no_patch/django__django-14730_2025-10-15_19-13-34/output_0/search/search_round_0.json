However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.\n</issue>"

Here are the API calls we might need:\n\n1. **Search for the ManyToManyField class**: Understanding the structure and methods of the ManyToManyField class is crucial. We need to see how it's currently handling the `symmetrical` attribute and where the best place might be to add the new validation.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"ManyToManyField\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for where ManyToManyField is defined or used**: This will help us understand if there's a specific method that processes the `related_name` attribute that could be relevant for adding our validation.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"ManyToManyField\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for the initialization method of ManyToManyField**: Since we're interested in adding validation during the definition of a ManyToManyField, the initialization method is a likely place for this logic.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"ManyToManyField\")\n   ```\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive starting point to understand how `ManyToManyField` is implemented and where we can introduce a check to prevent developers from defining a `related_name` on symmetrical `ManyToManyFields`."
