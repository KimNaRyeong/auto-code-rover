        "intended_behavior": "The `__init__` method should include a new validation segment after determining the value of `symmetrical`. This segment should check if `symmetrical` is `True` and `related_name` is provided (not `None`). If both conditions are met, the method should raise a ValueError (or a more specific custom exception), indicating that specifying a `related_name` for symmetrical `ManyToManyField` is invalid. This ensures clarity for developers about the non-creation of the related field on the target model when `symmetrical=True` and preserves the congruity and integrity of the model relationships by preventing misuse. This intended change is designed to alert developers early in the development process to an incorrect use of `ManyToManyField`, preventing bugs and confusion that might result from misunderstanding the purpose and behavior of the `symmetrical` attribute in relation to `related_name`."
