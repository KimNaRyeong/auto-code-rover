        "intended_behavior": "The `get_cmap` function should be modified to correctly retrieve colormaps by their registered names, irrespective of their original instantiation name. This entails ensuring that the lookup mechanism within `get_cmap` honors the name given at the time of registration done through `register_cmap`. If a colormap was registered with a new name, this name should uniquely identify the colormap within the entire matplotlib session. This modification should not affect the ability to retrieve built-in colormaps by their original names, preserving existing functionality while correcting the issue of recognizing custom registered colormap names."

        "method": "register_cmap",
        "intended_behavior": "While `register_cmap` seemingly behaves correctly by allowing a colormap to be registered under a new name, it should ensure that any references, internal mappings, or name-based lookups are consistently updated to reflect the new name. This includes making sure that the colormap object itself, if it retains any self-referential name attribute, is either updated or irrelevant to how `get_cmap` conducts its search. The primary objective is to maintain a consistent and reliable naming convention that applies both to the registration process and subsequent retrieval, without disrupting the registration of new colormaps or the override functionality for built-in maps."
