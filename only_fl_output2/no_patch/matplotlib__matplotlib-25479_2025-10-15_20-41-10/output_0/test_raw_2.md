Based on your requirements and the specifics of the given issue, I'm creating a python script `reproducer.py` that aims to replicate the problem as described. This script will follow the steps outlined in your initial problem description, attempt to use a registered colormap, and should fail (raising an `AssertionError` if the issue is present or exit with code 0 if the issue has been corrected in the version of matplotlib you are using).

Please see the revised `reproducer.py` below which is designed to run as you specified:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from matplotlib import cm
    from matplotlib.colors import LinearSegmentedColormap
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib

    print(f"Using matplotlib version: {matplotlib.__version__}")

    # Define colormap data and create a LinearSegmentedColormap
    my_cmap_data = [
        [1.5e-03, 4.7e-04, 1.4e-02],
        [2.3e-03, 1.3e-03, 1.8e-02],
        [3.3e-03, 2.3e-03, 2.4e-02],
    ]
    my_cmap = LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list('some_cmap_name', my_cmap_data)

    # Register the colormap using a name different from its internal name
    cm.register_cmap(name='my_cmap_name', cmap=my_cmap)

    # Attempt to use the registered colormap
    try:
        plt.figure()
        plt.imshow([[1, 2], [3, 4]], cmap='my_cmap_name')
        plt.colorbar()
        plt.close()
        print("Colormap registered and used successfully. This likely indicates the issue has been fixed.")
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The colormap could not be used with its registered name.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script scrutinizes the process of:
1. Creating a custom colormap.
2. Registering this colormap under a name that is different from its initial (creation-time) name.
3. Attempting to use this colormap by referring to its registered name when drawing a plot.

**Expected behavior:** If the issue is present, the script should raise an `AssertionError` due to the ValueError thrown when trying to set the colormap by its registered name.

**Outcome:** If the code exits with status `0` and does not print a stack trace or raise an `AssertionError`, this would suggest that the described issue has been addressed or is not present in your version of matplotlib.
