It seems there was an error related to the method used to register a colormap, likely due to confusion about the correct method or module where this functionality resides. Let's correct that and ensure the script is capable of correctly reproducing the intended issue.

Please note, in the latest versions of Matplotlib, the correct method to register a colormap can be found under `matplotlib.colormaps` rather than directly under `matplotlib.cm` or the reported method that caused the issue.

Given that, the following script is designed to reproduce the issue while adhering to the API correctly. However, it's worth mentioning that as of my last update, the `register_cmap` method should typically be called on `matplotlib.colormaps` in the newest versions of Matplotlib. If you're using an older Matplotlib version (as indicated by version `1.4.3`), the structure and method calls could differ significantly. For the purpose of this example, I'm assuming a newer version is being used, but will adjust to closely match the initial scenario:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from matplotlib.colors import LinearSegmentedColormap
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib

    # Check matplotlib version
    print(f"Using matplotlib version: {matplotlib.__version__}")

    my_cmap_data = [
        [1.5e-03, 4.7e-04, 1.4e-02],
        [2.3e-03, 1.3e-03, 1.8e-02],
        [3.3e-03, 2.3e-03, 2.4e-02],
    ]
    my_cmap = LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list('some_cmap_name', my_cmap_data)

    try:
        # Change to matplotlib.cm.register_cmap or matplotlib.colormaps.register
        # based on the Matplotlib version used.
        plt.colormaps.register(name='my_cmap_name', cmap=my_cmap)
    except AttributeError as e:
        print("Trying an alternative registration method due to error:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        matplotlib.cm.register_cmap(name='my_cmap_name', cmap=my_cmap)  # For older versions

    try:
        plt.set_cmap('my_cmap_name')
        plt.imshow([[1, 1], [2, 2]])
        plt.colorbar()
        plt.savefig('test_plot.png')  # Save the plot to verify the correct colormap is used
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Failed to use the registered colormap.") from e

    print("The script executed successfully; no assertion error was raised.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this script:
- The colormap is created and attempted to be registered using the newer `plt.colormaps.register` method, with a fallback to `matplotlib.cm.register_cmap` for older versions.
- The script then attempts to use the registered colormap and will print a stack trace if it fails at any point.
- An `AssertionError` is raised if there's a problem using the registered colormap, ensuring it's clear when the issue is present.
