 randMatrix won't generatte symmetric sparse matrices
When setting the percent parameter to anything else than 100, randMatrix fails to generate symmetric matrices. Consider the following examples:

' ' ' 
In [1]: import sympy

In [2]: from sympy.matrices import randMatrix

In [3]: randMatrix(3, symmetric=True, percent=1)
Out[3]: 
Matrix([
[13, 61, 13],
[59, 29, 59],
[88, 13, 61]])

In [4]: randMatrix(3, symmetric=True, percent=50)
Out[4]: 
Matrix([
[90, 60,  0],
[ 0,  0,  0],
[60, 59, 25]])

In [7]: randMatrix(3, symmetric=True, percent=99)
Out[7]: 
Matrix([
[0, 0, 19],
[0, 0,  0],
[0, 0,  0]])

In [9]: randMatrix(3, symmetric=True, percent=0)
Out[9]: 
Matrix([
[78, 78, 61],
[68,  8, 61],
[22, 68,  8]])

Also, the documentation says `If percent is less than 100 then only approximately the given percentage of elements will be non-zero.`, but the behaviour is the opposite. Setting it to 100 (default) produces the expected behaviour.

The problem happens with both the released version from pypi and git master.
