This ensures that the resulting matrix is both sparse and symmetric as intended. \n\nThe existing functionality for generating non-symmetric random matrices or fully filled symmetric matrices (when `percent=100`) should remain unaffected. The adjustment should only modify the behavior when generating symmetric matrices with `percent` < 100. Specifically, the implementation needs to:\n\n1.
