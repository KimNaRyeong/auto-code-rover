Search for the `randMatrix` method across the entire codebase to find where it is implemented.\n2. Since the issue specifically mentions a problem with symmetric matrices and the `percent` parameter, searching for code snippets that include `symmetric=True` and `percent` within the implementation of `randMatrix` could provide additional insights.\n3. Given the issue's mention of the problem existing in both the released version from PyPI and the git master, it would be helpful to look at documentation strings related to `randMatrix`, particularly those mentioning the `percent` parameter, to understand the intended functionality.\n\nTherefore, the API calls I would like to make are:\n\n- search_method(\"randMatrix\")\n- search_code(\"symmetric=True\")\n- search_code(\"percent\")"
