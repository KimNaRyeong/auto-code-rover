        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `randMatrix` method should be adjusted to ensure that when generating symmetric matrices with a `percent` parameter less than 100, the sparsity is applied in such a way that maintains symmetry. This means that for any element `(i, j)` that is set to zero, its symmetric counterpart `(j, i)` should also be set to zero if not already. This ensures that the resulting matrix is both sparse and symmetric as intended. \n\nThe existing functionality for generating non-symmetric random matrices or fully filled symmetric matrices (when `percent=100`) should remain unaffected. The adjustment should only modify the behavior when generating symmetric matrices with `percent` < 100. Specifically, the implementation needs to:\n\n1. Generate a list of indices for the upper triangle of the matrix (including the diagonal since it's symmetric).\n2. Randomly select a subset of these indices based on the specified `percent` parameter. This subset represents the positions that will retain non-zero values.\n3. For each selected position `(i, j)`, ensure the symmetric position `(j, i)` is also included in the subset if it\u2019s not already.\n4. For all indices not in the subset, set the corresponding elements in the matrix to zero.\n5. This procedure should replace the current logic for introducing zeros (lines 1412-1415) while maintaining the initial symmetric assignment of random numbers (lines 1403-1409).\n\nThis approach maintains the intended sparsity percentage as closely as possible, while ensuring the symmetry of the matrix is preserved irrespective of the `percent` value specified, thus resolving the reported issue."
