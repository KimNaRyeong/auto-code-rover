From its [docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.IterativeImputer.html):\n> **initial_strategy {\u2018mean\u2019, \u2018median\u2019, \u2018most_frequent\u2019, \u2018constant\u2019}, default=\u2019mean\u2019**\n> Which strategy to use to initialize the missing values. Same as the strategy parameter in SimpleImputer.\nI have set the initial strategy to `\"constant\"`. However, I want to define this constant myself. So, as I look at the parameters for `SimpleImputer` I find `fill_value`:\n>When strategy == \u201cconstant\u201d, fill_value is used to replace all occurrences of missing_values. If left to the default, fill_value will be 0 when imputing numerical data and \u201cmissing_value\u201d for strings or object data types.\nBased on this information, one would assume that `IterativeImputer` also has the parameter `fill_value`, but it does not.\n### Describe your proposed solution\nThe parameter `fill_value` needs to be added to `IterativeImputer` for when `initial_strategy` is set to `\"constant\"`. If this parameter is added, please also allow `np.nan` as `fill_value`, for optimal compatibility with decision tree-based estimators.\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

This is precisely what the issue submission is addressing.\n\n2. **SimpleImputer Class (sklearn/impute/_base.py):**\n   - Similarly inherits from `_BaseImputer` and offers a straightforward imputation of missing values with specified strategies, including a \"constant\" strategy.\n   - Crucially, it includes a `fill_value` parameter, which is used when the `strategy` is set to \"constant\" to define the specific value to replace all occurrences of missing values. This functionality is missing in `IterativeImputer` but is desired by the issue submitter.\n   - Implementation of `fill_value` in `SimpleImputer` suggests that adding similar functionality to `IterativeImputer` would entail defining a `fill_value` parameter in the initializer and adjusting the imputation logic to utilize this value when `initial_strategy` is set to \"constant\".\n\n**Relevance to the Issue:**\n\nThe absence of a `fill_value` parameter in `IterativeImputer` restricts users from specifying a custom initial imputation value, limiting the utility of the imputer in cases where a more nuanced approach to initial imputation is required. The issue submitted asks for adding this capability to `IterativeImputer` to match the flexibility offered by `SimpleImputer`.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\n\nTo resolve the issue, ideally, `IterativeImputer` should be modified to:\n- Include a `fill_value` parameter in its constructor, similar to that in `SimpleImputer`.\n- Adjust the `_initial_imputation` method (or wherever the initial imputation logic is handled) to make use of `fill_value` when `initial_strategy=\"constant\"` is specified.\n- Ensure compatibility with `np.nan` as a `fill_value` to facilitate imputations that are compatible with decision tree-based estimators which can naturally handle `np.nan` values.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps in crafting a patch would involve:\n1. Modifying the constructor (`__init__`) of `IterativeImputer` to include a `fill_value` parameter.\n2. Updating the initial imputation logic to account for this new parameter when `initial_strategy=\"constant\"`.\n3. Testing the implementation to ensure that it behaves as expected across the board, especially when integrating with various estimators and handling diverse datasets."

This parameter should allow any scalar value or `np.nan`, providing a default that maintains the current behavior when not explicitly set by the user. This change allows users to specify a custom initialization value for missing values, enhancing the flexibility of `IterativeImputer`. Existing functionality and default behavior of the class should remain unchanged when the `fill_value` parameter is not utilized (i.e., when `initial_strategy` is not \"constant\").\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** sklearn/impute/_iterative.py\n  - **Class:** IterativeImputer\n  - **Method:** _initial_imputation\n  - **Intended Behavior:** This method should be updated to utilize the `fill_value` parameter when performing the initial imputation with strategy \"constant\". The implementation should check if `initial_strategy` is \"constant\" and, if so, use the `fill_value` for replacing missing values. This adjustment ensures that `fill_value` directly influences the imputation process only in the context it's meant to (i.e., with \"constant\" strategy), without affecting other imputation strategies. The intended behavior is to provide a seamless way to customize initial missing values handling, which could be especially beneficial for datasets where a zero, the mean, or median value might not be the most appropriate initial guess."
