        "intended_behavior": "The constructor (__new__ method) of the RootOf class needs to accurately process and integrate the generator information when initializing RootOf instances, especially when dealing with expressions that involve substitutions leading to a change in the generator. This behavior should preserve the ability of RootOf to handle simple polynomial root scenarios while ensuring that new generators, introduced through substitutions or expressions involving functions of the original generator (e.g., tan(x)), are correctly identified and maintained as the polynomial's generator. When a substitution results in a new generator, this should be reflected in the poly attribute of the RootOf object, ensuring that methods relying on .poly.gen (and related functionality) operate with the correct context."
