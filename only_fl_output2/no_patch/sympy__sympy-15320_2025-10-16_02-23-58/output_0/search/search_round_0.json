        "content": "To address the issue effectively, let's gather more context regarding the `RootOf` functionality and where the potential problem might be stemming from. We'll need to investigate the implementation of `RootOf`, and specifically, highlight how it handles the generator across substitutions and polynomial transformations.\n\nWe can begin by searching for the `RootOf` class and the related method that might be processing the polynomial and its generators. This will include looking into how it constructs instances of `RootOf` and any utilities that manage the generator context, i.e., transforming or substituting expressions.\n\nHere are the API calls we should make to gather this context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"RootOf\")` - To find where the `RootOf` class is defined in the codebase.\n2. `search_method(\"subs\")` - Because the issue outlines a problem following substitution, we might want to see how substitution is generally handled, which could be relevant if `RootOf` leverages a common substitution method or has its own.\n3. `search_code(\"poly.gen\")` - This will help us understand how the generator (`gen`) is handled or accessed within polynomials, which appears to be central to the issue.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive view of the involved components and their interactions, allowing us to piece together how to navigate towards a solution."
