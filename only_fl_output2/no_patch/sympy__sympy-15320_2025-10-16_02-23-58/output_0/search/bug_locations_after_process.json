This behavior should preserve the ability of RootOf to handle simple polynomial root scenarios while ensuring that new generators, introduced through substitutions or expressions involving functions of the original generator (e.g., tan(x)), are correctly identified and maintained as the polynomial's generator. When a substitution results in a new generator, this should be reflected in the poly attribute of the RootOf object, ensuring that methods relying on .poly.gen (and related functionality) operate with the correct context."
