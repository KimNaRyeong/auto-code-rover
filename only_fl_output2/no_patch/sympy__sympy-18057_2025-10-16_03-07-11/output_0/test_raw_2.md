Given the initial attempt, it seems there was a misunderstanding. The script indeed did what was supposed to do under the described circumstances, producing an `AttributeError` and an `AssertionError` for the individual issues being tested, which aligns with the intention to demonstrate the problems. 

However, if the goal is to ensure that the script exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed, adjustments to the existing structure are necessary. This can be achieved by catching the specific errors and not raising an `AssertionError` when the conditions described as problematic are met, implying the script should proceed without error when the behavior causing these exceptions has been corrected in SymPy. Here is the revised script:

```python
import sys
import sympy

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    error_encountered = False

    # Testing repr evaluation in __eq__
    class C:
        def __repr__(self):
            return 'x.y'
    try:
        _ = sympy.Symbol('x') == C()
    except AttributeError as e:
        error_encountered = True
        print("Issue with repr evaluation in __eq__ detected.")
        print_stacktrace(e)

    # Testing incorrect comparison due to eval in __eq__
    class D:
        def __repr__(self):
            return 'x'
    try:
        comparison_result = sympy.Symbol('x') == D()
        if comparison_result:
            error_encountered = True
            print("Incorrect comparison due to eval in __eq__ detected.")
            # Since this does not raise an exception but leads to incorrect behavior, 
            # we manually handle the logic to print relevant information.
            print(f"Assertion failed: Symbol('x') incorrectly compares equal to an instance of D. Comparison result: {comparison_result}")
    except Exception as e:
        error_encountered = True
        print("Unexpected error during evaluation.")
        print_stacktrace(e)

    if error_encountered:
        print("Errors were detected during testing.")
    else:
        print("No errors detected. The issues appear to be resolved.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this updated version, the script aims to complete with exit code 0, presuming that no unhandled exceptions are thrown. It tracks whether any of the known issues have been encountered through the `error_encountered` boolean. If the issues under scrutiny persist (i.e., leading to `AttributeError` or incorrect behavior), it prints relevant stack traces and notes. If these issues have been resolved (i.e., no exceptions are thrown and the behavior is as expected), the script acknowledges the absence of errors and proceeds to exit quietly with a success status code (implicitly `0`), aligning with typical UNIX convention for signaling successful execution.
