        "intended_behavior": "The `sympify` function needs to ensure it does not execute potentially harmful code through the use of `eval`. To resolve the issue, the function could incorporate a more robust check or sanitation of inputs before passing them to `eval`. Additionally, a secure alternative to `eval` could be implemented for parsing expressions provided as strings. The use of `eval` could be isolated to strictly controlled scenarios where inputs are guaranteed to be safe, or replaced entirely if feasible. The goal is to maintain the functionality of converting inputs into SymPy expressions without risking arbitrary code execution."

        "method": "eval_expr",
        "intended_behavior": "The `eval_expr` function directly uses Python's `eval`, which is the root cause of the issue. The intended behavior here would be to introduce an additional layer of validation for the code being evaluated or to explore alternatives to `eval` that do not execute the code. For instance, safer parsing techniques or libraries could be considered to evaluate expressions. If `eval` must be used, then applying stricter whitelisting of allowed operations or structuring the input data in such a way that arbitrary code execution becomes impossible are critical steps. The primary aim is to ensure that `eval` cannot be leveraged to execute unintended operations, thereby preserving the intended functionality of parsing and evaluating symbolic expressions safely."
