        "content": "To gather enough context to resolve this issue, we should locate the relevant classes, methods, and code snippets referenced in the issue description. The focus should be on how the `__eq__` method and the `sympify` function are implemented and interact, especially regarding their behavior when evaluating representations of objects. Let's perform API calls targeting the areas described:\n\n1. Search for the `Symbol` class definition to understand its methods, specifically `__eq__`:\n    - `search_class(\"Symbol\")`\n\n2. Search for the `sympify` method to understand how it converts inputs into SymPy understandable types:\n    - `search_method(\"sympify\")`\n\n3. Given the traceback mentions evaluating expressions within `parse_expr`, it's also important to locate this function's definition:\n    - `search_method(\"parse_expr\")`\n\n4. To get the specific implementation details and surrounding context of the `eval_expr` function called within `parse_expr` as mentioned in the traceback:\n    - `search_method(\"eval_expr\")`\n\n5. Finally, to address the issue specifically mentioned about the `eval` function causing an error when passing the representation of an object, we should locate the code snippet where `eval` is used:\n    - `search_code(\"eval\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how objects are converted and evaluated within SymPy's type system and the equality checks, shedding light on where the problematic `eval` usage might be rectified."
