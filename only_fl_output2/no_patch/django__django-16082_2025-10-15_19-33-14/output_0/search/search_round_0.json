        "content": "To understand where and how the MOD operator is handled in Django's ORM and how type resolution occurs when combining numeric expressions with different data types, we could start by looking for the classes and methods that handle expressions, specifically those involved in mathematical operations or type casting. Given the information in the issue, relevant classes might be related to query expressions or fields, and methods might pertain to evaluating or compiling expressions.\n\nLet's start with some specific queries based on key terms mentioned in the issue:\n\n- Since the issue involves numeric expressions and the MOD operator within Django's ORM, we should look for classes or methods that deal with expressions. Classes like `Expression`, `Func`, or similar ones could be relevant. The `Func` class is often used for encapsulating SQL functions, and the MOD operator might be implemented through it or a similar mechanism.\n\n- The issue mentions a problem with resolving the `output_field` to a `Decimal` type when different numeric types are involved in the operation. Therefore, looking for where `output_field` is determined or modified in the context of expressions could provide valuable insights.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are the API calls I would make to get more context:\n\n1. search_class(\"Expression\")\n2. search_class(\"Func\")\n3. search_method(\"resolve_expression\")\n4. search_code(\"output_field\")\n5. search_code(\"MOD\")"
