This will ensure that the precision is preserved in such operations. The method might not directly deal with the MOD operator but ensuring that the output field adequately reflects the highest precision type involved in the operation is necessary. Modifications or additional checks may be needed within this method or closely related methods to ensure the correct output_field is utilized for the final expression."
