        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### OuterRef Class in `django/db/models/expressions.py`\n- **What it does:** The `OuterRef` class is likely used for creating references to outer query fields, which is useful in subqueries to refer to fields from the main query. It does not support aggregate functions, as indicated by `contains_aggregate = False`.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** Since the issue involves an inability to use `OuterRef` in a union or bitwise OR (`|`) operation within a `Subquery`, the functionality or limitations of `OuterRef` play a central role. Specifically, the problem may stem from how `OuterRef` is resolved or cloned (methods like `resolve_expression` and `relabeled_clone`) when used within these contexts.\n- **Intended behavior:** Ideally, `OuterRef` should be able to be used within `Subquery` expressions that are part of a `union` or `|` operation, allowing for dynamic references to the outer query fields without raising errors.\n\n#### Subquery Class in `django/db/models/expressions.py`\n- **What it does:** The `Subquery` class allows embedding a SQL subquery within a larger query. It has a customizable template for the SQL it generates and includes mechanisms to resolve its output field, handle external aliases, and generate SQL with appropriate context.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The issue is directly related to `Subquery`, especially because the error arises when trying to use `Subquery` with a union of querysets referencing `OuterRef`. The error suggests a potential issue with how `Subquery` interacts with combined queries (`union` or `|`) that include outer references.\n- **Intended behavior:** `Subquery` should enable the inclusion of complex queryset operations (like unions or OR operations) that involve references to fields in the outer query, without generating errors related to these references.\n\n#### Union Method in Various Files\n- **What it does:** Without seeing the specific code, it's clear that the `union` method is used to combine querysets in a way that aligns with SQL's UNION operation. It appears in models and possibly GIS-related functionality, indicating it has a broad application.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The error message mentions issues specifically when using `union` with querysets that include `OuterRef`. Thus, the implementation of `union` could lack support for or improperly handle subqueries with outer references.\n- **Intended behavior:** The `union` method should correctly handle subqueries including those that reference fields from an outer query using `OuterRef`, without resulting in errors that prevent its use in annotation contexts.\n\n#### Annotate Method in `django/db/models/query.py`\n- **What it does:** The `annotate` method is used to add additional fields to each object in a queryset, typically aggregations or values derived from the database. This is a core part of Django's ORM that enables complex data aggregations and transformations directly at the database level.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The issue occurs when trying to use `annotate` with a `Subquery` that contains a union. The mention of `_not_support_combined_queries('annotate')` indicates there might be limitations or specific conditions where combined queries (like those with `union` or `|`) are not supported within `annotate`.\n- **Intended behavior:** `annotate` should allow developers to enhance querysets with additional data using subqueries, including sophisticated operations involving unions or bitwise OR configurations of querysets that reference outer query fields.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the analysis, it's crucial to explore a few more details:\n- How `Subquery` and `OuterRef` interact within `union` and `|` operations specifically, looking into any conditions that might trigger unsupported use cases.\n- Specific implementation details of `union` and `|` operations in `django/db/models/query.py`, to understand any limitations or design decisions that could affect how subqueries with outer references are handled.\n\nI might consider the following API calls for deeper exploration:\n- `search_code_in_file(\"union\", \"django/db/models/query.py\")` to get more insight into how `union` is implemented.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"_not_support_combined_queries\", \"django/db/models/query.py\")` to understand the limitations mentioned within the `annotate` method relating to combined queries."

This includes ensuring that such querysets can be resolved without raising errors about references to an outer query. The resolution might involve modifying how `Subquery` generates its SQL to account for the combined queries, ensuring that outer references are correctly handled and represented in the resulting query.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/db/models/query.py`\n  - **Method:** `annotate`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The method should be updated to handle cases where the provided queryset for annotation includes combined queries (like those using `union` or `|` with `OuterRef`). This might require adjusting the checks within `annotate` (or the methods it calls) that currently lead to rejecting combined queries with outer references. The fix should ensure that `annotate` can be used with complex subqueries, thereby expanding its utility and flexibility without compromising the integrity of the outer query or annotations being applied.\n\nThese enhancements would allow developers to make more extensive use of Django's ORM capabilities, particularly in constructing complex data retrieval and annotation scenarios, without encountering the limitations currently described in the issue."
