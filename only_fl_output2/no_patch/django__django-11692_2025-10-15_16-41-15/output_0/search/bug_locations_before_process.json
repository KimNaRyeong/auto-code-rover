This includes ensuring that such querysets can be resolved without raising errors about references to an outer query. The resolution might involve modifying how `Subquery` generates its SQL to account for the combined queries, ensuring that outer references are correctly handled and represented in the resulting query."

This might require adjusting the checks within `annotate` (or the methods it calls) that currently lead to rejecting combined queries with outer references. The fix should ensure that `annotate` can be used with complex subqueries, thereby expanding its utility and flexibility without compromising the integrity of the outer query or annotations being applied."
