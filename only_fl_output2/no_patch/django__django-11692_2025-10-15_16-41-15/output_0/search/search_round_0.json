        "content": "To gather the context needed for crafting a patch to the described issue, we should target multiple angles:\n\n1. Understanding how `OuterRef` and `Subquery` classes are implemented or used.\n2. Knowing how `union` and `|` (or operator) impact queries, especially with `Subquery`.\n3. Checking if there's any handling or exceptions for `union` or `|` with `OuterRef` in a `Subquery`.\n4. The method `annotate` usage and implementation since the issue occurs there as well.\n\nLet's begin with these targeted API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"OuterRef\")` to check the implementation or usage instructions for `OuterRef`.\n- `search_class(\"Subquery\")` for getting details on how `Subquery` is implemented or supposed to be integrated with other ORM functionalities like `union` or `|`.\n- `search_method(\"union\")` to understand how the `union` operation is expected to function, especially when involving references to outer queries.\n- `search_method(\"annotate\")` to examine how annotation works and its compatibility with `Subquery` and `OuterRef`.\n\nThese API calls will provide a foundational context to start addressing the described issue."
