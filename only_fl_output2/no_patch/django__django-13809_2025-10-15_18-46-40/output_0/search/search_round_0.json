        "content": "To address the issue of adding a `--skip-checks` option to the `runserver` command, we need to understand how commands are defined and handled within the model of the framework being used. Since the issue mentions Django, focusing on Django's `runserver` command implementation and how command options are added would be the best approach. The command options for a Django management command are defined in the command class, usually by overriding the `add_arguments` method. Additionally, we might need to see how the `handle` method processes command line arguments, including the proposed `--skip-checks` option.\n\nGiven the information, let's proceed with the following search API calls:\n- search_class(\"Command\"): As management commands in Django usually inherit from a base `Command` class, this can give us an insight into how commands are structured.\n- search_method(\"add_arguments\"): This method is crucial for adding new command-line options.\n- search_method(\"handle\"): The `handle` method is where the command line arguments are processed.\n- search_code(\"runserver\"): This code snippet search might help locate where the `runserver` command is implemented or mentioned in the project."
