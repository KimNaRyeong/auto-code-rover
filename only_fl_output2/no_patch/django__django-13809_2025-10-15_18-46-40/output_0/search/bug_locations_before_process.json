The option should be stored in a way that it can be read later in the command's execution to conditionally skip the system checks."

        "intended_behavior": "Modify this method to check if the `--skip-checks` argument has been set. If so, bypass the checks usually performed by the runserver command. This likely involves conditional logic around wherever the checks are being triggered within this method, utilizing the value of the argument determined from `options['skip_checks']` (assuming `skip_checks` is the name given to the option in `add_arguments`). The primary goal is to preserve the normal behavior of the command when the `--skip-checks` option is not specified, ensuring backward compatibility and not affecting users who do not use this new option."
