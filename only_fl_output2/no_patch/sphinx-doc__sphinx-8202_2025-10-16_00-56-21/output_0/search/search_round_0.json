If the child class has the `__init__` method (using typed parameters) and I try to reassign the attribute from `Generic` class I got the following error:\n```text\nWARNING: :1: (WARNING/2) Field list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.\n```\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n```\n$ git clone git@github.com:dry-python/returns.git\n$ cd returns\n$ poetry install\n$ cd docs\n$ poetry run make html\n```\nCode example:\n* Python script\n```python\nfrom typing import (\nClassVar,\nType,\nTypeVar,\nGeneric,\n)\n_ValueType = TypeVar('_ValueType')\nclass MyGeneric(Generic[_ValueType]):\n#: Doc comment example.\nsome_type: ClassVar[Type['MyGenericChild']]\nclass MyGenericChild(MyGeneric[_ValueType]):\ndef __init__(self, inner_value: _ValueType) -> None:\npass\nMyGeneric.some_type = MyGenericChild\n```\n* rst\n```rst\n.. test:\nTest\n====\n.. automodule:: lib.test\n:members:\n```\nIf you try to modify something in the script maybe the error will not appear, it's a very specific corner case!\n**Expected behavior**\nThe warning should not appear!\n**Your project**\n[returns](https://github.com/dry-python/returns)\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Linux 5.7.9-1-MANJARO\n- Python version: 3.8.3\n- Sphinx version: 3.1.1\n- Sphinx extensions:\n```text\nsphinx.ext.autodoc\nsphinx.ext.doctest\nsphinx.ext.todo\nsphinx.ext.coverage\nsphinx.ext.viewcode\nsphinx.ext.autosummary\nsphinx.ext.napoleon\nm2r\nsphinx_autodoc_typehints\nsphinxcontrib.mermaid\nhoverxref.extension\n```\n---\nrelated issue https://github.com/dry-python/returns/issues/568\n</issue>"

Understanding how `__init__` is defined, including its parameters and body, could offer insights into the problem.\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"MyGenericChild\")`\n\n4. **Search for the assignment causing the warning**: The issue mentions an error when the `some_type` attribute is reassigned in the subclass. It might be necessary to look at where this assignment takes place in the context of the codebase.\n    - `search_code(\"MyGeneric.some_type = MyGenericChild\")`\n\nThese calls are aimed at getting a comprehensive view of how the classes and methods involved in the issue are implemented within the project."
