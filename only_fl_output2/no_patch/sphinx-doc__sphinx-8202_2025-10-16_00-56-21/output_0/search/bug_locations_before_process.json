        "intended_behavior": "The `doc/conf.py` file is crucial for specifying how Sphinx generates documentation from the source code, including handling of special Python typing such as Generics. To address the warning encountered, the file should ensure: 1. Correct Configuration of Sphinx Extensions: The configuration should enable and properly configure extensions such as `sphinx.ext.autodoc`, `sphinx.ext.viewcode`, and `sphinx.ext.napoleon` (for Google and NumPy style docstrings), which are crucial for handling Python-specific syntax and docstrings effectively. If not already done, enabling `sphinx_autodoc_typehints` could be beneficial, even though it wasn't directly found in the project - it might require installation and configuration as part of the Sphinx setup. 2. Optimize Settings for Python Generics and Typing: Ensure that the Sphinx setup is optimized for handling Python Generics and complex typing, possibly through the extension configuration. This may involve customizing the settings of `sphinx.ext.autodoc` to ignore or special-handle certain types that could be causing documentation warnings. 3. Custom Sphinx Extensions or Docstring Formatting: If the issue persists despite the above measures, consider either implementing custom Sphinx extensions or adjusting the project's documentation style. For example, explicitly documenting the type in the description of each parameter or return value, rather than relying solely on Python's typing syntax, might mitigate parsing issues leading to warnings. 4. Ensure Compatibility with Sphinx and Python Versions: Given the rapid evolution of both Python's typing system and Sphinx, ensuring that both are at a version compatible with the intended use of Generics and other advanced typing features is crucial. This might mean upgrading Sphinx, Python, or both, as well as ensuring all relevant Sphinx extensions are up to date."
