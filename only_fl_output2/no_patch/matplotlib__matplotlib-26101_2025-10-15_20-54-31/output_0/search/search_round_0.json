Discover how markers are drawn in general, determining if there's a distinction or specific handling logic for mathtext markers.\n2. Find the method responsible for positioning markers, particularly to verify how alignment is handled.\n\nGiven the issue's context, we can start with:\n- Searching for the class or method responsible for handling the plot function, as it's directly involved with rendering markers.\n- Since the issue specifically mentions mathtext markers, searching for how these are handled could help us identify any different treatment that might affect alignment.\n\nAPI calls to make:\n- `search_method(\"plot\")`: To find the entry point in the code where markers are being processed.\n- `search_code(\"markersize\")`: Because `markersize` was mentioned in the code for reproduction which might lead to sections of the code dealing with marker properties including alignment.\n- `search_code(\"mathtext\")`: To directly find any processing or special handling logic associated with mathtext rendering, which could be affecting alignment."
