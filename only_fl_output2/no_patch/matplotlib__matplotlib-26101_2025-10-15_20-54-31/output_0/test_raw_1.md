Given the previous feedback, I see the issue was not reproduced correctly, potentially due to the incorrect expectation set by the test code. Let's adjust the focus to explicitly testing the center alignment of math-text markers compared to standard markers, taking into account the syntax warning that was previously raised. This time, I'll ensure the math text is correctly handled and the test accurately reflects the condition for reproducing the alignment issue.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def assert_marker_alignment_corrected():
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    # Use raw string for math text to avoid escape sequence warning
    mathtext_marker, = ax.plot(0, 0, color='g', alpha=1.0, marker=r"$\star$", markersize=25, label='Mathtext star')
    normal_marker, = ax.plot(1, 0, color='b', alpha=1.0, marker="*", markersize=25, label='Normal star')

    plt.draw()

    renderer = fig.canvas.get_renderer()
    normal_marker_bbox = normal_marker.get_window_extent(renderer)
    mathtext_marker_bbox = mathtext_marker.get_window_extent(renderer)
    
    # Calculate alignment offset
    offset = np.abs(normal_marker_bbox.x0 - mathtext_marker_bbox.x0) + np.abs(normal_marker_bbox.y0 - mathtext_marker_bbox.y0)
    
    assert offset == 0, f"Mathtext markers are not properly center-aligned; offset found: {offset}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        assert_marker_alignment_corrected()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    else:
        print("Success: The mathtext markers are properly center-aligned with normal markers.")
        exit(0)
```

This script addresses the concern by directly comparing the bounding box positions of a normal star marker and a math-text star marker to assert their alignment. The use of `plt.draw()` and `get_window_extent(renderer)` allows us to make a more accurate measurement of the position differences between the two markers. Additionally, the math text syntax warning is resolved by employing a raw string (prefixed with 'r') to correctly interpret the LaTeX-like expression.
