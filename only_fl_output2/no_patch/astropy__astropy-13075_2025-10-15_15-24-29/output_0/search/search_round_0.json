        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue, I will use the following search API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `Cosmology` class to understand how it is currently structured and how `write` methods might be incorporated or extended:\n   ```\n   search_class(\"Cosmology\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions the method `write_html(...)`, which does not seem to exist yet, I'll look for any `write` method within `Cosmology` to understand the current implementation of file writing and consider how to add a new format:\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"write\", \"Cosmology\")\n   ```\n\n3. The issue discusses calling `cosmology.io.table.to_table()` and then using `QTable.write(...)`. Let's get the context of how `to_table` is implemented in the cosmology IO logic:\n   ```\n   search_method(\"to_table\")\n   ```\n\n4. Similarly, since `QTable.write` is a critical step in the proposed solution, understanding it could help in ensuring compatibility and proper implementation:\n   ```\n   search_method(\"write\")\n   search_class(\"QTable\")\n   ```\n\n5. Finally, since the issue also mentions enhancing parameters with MathJax representation and relates it to `def_unit` method from `units` where the `format` argument is utilized, let's examine how `def_unit` is implemented:\n   ```\n   search_method(\"def_unit\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls will help in gathering the necessary code context, understanding existing implementations, and identifying where and how the new feature can be integrated within the project."
