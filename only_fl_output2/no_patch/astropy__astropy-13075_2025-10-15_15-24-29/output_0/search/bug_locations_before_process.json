This method should leverage the 'to_table' method to convert the cosmology instance into a tabular format suitable for HTML representation. Then, format this table using MathJax for any relevant cosmological parameters with the assistance of a new feature or extension utilizing 'QTable.write(..., format='html')'. The new method should smoothly integrate with existing IO capabilities, meaning it should use or extend the existing framework ('UnifiedReadWriteMethod') to support the HTML format, ensuring consistency with how other formats are handled."
