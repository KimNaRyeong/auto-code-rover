        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\nThe collected context centers around the `trim_docstring` function in `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py`. Here's an analysis based on the provided code snippet and the issue description:\n\n#### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `trim_docstring` method is designed to uniformly trim leading and trailing whitespace from docstrings. This is aligned with PEP 257 recommendations on handling docstring indentation. The method:\n- Checks if the docstring is empty or consists solely of whitespace, and returns an empty string if true.\n- Converts tabs to spaces and splits the docstring into lines.\n- Identifies the minimum indentation level (excluding the first line) to correctly preserve the docstring's relative indentation.\n- Constructs a new trimmed docstring where each line has been appropriately indented and whitespace-trimmed.\n\n#### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue arises in the calculation of `indent`, as it includes all lines of the docstring, potentially considering the indentation of the first line. In docstrings where the first line is immediately adjacent to the triple quotes (common practice), this leads to a calculated indent of 0 because the first line is not indented. This behavior is inconsistent when the docstring's first line is expected to have content directly following the opening triple-quotes, conflicting with the handling of subsequent lines that may have been properly indented.\n\n#### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior would ensure that the method accurately computes the indentation level for docstrings regardless of whether the first line is empty or contains text. The modification proposed in the issue \u2013 to skip the first line when calculating the minimum indentation \u2013 aims to preserve the indentation of the actual content lines while not letting the potentially non-indented first line influence the overall indentation calculation. This ensures that docstrings with content starting on the first line are treated correctly, matching the handling for docstrings that start with an empty line (as per Django's common practice).\n\nIn conclusion, the code should be modified to correctly handle docstrings that start with text immediately on the first line. This involves altering the logic that calculates the minimum indentation to skip the first line, addressing the discrepancy without impacting docstrings that follow the empty first line convention."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

The existing functionality to trim leading/trailing whitespace and standardize indentation across the docstring should be maintained.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the calculation of the `indent` variable should be adjusted to skip the indentation check on the first line. This change will ensure that the first line, whether it be contentful or empty, does not adversely affect the indentation calculation for the rest of the docstring. \n\nModifying the line:\n```python\nindent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n```\nTo:\n```python\nindent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip())\n```\n\nThis adjustment ensures that docstrings with immediate text following the opening quotes are handled correctly, by treating the indentation of subsequent lines independently from the first line. This change should be applied while ensuring that the logic still supports docstrings that follow the established empty-first-line convention, thus aligning with the intended behavior to accommodate both docstring formats without introducing errors."
