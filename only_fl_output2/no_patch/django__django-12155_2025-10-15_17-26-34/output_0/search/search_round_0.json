Since the issue mentions the `trim_docstring` method where the bug seems to reside, we'll start by searching for this method in the entire codebase to find its location:\n   - `search_method(method_name=\"trim_docstring\")`\n\n2. The issue description includes a specific code snippet that appears to be causing the problem, as well as a proposed solution. To understand where exactly this snippet is, and to verify its presence before making changes, we'll search for the problematic code snippet:\n   - `search_code(code_str=\"indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\")`\n\nThese API calls will help us identify the location of `trim_docstring` method and the context around the problematic code snippet, setting the stage for crafting a patch to resolve the issue."
