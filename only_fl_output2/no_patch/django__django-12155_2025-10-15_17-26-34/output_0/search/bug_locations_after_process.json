        "intended_behavior": "The `trim_docstring` method needs a modification to ensure it handles docstrings beginning with text correctly, alongside preserving its functionality for docstrings that follow the convention of starting with an empty first line. The existing functionality to trim leading/trailing whitespace and standardize indentation across the docstring should be maintained. To resolve the issue, the calculation of the `indent` variable should be adjusted to skip the indentation check on the first line. This change will ensure that the first line, whether it be contentful or empty, does not adversely affect the indentation calculation for the rest of the docstring. Modifying the line: ```python indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip()) ``` To: ```python indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip()) ``` This adjustment ensures that docstrings with immediate text following the opening quotes are handled correctly, by treating the indentation of subsequent lines independently from the first line. This change should be applied while ensuring that the logic still supports docstrings that follow the established empty-first-line convention, thus aligning with the intended behavior to accommodate both docstring formats without introducing errors."
