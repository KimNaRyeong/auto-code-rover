To avoid a zero division problem, we were using a Case-When clause over that field. It works well on any 4.1 and prior versions but stopped working since 4.2, raising a FieldError like:\nCannot resolve keyword 'sum_total_objs' into field\nThe bug is reproducible with an extra test on the django aggregation test suite:\ndef test_referenced_group_by_aggregation_over_annotation(self):\ntotal_books_qs = (\nBook.objects.filter(authors__pk=OuterRef(\"pk\"))\n.order_by()\n.values(\"pk\")\n.annotate(total=Count(\"pk\"))\n.values(\"total\")\n)\nannotated_authors = Author.objects.annotate(\ntotal_books=Subquery(total_books_qs.annotate(\ntotal_books=F(\"total\")\n).values(\"total_books\")),\ntotal_books_a=Subquery(total_books_qs.filter(\nname__istartswith=\"a\"\n).annotate(\ntotal_books_a=F(\"total\")\n).values(\"total_books_a\")),\n).values(\n\"pk\",\n\"total_books\",\n\"total_books_a\",\n).order_by(\"-total_books\")\ntotals = annotated_authors.aggregate(\nsum_total_books=Sum(\"total_books\"),\nsum_total_books_a=Sum(\"total_books_a\"),\na_over_total_rate=Case(\nWhen(\nsum_total_books=0,\nthen=0,\n),\ndefault=Round(\n(Sum(\"total_books_a\") / Sum(\"total_books\")) * 100, 2\n),\noutput_field=FloatField(),\n),\n)\nself.assertEqual(totals['sum_total_books'], 3)\nself.assertEqual(totals['sum_total_books_a'], 0)\nself.assertEqual(totals['a_over_total_rate'], 0)\nThanks for the support!\n</issue>"

        "content": "To effectively gather context for resolving the mentioned issue, I would invoke the following search API calls based on the information provided in the issue description:\n\n1. Search for where the `aggregate` method is defined or used within the Django codebase since this method is central to the problem described. This could help in understanding if there have been changes or regressions in recent updates.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"aggregate\")\n```\n\n2. The issue mentions a specific problem with aggregations over annotated fields in version 4.2.x of Django. It would be useful to look at how subclasses of `QuerySet`, like the one being modified with `annotate` and `aggregate`, handle these methods. These subclasses are likely to interact with or extend Django's base `QuerySet` class, so let's look for that class.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"QuerySet\")\n```\n\n3. According to the provided stack trace and error message, `FieldError` being raised is central to understanding why `sum_total_objs` cannot be resolved. Searching for the `FieldError` class can provide insights into how errors are handled or raised during field resolution processes.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"FieldError\")\n```\n\n4. Since the bug is described within the context of using `Subquery`, `Sum`, and `Case` expressions in conjunction with the `annotate` method, it would be helpful to see if there are any relevant updates or changes in their implementations. Therefore, looking for these specific classes or functions could give further insight.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Subquery\")\nsearch_class(\"Sum\")\nsearch_class(\"Case\")\n```\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point by offering insights into how the Django ORM handles aggregation and annotation, any related changes between versions 4.1.x and 4.2.x, and where the breakdown that leads to the `Cannot resolve keyword` error might be happening."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, let's address the questions for each part of the code related to the issue.\n\n### 1. django/db/models/query.py: `aggregate` Method\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `aggregate` method in the `QuerySet` class allows for the aggregation of values over the current queryset. It takes arbitrary keyword arguments where each argument represents an aggregation to perform, represented as an expression, and returns a dictionary with each aggregation's result.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nThe issue reports that using a Case-When aggregation over a queryset that includes an aggregated field (created with a previous annotation) fails in Django versions 4.2.x, where it previously worked. The `aggregate` method is central to this as it performs the final aggregation step where the problem arises, specifically when resolving the `sum_total_objs` field that comes from an earlier annotation.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nThe intended behavior would be for the `aggregate` method to correctly resolve fields from earlier annotations or subquery annotations within the same queryset, including when these fields are used in complex expressions like `Case` within the aggregation. This would allow for dynamic computations based on other calculated fields without raising a `FieldError`.\n\n### 2. django/db/models/query.py: `QuerySet` Class\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `QuerySet` class represents a collection of database queries or records that can be filtered, ordered, and operated upon with methods like `annotate`, `filter`, `aggregate`, etc. It's a central piece of Django's ORM that allows for expressive database operations in Python.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nGiven that the `aggregate` method is a member of the `QuerySet` class, the behavior and implementation of `QuerySet` directly impact how aggregation operations, including those with `Sum` and `Case`, are parsed, executed, and how their results are constructed. The issue likely stems from how `QuerySet` handles or fails to handle aggregated and annotated fields during such operations in newer versions.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nThe expected behavior would be for `QuerySet` to facilitate aggregation and annotation seamlessly, including allowing aggregated fields to be referenced in subsequent annotations or aggregations within the same `QuerySet`.\n\n### 3. django/core/exceptions.py: `FieldError` Class\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `FieldError` exception likely gets raised when there's an issue with resolving a field name in a query. This suggests that Django has checks in place to ensure that field names referenced in queries are valid and can be resolved within the current context of the `QuerySet`.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nThe issue explicitly mentions a `FieldError` being raised, indicating that the problem lies in Django's ability to resolve the `sum_total_objs` field within the aggregation method. This means the changes in the newer version somehow impact the field resolution logic negatively in this specific case.\n\n#### Intended behavior\n`FieldError` should only be raised in situations where a field legitimately cannot be resolved (e.g., it does not exist). The expected behavior in the context of the reported issue would be for Django to recognize and resolve annotated and aggregated fields successfully within `aggregate` calls, even when these fields are used in expressions like `Case`.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Code Analysis\nGiven the context and understanding of the issue:\n- Investigate how the `aggregate` method's implementation has changed from Django 4.1.x to 4.2.x, specifically focusing on field resolution logic within aggregation and Case expressions.\n- Review how annotated and aggregated fields are tracked and resolved within a `QuerySet`'s lifecycle, especially when used in subsequent operations like `aggregate`.\n- Examine if there's a regression or change in how errors are handled or raised, particularly in context with aggregating over annotated fields, which might lead to the unexpected `FieldError`.\n\nThis analysis would inform the next steps, likely involving debugging the `aggregate` method's logic for resolving aggregated fields and possibly adjusting how `QuerySet` manages annotated and aggregated field references."

It should allow these fields to be referenced and used in further aggregate or annotation operations without raising a `FieldError`. This behavior should preserve the functionality of being able to perform complex queries involving multiple levels of aggregation and annotations, which is essential for advanced database operations in Django. Modifications or checks may need to be introduced to ensure field names originating from such operations are tracked and resolved correctly, particularly when used in expressions like `Case` within an aggregate call.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: File: django/db/models/expressions.py, Class: Case\n  - **Intended Behavior**: The `Case` expression class should ensure compatibility with dynamically aggregated fields, especially when these fields are used as conditions within the `Case` itself. Any resolution of field names within `Case` should account for the context where aggregated and annotated fields might be referenced. This would mean enhancing the logic that parses and validates the conditions within a `Case` expression to understand and correctly integrate with aggregated fields referenced from the queryset. This is critical for allowing dynamic calculation fields in aggregations, especially for zero-division checks or other conditional logic based on aggregated data.\n\nThese locations and modifications should address the issue of `FieldError` being raised when using aggregated fields within `Case` expressions by ensuring proper field resolution and compatibility with Django's advanced query capabilities."
