        "intended_behavior": "The `aggregate` method should correctly resolve aggregated fields that are produced by previous annotations or subquery annotations within the same `QuerySet`. It should allow these fields to be referenced and used in further aggregate or annotation operations without raising a `FieldError`. This behavior should preserve the functionality of being able to perform complex queries involving multiple levels of aggregation and annotations, which is essential for advanced database operations in Django. Modifications or checks may need to be introduced to ensure field names originating from such operations are tracked and resolved correctly, particularly when used in expressions like `Case` within an aggregate call."

        "method": "",
        "intended_behavior": "The `Case` expression class should ensure compatibility with dynamically aggregated fields, especially when these fields are used as conditions within the `Case` itself. Any resolution of field names within `Case` should account for the context where aggregated and annotated fields might be referenced. This would mean enhancing the logic that parses and validates the conditions within a `Case` expression to understand and correctly integrate with aggregated fields referenced from the queryset. This is critical for allowing dynamic calculation fields in aggregations, especially for zero-division checks or other conditional logic based on aggregated data."
