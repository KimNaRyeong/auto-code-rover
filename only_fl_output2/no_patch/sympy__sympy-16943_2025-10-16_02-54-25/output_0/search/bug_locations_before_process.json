        "intended_behavior": "The `fps` method should uniformly return a `FormalPowerSeries` object or a compatible type that supports indexing and other series operations, even when the input is a simple polynomial that does not need formal expansion. This requires modifying the method to encapsulate outputs like `x**2` within a formal series wrapper that mimics the behavior of a more complex series expansion, without altering the mathematical output. Essentially, even if the function decides to return the input in cases where expansion is deemed unnecessary, it should still ensure that the return value adheres to the interface expected by callers of `fps`."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to the `fps` function in `sympy/series/formal.py`, this wrapper method in the `Expr` class should ensure that for all expressions, calling `fps` yields an object that supports the full interface expected of a formal power series. This might mean implementing additional logic within this method to check the return type from the core `fps` function and adjust it accordingly, ensuring uniformity and predictability in the behavior of `fps` across the library."
