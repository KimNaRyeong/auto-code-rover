        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to `sympy.fps` not always returning a formal power series, I will need the following:\n\n- To understand how the `fps` function is implemented and where it might branch into returning a simple `Pow` object instead of a formal series, I need to look at the definition and implementation of this function. Thus, I will search for the `fps` method in the codebase.\n- Since the issue mentions that the returned type for `x**2` is of class `sympy.core.power.Pow` and it does not support indexing like a series, gathering information about both the `fps` function and possibly the `Pow` class seems relevant. I would want to see if there's handling or wrapping around such objects in the series or `fps` context to maintain a consistent interface.\n- The documentation and user expectation suggest that the `fps` function should return a formal power series object consistently, so it would be helpful to examine any portion of the code where `fps` decides on the return type based on the input. This suggests there is a conditional branch or a type check that leads to different types being returned. Checking for code snippets where `fps` makes this determination can provide insight into the issue.\n\nBased on the above analysis, I will invoke the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"fps\")`: This will help find where the `fps` function is defined and how it is implemented.\n2. `search_class(\"Pow\")`: To get context on the `Pow` class mentioned in the error, understanding its structure might provide insight on why it's returned and why it doesn't support the expected interface.\n3. `search_code(\"if isinstance\")`: This is a bit speculative, but it's common to use `isinstance` checks before deciding on a return type in Python, especially in a polymorphic context like sympy. This could help find the condition leading to the different return types."
