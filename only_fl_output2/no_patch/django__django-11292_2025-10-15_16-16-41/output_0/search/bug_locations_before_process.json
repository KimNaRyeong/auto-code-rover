The modification should define `--skip-checks` as a boolean flag, preserving the existing functionality of the method. The implementation must ensure that any command inheriting from `BaseCommand` automatically gains the ability to recognize and respond to this new argument. This change allows developers to explicitly request skipping system checks via the command line, enhancing the development workflow without affecting the default behavior where checks are performed."

This allows the command to skip over the system checks phase based on the user's explicit request via the command line options. The existing functionality, where system checks run by default to ensure system integrity before proceeding with the command's main logic, must be preserved for cases where `--skip-checks` is not specified."
