        "content": "To resolve this issue effectively, we need to gather more context about how management commands are currently implemented in the project. This involves understanding the base class or mechanism through which management commands are executed, and how command-line options are processed and integrated. Given the information about the existence of a \"skip_checks\" option that is not exposed to the command line, we can infer that there is likely a base class for management commands that handles common arguments or flags.\n\nLet's perform the following API calls to get the required context:\n\n1. Search for the base class of management commands to understand how command-line options are structured and processed. Since management commands are a common feature of frameworks like Django, we can make an educated guess on similar names:\n   - `search_class(\"BaseCommand\")`\n   - `search_class(\"Command\")`\n\n2. Once we have the base class, we should look for the method that parses or processes command-line arguments, as that's likely where we'll need to insert our new `--skip-checks` option:\n   - Since the specific method name is not known yet, we assume typical patterns in implementing CLI interfaces and try common method names for parsing arguments in such classes:\n     - `search_method_in_class(\"add_arguments\", \"BaseCommand\")`\n     - `search_method_in_class(\"handle\", \"BaseCommand\")`\n\n3. Given the description of the stealth option `skip_checks`, searching for its current implementation can provide clues on how it's used internally, which is critical for ensuring the new command-line option interacts correctly with the existing logic:\n   - `search_code(\"skip_checks\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to discover how command-line arguments are defined and processed within management commands and to understand how the existing `skip_checks` option is implemented. With the results from these calls, we should be able to identify where and how to insert the new `--skip-checks` CLI option."

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\nThe collected context provides a good foundation for understanding where and how to integrate the `--skip-checks` option into the Django management command framework. Here\u2019s a breakdown based on the results:\n\n#### `BaseCommand` in `django/core/management/base.py`\n- **What it does:** The `BaseCommand` class serves as the base class for all management commands in the Django framework. It defines common functionalities such as argument parsing (`add_arguments` method), command execution (`handle` method), version management, help text, and more. The `stealth_options` and `base_stealth_options` attributes suggest some options are meant to be hidden from the conventional help text or documentation.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The issue description mentions management commands and a \"stealth option\" `skip_checks`. The `BaseCommand` class defines `skip_checks` as part of `base_stealth_options`, confirming its status as an internally used option. Since it's already a stealth option, exposing it requires making adjustments to how command-line arguments are handled.\n- **Intended behavior:** To address the issue, the management command framework needs to expose `skip_checks` as a user-available command-line argument, allowing users to explicitly skip system checks when running a command. This means altering or extending `add_arguments` to include `--skip-checks` and ensuring the `execute` or related methods respect this flag when provided.\n\n#### `add_arguments` Method\n- **What it does:** This method is an entry point for adding custom command-line arguments to management commands. It\u2019s designed to be overridden by subclasses of `BaseCommand`, allowing each command to specify its unique arguments.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The `add_arguments` method is directly relevant since adding a new command-line option (`--skip-checks`) involves modifying or extending this method in the `BaseCommand` class or ensuring commands that need to recognize this option override this method appropriately.\n- **Intended behavior:** To implement the feature requested in the issue, `add_arguments` will need to be extended to include an argument definition for `--skip-checks`, making it a standardized option across commands that choose to implement it.\n\n#### `handle` Method\n- **What it does:** Serves as the primary logic entry point for a management command. Each command must implement this method to perform its specific tasks. It's where the command's functional logic resides, separate from argument handling and other plumbing.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** While the `handle` method itself might not need to be modified to expose `--skip-checks` on the command line, understanding its place in the command lifecycle is important for ensuring that the `skip_checks` flag's effect is appropriately implemented wherever checks are performed.\n- **Intended behavior:** Depending on how `skip_checks` is currently utilized within commands, modifications to respect the `--skip-checks` flag set from the command line might be necessary within implementations of `handle` or related methods (like `_run_checks`).\n\n#### Presence of `skip_checks` in the Code\n- **What it does:** The presence of `skip_checks` in `base.py` and other snippets confirms it's a configurable behavior in the system checks mechanism of Django management commands. It acts as a switch, presumably to enable or disable running system checks before executing a command's primary logic.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** Directly relates to the issue, as it points to the mechanism that needs to be controlled via the command-line interface.\n- **Intended behavior:** Modification needs to ensure that the `--skip-checks` flag can control this switch from the command line, altering the default behavior (which likely involves running comprehensive system checks before command execution).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo resolve the issue, the next steps involve modifying the `BaseCommand`'s `add_arguments` method to officially include `--skip-checks` as an understood command-line option. Additionally, it\u2019s necessary to ensure that the logic within commands (or the overarching command infrastructure) respects this option when set, effectively skipping the designated checks. This would involve checking the handling of `skip_checks` within `execute`, `_run_checks`, or similar methods where checks are aggregated and run."

The modification should define `--skip-checks` as a boolean flag, preserving the existing functionality of the method. The implementation must ensure that any command inheriting from `BaseCommand` automatically gains the ability to recognize and respond to this new argument. This change allows developers to explicitly request skipping system checks via the command line, enhancing the development workflow without affecting the default behavior where checks are performed.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/core/management/base.py`\n  - **Class:** `BaseCommand`\n  - **Method:** `execute`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** This method should be modified to check if the `--skip-checks` flag has been set and, if so, bypass the execution of `self._run_checks()` or adjust its behavior accordingly. This allows the command to skip over the system checks phase based on the user's explicit request via the command line options. The existing functionality, where system checks run by default to ensure system integrity before proceeding with the command's main logic, must be preserved for cases where `--skip-checks` is not specified.\n\nThese modifications ensure the system's checks can be conditionally bypassed, providing flexibility for development workflows without negatively impacting the default behavior focused on system integrity and safety."
