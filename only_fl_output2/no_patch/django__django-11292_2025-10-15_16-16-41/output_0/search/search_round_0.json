        "content": "To resolve this issue effectively, we need to gather more context about how management commands are currently implemented in the project. This involves understanding the base class or mechanism through which management commands are executed, and how command-line options are processed and integrated. Given the information about the existence of a \"skip_checks\" option that is not exposed to the command line, we can infer that there is likely a base class for management commands that handles common arguments or flags.\n\nLet's perform the following API calls to get the required context:\n\n1. Search for the base class of management commands to understand how command-line options are structured and processed. Since management commands are a common feature of frameworks like Django, we can make an educated guess on similar names:\n   - `search_class(\"BaseCommand\")`\n   - `search_class(\"Command\")`\n\n2. Once we have the base class, we should look for the method that parses or processes command-line arguments, as that's likely where we'll need to insert our new `--skip-checks` option:\n   - Since the specific method name is not known yet, we assume typical patterns in implementing CLI interfaces and try common method names for parsing arguments in such classes:\n     - `search_method_in_class(\"add_arguments\", \"BaseCommand\")`\n     - `search_method_in_class(\"handle\", \"BaseCommand\")`\n\n3. Given the description of the stealth option `skip_checks`, searching for its current implementation can provide clues on how it's used internally, which is critical for ensuring the new command-line option interacts correctly with the existing logic:\n   - `search_code(\"skip_checks\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to discover how command-line arguments are defined and processed within management commands and to understand how the existing `skip_checks` option is implemented. With the results from these calls, we should be able to identify where and how to insert the new `--skip-checks` CLI option."
