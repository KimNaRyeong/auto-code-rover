The file where the test failed: `astropy/time/tests/test_precision.py`.\n2. The method that needs investigation: `two_sum`.\n3. The test method that fails: `test_two_sum_symmetric`.\n\nGiven these elements, the most appropriate API calls to make would be:\n\n1. Look for the implementation of `two_sum` to understand how it is supposed to work and why it might return unexpected results when the order of arguments changes.\n2. Get more context around the failing test case `test_two_sum_symmetric` to understand its intent and setup.\n\nHence, the necessary API calls are:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"two_sum\", \"astropy/time/tests/test_precision.py\")`: This will provide information on whether the `two_sum` method is defined or used within the test file itself, which can be common in unit tests for specific utility functions.\n- `get_code_around_line(\"astropy/time/tests/test_precision.py\", 315, 5)`: This call aims to get more code context around the line where the assertion fails to see if there are any relevant comments, setup, or data that could affect the outcome.\n- `search_method(\"two_sum\")`: Since `two_sum` might be defined in another module or file, this broader search will help locate its definition across the entire project if it\u2019s not found within the test file itself.\n"
