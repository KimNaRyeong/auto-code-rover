        "intended_behavior": "The `two_sum` method should compute the sum of two floating-point numbers `a` and `b` such that the result is symmetric, i.e., `two_sum(a, b) == two_sum(b, a)` in terms of both the sum and the error component. This means the method needs to ensure that the handling of floating-point arithmetic and the associated errors does not depend on the order of the operands, preserving the commutative property of addition. To resolve the issue, the implementation might need adjustment to ensure that it correctly and symmetrically handles the floating-point rounding errors, especially in edge cases involving very large or very small numbers that can challenge the precision limits of float64 representations. The adjustments should validate that, for any `a, b` within the representable range of float64 numbers, swapping `a` and `b` does not change the outcome of the function. This may require a review and potentially an enhancement of the error analysis approach in the method, ensuring that the floating-point error compensation (`ea`, `eb`) does not lead to asymmetry in computed results for reversed operands."
