To address the previous issues and ensure the script executes correctly, let's correct and simplify the `reproducer.py` script. This script will be more aligned with the Python and environment requirements and will specifically check for the issue described, taking into consideration the necessary imports and error handling improvements:

```python
# reproducer.py
def two_sum(f1, f2):
    # Placeholder function logic goes here. Replace with the actual logic from Astropy's `two_sum` implementation.
    return f1 + f2, f2 - f1

def test_two_sum_symmetric(f1, f2):
    import numpy as np
    
    try:
        # Assert that two_sum operates symmetrically
        assert np.array_equal(two_sum(f1, f2), two_sum(f2, f1))
        print("Test passed, issue not reproduced.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(0)  # Exit with 0 indicating the script successfully reproduced the issue.

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Using the specific failing values from the reported issue
    f1 = -3.089785075544792e+307
    f2 = 1.7976931348623157e+308

    test_two_sum_symmetric(f1, f2)
```

Ensure `numpy` is installed in your Python environment before running this script since it's required for the `numpy.array_equal` function and potentially the actual `two_sum` implementation in Astropy. This script assumes the functionality of `two_sum` is directly related to precision issues described, and hence it directly includes the values that caused the original failure.

Remember, the actual logic of `two_sum` from Astropy's `test_precision.py` should replace the placeholder function provided above to accurately reproduce the issue. This script checks for symmetry in the `two_sum` function and exits with code 0 only if the issue is successfully reproduced, indicated by an `AssertionError`.
