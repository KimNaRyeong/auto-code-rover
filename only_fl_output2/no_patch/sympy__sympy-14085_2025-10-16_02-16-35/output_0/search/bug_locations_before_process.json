        "intended_behavior": "The `parse_expr` function needs to be enhanced to recognize and properly convert Unicode characters that represent Greek letters into the corresponding symbolic names used by SymPy. For example, it should translate the string \"\u03b1\" to `Symbol('alpha')`. This requires updating or adding to the list of transformations used by `parse_expr` to include a mapping from Greek Unicode characters to their symbolic names. This modification should be carefully implemented to ensure it does not affect the ability to parse and handle other expressions, thereby preserving existing functionality while improving the handling of Greek letters in strings."
