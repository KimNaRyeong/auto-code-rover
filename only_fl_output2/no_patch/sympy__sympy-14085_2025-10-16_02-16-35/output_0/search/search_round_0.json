        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather context around the components involved in the error traceback. The mentioned components are `sympify` in the `sympy/core/sympify.py` file and `parse_expr` in the `sympy/core/ast_parser.py` file, as well as understanding how symbols, like Greek letters, are handled within SymPy. Here are the API calls that will help us get the required context:\n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"sympify\", \"sympy/core/sympify.py\")` - This will provide us the implementation details of the `sympify` function where the issue originates.\n2. `search_method_in_file(\"parse_expr\", \"sympy/core/ast_parser.py\")` - This will give us insight into how expressions are parsed, which seems to be failing for the Greek letter \"\u03b1\".\n3. `search_code(\"Symbol('alpha')\")` - Since Greek letters are pretty printed for symbols of their name, understanding how `Symbol('alpha')` gets processed might offer clues on handling its pretty-printed version \"\u03b1\"."
