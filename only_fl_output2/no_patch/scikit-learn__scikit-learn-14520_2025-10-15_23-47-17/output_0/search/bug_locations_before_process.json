        "intended_behavior": "The `fit_transform` method within the `TfidfVectorizer` class is currently ignoring the `copy` parameter, with a hardcoded value of `False` passed to the `transform` method. The intended behavior is to modify this method to respect an externally provided `copy` parameter. This parameter should control whether a copy of the input data is made during the transformation process. By default, the behavior should remain efficient (potentially not creating a copy), but if a user explicitly sets `copy=True` when calling `fit_transform`, the method should ensure that the transformed data is a copy of the original data, thus preserving the original data unchanged."
