Search for the class `TfidfVectorizer` in the codebase to understand its structure and any inheritance that might be relevant:\n   - `search_class(\"TfidfVectorizer\")`\n\n2. Since the issue is specifically related to a method in the `TfidfVectorizer` class where the `copy` parameter is mentioned but apparently not used, it's beneficial to look at the method's implementation:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"fit_transform\", \"TfidfVectorizer\")`\n\n3. The part of the code provided in the issue points out a specific line inside a file (`text.py`). Fetching the surrounding code could help understand how the `copy=False` is intended to be used or if its usage was indeed omitted:\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py\", 1669, 10)`\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py\", 1692, 10)`\n\nThese API calls aim to provide an overview of the class definition, method implementation where the issue is observed, and the specific context around the mentioned lines. This should give a solid foundation for understanding the problem and moving towards crafting a patch."
