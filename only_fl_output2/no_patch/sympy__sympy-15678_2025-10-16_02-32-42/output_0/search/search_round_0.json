        "content": "To resolve the issue reported, we need to gather more context about the `idiff` function, its usage, and its implementation. The error messages point to specific problems in handling equations (specifically with `Eq`) and in dealing with expressions that involve a function of x (`f(x)`) instead of a direct variable like `y`.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls will provide the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the implementation of `idiff`:** Since the traceback shows `idiff` is causing the issue, the first step is getting more context about where and how `idiff` is implemented.\n   - `search_method(\"idiff\")`\n\n2. **Get context around the error messages:** The error messages point to specific lines where exceptions are raised, but we need more context about the logic leading up to these errors.\n   - Since we know one error is related to the use of `Eq` and another due to `f(x)`, let's search for code snippets that match these patterns within the `idiff` function, if the implementation details are accessible. This step might help understand how `idiff` currently processes its arguments and where it might be falling short.\n   - `search_code(\"solve(eq.diff(x), dydx)[0].subs(derivs)\")`\n   - `search_code(\"raise ValueError(\\\"expecting x-dependent symbol(s) but got: %s\\\" % y)\")`\n\n3. **Understand the handling of equations and symbols in idiff:** The issues reported suggest that `idiff` may not be handling equations (`Eq`) properly and has trouble interpreting expressions like `f(x)` as variables. To address these specific points, more context about how `idiff` parses and manipulates its inputs is needed.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"eq.diff(x)\", \"./sympy/geometry/util.py\")`\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"solve(\", \"./sympy/geometry/util.py\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to gather a comprehensive understanding of `idiff`'s current implementation, focusing on error handling, equation processing, and the handling of symbolic expressions, which are at the heart of the issue submitted."
