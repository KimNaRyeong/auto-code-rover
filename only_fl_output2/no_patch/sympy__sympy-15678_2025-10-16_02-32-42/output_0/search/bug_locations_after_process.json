        "intended_behavior": "The `idiff` function should be enhanced to handle equations passed as `Eq` objects seamlessly. When an `Eq` object is passed as the equation parameter `eq`, `idiff` should first convert this into an expression that can be used for differentiation and solving by subtracting one side of the equation from the other (e.g., using `eq = eq.lhs - eq.rhs` when `eq` is detected to be an instance of `Eq`). This change would preserve the existing functionality for other types of inputs while extending support for `Eq` objects."

        "intended_behavior": "The method needs modification to correctly identify and differentiate expressions of the form `f(x)` as dependent variables. Error handling that currently raises a `ValueError` when encountering a non-symbol dependent variable (`\"expecting x-dependent symbol(s) but got: %s\" % y`) should be updated. A potential solution involves introducing logic to recognize function expressions and manipulate them equivalently to symbols in the context of solving for derivatives. This includes creating a more flexible substitution strategy that can handle function symbols and ensuring that differentiation correctly interprets these function symbols as dependent variables."
