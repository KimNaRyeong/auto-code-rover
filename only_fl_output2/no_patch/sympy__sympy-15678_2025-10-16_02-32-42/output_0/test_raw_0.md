This script contains three test functions intended to reproduce the reported issues with the `idiff` function from SymPy:

1. `test_idiff_supports_eq()` tries to run `idiff` with an equation wrapped in `Eq()`. The function should run without raising exceptions when the issue with `Eq` is resolved.

2. `test_idiff_with_function()` attempts to call `idiff` with an expression involving a function of x, `f(x)`. Since the reported issue states that `idiff` doesn't support expressions like `f(x)`, an `AssertionError` is raised if the function does not raise the expected `ValueError`. If the issue is fixed, and it does not raise a `ValueError`, an alternative assertion might need to be revised to reflect the correct behavior.

3. `test_idiff_without_eq_or_function()` demonstrates a case where `idiff` is used with regular symbols and expressions not involving `Eq` or a function of x. This test is supposed to pass when `idiff` functions correctly under such circumstances.

The script will raise an `AssertionError` if the issues are present, indicating that the problem exists. If the issues are fixed, the script will complete without error.
