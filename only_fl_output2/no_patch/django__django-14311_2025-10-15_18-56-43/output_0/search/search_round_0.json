        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue described, it's crucial to understand how Django's autoreloader currently processes arguments, specifically in relation to handling modules passed with the `-m` flag. From the issue, it\u2019s clear we need to examine the implementation of the fix and how modules specified as `foo.bar.baz` are incorrectly handled as `foo.bar`. The commit mentioned in the issue ([ec6d253](https://github.com/django/django/commit/ec6d2531c59466924b645f314ac33f54470d7ac3)) is a good starting point, but since we can't directly access external links or commits, we'll focus on what we can find within Django's codebase according to the issue description.\n\nFirst, we need to identify the part of the Django codebase that is responsible for the autoreloading mechanism. From the issue description and familiarity with Django, this functionality is likely to be part of Django's utility scripts or commands related to starting the server, specifically around autoreloading during development. \n\nGiven the context, the following API calls are necessary to gather the relevant code snippets and implementation details for crafting a patch:\n\n1. **Search the autoreloader's implementation:**\n   - Since the issue mentions autoreloading, it's logical to start by locating the autoreloader's implementation. However, without the exact name of the class or method used for autoreload, we must rely on keyword searches.\n   - `search_code(\"autoreloader\")` might reveal which files or classes implement autoreloading functionality, so we can narrow down further searches.\n\n2. **Identify how arguments are parsed and modified:**\n   - The description points towards argument parsing when `-m` is used, implying there's logic that modifies or interprets these arguments.\n   - `search_code(\"-m\")` could help identify relevant code sections that deal with module parsing and argument handling.\n\n3. **Discover code related to module handling:**\n   - Since there's an issue with how dotted module names are handled, finding where Django deals with these could be crucial.\n   - `search_code(\"dotted module name\")` as an exploratory step to see if there's any explicit handling or mentioning of such cases in comments or code logic.\n\nThese initial searches aim to develop a broad understanding of how Django's autoreloader currently works, focusing on areas likely impacted by the described issue\u2014argument parsing, module handling, and maybe specific autoreload mechanisms. From there, we can narrow down to more targeted searches or direct examination of certain files or classes based on what we find."
