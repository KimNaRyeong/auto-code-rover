        "intended_behavior": "Within this file, the code responsible for interpreting and handling the `-m` module syntax needs to accurately distinguish and maintain full dotted module paths instead of truncating them to a parent package. The intended behavior should ensure that when a command like `python -m foo.bar.baz` is executed, the autoreloader recognizes and uses the complete `foo.bar.baz` path for reloading purposes, rather than misinterpreting it as `foo.bar`. This would involve adjusting how command line arguments are parsed and fed into the reloading mechanism, potentially requiring enhancements to both argument parsing and the reloader's module tracking logic. The key is preserving the functionality for other forms of module specification (e.g., simple scripts or packages with `__main__.py`) while correcting the handling for dotted module names. This fix must ensure the auto-reloader remains functional in its primary role of monitoring for code changes and restarting the development server when changes are detected, across all supported modes of specifying what code to run."
