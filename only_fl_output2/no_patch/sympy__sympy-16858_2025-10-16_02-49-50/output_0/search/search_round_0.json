        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to missing checks and attributes in various distributions of sympy.stats, I will select several search API calls focusing on likely affected classes or methods based on the description:\n\n1. **Search for classes related to distributions**: Since the issue mentions that various distributions in `sympy.stats` lack checks for parameters and set attributes, it's essential to search for classes representing these distributions. However, without specific distribution names, we're somewhat at a guess. A common starting point could be classes like `Normal`, `Binomial`, or `Poisson` as they are fundamental distributions. If the names of specific distributions were mentioned in the issue, we could target those directly.\n\n2. **Search for methods related to parameter checking or attribute setting within those classes**: Methods that are likely involved in accepting parameters (for instance, constructor methods or setters) and those that handle internal attributes setting.\n\nGiven the generalized nature of the issue without explicit mention of class or method names, I propose starting with common distributions and checking for commonly used method patterns for parameter checks and attribute settings. Here are the API calls I would make following this strategy:\n\n```python\n# Search for classes representing common distributions to start investigating the issue.\nsearch_class(\"Normal\")\nsearch_class(\"Binomial\")\nsearch_class(\"Poisson\")\n\n# Assuming we might find methods like `check_parameters` or similar in any class for parameter validation.\nsearch_method(\"check_parameters\")\n\n# Also, searching for a common attribute setter method, though specific names are not mentioned in the issue.\nsearch_method(\"set_attributes\")\n\n# If specific distribution names were given in the issue, replace the \"Normal\", \"Binomial\", \"Poisson\" with those names in the above calls.\n```\n\nThese calls will provide a starting point to gather more context about where the missing checks and attributes might be and how the existing code structure manages these aspects. Further searches would be refined based on the findings from these initial queries."
