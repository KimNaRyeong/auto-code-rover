        "intended_behavior": "The `polyval` function should check if the `coord` DataArray has a name, and if not, a temporary name should be assigned for the duration of the function call to ensure compatibility with `get_clean_interp_index`. This temporary name could be something generic or derived from its dimension's name to ensure uniqueness and avoid clashes. This adjustment preserves the existing functionality for named coordinates while extending support to unnamed coordinates."

        "intended_behavior": "Enhance `get_clean_interp_index` to handle the scenario where `dim` is provided but `use_coordinate` results in a coordinate without a name. In such cases, the function should either utilize the dimension name (if appropriate) as a fallback or support operations with unnamed coordinates without causing errors. This functionality should include handling both the creation of an index for interpolation and ensuring that any checks or operations that rely on coordinate names are compatible with unnamed coordinates. This update caters to a more robust, error-tolerant handling of coordinate and dimension names, facilitating smoother operations with a wider variety of `DataArray` inputs."
