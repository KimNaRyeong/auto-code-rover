UserSettingsHolder in django/conf/__init__.py\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\nThe `UserSettingsHolder` class seems to be a container for settings. It has methods for getting, setting, deleting settings, and a few others like checking if a setting is overridden and providing a representation.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\nThe class `UserSettingsHolder` appears to be directly involved in the issue, as its `__getattr__` method allows retrieval of settings regardless of their casing, contrary to the expected behavior where only uppercase settings should be retrievable.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\nBased on the issue description, `UserSettingsHolder.__getattr__()` should probably be modified to raise an error or ignore any non-uppercase setting names, enforcing the documentation's constraint that only uppercase settings are allowed.\n\n### 2. configure method in LazySettings class in django/conf/__init__.py\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\nThe `configure` method allows for the manual configuration of settings. It takes a set of options (presumably settings), assigns them to an instance of `UserSettingsHolder`, and then wraps this holder within the `LazySettings` instance.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\nThe `configure` method directly relates to the issue as it allows for setting non-uppercase settings. According to the issue, this behavior contradicts the documentation, suggesting only uppercase settings should be allowed.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\nThe method should ideally validate the option names to ensure they are uppercase before setting them on the `UserSettingsHolder`, adhering to the documented constraint.\n\n\nOverall, the intended behavior deduced from the issue is that both setting and getting settings via `UserSettingsHolder` (either directly or through the `configure` method in `LazySettings`) should enforce the rule that only uppercase settings are allowed. This implies we might need to add validation logic in both the `configure` method before settings are assigned and potentially modify `UserSettingsHolder.__getattr__` to enforce this constraint or ensure it's enforced elsewhere consistently."

If a non-uppercase setting name is accessed, it should either raise an AttributeError or simply return a not found response (e.g., `None` or a custom message indicating the setting is invalid), thus preserving the functionality while enforcing the constraint that only uppercase settings are allowed to be accessed.\n\n### Location 2:\n- **File:** django/conf/__init__.py\n- **Class:** LazySettings\n- **Method:** configure\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\nThe `configure` method should include a validation step for the names of the settings in the **options** dictionary, ensuring they are all uppercase. If the validation fails (i.e., if there are non-uppercase options), it should raise a ValueError or similar exception that clearly indicates the nature of the error. This will preserve the existing functionality by allowing settings to be manually configured while enforcing the rule that only uppercase settings are allowed, thereby aligning with the documented constraints and the intended use of Django settings. \n\nBy implementing these changes, we ensure that the system respects the documented constraints regarding settings being uppercase, thus promoting consistency and avoiding potential issues related to the case sensitivity of setting names."
