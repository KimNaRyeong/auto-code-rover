If a non-uppercase setting name is accessed, it should either raise an AttributeError or simply return a not found response (e.g., `None` or a custom message indicating the setting is invalid), thus preserving the functionality while enforcing the constraint that only uppercase settings are allowed to be accessed."

        "intended_behavior": "The `configure` method should include a validation step for the names of the settings in the **options** dictionary, ensuring they are all uppercase. If the validation fails (i.e., if there are non-uppercase options), it should raise a ValueError or similar exception that clearly indicates the nature of the error. This will preserve the existing functionality by allowing settings to be manually configured while enforcing the rule that only uppercase settings are allowed, thereby aligning with the documented constraints and the intended use of Django settings."
