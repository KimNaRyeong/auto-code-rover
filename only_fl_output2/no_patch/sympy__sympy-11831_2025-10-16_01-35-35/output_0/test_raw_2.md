Given the request, here's how you can structure `reproducer.py` to capture the behavior of the reported issue. Please note that in order to run this script, you'll need to have `sympy` installed in your Python environment.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_sympy_set_intersection():
    from sympy import symbols, S, sets

    d = symbols("d")
    solution = sets.FiniteSet((d + 1, -d + 4, -d + 5, d))
    
    try:
        # This is where the issue is anticipated.
        solution.intersect(S.Naturals0**4)
        # If the operation passes without a TypeError, then it's assumed to be fixed.
        print("No issues encountered. The problem seems to have been fixed.")
        exit(0)
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Raising AssertionError to indicate issue presence explicitly if TypeError is caught.
        raise AssertionError("The intersection operation failed due to a TypeError.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_sympy_set_intersection()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        exit(1)  # Exit with an error code if the issue is present.
```

This script follows the instructions for:

- Attempting to execute the code that's expected to fail due to the issue.
- Catching the specific `TypeError` and printing detailed information about the exception.
- Raising an `AssertionError` if the expected error is encountered, affirming the issue's presence.

Execution will exit with code `0` only if the issue is somehow fixed and no error is raised, contrary to the expected failing behavior. Otherwise, it will exit with code `1`, indicating the issue persists, which aligns with reproducing the problematic behavior.
