This script is designed to reproduce the specified issue of a `TypeError` raised during a `set intersection` operation in `sympy`. When executed, it attempts the intersection operation that is known to cause the issue. When the issue occurs, it captures and prints a detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. If the intersection operation does not raise a `TypeError`, it means the issue has been fixed, and the script will raise an `AssertionError`. If any other exception occurs, it also raises an `AssertionError`, but with a different message, helping to differentiate between expected and unexpected behaviors.
