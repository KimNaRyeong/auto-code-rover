Specifically, we need to understand how `transform` method handles different data types and why it fails when transforming empty lists after fitting with string values. The error tracebacks indicate a type casting issue within NumPy functions called by the `transform` method, which suggests that looking at the implementation might reveal assumptions or operations leading to the failure. \n\nLet's perform the following API calls to get the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"LabelEncoder\")`: This will help us locate where the `LabelEncoder` class is defined, allowing us to further investigate its methods.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"transform\", \"LabelEncoder\")`: Since the issue occurs when the `transform` method is called with an empty list, investigating this method directly will provide insights into its handling of empty inputs and type casting logic."
