Given the requirements and the context of reproducing a specific issue with `LabelEncoder` in scikit-learn, below is an updated standalone Python script that should execute as per the given instructions. This script is designed to trigger the described issue with handling empty lists depending on the data type the `LabelEncoder` was fitted with. The script will print a detailed stack trace if it encounters the described error, and it aims to exit with code 0 if and when the issue is addressed in the future versions of scikit-learn.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_label_encoder_with_empty_input():
    from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
    import numpy as np

    le = LabelEncoder()

    # Case 1: Fitting with integers, then transforming an empty list
    le.fit([1, 2])
    result_int = le.transform([])
    assert result_int.size == 0, "Failed: The method should handle empty inputs gracefully when fitted with integers."

    # Case 2: Fitting with strings, then transforming an empty list
    try:
        le.fit(["a", "b"])
        result_str = le.transform([])
        # Assuming the fix will still return an empty array, regardless of the input data types
        assert result_str.size == 0, "Failed: The method should handle empty inputs gracefully when fitted with strings."
        print("Success: The method handles empty inputs gracefully for both integers and strings.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue with handling empty lists when fitted with strings is present.")

def main():
    try:
        test_label_encoder_with_empty_input()
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print(ae)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate the issue is present following the initial request
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script first fits a `LabelEncoder` with integers and attempts to transform an empty list. It then does the same with a `LabelEncoder` fitted with strings. According to the problem description, the first operation should succeed, and the second should fail, raising an error due to the type casting issue. The `AssertionError` is specifically raised when the script encounters the known issue to clearly indicate its presence.
