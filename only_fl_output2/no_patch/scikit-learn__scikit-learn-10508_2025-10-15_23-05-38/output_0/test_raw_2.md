Here's a standalone Python script as per your instructions that should reproduce the issue with `LabelEncoder` and handle the AssertionError or any exception appropriately:

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
    import numpy as np
    
    le = LabelEncoder()
    
    try:
        # First scenario with integers
        le.fit([1, 2])
        result_int = le.transform([])
        assert result_int.size == 0, "Failure: The method did not return an empty array when fitted with integers."

        # Second scenario with strings
        le.fit(["a", "b"])
        result_str = le.transform([])  # This is expected to fail based on the specified issue
        assert result_str.size == 0, "Failure: The method did not return an empty array when fitted with strings."
        print("Success: The issue is fixed. Empty list transformation works correctly for all tested inputs.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 if the issue is still present

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print("AssertionError:", ae)
        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating the issue was successfully reproduced and caught by AssertionError
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
```

This script aims to detect the issue with transforming empty lists using `LabelEncoder` from the `scikit-learn` library, specifically when the `fit` method has been used with string values prior to the transformation of an empty list. The script includes error handling to catch and display a detailed stack trace if an exception occurs, aligning with your request for clear visibility of the issue at hand. If an `AssertionError` is caught, it signifies the script anticipated the failure and hence exits with code 0 to indicate success in reproducing the bug. Any other errors will cause the script to exit with code 1.
