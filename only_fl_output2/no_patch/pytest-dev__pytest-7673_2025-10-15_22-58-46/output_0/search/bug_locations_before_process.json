        "intended_behavior": "The method's handling of `_initial_handler_level` should be revised to preserve the handler's original logging level before any test executions that call `set_level`. This can be achieved by initializing `_initial_handler_level` only if it has not already been set, ensuring that multiple calls to `set_level` within the same test do not overwrite the original level. A strategy similar to `_initial_logger_levels` using `setdefault` could be applied or a conditional check to ensure `_initial_handler_level` is only set once and not overwritten by subsequent calls to `set_level`. The restoration of the handler level during teardown should revert it back to this initially saved level, maintaining the integrity of logging levels across different tests."
