Let's perform the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for mentions of the `caplog` class to understand its structure and in which file it's defined:\n   - `search_class(\"caplog\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a specific method, `set_level`, within potentially a `caplog` class or related context, let's search for the method directly:\n   - `search_method(\"set_level\")`\n\n3. The issue description highlights a problem with how `_initial_handler_level` is managed. Therefore, it would be beneficial to find the code snippets where `_initial_handler_level` is mentioned to understand its usage:\n   - `search_code(\"_initial_handler_level\")`"
