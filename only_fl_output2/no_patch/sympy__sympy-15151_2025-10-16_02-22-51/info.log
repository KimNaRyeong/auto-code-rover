This enhancement should preserve the method's existing functionality for pretty-printing other types of expressions, adding only the specific logic required to detect and format indexed expressions correctly. This may involve adjusting the underlying `pretty` method it calls to ensure it supports this specific case, ensuring that indexed expressions are rendered in a detailed and readable format while maintaining backward compatibility and the general extensibility of the pretty printing system."}]
