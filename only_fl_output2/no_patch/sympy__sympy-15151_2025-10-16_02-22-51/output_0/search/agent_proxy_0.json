There are no explicit mentions of class names, method names, or specific code snippets directly in the issue, however, the nature of the issue hints at a few potential approaches:\n\n1. **Searching for a pretty printing class or method**: Since the issue is about \"pretty printing\", we can start by looking for classes or methods that are likely responsible for formatting or rendering expressions.\n\n2. **Examining specific syntax \"indexed(x1, i)\"**: The phrase \"indexed(x1, i)\" seems to be a part of a syntax or a method call involved in the process that is not producing the expected outcome.\n\nLet's construct our API calls to gather more context:\n\n1. To locate the pretty printing functionality, we could search for a class or method with keywords like \"pretty\", \"print\", or \"render\".\n2. To dig directly into how \"indexed(x1, i)\" is processed, we should search for this specific phrase within the codebase.\n\nThese steps will help us find relevant parts of the code that likely contribute to the issue at hand.\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_method(\"pretty_print\")\nsearch_method(\"render\")\nsearch_code(\"indexed(x1, i)\")\n```"
