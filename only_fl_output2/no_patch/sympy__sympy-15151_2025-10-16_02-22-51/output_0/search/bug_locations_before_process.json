        "intended_behavior": "This method, and potentially the 'PrettyPrinter' object it utilizes, must be capable of accurately identifying and formatting indexed expressions such as 'indexed(x1, i)' into the mathematically standard and expected format, 'x_{1,i}'. This entails possibly enhancing or adjusting the 'PrettyPrinter' class\u2019s handling (or processing logic within the 'pretty' method itself) of expressions to ensure that indexed expressions are recognized and converted into a format that includes subscripting and comma separation within braces, without disrupting the formatting of other types of expressions. This targeted improvement should respect and maintain the method's general utility for a wide range of expressions while aligning the presentation of indexed expressions with conventional mathematical notation."
