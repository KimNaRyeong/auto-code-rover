To create a standalone Python file that reproduces the issue described, we need to simulate a situation where the `.pytest` module's behavior would replace '.[' with '[' in a test name under specific conditions. The goal of the script is to detect if this unwanted replacement occurs, and if it does, it should raise an `AssertionError` with a clear stack trace showing where in the code the alteration happens. If the issue is fixed, the script should exit peacefully with exit code 0.

Given the nature of the issue involving pytest's internal behavior, we'll simulate this with a mock environment that tricks the script into thinking it's running under a pytest test scenario. However, it's essential to understand that this script may need modifications if the pytest internals change significantly beyond the provided descriptions.

Here's how you might write such a file, `reproducer.py`:

```python
import pytest
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


@pytest.mark.parametrize("test_input", ["..["])
def test_sample(test_input):
    raise ValueError("Intentional failure to reproduce the issue.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Dynamically run pytest and capture the output
    import subprocess
    import re

    try:
        output = subprocess.check_output(["pytest", __file__], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, text=True)
        match = re.search(r"test_sample\[.*?\]", output)
        if match:
            test_name = match.group(0)
            if test_name != "test_sample[..[]":
                raise AssertionError(f"Test name was altered: found '{test_name}'")

    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as cpe:
        # This means pytest did run and reported failures which is expected in this case
        print("Pytest run as expected, checking for anomalies in test naming:", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(cpe)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("Issue not detected, test naming works as expected.")
        sys.exit(0)
```

This script works by:
- Defining a test function decorated with `@pytest.mark.parametrize`, designed to trigger the described naming issue.
- Running itself with pytest using `subprocess.check_output`. Upon completion, it checks if the output contains the expected (altered or unaltered) test name.
- If the test name has been altered (implying an AssertionError is not raised), the script raises an `AssertionError`, printing a stack trace for debugging.
- If the script does not detect the described issue (meaning pytest behaves as expected), it exits with a code 0.

Note:
- Ensure pytest is installed in the environment where this script will run, as it dynamically invokes pytest on itself.
- The behavior and effectiveness of this script could vary with the version of pytest. If pytest's execution or output format changes, adjustments to the regex search or the overall approach might be necessary.
