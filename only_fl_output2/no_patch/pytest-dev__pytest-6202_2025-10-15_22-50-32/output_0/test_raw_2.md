Creating a script that directly reproduces this specific pytest-related issue purely through standalone execution (without explicitly invoking pytest via CLI or similar) is fundamentally challenging, given that the issue occurs within the pytest internals themselves. However, we can approximate an approach by crafting a script that utilizes pytest's API to attempt to reproduce the scenario programmatically. This script will still require pytest to be installed in the environment where the script is executed.

Given the constraints and the nature of the reported issue, I'll provide a Python script that essentially tries to simulate the test collection phase and then directly manipulates or inspects relevant internal data structures of pytest to identify the problem. However, please be aware that without directly running pytest in its standard manner (i.e., via command line interface), we might not fully emulate the exact issue context. Additionally, the approach of directly inspecting or altering internal pytest structures is brittle and might not work across different pytest versions.

Nonetheless, let's draft a script based on the provided details:

```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    Line {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Attempt to import pytest programmatically
    try:
        import pytest
        from _pytest.python import Function
    except ImportError as e:
        print("Pytest must be installed to reproduce the issue.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    test_name = "test_boo[.[]"

    # Mocking a pytest Function item to manually inspect name handling
    class MockFunction(Function):
        def __init__(self, name):
            self._name = name

        def reportinfo(self):
            return self.fspath, None, self._name

    mock_func = MockFunction(name=test_name)
    
    # Simulating what happens when pytest generates a report description
    desc = mock_func.nodeid
    
    if desc == test_name:
        print("Issue not present. Test naming works as expected.")
        sys.exit(0)
    else:
        print(f"Issue present. Expected '{test_name}' but got '{desc}'")
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note:
- This script tries to simulate the critical path where the issue might manifest but does so at a high level without diving deep into pytest's collection and execution phases, primarily because replicating the precise conditions and internal state of pytest involved in test name modification without running pytest via its CLI can be very complex.
- The script checks if the manipulated test name retains its original form after going through a mocked version of pytest's internals (specifically, a process similar to what happens when pytest generates a report description).
- The effectiveness of this replication script is constrained by how closely it emulates the specific internal behavior of pytest you're interested in. Given the context, it's advisable to run this in an environment where the issue is known to occur to check if the script can detect the naming problem accurately.
