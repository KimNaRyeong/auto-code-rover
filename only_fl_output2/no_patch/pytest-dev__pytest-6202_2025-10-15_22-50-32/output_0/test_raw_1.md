For this specific scenario, directly reproducing the issue outside the pytest environment isn't straightforward due to the nature of the bug relating specifically to pytest internals and how it alters test names under certain conditions. However, I'll aim to provide a script that does its best to mirror the conditions and exhibit the issue when run in a context where pytest is available, and otherwise, provide meaningful output or indications on the status of the issue.

The script below tries to replicate the original problem within pytest's framework by defining a test function whose name should trigger the replacement logic, and inspecting the test name programmatically after a test run to determine if it's been altered improperly.

```python
import pytest

def test_issue_reproduction():
    """
    A simple test function that will always pass.
    It's only needed to trigger the test infrastructure.
    """
    assert True

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', line_number, ':', code_context, file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import subprocess
    import re

    try:
        # Dynamically running the test(s) within this script
        output = subprocess.check_output(["pytest", "-v", "--tb=short", __file__], text=True)
        pattern = re.compile(r"test_issue_reproduction(\[.+\])")
        matches = pattern.findall(output)

        if matches:
            # Assuming the first match contains the parameterization part
            test_name_suffix = matches[0]
            if test_name_suffix == "[..[]":
                print("Issue not present, test naming works as expected.")
                sys.exit(0)
            else:
                raise AssertionError("Test name has been altered incorrectly.")  # Assuming alteration
        else:
            print("Test name pattern not found in output, unable to verify issue.")
            sys.exit(1)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as cpe:
        print("Pytest execution failed. This might be due to the environment not having pytest installed.")
        print_stacktrace(cpe)
        sys.exit(cpe.returncode)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
```

This script:
1. Defines a minimal test case `test_issue_reproduction` intended to pass without any conditions.
2. In the main block, attempts to invoke `pytest` on itself to trigger test discovery and execution.
3. Uses regular expressions to search the output for evidence of the test name alteration bug.
4. Reports whether the issue is present based on the observed test name alteration results.

Note: This script assumes that pytest is correctly installed in the environment and that it's being executed in a manner where subprocesses can invoke pytest on the script. The script's success in demonstrating the issue as described depends on having a test environment similar to the one where the issue was originally observed, including the pytest version. It's a somewhat unique approach due to the necessity of capturing pytest behavior from within a pytest-invocable script.
