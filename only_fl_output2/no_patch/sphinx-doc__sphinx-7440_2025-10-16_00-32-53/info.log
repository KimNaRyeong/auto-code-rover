The intended behavior is to ensure that Sphinx, which is the tool used for generating the documentation, treats these terms as distinct when they are meant to refer to different concepts or when the case difference is deliberate and meaningful. This could involve considering the following adjustments: - Reviewing and updating the `glossary.rst` file to ensure that if `MySQL` and `mysql` are indeed meant to represent the same term, they should be merged into a single, consistent term usage throughout the document. This involves consolidating any duplicated content and eliminating one of the terms in favor of the other. - If `MySQL` and `mysql` are intended to be separate terms with distinct meanings, then an exception or clarification should be added to guide Sphinx during the build process. This might involve configuring Sphinx or its glossary extension to treat the terms as case-sensitive or providing additional context within the `glossary.rst` file to differentiate the terms clearly. - Ensuring documentation clarity by possibly adding a note or explanation regarding the case sensitivity of certain terms and their distinct meanings, if applicable. This clarification or adjustment will prevent Sphinx from throwing an error during the documentation build process due to perceived duplicate terms, thereby preserving the integrity and accuracy of the project's documentation."
