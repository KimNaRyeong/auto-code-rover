Since we are unable to directly access the specific files or execute further effective search API calls to gather the necessary information for resolving the issue with `doc/glossary.rst` in your project, my ability to assist is significantly constrained.\n\nAt this point, the best course of action would be manual investigation within the project's repository or collaboration with the project's maintenance team for more direct assistance. This approach will allow for the hands-on examination and modification of the `doc/glossary.rst` document or any related project configurations that could address the Sphinx documentation build error regarding duplicate, case-sensitive term definitions.\n\nI recommend the following steps:\n\n1. **Manual Repository Inspection**: If you have access, directly inspect the `doc/glossary.rst` in the phpMyAdmin project to identify and correct instances where \"MySQL\" and \"mysql\" may be causing conflicts due to case sensitivity.\n\n2. **Consultation with Sphinx Documentation**: Review the Sphinx documentation for any guidance on handling case sensitivity within glossary terms or configurations that may allow both terms to coexist without causing build errors.\n\n3. **Project Community Engagement**: Engage with the phpMyAdmin project\u2019s community forums, issue trackers, or mailing lists. Often, project contributors and maintainers may have encountered similar issues or may have insights or workarounds that are not immediately obvious.\n\n4. **Review Project Documentation and Guidelines**: Projects often have documentation or contributor guidelines that may address common issues or provide specific instructions for handling documentation-related matters, including glossary terms in Sphinx.\n\nI hope these suggestions help guide you towards finding a suitable resolution."
