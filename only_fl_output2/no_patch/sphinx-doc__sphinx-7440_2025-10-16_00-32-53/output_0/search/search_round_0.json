        "content": "To address the reported issue effectively, we need specific context from the `glossary.rst` file where the duplicate term definition is reported. Since the error points to a specific line number within a documentation file and we're dealing with Sphinx documentation, code-specific searches (like those for classes or methods) might not be directly helpful. Instead, focusing on the content around the mentioned line will provide us with the needed details to understand how `MySQL` and `mysql` are both referenced, allowing us to propose a fix.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API call to gather context:\n\n- `get_code_around_line(\"doc/glossary.rst\", 243, 10)`: This call will retrieve the lines around the specified line number 243 in the `glossary.rst` file, which is directly related to the reported issue. A `window_size` of 10 is chosen to provide ample context before and after the problem line, potentially including both mentions of `MySQL` and `mysql`."
