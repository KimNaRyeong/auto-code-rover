        "content": "<issue>autowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr\nWhen using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:\n```python\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\nimport numpy as np\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\nexpr = 1.0\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\n```\nThis should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:\n```python\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\n```\nA little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:\n```C\ndouble autofunc(double x) {\ndouble autofunc_result;\nautofunc_result = 1.0;\nreturn autofunc_result;\n}\n```\n(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)\nI've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:\n```python\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\nimport numpy as np\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\n# now output depends on x\nexpr = x[0,0]\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\n# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\n```\nThis may seem like a silly issue (\"why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?\"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.\nI think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from our search results, let's address each piece individually:\n\n### `autowrap` Function in `sympy/utilities/autowrap.py`\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `autowrap` function compiles a SymPy expression into a callable binary function. It takes an expression and optional parameters like the backend (either `f2py` or `cython`), the language, temporary directory paths, argument details, and compilation flags. The function eventually generates code, wraps it using the specified backend, and makes it callable from Python.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue arises when `autowrap` is used with `backend='cython'` and an array argument (e.g., `MatrixSymbol`) does not appear in the expression. The bug is related to how `autowrap` handles these function arguments during the code generation phase, specifically with the Cython backend.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Ideally, regardless of the argument's presence in the expression, `autowrap` should correctly interpret array-like arguments (or `MatrixSymbol` instances) and generate appropriate C (or Cython) code that handles these arguments correctly (e.g., as array pointers rather than scalars).\n\n### `MatrixSymbol` Class in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - `MatrixSymbol` represents a symbolic matrix expression. It is used in expressions that are meant to be symbolic representations of matrices within the SymPy framework.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The bug involves `MatrixSymbol` instances as arguments to the `autowrap` function, which indicates a potential disconnect or misinterpretation in how these symbolic matrix arguments are handled during the wrapping process for Cython backend code generation.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - When a `MatrixSymbol` is passed as an argument to `autowrap`, the generated Cython code (or intermediary C code) should acknowledge the matrix nature of the symbol, thus defining the function parameter as a pointer to arrays (e.g., `double*`) instead of a scalar (`double`).\n\n### Search for \"double autofunc(double x)\" in the codebase\n- The inability to locate this specific code snippet doesn't directly give us context from the existing codebase but indicates that the signature might be dynamically generated based on the arguments passed to `autowrap`. This suggests investigating how `autowrap` and, by extension, the `CythonCodeWrapper` (inferred from the backend name) handle argument types and their translation into C function signatures.\n\nGiven the results and analysis, further steps to debug the issue could involve:\n- Investigating how the `CythonCodeWrapper` class and its helper methods (`routine`, `wrap_code`) handle argument types, particularly `MatrixSymbol` instances, to generate C/Cython function signatures.\n- Identifying where in the codebase the mapping or decision logic happens that leads to a scalar type (`double`) being used for array arguments in the generated code.\n\nTherefore, additional API calls we should make include searching for the `CythonCodeWrapper` class and any method related to routine generation or code wrapping within it:\n- search_class(\"CythonCodeWrapper\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"routine\", \"CythonCodeWrapper\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"wrap_code\", \"CythonCodeWrapper\")"
