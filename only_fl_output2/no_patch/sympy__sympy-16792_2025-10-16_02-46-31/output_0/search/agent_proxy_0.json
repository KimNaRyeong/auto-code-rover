Below are the API calls that would provide the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the `autowrap` function in the entire codebase to understand its implementation and how it interacts with the backend specified:\n   - `search_method(\"autowrap\")`\n\n2. Since the issue involves the `MatrixSymbol` class, we need to look into its details to understand how it's supposed to interact with `autowrap` and how it's represented during the Cython backend code generation:\n   - `search_class(\"MatrixSymbol\")`\n\n3. Given that the incorrect C function signature is a key point of failure, it's essential to understand how the C function signatures are generated, specifically when the backend is Cython. We should look for the code snippet or function responsible for generating these signatures:\n   - `search_code(\"double autofunc(double x)\")`\n\nBy examining the details and implementation of `autowrap`, understanding the role and functionality of `MatrixSymbol`, and investigating the process of generating C function signatures, we'll be better equipped to pinpoint the problem and devise a suitable fix."
