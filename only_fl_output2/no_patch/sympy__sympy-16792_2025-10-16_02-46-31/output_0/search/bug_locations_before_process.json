When processing array arguments (like those represented by MatrixSymbol), the generated Cython code should accurately reflect the array nature of the parameters rather than treating them as scalars. This could involve adjusting how variables are declared within the templated code or ensuring that the argument's nature (scalar vs. array) is considered when generating function prototypes and declarations."

It should be ensured or modified that array arguments are correctly identified and treated differently from scalar arguments. The method could be adjusted to set flags or properties for each argument that correctly indicate its type (especially for arrays) so that subsequent steps in file preparation and code generation can utilize this information to generate correct Cython and C code that handles array inputs properly."
