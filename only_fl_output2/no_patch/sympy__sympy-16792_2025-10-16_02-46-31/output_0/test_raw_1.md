Given the previous attempt to run `reproducer.py` failed due to a missing `numpy` module, which is external to the standard Python library and must be installed separately, and the focus on the `sympy` library and its autowrap feature, here's an updated standalone Python script that attempts to address the outlined issue. This version integrates a safety check for the `numpy` dependency, showcasing how one might attempt to gracefully handle or alert about missing dependencies in a reproducible script scenario.

Please ensure that the environment where this script is intended to run has `sympy` and `numpy` properly installed. In a real-world scenario, dependencies would typically be documented and managed through a requirements file or a containerized environment to ensure consistency and reproducibility.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_dependencies():
    try:
        import numpy
        import sympy
    except ImportError as e:
        print("Missing required dependencies. Please ensure numpy and sympy are installed.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

def main():
    check_dependencies()

    from sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap
    from sympy import MatrixSymbol
    import numpy as np

    x = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)
    expr = 1.0  # Simplified expression not involving 'x'
    try:
        f = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')
        # Attempt to evaluate the function which should only return 1.0
        result = f(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))
        assert result == 1.0, "Expected the function to return 1.0"
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print("AssertionError: The test detected the described issue.")
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    else:
        print("No issues detected. The function returned the expected result.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script aims to:
- Check for `numpy` and `sympy` dependencies before attempting to reproduce the issue.
- Reproduce the specific issue as described, regarding `autowrap` with the `cython` backend improperly handling cases where the array arguments do not appear in the wrapped expression.
- Use `print_stacktrace` to provide a detailed output of the error encountered, for diagnostic purposes.
- Exit with code `0` when the issue is fixed, or exit with code `1` upon detecting the issue or encountering an unexpected error.

This should be run in an environment with both `numpy` and `sympy` installed, and intended for use as a diagnostic tool, potentially aiding in the confirmation and eventual resolution of the reported issue.
