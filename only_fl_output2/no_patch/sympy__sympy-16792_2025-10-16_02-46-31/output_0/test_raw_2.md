Here's a revised version of `reproducer.py`, meticulously crafted to pinpoint the described issue. This script deliberately attempts to reproduce the faulty behavior—as delineated—where `autowrap` using the `cython` backend mishandles scenarios involving array arguments not present in the expression being wrapped. Upon identifying the problem, it will raise an `AssertionError`. Conversely, should the issue be rectified, the script will gracefully conclude with an exit code of 0.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap
        from sympy import MatrixSymbol
        import numpy as np
    except ImportError as e:
        print("This script requires sympy and numpy to be installed.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

    x = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)
    expr = 1.0  # The expression does not use 'x'
    try:
        # This is expected to generate a Cython function that takes a matrix but returns a constant
        f = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')
        result = f(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))
        # The following assertion will fail if the issue is present
        assert result == 1.0, f"Expected 1.0, got {result}"
    except TypeError as e:
        print("Issue reproduced: incorrect handling of unused array arguments.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    else:
        print("No issue detected. The function returned the expected result.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please ensure both `sympy` and `numpy` are correctly installed in your Python environment before executing this script. This can be done using pip:

```sh
pip install sympy numpy
```

This script is structured to automatically detect the discussed issue when executed in an appropriately configured environment, visualizing the error clearly if encountered.
