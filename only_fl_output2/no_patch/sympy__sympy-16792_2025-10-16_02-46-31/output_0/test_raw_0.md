This script is designed to:
1. Reproduce the issue related to the autowrap feature of SymPy when it generates Cython code that incorrectly interprets array arguments.
2. It raises an `AssertionError` when the issue is present by ensuring that the returned value is not as expected due to incorrect argument handling in the generated code.
3. Provides a detailed stack trace of where the error occurred for easier debugging and verification, using the `print_stacktrace` function.
4. Exits with code 0 only when the issue is fixed, facilitating automated checks to verify the resolution of the problem.
