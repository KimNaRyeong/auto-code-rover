        "content": "Given the error output you've shared, it appears the issue is unrelated to how the code is written. Instead, it seems to be a problem with the environment setup, specifically a missing `packaging` module. Before we proceed with revising the `reproducer.py`, ensure that your environment includes the `packaging` module, which is a dependency of `astropy`. You can install it using `pip install packaging` or include it in your environment setup.\n\nAssuming your environment issue is resolved, I'll provide an adjusted version of `reproducer.py` that includes error handling for module importation issues but keeps the focus on the original issue regarding spaces in unit representations. Please verify your environment setup, then try executing the script below:\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\nimport sys\n\ntry:\n    import astropy.units as u\nexcept ImportError as import_error:\n    print(f\"Error importing astropy: {import_error}\")\n    sys.exit(1)\nexcept ModuleNotFoundError as module_not_found_error:\n    print(f\"Missing module: {module_not_found_error}.

Once the environment issue is resolved, this script will focus on the original task of asserting whether the space issue with unit representations in Astropy exists or not."
