This might involve checking and possibly modifying the conditions or logic that prepends spaces based on unit scale factors or the presence of certain unit components. Any modification should preserve the method's existing functionality to accurately represent units in their requested format, adjusting only for the leading space inconsistency."

The logic handling the format-specific concatenations and space insertions needs careful inspection to eliminate the inconsistency. As with `core.py`, the aim would be to preserve the integrity and accuracy of the unit representation while aligning with the expected behavior of no leading spaces in all scenarios."
