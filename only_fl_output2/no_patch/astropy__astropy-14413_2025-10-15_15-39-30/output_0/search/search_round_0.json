        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue related to extraneous space in Unicode and console unit representations in Astropy's units module, we need to explore the code responsible for unit string formatting. The following API calls would be pertinent:\n\n1. **Search for the method involved in string formatting of units**: The description implies an inconsistency in how unit strings are formatted when using different formats (e.g., default, unicode, console). We should start by searching for the method that handles `.to_string()` or similar string formatting functionality within unit classes.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_method(\"to_string\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Explore the decomposition of units**: The issue mentions the behavior difference when a unit is decomposed, especially in combination with scales and specific units like `eV` and `s` (seconds). This suggests we should look into how decomposition is handled and how it interacts with formatting.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"decompose\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for where the issue is noted**: The description references specific GitHub PR discussions, indicating the problem areas might be documented or hotfixed there. While we can't access the PR directly through this API, code snippets given in the issue suggest specific string representation examples. Searching for these patterns in the codebase might lead us to relevant sections or tests.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"f'{(u.m**-1):unicode}'\")\n   search_code(\"f'{(u.eV*u.s**2).decompose():unicode}'\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls aim to highlight the methods responsible for the formatting inconsistency and guide the investigation towards sections of the code where fixes are likely needed."
