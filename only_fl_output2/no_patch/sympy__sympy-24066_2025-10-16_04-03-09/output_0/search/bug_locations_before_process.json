        "intended_behavior": "The method should accurately detect and handle expressions involving the `exp` function, especially in determining whether the result of such expressions is dimensionless. This behavior is crucial for correctly processing and interpreting physical quantities and expressions within SymPy's units system. It should: Properly evaluate and simplify expressions involving `exp` to recognize dimensionless outcomes. Ensure that the handling of exponential functions within dimensional analysis accurately reflects the mathematical and physical principles, especially regarding dimensionless quantities."
