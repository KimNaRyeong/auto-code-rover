To use this script, save it as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project. Execute it by running `python3 reproducer.py` in your terminal. The script is designed to:

1. Reproduce the specific issue described.
2. Asserts are placed to test specific conditions where the issue would manifest.
3. In case of failure, a custom `print_stacktrace` function is called to provide a clearer understanding of the cause and location of the error, including the line numbers involved.

When executed, the script will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, clearly describing the failure point via a printed stack trace. If fixed, the script should exit with code 0, indicating no unhandled exceptions occurred.
