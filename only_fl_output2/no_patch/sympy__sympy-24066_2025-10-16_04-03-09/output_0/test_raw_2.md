Given your instructions, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the previous interactions regarding the correct handling of the error and the objective of the script. The goal is to create a script that indeed demonstrates the issue clearly by specifically catching the `ValueError` triggered by the use case and prints the stack trace if the issue is present. 

Below, I've provided a revised version of the `reproducer.py` that aligns with your corrected instructions. It includes the detailed stack trace printing function you've provided. This script is designed to explicitly reproduce the issue described and handle the relevant exceptions.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_issue():
    from sympy import exp
    from sympy.physics import units
    from sympy.physics.units.systems.si import SI

    expr = units.second / (units.ohm * units.farad)
    # This should not raise any errors
    dim = SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr)[1]

    assert SI.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(dim), "The dimension is not detected as dimensionless."

    buggy_expr = 100 + exp(expr)
    # This is expected to raise ValueError showing the bug
    SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(buggy_expr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("AssertionError: An assertion failed, indicating a logic issue in the test.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except ValueError as e:
        print("ValueError: Detected the issue as described.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(0)  # Exiting with 0 as the script successfully reproduced the issue
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred, indicating a different problem might be present.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
```

This script now incorporates the desired error handling where it concludes successfully with an exit code of `0` if it reproduces the specific `ValueError` showing the bug in question, consistent with your corrected guidelines. It uses the detailed `print_stacktrace` function to provide clear insight into the error's origin when it occurs.
