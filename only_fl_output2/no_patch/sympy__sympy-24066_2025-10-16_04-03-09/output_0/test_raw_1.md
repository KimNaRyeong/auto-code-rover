Based on your feedback, it's clear that the test script actually did reproduce the issue as expected, given that it triggered a `ValueError` from within the `sympy` library. The earlier response indicated no issue detected because it was expected to catch an `AssertionError`, not a `ValueError`. 

Let's modify the script to specifically catch the `ValueError` as well and correctly reflect that the issue was indeed reproduced. The modified script will exit with an error message and print the stack trace if the problem persists, or exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from sympy import exp
        from sympy.physics import units
        from sympy.physics.units.systems.si import SI

        # Initial setup
        expr = units.second / (units.ohm * units.farad)
        SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr)  # Ensure no error here
        
        # Buggy expression expected to raise ValueError
        buggy_expr = 100 + exp(expr)
        SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(buggy_expr)
        
        # If ValueError is not raised, assume issue is fixed
        print("No issue detected.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print("AssertionError: An assertion failed indicating an issue.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error due to assertion failure
    except ValueError as e:
        print("ValueError: Detected the issue as expected.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error due to the ValueError indicating the issue
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error due to unexpected exception

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    exit(0)  # Exit with success code if no errors
```

This script now specifically handles `ValueError` to account for the problem described. It prints detailed error information if encountered and exits with code 1 to indicate the error presence, aligning with the requirement for the script to exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed, i.e., no uncaught exceptions are raised.
