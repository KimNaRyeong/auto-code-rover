The method currently simply retrieves a value from `SI_quantity_scale_factors` without handling the special case for units like ohm that should not be affected by the kilogram workaround. The intended behavior here is to incorporate a check or a mechanism that correctly adjusts the scale factor for such cases, ensuring that operations like dividing voltage by current result in the expected SI units without an erroneous scale factor applied."

Given the unexpected behavior when converting quantities to ohm, this function may need additional handling or adjustments to ensure that the scale factor of the result adheres to SI unit expectations."
