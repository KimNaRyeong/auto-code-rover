In the SI system, 1 V/ 1 A = 1 \u03a9.\n### What I Did\n```\n>>> from sympy.physics.units import Quantity, voltage, current, ohm, convert_to\n>>> vs = Quantity('vs')\n>>> vs.set_dimension(voltage)\n>>> vs_i = Quantity('vs_i')\n>>> vs_i.set_dimension(current)\n>>> convert_to(vs/vs_i, ohm)\nohm/1000\n```\n### Further discussion\nThe problem is related to the kilogram workaround and the property `scale_factor`. The default scale_factor for a Quantity is 1.\n```\n>>> vs.scale_factor\n1.0\n```\nThe docstring for `scale_factor' states:\n> Overall magnitude of the quantity as compared to the canonical units.\nBut, the scale factor for ohm is 1000.\n```\n>>> ohm.scale_factor\n1000\nThis value of 1000 conflicts with the definition. `scale_factor` is a user facing property and should be consistent with the unit system definition, in this case the SI. The kilogram workaround should be an internal implementation factor and not exposed to the user.\n</issue>"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "After reviewing the collected context from the API calls, let's analyze the findings:\n\n### Analysis of `Quantity` class from `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py`\nThe `Quantity` class is central to handling physical quantities with units in SymPy. It inherits from `AtomicExpr` and is designed to be both commutative and real, among other properties. The constructor allows for defining a quantity with a name, optional abbreviation, dimension, and scale factor. Critically, the class provides methods for setting dimensions and scale factors, and offers properties for accessing these along with the quantity's name and abbreviation.\n\n#### Relation to the Bug\nThe issue states that dividing a quantity with dimensions of voltage by one with dimensions of current results in an ohm value scaled by 1/1000th of what is expected. This discrepancy suggests a problem with how scale factors are managed or applied during unit conversion operations, specifically when they are expected to adhere to SI standards.\n\nThe `scale_factor` property, which returns the scale factor of a quantity relative to canonical SI units, could be a direct point of interest. Given that the issue highlights inconsistency in the scale factor (where the scale factor for ohm is 1000, conflicting with the user's expectations based on SI units), investigating the handling and accessibility of `scale_factor` becomes crucial.\n\n### Analysis of `set_dimension` and `convert_to` Methods\nThe `set_dimension` method allows for setting the dimension of a quantity and emphasizes supporting SI dimensions primarily, throwing a NotImplementedError for non-SI unit systems. This approach underscores the issue's focus on ensuring SI compliance.\n\nThe `convert_to` method is instrumental in converting quantities to equivalent forms in different units while preserving their dimensions. The reported issue involves this method, as it's being used to convert a ratio of voltage and current to ohms, but the output is unexpectedly scaled.\n\n#### Relation to the Intent and Bug\n1. **Role of Scale Factors**: The handling of `scale_factor` within `Quantity` is central to the issue. Conversions depend on accurately representing and adjusting scale factors according to the SI unit system, which seems to go awry in the current implementation.\n2. **Expectation vs. Reality**: The expectation is that operations involving quantities, when converted to different but dimensionally equivalent forms, would respect the canonical SI representations. This expectation fails in the case of converting voltage/current to ohms, hinting at a deeper issue in either how scale factors are set, retrieved, or applied during conversions.\n\n### Missing Context and Next Steps\n1. **Default `scale_factor`**: The search for instances where `scale_factor` is set to 1.0 returned no results, which suggests that examining constructors or initializers within `Quantity` or related utilities for defaults might be necessary. A more specific search within the `Quantity` class implementation might reveal how scale factors are defaulted or overridden.\n2. **Kilogram Workaround**: The absence of direct references to a \"kilogram workaround\" suggests that the workaround's details might be embedded within the logic for handling dimensions or scale factors, possibly obfuscated by a lack of explicit documentation or comments in the code.\n\n#### Potential API Calls to Consider\n1. **Examine Quantity Constructor**: To understand default handling and potential overrides of `scale_factor`, inspecting the constructor method more closely could unearth default assignment patterns or conditional logic related to scale factors.\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"sympy/physics/units/quantities.py\", line_number_of_constructor, window_size=10)`\n   \n2. **Kilogram Workaround Details**: Since the direct search did not yield results, another approach could involve examining methods closely connected to unit conversion or scale factor adjustment processes, potentially under different terminology.\n   - Searching for methods or code comments that mention specifics about SI unit adjustments, exceptions, or handling might uncover related logic.\n   \n3. **Deep Dive Into `convert_to` in util.py**: Given that `convert_to` is crucial for the issue at hand, examining its implementation in `util.py` might provide insights into how conversions are handled and where the inconsistency originates.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"convert_to\", \"sympy/physics/units/util.py\")`\n\n4. **Scale Factor Adjustments**: Searching for lines of code where `scale_factor` is modified, not just set, to see if there are adjustments or workarounds being applied during unit conversions or elsewhere in the codebase.\n   - `search_code(\"SI_quantity_scale_factors.get\")`\n\nThese steps aim to fill the gaps in our understanding of the issue and its context within the SymPy units module."

The method currently simply retrieves a value from `SI_quantity_scale_factors` without handling the special case for units like ohm that should not be affected by the kilogram workaround. The intended behavior here is to incorporate a check or a mechanism that correctly adjusts the scale factor for such cases, ensuring that operations like dividing voltage by current result in the expected SI units without an erroneous scale factor applied. This may involve introducing conditional logic within the method or a preprocessing step before the scale factor is set, which checks for and corrects any discrepancies arising from internal workarounds or implementations details meant to be hidden from the user.\n  \n- **Bug Location 2**: \n  - **File**: sympy/physics/units/util.py\n  - **Function**: convert_to\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Although not directly mentioned as buggy, the `convert_to` function in utils is crucial for handling conversions that are at the heart of the reported issue. Given the unexpected behavior when converting quantities to ohm, this function may need additional handling or adjustments to ensure that the scale factor of the result adheres to SI unit expectations. It's possible that the conversion process needs to take into account special rules for certain units (like ohm in this case) or corrections for internal workarounds (e.g., the kilogram workaround) that should not affect the resultant scale factor visible to the user. Enhancements here could involve applying adjustments to the scale factor based on the dimensions or units involved in the conversion, ensuring the outcome matches the expected SI standards.\n\nThese adjustments aim to maintain the existing functionality of SymPy's units system while correcting the specific issue reported with ohm scale factors. The focus is on ensuring that internal representation and adjustments do not leak into user-facing properties and behavior, maintaining the integrity and accuracy of unit conversions within the expected SI framework."
