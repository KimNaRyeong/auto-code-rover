In the SI system, 1 V/ 1 A = 1 \u03a9.\n### What I Did\n```\n>>> from sympy.physics.units import Quantity, voltage, current, ohm, convert_to\n>>> vs = Quantity('vs')\n>>> vs.set_dimension(voltage)\n>>> vs_i = Quantity('vs_i')\n>>> vs_i.set_dimension(current)\n>>> convert_to(vs/vs_i, ohm)\nohm/1000\n```\n### Further discussion\nThe problem is related to the kilogram workaround and the property `scale_factor`. The default scale_factor for a Quantity is 1.\n```\n>>> vs.scale_factor\n1.0\n```\nThe docstring for `scale_factor' states:\n> Overall magnitude of the quantity as compared to the canonical units.\nBut, the scale factor for ohm is 1000.\n```\n>>> ohm.scale_factor\n1000\nThis value of 1000 conflicts with the definition. `scale_factor` is a user facing property and should be consistent with the unit system definition, in this case the SI. The kilogram workaround should be an internal implementation factor and not exposed to the user.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue reported, we need to gather more context about how `scale_factor` is implemented and used within the `Quantity` class and possibly other related classes or functions in the `sympy.physics.units` module. Based on the description provided in the issue, the following API calls would be useful:\n\n1. **Find where the `Quantity` class is defined:**\n   - `search_class(\"Quantity\")`\n\n2. **Find the implementation and usage of `scale_factor` within the `Quantity` class:**\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"scale_factor\", \"Quantity\")`\n\n3. **Search for the `set_dimension` method within the `Quantity` class to understand how dimensions are set:**\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"set_dimension\", \"Quantity\")`\n\n4. **Locate where the conversion to ohm is implemented or handled:**\n   - `search_method(\"convert_to\")`\n\n5. **Search for the code snippet where the default `scale_factor` is set to understand its overriding mechanism:**\n   - `search_code(\"scale_factor = 1.0\")`\n\n6. **Understand the implementation of the kilogram workaround mentioned in the issue description:**\n   - `search_code(\"kilogram workaround\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive view of how `scale_factor` is used and modified across the `sympy.physics.units` module, how dimensions are associated with quantities, and specifically how unit conversions that might affect `scale_factor`, like the conversion to ohm, are implemented. Understanding these aspects will be crucial in devising a solution that makes `.scale_factor` private while ensuring the functionality described works as expected (i.e., converting voltage/current to ohms correctly)."
