        "intended_behavior": "The calculation of the `score` variable should be safeguarded against division by zero errors more robustly. While the existing condition (`if np.allclose(intra_dists, 0) or np.allclose(centroid_distances, 0):`) attempts to handle cases where distances are close to zero, it might not be sufficient for all cases, especially where `centroid_distances` could contain zeros leading to potential division by zero errors. The enhancement should ensure that `centroid_distances` are checked more thoroughly to identify and handle zeros or near-zero values on a per-element basis before the division occurs. This might include either filtering out or appropriately modifying such values to avoid division by zero, or applying a small epsilon value to denominator values directly before the division. The essence of the functionality and its outputs should remain unchanged, ensuring that the Davies-Bouldin score is calculated correctly without raising warnings or errors under any condition, preserving the integrity and reliability of the metric's computation."
