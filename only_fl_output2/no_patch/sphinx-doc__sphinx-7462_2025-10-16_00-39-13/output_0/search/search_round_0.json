Write contents of snippet to module and set it to be explorable by sphinx.\n2. Install dependencies, in my `docs/requirements.txt`:\n```txt\nSphinx>=2.0.1\nsphinx-rtd-theme>=0.4.3\n```\n2. Build docs.\n**Expected behavior**\nDocs are built and there is `foo` with valid type annotations.\n**Your project**\nhttps://github.com/lycantropos/robust/tree/1c7b74e0cc39c1843a89583b8c245f08039a3978\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Windows 10, but also reproduces on [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/shewchuk/builds/10817256/).\n- Python version: 3.8.0\n- Sphinx version: 3.0.1\n- Sphinx extensions:  `['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'sphinx.ext.viewcode']`\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, involving a `IndexError: pop from empty list` triggered during documentation generation by Sphinx when encountering an empty tuple type annotation, we need to explore relevant parts of the codebase. Given the traceback pointing to Sphinx's `python.py` file, and the mention of a specific usage pattern that leads to this error, let's gather context from the project and Sphinx source itself, if accessible.\n\n1. Starting with the project mentioned in the issue, we should look at where the function `foo` might be defined or similar patterns are used, to understand the annotation's interaction with Sphinx. However, direct access to the mentioned project's specific files is not possible through the provided API options. We will focus instead on gathering context around how Sphinx processes type annotations.\n\n2. The traceback points to an issue in Sphinx's `domains/python.py`. Although we might not directly access Sphinx's source code using these APIs, understanding how Sphinx processes annotations and specially empty tuple annotations could be crucial. Often these are handled in parsing or introspection code, potentially in functions or methods related to parsing docstrings or generating documentation from annotations.\n\nTo start, let's gather information on how type annotations are generally handled in the code that might be contributing to the issue:\n\n- search_code(\"Tuple[()]\")\n- search_method(\"unparse\")\n\nThese queries aim to find instances of empty tuple type annotations being handled or referenced in the codebase and identify the method where the error occurs to understand its purpose and how it's called during the documentation generation process."
