Given the context and taking into account that the original attempt to reproduce the issue using a Sphinx documentation build script did not succeed due to missing Sphinx command (`sphinx-build` not found), I will revise the approach. However, it's important to note that directly capturing the `IndexError: pop from empty list` exception within a standalone Python script that involves Sphinx might not be straightforward due to how the Sphinx build process is external to the script's Python environment.

To address the FileNotFoundError and stay within the constraints of using a standalone Python script for issue reproduction, the script below assumes Sphinx is installed in the Python environment and programmatically invokes Sphinx using its Python API rather than relying on the command line tool `sphinx-build`. This approach should bypass the immediate issue of `sphinx-build` not being found in the system's PATH.

Note: This script focuses on simulating the minimal Sphinx environment required to trigger the parsing of a Python file with the specified empty tuple type annotation. If the original error is tightly integrated with Sphinx's internal mechanisms or how Sphinx interacts with specific extensions or configurations, further adjustments might be necessary.

```python
import os
import sys
from sphinx.application import Sphinx
from sphinx.util.docutils import docutils_namespace

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx(srcdir, confdir, outdir, doctreedir):
    app = Sphinx(
        srcdir, confdir, outdir, doctreedir, 'html',
        {'extensions': ['sphinx.ext.autodoc'], 'master_doc': 'index'}
    )
    return app

def main():
    try:
        # Prepare directories
        srcdir = 'temp_docs/source'
        confdir = srcdir
        outdir = 'temp_docs/build/html'
        doctreedir = 'temp_docs/build/doctrees'
        os.makedirs(srcdir, exist_ok=True)
        os.makedirs(outdir, exist_ok=True)

        # Create a minimal Sphinx configuration
        with open(os.path.join(srcdir, 'conf.py'), 'w') as f:
            f.write("project = 'TestProject'\nextensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']\nhtml_theme = 'alabaster'\n")

        # Create an index file
        with open(os.path.join(srcdir, 'index.rst'), 'w') as f:
            f.write(".. toctree::\n\n   module\n")

        # Create a Python module with an empty tuple type annotation
        with open(os.path.join(srcdir, 'module.py'), 'w') as f:
            f.write("""\
from typing import Tuple

def foo() -> Tuple[()]:
    \""Sample text."\"
    return ()
""")

        # Build the docs
        app = setup_sphinx(srcdir, confdir, outdir, doctreedir)
        with docutils_namespace():
            app.build(force_all=True)
        print("Documentation built successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**How to Use:**

- Ensure that Sphinx is installed in your Python environment (`pip install Sphinx`).
- Run this script with Python 3. This script attempts to set up a minimal Sphinx project programmatically and then build it, which should replicate the documentation build process where the issue could happen.
