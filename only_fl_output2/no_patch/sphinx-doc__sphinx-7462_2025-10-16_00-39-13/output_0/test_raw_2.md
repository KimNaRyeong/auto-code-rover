Given that previously provided solutions did not directly reproduce the issue as intended, and there was feedback indicating an environment issue (Sphinx dependency), I'll craft another approach for a standalone Python reproduction script. This time, we ensure the environment is correctly prepared before execution. However, note that due to the specific nature of the error (related to Sphinx processing), reproducing the `IndexError: pop from empty list` solely through a Python script without mimicking the full Sphinx environment and execution context might not directly trigger the same error. 

Below is an updated approach that attempts to capture the situation more effectively. This script checks if the necessary Sphinx environment is ready and tries to mimic a Sphinx run by directly invoking relevant internal functions that could lead to reproducing the originally mentioned stack trace related to type annotations.

```python
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def ensure_dependencies():
    try:
        import sphinx
        from sphinx.application import Sphinx
        from docutils import nodes
    except ImportError as imp_err:
        print("Missing dependencies. Please ensure Sphinx is installed.", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(imp_err)
        sys.exit(1)

def create_test_file():
    test_content = """\
from typing import Tuple

def foo() -> Tuple[()]:
    \"\"\"Sample text.\"\"\"
    return ()
"""
    with open('test_module.py', 'w') as test_file:
        test_file.write(test_content)

def run_sphinx():
    ensure_dependencies()
    from sphinx.application import Sphinx
    # Setup minimal Sphinx application
    app = Sphinx(
        source_dir='.',
        confdir='.',
        outdir='./_build',
        doctreedir='./_doctrees',
        buildername='html',
    )
    app.build(force_all=True)

def main():
    create_test_file()
    try:
        run_sphinx()
        print("Test completed successfully. Issue not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        if e.__class__.__name__ == 'IndexError' and str(e) == 'pop from empty list':
            print("Issue reproduced successfully.")
            sys.exit(0)
        else:
            print("An error occurred.", file=sys.stderr)
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Important Notes and Execution Steps:**

1. This script assumes Sphinx and its dependencies, including `docutils`, are already installed in the environment. If not, they can be installed using `pip install Sphinx docutils`.
2. The script first checks for dependencies and then creates a Python test file with the specific empty tuple type annotation.
3. It attempts to run Sphinx programmatically. If the specific error `IndexError: pop from empty list` is encountered during this process, it catches the exception and verifies if it matches the expected error.
4. Due to variations in Sphinx's internal handling and the original environment where the issue was encountered, adjustments may be needed to precisely replicate the conditions leading to the error.

Please adjust the script's Sphinx configuration and the created test file as needed to more accurately reflect your project's setup.
