        "content": "<issue>Aggregation over subquery annotation GROUP BY produces wrong results\nDescription\n(last modified by Christian Klus)\nStarting in django 3.0.7, specifically after patch #31566 I noticed some of my more complex queries returning incorrect results. I think I've narrowed it down to a simpler test case:\nExample query:\nBook.objects.all().annotate(\npub_year=TruncYear('pubdate')\n).order_by().values('pub_year').annotate(\ntotal_pages=Sum('pages'),\ntop_rating=Subquery(\nBook.objects.filter(\npubdate__year=OuterRef('pub_year')\n).order_by('rating').values('rating')[:1]\n)\n).values('pub_year', 'total_pages', 'top_rating')\nGenerated SQL on 3.0.6:\nSELECT\ndjango_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\") AS \"pub_year\",\nSUM(\"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pages\") AS \"total_pages\",\n(\nSELECT U0.\"rating\"\nFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\" U0\nWHERE\ndjango_date_extract('year', U0.\"pubdate\") = django_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\")\nORDER BY U0.\"rating\" ASC LIMIT 1\n) AS \"top_rating\"\nFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\"\nGROUP BY\ndjango_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\"),\n\"top_rating\"\nGenerated SQL on current master:\nSELECT\ndjango_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL) AS \"pub_year\",\nSUM(\"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pages\") AS \"total_pages\",\n(\nSELECT U0.\"rating\"\nFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\" U0\nWHERE\ndjango_date_extract('year', U0.\"pubdate\") = django_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL)\nORDER BY U0.\"rating\" ASC LIMIT 1\n) AS \"top_rating\"\nFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\"\nGROUP BY\ndjango_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL),\n(\nSELECT U0.\"rating\"\nFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\" U0\nWHERE\ndjango_date_extract('year', U0.\"pubdate\") = django_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL)\nORDER BY U0.\"rating\" ASC LIMIT 1\n),\n\"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\"\nI see two separate issues here:\n\"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\" is being added to the group by clause incorrectly (this issue probably predates the patch mentioned above)\nEven though the subquery is in the select statement, the alias is not being used and instead the subquery is reevaluated. This nearly doubles the cost of one of my queries that is experiencing this problem.\nI don't know much about the ORM internals, but here is my naive patch for the second issue:\ndiff --git a/django/db/models/sql/query.py b/django/db/models/sql/query.py\nindex ee98984826..6ea287d6cb 100644\n--- a/django/db/models/sql/query.py\n+++ b/django/db/models/sql/query.py\n@@ -2220,7 +2220,7 @@ class Query(BaseExpression):\n# the selected fields anymore.\ngroup_by = []\nfor expr in self.group_by:\n-\t\t\t\tif isinstance(expr, Ref) and expr.refs not in field_names:\n+\t\t\t\tif isinstance(expr, Ref) and expr.refs not in field_names + annotation_names:\nexpr = self.annotations[expr.refs]\ngroup_by.append(expr)\nself.group_by = tuple(group_by)\nI'd appreciate anyone with deeper knowlege of the ORM to chime in and let me know if I'm on the right track. Tests are passing locally.\nThe resulting query on master:\nSELECT\ndjango_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL) AS \"pub_year\",\nSUM(\"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pages\") AS \"total_pages\",\n(\nSELECT U0.\"rating\"\nFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\" U0\nWHERE\ndjango_date_extract('year', U0.\"pubdate\") = django_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL)\nORDER BY U0.\"rating\" ASC LIMIT 1\n) AS \"top_rating\"\nFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\"\nGROUP BY\ndjango_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL),\n\"top_rating\"\n</issue>"

        "content": "To better understand and resolve the issue, we need to gather more context about the codebase and how the SQL query generation is handled, specifically relating to GROUP BY clause manipulation and the treatment of subquery annotations. The provided patch suggests a modification in the handling of `Ref` objects within the `group_by` list of a `Query` object. This directs our attention towards classes and methods related to SQL query generation, particularly those managing GROUP BY clauses and annotations.\n\nGiven the details from the issue, I would like to invoke the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Query\")`: Since the patch is applied to the `Query` class, we need to understand its structure and related methods.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"group_by\", \"Query\")`: This is to get context around how the `group_by` attribute is manipulated within the `Query` class, as the bug fix seems to adjust the logic within the handling of this attribute.\n3. `search_code(\"if isinstance(expr, Ref) and expr.refs not in field_names\")`: Searching for this code snippet will help us locate the exact code block that is being modified by the patch, providing context on surrounding logic and potentially affected areas."
