        "intended_behavior": "The `set_values` method's logic shall be updated to correctly include annotations in the `group_by` clause management. This means adjusting the condition that checks for expressions to include those that reference annotations, not just field names. The method should ensure that:\n- If an expression in the `group_by` list is an instance of `Ref` and its reference is an annotation (i.e., its name is in `annotation_names`), it should be correctly resolved to the corresponding annotation expression before being included in the `group_by` list.\n- This adjustment preserves the existing functionality by still allowing non-annotation expressions to be included in `group_by` correctly while ensuring annotations, specifically those involving subqueries, are not re-evaluated unnecessarily in the resulting SQL. This would fix the issue where subquery annotations lead to incorrect results due to improper group by handling, and it should improve performance by avoiding redundant evaluations of subqueries."
