Specifically, it needs to handle cases where the wrapped expression involves a transformation or condition (e.g., IS NULL) on a field that impacts the grouping. The modified behavior must ensure that such expressions are preserved in the GROUP BY clause of the generated SQL query, possibly by accurately reflecting the expression's effect on the field within the group by handling logic."

This entails correctly identifying and incorporating the expressions (especially those involving field transformations or conditions) into the SQL query construction process. The aim is to maintain the integrity of such expressions through to the final SQL, ensuring that the grouping is accurate as per the user's expectation, especially when ExpressionWrapper is involved."
