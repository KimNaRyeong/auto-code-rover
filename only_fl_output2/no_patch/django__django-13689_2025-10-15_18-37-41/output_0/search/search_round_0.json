        "content": "To address the issue described, it's necessary to investigate how Django handles ExpressionWrapper instances and aggregation, especially within a QuerySet's annotate and values methods. This involves looking at specific parts of the Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework. The issue seems related to how Django constructs SQL queries involving ExpressionWrapper in combination with the aggregate functions like Count.\n\nGiven the context, we'll need to explore several aspects of Django's ORM system:\n1. **ExpressionWrapper Class**: To understand how it is defined and used in Django.\n2. **QuerySet's `annotate` Method**: As this is where the ExpressionWrapper is being used.\n3. **QuerySet's `values` and `aggregate` Methods**: Since these are part of the query that exhibits the issue.\n4. **SQL Construction Code**: Particularly how the `GROUP BY` clause is generated from Django's ORM query to SQL.\n\nTo gather this information, the following API calls will be made:\n- search_class(\"ExpressionWrapper\"): To find where `ExpressionWrapper` is defined within Django's codebase.\n- search_method(\"annotate\"): To understand how the `annotate` method processes the `ExpressionWrapper`.\n- search_method(\"values\"): To look into the implementation of the `values` method and its interaction with grouping and aggregation.\n- search_method(\"aggregate\"): Since aggregation (`Count()` in this case) is a crucial part of the issue, exploring its implementation can shed light on how distinct counts are managed.\n\nThese searches will provide a foundational understanding of where things might be going wrong in the process of constructing the SQL query, specifically the `GROUP BY` clause."
