        "intended_behavior": "The `_validate_angles` method should be updated to consider floating-point precision differences, especially between `float32` and `float64`, ensuring that valid latitude values very close to the limits (-90 and 90 degrees, or \\(\\frac{-\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) radians) are not rejected due to precision issues. The code should incorporate a tolerance factor (epsilon) when performing comparisons to handle slight discrepancies caused by the float conversion.\n\nA practical approach to implementing this would involve: \n- Defining a small epsilon value, appropriate for `float32` comparisons, while ensuring that `float64` values retain their precision.\n- Modifying the comparison logic in lines 597 and 598 to account for this epsilon, such that \\(|\\text{angle} - \\text{limit}|\\) must be greater than epsilon to be considered invalid. \n\nThis modification would allow for the slightly inaccurate representation of `float32` values (e.g., the mentioned \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\)) while preserving the strict bounds for locations genuinely outside of the valid range. This approach balances the need for precision with the practical realities of floating-point arithmetic, especially in scientific computing where data types like `float32` are common due to their space and performance efficiencies."
