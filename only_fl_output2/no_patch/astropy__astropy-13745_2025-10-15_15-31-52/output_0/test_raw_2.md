Given the task and the requirements provided, here is a `reproducer.py` script designed to raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, and to terminate with code 0 if the issue has been fixed.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from astropy.coordinates import Latitude
    import numpy as np
    
    lat = np.float32(np.pi/2)
    try:
        Latitude(lat, 'rad')
        # If the script reaches this point without exceptions, the issue is considered fixed.
        print("No issue detected.")
        exit(0)
    except ValueError as e:
        # Capture and print stack trace:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Raise an AssertionError to explicitly indicate the issue presence.
        raise AssertionError("An issue was detected: Latitude object rejected the float32 representation of π/2.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script does the following:
- Attempts to instantiate an `astropy.coordinates.Latitude` object using a `float32` representation of π/2.
- If this operation raises a `ValueError` suggesting that the value is out of the accepted range, it captures the exception and prints a detailed stack trace.
- If the object is successfully created without raising an exception, it concludes that the issue has been fixed, prints a corresponding message, and exits with code 0.
- In the event of a `ValueError`, the script will raise an `AssertionError` indicating that the issue still exists. This is intended to explicitly signal the presence of the issue through script termination status and output.
