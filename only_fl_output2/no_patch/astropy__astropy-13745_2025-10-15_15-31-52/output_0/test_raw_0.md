This script will reproduce the issue described with the Astropy `Latitude` class not accepting the float32 representation of $\pi/2$. When you run `python3 reproducer.py` in the root directory of the project, it will either:

- Print a stack trace and raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is still present, signaling that the issue hasn't been fixed yet.
- Print "No issue detected." and exit with code 0, signaling that the issue has been fixed, assuming updated behavior would accept the float32 representation without error.
