Certainly! Based on your provided details and request, here's a corrected version of the `reproducer.py` to ensure it aligns with your instructions for capturing the issue with `astropy.coordinates.Latitude` and handling the float32 representation of π/2:

```python
# reproducer.py
def main():
    from astropy.coordinates import Latitude
    import numpy as np
    
    def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
        import traceback
        import sys
        tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
        print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
        for frame in tb:
            line_number = frame.lineno
            code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
            print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
            print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    
    lat = np.float32(np.pi/2)
    
    try:
        # This will attempt to create a Latitude object with a float32 representation of π/2 in radians.
        Latitude(lat, 'rad')
        # If the Latitude object is successfully created, then the issue is presumed to be fixed. 
        # Exit with code 0 indicating no exceptions were raised and the behavior is as expected.
        print("No issue detected.")
        exit(0)
    except ValueError as e:
        # If a ValueError is raised, it's presumably due to the rejection of the float32 representation.
        # Print the stack trace for diagnostic purposes.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Raise an AssertionError to indicate the presence of the issue explicitly.
        raise AssertionError("An issue was detected: Latitude object rejected the float32 representation of π/2.") from None
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

You should put this script into the root directory of your project and run it with Python 3. If the issue is present, as described, the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print the stack trace to standard error. If the script prints "No issue detected." and exits with code 0, it means the issue related to handling the float32 representation of π/2 by `Latitude` has been resolved.
