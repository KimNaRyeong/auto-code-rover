Apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's try creating a more tailored python script to address the issue described, keeping the same requirements in mind. This script will place a stronger emphasis on detecting the specific problem of the figure title disappearance when using seaborn's objects API with subfigures, and handle errors as requested:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import seaborn.objects as so


def check_for_title(fig):
    """Checks if the given figure has a title set."""
    return fig._suptitle is not None and fig._suptitle.get_text() != ""


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    fig = plt.figure(constrained_layout=True)
    subfigs = fig.subfigures(1, 2)
    tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
    p = (
        so.Plot(tips, "total_bill")
        .add(so.Bars(), so.Hist())
    )
    p.on(subfigs[0]).plot()

    ax = subfigs[1].subplots()
    ax.scatter([1], [1])

    fig.suptitle("Test title")

    # Verify the title is present after plotting
    if not check_for_title(fig):
        raise AssertionError("Figure title missing after plotting with seaborn objects API.")

    plt.show()
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exit with error code to indicate the presence of the issue
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exit with error code due to unexpected error
else:
    print("Issue resolved. Figure title remains intact.")
    exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate the issue is resolved
```

This script is designed to exit with an error code (1) if the figure title is missing after using seaborn's objects API with Matplotlib's subfigures, indicating the presence of the issue. It will print the stack trace if an error occurs during the execution outside of the main assertion check. If the issue is resolved, and the figure title remains intact after plotting, it will exit successfully with code 0.
