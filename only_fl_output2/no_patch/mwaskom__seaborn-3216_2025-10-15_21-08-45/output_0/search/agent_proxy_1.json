The specific change should ensure that when a subfigure (`target`) is involved, it is treated as the context for plotting operations rather than reverting to its parent figure. This would mean adjusting the line 186 from `figure = target.figure` to something that acknowledges `target` as the current context if it is a subfigure. This change would allow seaborn to correctly plot on subfigures without overriding or losing figure-wide settings like the figure title. This adjustment preserves the existing functionality (supporting plots on figures and subfigures) while resolving the issue of missing titles when plotting on subfigures. \n\n   This specific solution aims to align the library's functionality with the expected behavior when using matplotlib subfigures, ensuring compatibility and flexibility in complex plotting scenarios."
