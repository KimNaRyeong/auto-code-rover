Given your specifications and the need to directly address the reproduction of the issue in a standalone script, let's structure `reproducer.py` to specifically target simulating the described test failures in a scenario where NumPy is not available. This script carefully incorporates the details from your issue report, ensuring that it either raises an `AssertionError` corresponding to the observed issues or verifies their resolution.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_sympy_without_numpy():
    try:
        # Attempting to import sympy elements that are known to fail without NumPy
        from sympy import Symbol, Catalan, oo, summation, Rational, factorial, S
        from sympy.abc import n, x
        from sympy.functions import sin
        from sympy.matrices import Matrix
        # Replicate one failing expression from each reported test case
        # sympy.concrete.tests.test_sums_products
        pi_series_result = summation( (4 * factorial(n) * (1103 + 26390 * n)) / (factorial(n)**4 * 396**(4*n)), (n, 0, oo))
        assert pi_series_result.evalf(100) == S.Pi.evalf(100), "pi series comparison failed"
        # sympy.integrals.tests.test_quadrature and so on...

        # sympy.utilities.tests.test_lambdify
        f = lambdify(x, sin(x), "math")
        assert isinstance(f(2), float), "lambdify math sin failed"

        # sympy.matrices.matrices.DeferredVector
        def func(v):
            m = Matrix(v)
            return (m[0], m[-1])
        assert func([1, 2, 3]) == (1, 3), "DeferredVector example failed"

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        import numpy
        print("This script is meant to run in an environment where NumPy is not available.",
              "Please ensure NumPy is uninstalled to replicate the issues.", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)
    except ImportError:
        test_sympy_without_numpy()
    print("All tests passed successfully.")
    sys.exit(0)
```

This script checks for the presence of NumPy and continues to replicate the issues only if NumPy is not found. It directly uses elements and functionalities from SymPy that were identified as problematic in environments without NumPy. Each test case is simplified to a critical assertion that emulates the essence of the failures listed, intended to provoke an `AssertionError` if the issue persists or to pass quietly if the issue has been resolved.

The script finishes by reporting the successful execution of all tests if no issues are encountered, ensuring clarity on the status of the reported issues.
