To better address the task and focus on accurately simulating the testing environment for the issues related to NumPy not being installed, the following Python script, `reproducer.py`, has been crafted. This script checks the core issues by trying to replicate the failing test cases and doctests as described in your issue report, using the provided function to print stack traces for any raised `AssertionError`.

The focus is on hitting the key points from your issue list without assuming direct access to internal SymPy testing functionalities or the project's test suite setup. Importantly, we must simulate the test conditions under which those `AssertionErrors` were originally observed.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_sympy_behavior_without_numpy():
    try:
        from sympy import symbols, Catalan, oo, Rational, fac
        from sympy.series import pi
        n = symbols('n')

        # Checking if sympy can execute these expressions without NumPy
        expr1 = (pi**2 * Rational(1103 + 26390*n) / fac(n)**4 / 396**(4*n)).evalf(subs={n:0})
        assert str(expr1) != "", "Failed to eval pi series"
        
        expr2 = Catalan.evalf()
        assert str(expr2) != "", "Failed to eval Catalan constant"

        # You might add more direct evaluations from the mentioned tests as needed.

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error status if any assertion fails

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        import numpy
        print("NumPy is installed, please run this script in an environment without NumPy.")
        sys.exit(1)
    except ImportError:
        print("NumPy is not installed, proceeding with tests.")
        test_sympy_behavior_without_numpy()
    print("All tests passed successfully.")
    sys.exit(0)
```

This script attempts to mimic the failure conditions outlined in your issue by:
- Checking that NumPy is indeed not available in the current environment to ensure the testing condition is met.
- Performing operations that involve functionality reportedly failing in the initial issue description, such as evaluating constants and series that might require internal precision handling without NumPy.

The assertions and expressions were chosen to represent potential failures highlighted in the issue but tailored to work as standalone checks. Depending on how SymPy attempts to fallback on pure Python implementations in the absence of NumPy, you may still need to adjust or extend these checks to better match the original test cases' conditions more precisely.

Remember, this script assumes a direct context application, where the environment is controlled to simulate the absence of NumPy, reflecting the reported issue scenario. If upon running this script issues are detected or the script exits with a non-zero status in such an environment setup, it confirms the presence of the issue under those specific conditions.
