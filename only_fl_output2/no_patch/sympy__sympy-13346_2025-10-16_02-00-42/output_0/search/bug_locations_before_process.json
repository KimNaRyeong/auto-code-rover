        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior around `DeferredVector` should ensure that when operations are performed leading to integer results, those results should remain as integers rather than being automatically cast to floats. This might require reviewing and possibly adjusting the interaction between `DeferredVector` and numerical computation processes (like those handled by `lambdify`). Ensuring that the type consistency is preserved during such operations will correct the test failure noted in the doctest scenario provided. Specifically, adjustments might be needed in how `DeferredVector` instances are processed by `lambdify` or similar mechanisms to ensure that numerical computations with integers yield integer results."
