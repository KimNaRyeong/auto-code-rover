        "intended_behavior": "Inside the `Session.send` method, the code should encapsulate a try-except block around the `adapter.send(request, **kwargs)` call to catch `socket.timeout` exceptions explicitly. Upon catching this type of exception, it should re-raise it as a `requests.exceptions.Timeout` exception. This ensures that exceptions related to timeouts remain consistent throughout the `requests` library and are predictable for developers using the library."
