Search for the usage of the `//` operator which may not be directly associated with a specific class without knowing more context, it's a global Python operation. However, the issue description hints at a custom implementation or handling (`S(2)//S.Half give ZeroDivisionError`). This suggests we may be dealing with a specialized class or method overriding behavior related to division, or specifically, floor division in Python. Hence, I'll start by searching for code snippets that could be related to this custom behavior:\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"S(2)//S.Half\")\n   ```\n\n2. Given the nature of the problem, there's a strong likelihood that it's tied to a custom implementation of floor division within a class or through overriding the `__floordiv__` method, which is responsible for handling the `//` operator in Python. If `S` or `Half` are classes, I would search for them and their methods possibly overriding the floor division behavior:\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"S\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"__floordiv__\", \"S\")\n   ```\n\n   Since \"Half\" is mentioned in a way that suggests it could be a property, member, or another class involved in the operation, I'll search for it as well:\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"Half\")\n   ```\n\nThese calls are aimed at uncovering the definitions and implementations that could affect the behavior of floor division in this context, providing insights into any custom logic that might be causing the reported `ZeroDivisionError`."
