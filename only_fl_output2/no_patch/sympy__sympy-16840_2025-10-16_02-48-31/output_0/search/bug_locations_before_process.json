        "intended_behavior": "The __floordiv__ method in the Integer class should not only handle other integer operations but also correctly interact with rational numbers, especially singleton instances like Half. When the method encounters a Half instance or similar rational numbers as the divisor, it should explicitly account for these cases, ensuring that the division is mathematically accurate. A fix may involve adding a condition to check if other is an instance of Half (or a similar check for rational numbers) and then handling the operation in a way that prevents errors like ZeroDivisionError and ensures accurate computation. This approach should preserve the existing functionality for integer operations while extending the method's capability to handle rational numbers gracefully."
