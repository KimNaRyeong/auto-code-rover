This script sets up a minimal Django environment programmatically, defines a model with the problematic field (`BinaryField` with a default value of `''`), and then attempts to migrate to introduce the issue. It captures any exceptions, prints a detailed stack trace for debugging, and specifically looks for the error related to this issue before asserting or raising exceptions based on the outcome.

Remember to install Django (`django`) and ensure you're using compatible versions as outlined in your issue: Python 3.6.0, Django 1.10.6 (though it's worth noting these versions are quite outdated and may have security vulnerabilities, so use them with caution and preferably in a virtual environment).
