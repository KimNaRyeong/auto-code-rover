        "intended_behavior": "When handling defaults, especially in migrations that involve a change from an empty string ('') to a binary type (b''), these methods should correctly interpret and handle empty strings as binary data when the field definition changes. This means ensuring that during migration and reverse migration operations, the field's handling of default values correctly distinguishes between non-binary and binary defaults in a manner that is consistent, preventing type errors such as the one described. Specifically, during a reverse migration, if a BinaryField is reverted from a b'' default back to '', the field should handle or convert this value into the appropriate binary format (b'') internally to avoid TypeError: can't escape str to binary. This handling ensures successful migration application and reversal, aligning with Django's expected behavior for field type changes across migrations."
