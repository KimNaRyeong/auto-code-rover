        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the `DatabaseCache` backend generates and executes queries, especially focusing on how fields are quoted in those queries, considering the specific requirements for Snowflake. Here are the steps and corresponding API calls we should make to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Find the `DatabaseCache` class to understand its structure and methods.\n2. Locate any method(s) involved in constructing or executing queries, likely related to cache retrieval or storage.\n3. Check if there are any explicit mentions or handling of field quoting or case sensitivity, which might be relevant to Snowflake's requirements.\n\nBased on these steps, here are the appropriate API calls:\n\n1. ```search_class(\"DatabaseCache\")```\n2. Given that we don't yet know the exact methods or files, but we're interested in how queries are constructed, let's first search for likely method names related to querying after finding the class. Assuming typical cache operations might involve methods like `get`, `set`, or something related to query construction or execution:\n    - ```search_method_in_class(\"get\", \"DatabaseCache\")```\n    - ```search_method_in_class(\"set\", \"DatabaseCache\")```\n    - ```search_method_in_class(\"make_query\", \"DatabaseCache\")``` (This is speculative; actual method name might differ based on Django's internal naming conventions)\n\n3. To understand specifically how fields are treated in queries, especially in relation to Snowflake's requirements, a direct reference to code dealing with quotation marks or uppercasing might be pivotal. This can be speculative as we don't have the exact terms used, but it's worth trying to find if any generic handling of quotes or case exists in the logic:\n    - ```search_code(\"quote\")```\n    - ```search_code(\"uppercase\")```\n\nThese API calls are designed to cover the understanding of the class structure, identify relevant methods, and find any explicit handling related to quoting fields or case sensitivity that would matter for Snowflake integration."
