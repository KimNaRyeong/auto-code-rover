The adjustment should maintain the ability to dynamically adjust to different database backends while preserving function for non-Snowflake databases. Adding logic to automatically detect when the backend is Snowflake or enforcing quoting regardless of backend (where it doesn't break functionality) might be necessary.\n\n- **Location 2:**  \n    - **File:** `django/core/cache/backends/db.py`\n    - **Class:** `DatabaseCache`\n    - **Method:** `get`  \n    **Intended Behavior:** In the `get` method, similar to `set`, any part of the code generating SQL queries to fetch cached values must ensure that identifiers are properly quoted to avoid the automatic conversion to uppercase by Snowflake. Adjustments here should seek to ensure compatibility across diverse database backends, preserving the ORM's database-agnostic promise.\n\n**Rationale:** Given that the issue specifically mentions the requirement of Snowflake to have all fields quoted to treat them as case-sensitive, adjustments in these locations are critical. These methods are directly involved in the construction and execution of SQL queries against the cache database table. Ensuring that identifiers are quoted preserves the integrity of the case sensitivity, which is crucial for compatibility with Snowflake's behavior. The intended fixes should not disrupt existing functionality for other database backends already supported by Django, hence necessitating careful consideration and testing to ensure broader compatibility."
