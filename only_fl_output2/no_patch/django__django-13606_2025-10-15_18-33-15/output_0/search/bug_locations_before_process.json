        "intended_behavior": "This method should be modified to replace the use of `NOT IN` with `NOT EXISTS` for subqueries related to excluding records based on N-to-many relationships. The change aims to enhance performance and improve the handling of `NULL` values. To achieve this, the construction of the subquery and condition within the method needs to be adjusted. Specifically, the logic that currently generates a `NOT IN` SQL statement (around lines 1759-1764 mentioning the consideration for `WHERE NOT EXISTS`) should be reworked to produce a `NOT EXISTS` condition instead. This involves:\n- Constructing a `NOT EXISTS` subquery that encapsulates the original filter criteria.\n- Ensuring that the condition is correctly integrated with the rest of the Django ORM querying mechanism, maintaining compatibility and functionality.\n- Preserving the existing functionality where non-null fields are selected correctly, ensuring the efficiency and accuracy of the exclude operation.\n- The adjustment should respect all comment hints and advice present in the method documentation, explicitly leveraging the mentioned benefits of `NOT EXISTS` over `NOT IN` regarding performance and null handling."
