This is our starting point to gather context.\n\n2. **Understand the usage of `NOT IN` in relation to `split_exclude` method:** Since the issue highlights a problem with the use of `NOT IN` and suggests replacing it with `NOT EXISTS`, it's crucial to find where exactly `NOT IN` is being used in the context of `split_exclude`.\n\nBased on these insights, let's craft our API calls:\n\n- Search for the `split_exclude` method across the entire codebase to identify which file or class it belongs to.\n  \n  `search_method(\"split_exclude\")`\n\n- Once we know where `split_exclude` resides, we'll likely need to examine the code around the problematic `NOT IN` usage. However, without knowing the specific location, we can't make this call yet. The first step will guide us further.\n\nLet's execute these initial searches to narrow down our focus area."
