        "intended_behavior": "The `Y` method within the `DateFormat` class should be modified or ensured to return the year as a zero-padded, four-digit format. This means that if the year represented by the date object is less than 1000, the method should explicitly prepend zeros to the year value until the length of the year string is four characters. This behavior must preserve the method's existing functionality for years that are already four digits long but add zero-padding for years with fewer than four digits to ensure the year is always returned in a four-digit format. This resolution will address the issue of the `Y` specifier not correctly zero-padding years less than 1000, in line with the expected behavior described in the issue."
