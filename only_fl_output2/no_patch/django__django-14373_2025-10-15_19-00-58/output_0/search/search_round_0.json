First, find which file the `DateFormat` class is defined in, as this will allow us to narrow down the search area for the bug.\n   - `search_class(\"DateFormat\")`\n\n2. Once we have the file name where `DateFormat` is defined, look for the `Y` method within that class to directly inspect how the padding is being handled.\n   - This cannot be called now as it requires knowing the file name from the result of step 1.\n\n3. It may also help to search the entire codebase for any uses of `DateFormat.Y()` to see how and where it's being called; it can provide clues to exceptions or edge cases.\n   - `search_code(\"DateFormat.Y()\")`\n\nLet's start with these API calls to gather the necessary information, and then proceed based on the findings from these initial searches."
