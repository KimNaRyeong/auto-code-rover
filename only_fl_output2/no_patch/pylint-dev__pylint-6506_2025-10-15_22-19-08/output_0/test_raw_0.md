This `reproducer.py` script attempts to reproduce the scenario outlined in the issue description by invoking `pylint` with an unrecognized option `-Q`. If the output matches the error pattern identified (`unrecognized-option` and `_UnrecognizedOptionError`), the script confirms a successful reproduction by printing "Issue reproduced successfully." It then exits with a status code of `0`, indicating successful reproduction of the issue in a manner that matches what was described.

On the other hand, if the execution leads to a different outcome (i.e., `pylint` does not raise an error, or the error message does not match the expected pattern), the script will raise an `AssertionError`, indicating that the issue was not reproduced as expected. 

This script leverages the `subprocess` module to run `pylint` as an external command and captures its output. In case of an error, the script uses a custom function `print_stacktrace` to print the stack trace of the exception for debugging purposes.
