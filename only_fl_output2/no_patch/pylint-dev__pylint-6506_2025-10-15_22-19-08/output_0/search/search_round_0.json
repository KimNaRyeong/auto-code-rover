        "content": "To address this issue effectively, we need to gather details from the codebase that relate to how pylint handles command line options and raises errors for unrecognized options. Given the descriptions provided in the issue, the traceback refers to specific files and methods involved in this bug:\n\n1. The file `pylint/config/config_initialization.py` contains the function `_config_initialization` where the error is eventually raised.\n2. The `PylintRun` class in the file `pylint/lint/run.py` initializes and probably parses command line arguments before it leads to the error.\n3. The error class `_UnrecognizedOptionError` is mentioned, which should be part of the exception handling mechanism for command line parsing.\n4. The initial handling of the command line, based on the output, happens somewhere where the options are checked against recognized ones to issue `E0015`.\n\nBased on these, the following API search calls are necessary:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"_config_initialization\", \"pylint/config/config_initialization.py\")` to understand how options are parsed and how unrecognized options are handled.\n- `search_class_in_file(\"PylintRun\", \"pylint/lint/run.py\")` to look into how command line arguments are initially processed and passed down.\n- `search_code(\"class _UnrecognizedOptionError\")` to get context on how this exception is defined and potentially how it is intended to be caught or handled elsewhere.\n\nThese calls should provide a solid foundation to start addressing the bug, especially understanding the flow of command line argument processing and where exactly the enhancement of showing usage tips instead of a traceback could be introduced."
