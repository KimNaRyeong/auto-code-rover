Instead, upon catching the error, the function should print a concise, user-friendly error message (e.g., 'Error: Unrecognized option -Q. Use --help to see available options.') and then gracefully exit the application (e.g., `sys.exit(1)`). This change aims to improve user experience by providing clear guidance on next steps rather than exposing internal execution details."

This would guide future maintenance and enhancement efforts to align with best practices for exception handling within the tool, without altering its current functionality."
