Certainly! Based on the instructions, here's an updated `reproducer.py` script that should adhere more closely to your requirements. Please note, the script aims to check the described issue by attempting to convert a stacked DataArray to both Series and DataFrame types within the `xarray` library context. In case the operations fail, it prints a detailed stack trace as requested.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys
import traceback
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f'    Line {line_number}: {code_context}', file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Create a DataArray with one multiindex dimension and another dimension.
    da = xr.DataArray([[[1]]], dims=["a", "b", "c"]).stack(ab=["a", "b"])

    # Attempt to convert stacked DataArray to Series
    try:
        series = da.to_series()
        print("Conversion to Series succeeded.")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Conversion to Series failed with an exception.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "to_series failed."

    # Attempt to convert stacked DataArray to DataFrame
    try:
        df = da.to_dataframe("A")
        print("Conversion to DataFrame succeeded.")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Conversion to DataFrame failed with an exception.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "to_dataframe failed."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script first creates a `DataArray` object with three dimensions and then stacks two of these dimensions into a multiindex. It attempts to convert this multiindex `DataArray` to a `Series` and a `DataFrame`, respectively. If either conversion process raises an exception, it will print a detailed stack trace before triggering an `AssertionError`. The script should exit with code 0 if the issue described is fixed or if no exception is raised during the conversion processes.
