        "intended_behavior": "Similar to `to_series`, `to_dataframe` needs to be adapted to manage `DataArray` objects that feature a mix of multi-indexed and regular dimensions, ensuring a seamless conversion into a `pandas.DataFrame`. The DataFrame's index should be a `MultiIndex` that accurately represents all dimensions involved, including the handling of any stacked dimensions alongside standard dimensions. This enhancement should ensure that the dimensionality of the original `DataArray` is fully and correctly transitioned into the DataFrame structure without loss of information or hierarchical integrity."
