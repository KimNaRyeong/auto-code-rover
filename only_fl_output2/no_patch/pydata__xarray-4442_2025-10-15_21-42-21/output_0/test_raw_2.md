Given the new requirements and aiming to ensure that the script properly handles the setup to reproduce the provided issue, let's correct the oversight and confirm that the error handling and assertions align with your instructions. Here's an updated version of `reproducer.py`:

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys
import traceback
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Creating a DataArray with a stacked dimension and an additional dimension.
        da = xr.DataArray([[[1]]], dims=["a", "b", "c"]).stack(ab=["a", "b"])

        # Attempting to convert the DataArray to a pandas Series and DataFrame
        series_conversion_successful = False
        df_conversion_successful = False
        
        try:
            da.to_series()
            series_conversion_successful = True
        except NotImplementedError as e:
            print("Conversion to pandas Series failed with NotImplementedError.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
        
        try:
            da.to_dataframe("A")
            df_conversion_successful = True
        except NotImplementedError as e:
            print("Conversion to pandas DataFrame failed with NotImplementedError.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
        
        # Both conversions are expected to raise NotImplementedError based on the description.
        # If they do not, we assert False.
        assert not(series_conversion_successful and df_conversion_successful), \
            "Expected NotImplementedError for one of the conversions, but both succeeded."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Test failed, the issue is reproduced.")
        raise e
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("Test passed, the issue seems to be resolved!")
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version of `reproducer.py` aims to explicitly demonstrate the issue presented: it attempts to convert a `DataArray` to a `pandas.Series` and `DataArray.to_dataframe`, highlighting the scenario when one dimension is stacked (forming a MultiIndex) while others remain as is. The script expects a specific `NotImplementedError` for this scenario, based on the initial problem description. AssertionError is raised only when the operations unexpectedly succeed, indicating no error was encountered when the issue should be present. The script also includes comprehensive error handling, ready to provide detailed information for diagnostics and halt with an appropriate exit code.
