The original source language is used instead of the translated language. Fuzzy translations are translations that in general need to be reviewed by a translator. For example all machine translations could be marked as fuzzy. It would be desirable to let the user decide whether to include these fuzzy translations in the generated documentation.\nProposed solution\n------------------\nAdd a new configuration parameter \"use_fuzzy_translations\".\nChange in line 72 of the file sphinx/sphinx/util/i18n.py\nwrite_mo(file_mo, po)\nto\nwrite_mo(file_mo, po, use_fuzzy_translations)\nWriting mo files with fuzzy translations is supported by the babel package, as can be seen in the documentation:\nhttp://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/api/messages/mofile.html\n</issue>"

This helps ensure there are no conflicts or redundancies with the proposed solution.\n\nThese calls will provide an initial understanding necessary to approach the problem and devise a proper solution."
