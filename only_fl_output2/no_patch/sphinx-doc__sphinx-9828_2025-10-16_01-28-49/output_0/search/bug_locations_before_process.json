Adjust the processing logic to include or exclude fuzzy translations based on the parameter's value, involving branching logic or an additional condition that checks the parameter before processing each translation entry marked as 'fuzzy'. Implement a new configuration parameter within Sphinx's configuration system, named 'use_fuzzy_translations'. The default behavior should remain as is, not including fuzzy translations unless explicitly configured otherwise."
