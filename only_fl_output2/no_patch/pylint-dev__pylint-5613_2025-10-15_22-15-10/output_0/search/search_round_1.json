        "content": "Based on the returned results from the invoked API calls, let's analyze the collected context in relation to the reported issue:\n\n1. **Result from `search_method(\"run_pyreverse\")`:**\n   - **What does this part of the code do?**\n      - The code in `pylint/__init__.py` defines a function `run_pyreverse()` that imports a class `Run` from `pylint.pyreverse.main` and executes it with `sys.argv[1:]` as its argument. It appears to be a straightforward entry point for running Pyreverse by directly passing command-line arguments.\n   - **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n      - The issue describes the need for a more Pythonic way to call Pyreverse, rather than manipulating `sys.argv` and using `run_pyreverse()` as it currently stands. This function is the current means by which Pyreverse is invoked, so it's directly related to the requester's problem.\n   - **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n      - The intended behavior post-resolution would likely involve either modifying this function or adding a new method to `pylint` that allows invoking Pyreverse with a function call and parameters, rather than via command-line arguments manipulation.\n\n2. **Result from `search_code(\"import pylint\")`:**\n   - **What does this part of the code do?**\n      - The code snippet from `pylint/__main__.py` shows how `pylint` is imported and used within its own main entry point. It modifies the system path and then runs Pylint directly.\n   - **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n      - Although this snippet does not directly relate to Pyreverse, it reflects a pattern of how Pylint's tools can be invoked programmatically (in this case, `run_pylint()`). This pattern may serve as a guide for implementing a similar approach for Pyreverse, as requested in the issue.\n   - **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n      - In the context of the issue, a similar approach could be taken to `run_pyreverse()`, providing an API for programmatic invocation.\n\n3. **Result from `search_code(\"sys.argv\")`:**\n   - **What does this part of the code do?**\n      - Across various files in the Pylint codebase, `sys.argv` is used for command-line argument processing in multiple contexts, including in `pyreverse`.\n   - **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n      - The reported issue specifically describes manipulating `sys.argv` to work with `pyreverse`, a pattern that's seen across the codebase for command-line tool invocation. This widespread use of `sys.argv` reaffirms the need for an alternative invocation method that doesn't require manipulating global state.\n   - **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n      - Ideally, the alternative to the current approach would abstract away the direct use of `sys.argv`, allowing `pyreverse` to be invoked with parameters passed to a function instead. This would make it more user-friendly and align with typical Python practices.\n\nThe analysis suggests that for resolving the issue, one approach could be to either modify `run_pyreverse()` or introduce a new function within Pylint that would handle the arguments as function parameters, invoking the Pyreverse tool programmatically without the need for the caller to manipulate `sys.argv`. This would provide a more Pythonic API for Pyreverse, as requested."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

This new method should accept arguments such as `output format`, `project name`, and `files` as parameters instead of requiring manipulation of `sys.argv`. While preserving the existing functionality, this method should internally handle the construction of the command line arguments before invoking the `PyreverseRun` class. This could potentially involve modifying or extending `PyreverseRun` to accept parameters in a manner that's consistent with typical Python function calls, thereby eliminating the need for users to manipulate `sys.argv` directly.\n  \nThe solution will make it easier and less error-prone for developers to use `pyreverse` programmatically within their Python projects by offering a clear and simple interface."
