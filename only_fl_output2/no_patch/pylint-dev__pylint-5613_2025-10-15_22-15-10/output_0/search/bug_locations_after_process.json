        "intended_behavior": "The `run_pyreverse` method should be modified or supplemented with a new method to provide a more Pythonic way of invoking `pyreverse`. This new method should accept arguments such as `output format`, `project name`, and `files` as parameters instead of requiring manipulation of `sys.argv`. While preserving the existing functionality, this method should internally handle the construction of the command line arguments before invoking the `PyreverseRun` class. This could potentially involve modifying or extending `PyreverseRun` to accept parameters in a manner that's consistent with typical Python function calls, thereby eliminating the need for users to manipulate `sys.argv` directly.\n\nThe solution will make it easier and less error-prone for developers to use `pyreverse` programmatically within their Python projects by offering a clear and simple interface."
