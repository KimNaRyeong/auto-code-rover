When fixed, the script will run successfully without any exception, exiting with code 0. Please note, given the nature of the issue, this script is somewhat speculative and assumes the presence of a better entry point or checks for its absence.\n\n```python\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef current_pyreverse_method():\n    import pylint\n    import sys\n\n    name = \"ProjectName\"\n    files = [\"file1.py\", \"file2.py\"]  # Example files\n\n    sys.argv = 'pyreverse -o png -p'.split() + [name] + files\n    try:\n        pylint.run_pyreverse()\n    except SystemExit:\n        pass  # Expected as per the reported issue\n\ndef desired_pyreverse_method():\n    import pylint\n\n    name = \"ProjectName\"\n    files = [\"file1.py\", \"file2.py\"]  # Example files\n\n    try:\n        pylint.pyreverse(output=pylint.PNG, project=name, files=files)\n        return True\n    except AttributeError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    # First, we try the current cumbersome approach to ensure it works (No assertion here).\n    current_pyreverse_method()\n\n    # Now, we try the desired approach and assert its absence or malfunction.\n    assert desired_pyreverse_method(), \"The desired pyreverse API is not implemented or failed.\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis script starts by defining a `print_stacktrace` function as you requested. It then defines a function `current_pyreverse_method` to replicate the current method of running `pyreverse` as written in the initial problem statement. The `desired_pyreverse_method` function is intended to represent the invocation of `pyreverse` as per your desired solution, and it's structured to catch and print a stack trace of any `AttributeError` (assuming `pylint.pyreverse` or the arguments are not implemented) or a general exception, returning `False` if the desired functionality is not available or fails for any reason. Mainly, it uses an assertion to detect the presence and correctness of the desired solution. \n\nMake sure you have `pylint` installed in your environment and adjust the `files` variable in the script with actual Python files you want to check. The script assumes the desired `pylint.pyreverse` API would be straightforward and intuitive as per your example, but modifications might be needed based on the actual implementation details when or if they become available."
