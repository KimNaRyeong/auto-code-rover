Given your requirements, I crafted a Python script named `reproducer.py` that attempts to replicate the existing issue with the current `pyreverse` invocation and will raise an `AssertionError` if the desired entry point (as illustrated in your request) does not exist or function as expected. When fixed, the script will run successfully without any exception, exiting with code 0. Please note, given the nature of the issue, this script is somewhat speculative and assumes the presence of a better entry point or checks for its absence.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def current_pyreverse_method():
    import pylint
    import sys

    name = "ProjectName"
    files = ["file1.py", "file2.py"]  # Example files

    sys.argv = 'pyreverse -o png -p'.split() + [name] + files
    try:
        pylint.run_pyreverse()
    except SystemExit:
        pass  # Expected as per the reported issue

def desired_pyreverse_method():
    import pylint

    name = "ProjectName"
    files = ["file1.py", "file2.py"]  # Example files

    try:
        pylint.pyreverse(output=pylint.PNG, project=name, files=files)
        return True
    except AttributeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    return False

def main():
    # First, we try the current cumbersome approach to ensure it works (No assertion here).
    current_pyreverse_method()

    # Now, we try the desired approach and assert its absence or malfunction.
    assert desired_pyreverse_method(), "The desired pyreverse API is not implemented or failed."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script starts by defining a `print_stacktrace` function as you requested. It then defines a function `current_pyreverse_method` to replicate the current method of running `pyreverse` as written in the initial problem statement. The `desired_pyreverse_method` function is intended to represent the invocation of `pyreverse` as per your desired solution, and it's structured to catch and print a stack trace of any `AttributeError` (assuming `pylint.pyreverse` or the arguments are not implemented) or a general exception, returning `False` if the desired functionality is not available or fails for any reason. Mainly, it uses an assertion to detect the presence and correctness of the desired solution. 

Make sure you have `pylint` installed in your environment and adjust the `files` variable in the script with actual Python files you want to check. The script assumes the desired `pylint.pyreverse` API would be straightforward and intuitive as per your example, but modifications might be needed based on the actual implementation details when or if they become available.
