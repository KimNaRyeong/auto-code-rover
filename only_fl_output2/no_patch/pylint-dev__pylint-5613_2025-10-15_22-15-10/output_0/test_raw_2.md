To create a `reproducer.py` script that reproduces the specific issue of lacking a straightforward, more Pythonic entry point for `pyreverse` from `pylint`, and to handle the scenario as outlined in your desired solution versus the current problem, I will structure the script as follows:

1. The script will attempt to use `pylint` in the way desired (as you've requested in the "Desired solution").
2. If the AttributeError is raised (because the method does not exist), it will be caught, and a stack trace of it will be printed using the provided function.
3. It will assert a condition that will always be false (given the current pylint implementation as of my last update), ensuring an `AssertionError` when the issue is present.
4. When pylint updates to include a method matching your desired solution, the script will exit with code 0, indicating the issue has been resolved.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Attempt to use pylint in the desired way.
    try:
        import pylint
        # The method signature below is based on your desired solution.
        # As of my last update, this method does not exist and will raise an AttributeError.
        pylint.pyreverse(output=pylint.PNG, project="ProjectName", files=["file1.py", "file2.py"])

    except ImportError as e:
        print("It seems like pylint is not installed. Please ensure pylint is installed.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("pylint must be installed.")
    
    except AttributeError as e:
        # This is expected as the desired functionality does not exist currently.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The desired pyreverse API is not yet implemented in pylint.")
    
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An unexpected error occurred, indicating another issue.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script stays true to your requirements by:
- Using the provided `print_stacktrace` function to accurately print the traceback, which includes the exact location (file and line number) along with the context of each stack frame involved in raising the exception.
- Asserting an error condition based on the current capability of pylint regarding the `pyreverse` feature, thus ensuring that the script accurately reflects the presence of the issue when executed against the current version of pylint.
- Providing clear information on what the issue is, where it was encountered, and how it conforms to the desired solution's requirements.
