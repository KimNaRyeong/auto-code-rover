If you run makemigrations on such a machine it will fail while attempting to check the migrations consistency, which is quite annoying. The solution seems to either add a django.db.backends.dummy backend for such cases or start a database server locally.\nI'd like to add a flag to skip the consistency check in these situations, or fail gracefully if the connection to the database isn't available.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insights into how the `makemigrations` command and migration consistency checks are implemented in Django, offering a foundation for addressing the issue. Here's the analysis based on the information obtained:\n\n### `makemigrations.py` Code Analysis\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe code snippet from `django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py` is part of the `handle` method in the `Command` class, responsible for executing the `makemigrations` command. It performs several key operations:\n\n1. Initializes a `MigrationLoader` with `None` for the connection to prevent resolving migrations from the database.\n2. Identifies app configurations and possibly checks multiple database aliases if database routers are used (depending on the settings).\n3. For each database alias, it checks if:\n   - The engine specified is not the dummy backend.\n   - Any migrations applicable to the database via router rules are pending.\n4. If such migrations are found, it calls `loader.check_consistent_history(connection)` to ensure no migrations have been applied before their dependencies.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nThe issue at hand arises when this `makemigrations` command is executed in environments without a configured or accessible database, leading to a failure during the `loader.check_consistent_history(connection)` step. The code explicitly requires a connection to the database for checking migration consistency, which is directly related to the reported bug of not being able to skip this check under certain conditions.\n\n#### Intended behavior based on issue description\nThe intended behavior would allow the `makemigrations` command to optionally skip the migration consistency check or gracefully handle scenarios where a database connection is unavailable. This flexibility is essential for executing the command in development environments or configurations where the database is temporarily inaccessible or irrelevant to the migrations being generated.\n\n### `MigrationLoader` and `check_consistent_history` Analysis\n\n#### What does this method do?\nThe `check_consistent_history` method in `MigrationLoader` raises `InconsistentMigrationHistory` if any applied migrations have unapplied dependencies. It ensures the database's migration history is consistent with the migration files present.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nThis method enforces a strict consistency check that requires a live connection to the database to assess applied migrations against the current migration state. This requirement is central to the issue because it prevents the `makemigrations` command from running without database access.\n\n#### Intended behavior based on the issue description\nTo address the issue, there needs to be a mechanism to bypass or modify this consistency check under certain conditions, specifically when database access is unavailable or intentionally skipped. This adjustment would allow developers to generate migrations without needing a live database connection, enhancing the command's flexibility for various development scenarios.\n\n---\n\nBased on this analysis, the solution to the issue would involve introducing a new flag or check within `makemigrations.py` that conditionally bypasses the call to `check_consistent_history` based on user input or detecting the absence of a database connection. This requires careful adjustment to both where the database connections are determined to be necessary and how the migration loader interacts with those conditions."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This flag would conditionally skip the consistency check in scenarios where a database connection is not available or its check is explicitly not desired by the user. The existing functionality should be preserved by making this skipping behavior entirely optional and defaulting to the current behavior (performing the consistency check).\n\n- **Location 2**: \n  - **File**: `django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py`\n  - **Class**: `Command`\n  - **Method**: `handle`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: This method should be updated to parse the new flag introduced for skipping checks. Based on the flag's presence, it can conditionally bypass the invocation of `loader.check_consistent_history(connection)`. The logic can be handled by adding a conditional check before the for-loop that checks database connections (around current lines 93-101). If the new flag is set to skip checks, these lines (especially the call to `check_consistent_history`) should not be executed. This change allows the `makemigrations` command to proceed without needing to verify the database migrations' consistency.\n\nThese changes would allow users to bypass migration checks in environments where database access is not available or needed, providing greater flexibility in development workflows."
