This flag would conditionally skip the consistency check in scenarios where a database connection is not available or its check is explicitly not desired by the user. The existing functionality should be preserved by making this skipping behavior entirely optional and defaulting to the current behavior (performing the consistency check)."

        "intended_behavior": "This method should be updated to parse the new flag introduced for skipping checks. Based on the flag's presence, it can conditionally bypass the invocation of loader.check_consistent_history(connection). The logic can be handled by adding a conditional check before the for-loop that checks database connections (around current lines 93-101). If the new flag is set to skip checks, these lines (especially the call to check_consistent_history) should not be executed. This change allows the makemigrations command to proceed without needing to verify the database migrations' consistency."
