Certainly! Below is the content for a Python script named `reproducer.py` that will reproduce the issue you've outlined regarding the handling of tensor product expressions in SymPy. This script checks if simplification and expansion of tensor products behave as expected. When the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace.

```python
import sys
from sympy import Symbol
from sympy.physics.quantum import TensorProduct as tp
from sympy.physics.quantum import tensor_product_simp as tps
from sympy.physics.paulialgebra import Pauli

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_tensor_product_powers():
    try:
        a = Symbol('a', commutative=False)

        t1 = tp(1, 1) * tp(1, 1)
        simplified_t1 = tps(t1)
        assert simplified_t1 != t1, "Simplification of t1 did not change its expression."

        expanded_t1 = t1.expand(tensorproduct=True)
        assert expanded_t1 != t1, "Expansion of t1 did not change its expression."

        substituted_t1 = tps(tp(1, 1) * tp(1, a)).subs(a, 1)
        assert substituted_t1 == 1, "Substituted t1 is not simplified to 1."

        t2 = tp(1, Pauli(3)) * tp(1, Pauli(3))
        simplified_t2 = tps(t2)
        assert simplified_t2 != t2, "Simplification of t2 did not change its expression."

        expanded_t2 = t2.expand(tensorproduct=True)
        assert expanded_t2 != t2, "Expansion of t2 did not change its expression."

        substituted_t2 = tps(tp(1, Pauli(3)) * tp(1, a)).subs(a, Pauli(3))
        assert substituted_t2 == 1, "Substituted t2 is not simplified to 1."

        print("All tests passed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_tensor_product_powers()
    sys.exit(0)
```

Place this script in the root directory of your project and execute it using `python3 reproducer.py`. This script performs a series of assertions to check if the manipulation and simplification of tensor product expressions work as expected, based on the example session you've provided. When an assertion fails due to the issue being present, it will print a stack trace with detailed information and exit with code 1. If all assertions pass, indicating the issue is fixed, it will simply print "All tests passed." and exit with code 0.
