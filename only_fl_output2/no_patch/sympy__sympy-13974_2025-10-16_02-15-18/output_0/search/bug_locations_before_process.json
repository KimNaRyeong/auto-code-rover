        "intended_behavior": "The method `_eval_expand_tensorproduct` should be able to correctly handle and simplify expressions involving powers of tensor products. Currently, it seems it does not correctly simplify or evaluate powers of `TensorProduct` expressions as expected. The intended behavior is to enhance this method so it can recognize and simplify powers of tensor products according to mathematical rules appropriate for tensor products. This could involve checking for powers outside of `TensorProduct` instances and recursively simplifying them or applying a more sophisticated simplification strategy that recognizes when elements of the tensor product can themselves be powered or simplified."
