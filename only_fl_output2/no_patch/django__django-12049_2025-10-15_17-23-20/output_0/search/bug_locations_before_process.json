        "intended_behavior": "This method's logic needs to be adapted to accommodate case-insensitive collation in databases. The current behavior performs a case-sensitive comparison of column names ('if field.column not in column_names'). To resolve the issue, this comparison should be made case-insensitive. This could potentially involve lowercasing (or uppercasing) both the 'field.column' and the elements within 'column_names' before performing the comparison, depending on the database collation settings. However, simply applying a case conversion is not universally appropriate, as it may not respect the database's collation and case sensitivity settings outright. \n\nA more nuanced approach might include obtaining the database's collation sensitivity settings directly within this method and adjusting the comparison logic based on these settings. For databases with case-insensitive collation, the method would perform a case-insensitive comparison. This adjustment ensures that migrations are correctly detected as applied or not, aligning with the case sensitivity behavior of the database in use. It is crucial that this change preserves the existing functionality for databases where case sensitivity is the norm, meaning conditional logic should be employed to only apply the new behavior when necessary.\n\nAdditionally, to support this intended behavior, there might be a need to interface with the database backend's introspection tools to adequately determine the database's case sensitivity settings. This ensures that the solution is robust and adaptable across different database types supported by Django."
