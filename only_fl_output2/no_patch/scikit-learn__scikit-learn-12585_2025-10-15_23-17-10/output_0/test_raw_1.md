I understand you're asking for a correct approach to create a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` to reproduce the given issue. However, the previous test you attempted did not include actually executing the code in the provided manner. Instead, it seems there might have been misunderstandings or the setup environment was not fully ready, rather than the actual Python script not addressing the issue correctly.

Given your requirements, it seems the issue description aimed at reproducing should remain unchanged as the problem was with how the environment was set up, rather than with the logic of reproducing the issue itself. If you still need a code snippet that follows your guidelines and aims to reproduce the initially described `clone` issue with classes instead of instances, you can use the previously provided script, ensuring your environment is correctly set up with all necessary Scikit-learn components built and accessible.

Let's assume your setup issues have been resolved, and you want the code written in a slightly different structure or explanation on how to correctly run such tests:

1. Ensure your Python environment has scikit-learn installed correctly. If the package is not correctly installed or built, you will encounter import errors as seen above.
2. Use the code snippet provided in the earlier response but ensure you follow these steps before:
   - Activate your Python environment where scikit-learn is correctly installed.
   - If scikit-learn is not installed, you can install it via `pip install scikit-learn` or follow the installation instructions from the official scikit-learn documentation.
   - Ensure the version of scikit-learn you're using is compatible with the code snippet. The error in question relates to functionality that might behave differently across versions.

Given these clarifications, here is the reiteration of the `reproducer.py` script provided earlier that you should try in a correctly set up environment:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_clone_with_estimator_type():
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    from sklearn.base import clone
    try:
        # Attempt to clone StandardScaler with a parameter set to its class type
        cloned = clone(StandardScaler(with_mean=StandardScaler))
        print(f"Clone successful: {cloned}")
        exit(0)  # Exiting with code 0 to indicate success (no exception raised, implying the issue is not present)
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Failure to clone with estimator type parameter") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_clone_with_estimator_type()
```

After making sure your environment is correctly prepared, running this script should attempt to replicate the issue. If the script exits with code 0, it means the issue cannot be replicated because no error occurred, or it has been resolved in the used version of scikit-learn. If the `AssertionError` is raised, and the stack trace is printed, it means the issue is present, and you've successfully replicated the problem described.
