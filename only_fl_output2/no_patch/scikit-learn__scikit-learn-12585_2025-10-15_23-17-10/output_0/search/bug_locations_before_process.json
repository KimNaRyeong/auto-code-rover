        "intended_behavior": "The `clone` method should be modified to handle instances where a parameter is an estimator type (class) rather than an estimator instance. This could be achieved by checking if a parameter is a type and taking appropriate action that does not involve invoking `get_params` on it, since `get_params` is an instance method and cannot be called on a class directly. A logical extension of the proposed fix in the issue would be to implement a conditional check to identify when a parameter is a class of an estimator and then decide either to skip cloning for that parameter, clone it differently, or handle it in such a way that does not expect the parameter to be an instance with a `get_params` method. Specifically, this involves:\n\n- Adapting the condition at line 51 to also check whether the `estimator` is a class. This might involve using `inspect.isclass(estimator)` or a similar mechanism in Python to identify if the `estimator` variable represents a class.\n- Defining the behavior for classes that are meant to be used as estimators without instantiation. One solution could be directly copying the class reference for those parameters if cloning is not logically meaningful or required for types. This approach preserves the functionality of cloning instances while also accommodating use cases where parameters are estimator types meant to configure the cloned instance's behavior dynamically."
