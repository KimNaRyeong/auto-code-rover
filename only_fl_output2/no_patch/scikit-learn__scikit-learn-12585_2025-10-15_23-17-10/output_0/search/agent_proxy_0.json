We also need to understand how estimator classes (versus instances) are handled within the sklearn codebase. Let's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the `clone` method in the entire codebase**: This will help us locate the file and exact implementation details of the `clone` method, which is failing when estimator types are passed as parameters.\n   - `search_method(\"clone\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `get_params` method in the entire codebase**: Since the error message indicates a problem with `get_params`, understanding where and how it's implemented will provide insight into why it's expecting an instance (`self`) and not working with a class type.\n   - `search_method(\"get_params\")`\n\nThese calls will provide the necessary code context regarding the implementation of `clone` and `get_params`, allowing us to examine how they could be adjusted to handle the use case described in the issue."
