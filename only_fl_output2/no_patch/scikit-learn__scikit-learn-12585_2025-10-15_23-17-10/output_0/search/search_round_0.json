I'd happily submit a PR if this change is desired.\n#### Versions\nsklearn: 0.20.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue described, we need more context about the implementation of the `clone` method and possibly the `get_params` method in the `sklearn.base` module, as these are directly involved in the reported problem. We also need to understand how estimator classes (versus instances) are handled within the sklearn codebase. Let's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the `clone` method in the entire codebase**: This will help us locate the file and exact implementation details of the `clone` method, which is failing when estimator types are passed as parameters.\n   - `search_method(\"clone\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `get_params` method in the entire codebase**: Since the error message indicates a problem with `get_params`, understanding where and how it's implemented will provide insight into why it's expecting an instance (`self`) and not working with a class type.\n   - `search_method(\"get_params\")`\n\nThese calls will provide the necessary code context regarding the implementation of `clone` and `get_params`, allowing us to examine how they could be adjusted to handle the use case described in the issue."
