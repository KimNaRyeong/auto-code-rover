Based on your requirements, here is a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py`. This script is designed to test the cloning issue with estimator types you've described. When executed, it should work as specified: raising an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, or exiting with code 0 if the issue has been resolved. Additionally, this script includes the function `print_stacktrace` for clear error reporting.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_clone_with_estimator_class():
    from sklearn.base import clone
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

    try:
        # Attempt to clone StandardScaler, incorrectly passing its class rather than an instance
        clone(StandardScaler(with_mean=StandardScaler))
        print("No error occurred, which is unexpected.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        if isinstance(e, TypeError) and 'get_params' in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            print("\nTest confirmed: Issue exists with cloning estimator types.")
            raise AssertionError("Issue with cloning estimator types confirmed.") from e
        else:
            print("An unexpected error occurred:", str(e))
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_clone_with_estimator_class()
```

This script specifically tests whether sklearn's `clone` function can handle being passed a class with one of its parameters being another class (here, `StandardScaler`) rather than an instance. According to the described issue, this should raise a `TypeError` due to `get_params` expecting an instance rather than a class.

To use this script:

1. Save it as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project.
2. Ensure you have the required version of scikit-learn installed in your Python environment. The issue was originally described with sklearn version 0.20.0, but you might want to test against both that version and the latest one.
3. Run the script by executing `python3 reproducer.py` from a terminal or command prompt. 

Make sure that your Python environment is correctly set up and that all dependencies are properly installed to avoid unrelated import errors or environment issues.
