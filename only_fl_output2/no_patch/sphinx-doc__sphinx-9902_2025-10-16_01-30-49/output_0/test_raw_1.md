Given the nature of the described issue, which involves Sphinx documentation generation and the handling of `.. py:data::` directive with `:type:` option, creating a standalone Python script to directly reproduce the issue outside of a Sphinx build environment is not straightforward. This is because the issue is specifically tied to how Sphinx processes directives and generates documentation, which involves parsing reStructuredText, evaluating configuration, and generating HTML or other output formats. This process is not easily mimicked by a simple Python script without invoking Sphinx itself.

However, I can guide you through a conceptual approach for a script that attempts to simulate the inclusion of Sphinx and checks for the expected outcome in a generated document. This will not exactly replicate the Sphinx build process but can serve as an illustrative attempt:

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_project():
    """
    This function is a placeholder to demonstrate the steps required.
    Actual implementation details might differ.
    """
    # Assume Sphinx and necessary extensions are installed
    # Create a minimal Sphinx project setup here,
    # including a conf.py and index.rst that includes the problematic module

    module_content = """
\"\"\"    
.. py:data:: mol
    :type: Unit
    :value: 'mol'
    
    mole
\"\"\"

from .module2 import Unit

mol = Unit('mol')
"""

    module2_content = """
class Unit:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
"""
    os.mkdir('test_project')
    os.chdir('test_project')
    with open('conf.py', 'w') as f:
        # Write minimal Sphinx configuration
        f.write("extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']\n")
    with open('index.rst', 'w') as f:
        # Write minimal index.rst that includes the problematic module
        f.write(".. automodule:: my_library.module1\n")
    os.mkdir('my_library')
    with open('my_library/__init__.py', 'w') as f:
        # Create an empty __init__.py
        pass
    with open('my_library/module1.py', 'w') as f:
        # Write the problematic module content
        f.write(module_content)
    with open('my_library/module2.py', 'w') as f:
        # Write the referenced module content
        f.write(module2_content)

def build_sphinx_docs():
    # Placeholder function to run the Sphinx build command
    # This would typically be something like `sphinx-build -b html . _build`
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', '.', '_build'], check=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
        print(result.stdout)
        return True
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

def check_for_link():
    # Placeholder function to check if the generated documentation has the correct link
    # This would involve parsing the generated HTML files and looking for the expected hyperlink
    try:
        with open('_build/html/my_library.module1.html', 'r') as f:
            contents = f.read()
            if "Unit" in contents and "href" in contents:
                print("Success: The link is present.")
                return True
            else:
                raise AssertionError("Link to 'Unit' type is missing.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        setup_sphinx_project()
        if build_sphinx_docs():
            if not check_for_link():
                sys.exit(1)  # The link was not found 
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with an error if any step fails
```

This script is more illustrative than functional because actual Sphinx behavior, particularly concerning document generation and linking, is complex and requires a full Sphinx environment to reproduce accurately. The placeholders within this script indicate where you would insert the specific logic to initialize a Sphinx project, write the problematic module into the project, execute the Sphinx build process, and then attempt to verify whether the link was correctly generated in the output HTML. 

To truly verify and debug the issue, setting up a minimal Sphinx project and reproducing the steps manually, then inspecting the generated documentation, is advisable.
