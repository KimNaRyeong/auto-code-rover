Creating a standalone Python script to directly reproduce a documentation linking issue that arises within a Sphinx documentation generation process is a technically challenging request. This is because the issue fundamentally involves Sphinx's handling of reStructuredText (reST) directives and not a straightforward Python error or exception that can simply be captured and detected through a Python script's execution flow.

However, I can attempt to guide you through a Python script that would serve as a sort of wrapper or automation tool to replicate the steps you might manually take: create files, run Sphinx, and look for expected output in generated documentation. Still, please note this script will involve running external commands (like Sphinx commands) and checking generated files for specific content, which is quite different from raising and catching Python exceptions based on logic errors within Python code itself.

Here's a conceptual Python script named `reproducer.py` that aims to automate the process:

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_environment():
    os.mkdir("temp_sphinx_project")
    os.chdir("temp_sphinx_project")
    os.mkdir("my_library")
    module1_content = """
\"\"\"
.. py:data:: mol
    :type: Unit
    :value: 'mol'

    mole
\"\"\"

from .module2 import Unit

mol = Unit('mol')
    """
    module2_content = """
class Unit:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
"""
    with open("my_library/module1.py", "w") as f:
        f.write(module1_content)
    with open("my_library/module2.py", "w") as f:
        f.write(module2_content)

    conf_py_content = """
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))
extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']
project = 'Test Project'
master_doc = 'index'
"""
    index_rst_content = """
.. automodule:: my_library.module1
"""
    with open("conf.py", "w") as f:
        f.write(conf_py_content)
    with open("index.rst", "w") as f:
        f.write(index_rst_content)

def run_sphinx():
    try:
        subprocess.check_call(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', '.', '_build/html'])
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

def check_documentation():
    try:
        with open("_build/html/my_library.module1.html", "r") as f:
            if "class=\"reference internal\"" not in f.read():
                raise AssertionError("Expected internal reference not found in documentation.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    setup_sphinx_environment()
    run_sphinx()
    check_documentation()
    print("Issue reproduction script completed successfully.")
```

Before running this script, ensure:
- Sphinx is installed in your environment (`pip install sphinx`).
- You're running the script in an environment where it has permission to create directories and files, and run subprocesses.

Remember, this script aims to automate the steps of reproducing the issue: setting up a minimal environment, running Sphinx, and checking if the generated documentation has the expected internal references or not. It exits with code 0 only if it successfully verifies the output against the expected conditions.

This is an unusual use of a Python script, typically meant for executing Sphinx in a way that might be closer to how one would manually test and verify the issue. Given the complexities around Sphinx documentation generation and the dependency on external commands and file I/O, it might need adjustments based on your specific environment or Sphinx configuration.
