It does not work within the context of the module.  What I mean by that is I have to key out the entire module path and the class for the type instead of importing the type into the module and only having to type in the type class name.\n### How to Reproduce\nsay I have the following in the module \"my_library.module1\"\n``` python\n\"\"\"\n.. py:data:: mol\n:type: Unit\n:value: 'mol'\nmole\n\"\"\"\nfrom .module2 import Unit\nmol = Unit('mol')\n```\nThe output I get when building the docs is this.\n```\nmol: Unit = 'mol'\nmole\n```\nand \"Unit\" is not a clickable link.\nHowever if I have the following in the module \"my_library.module1\"\n``` python\n\"\"\"\n.. py:data:: mol\n:type: my_library.module2.Unit\n:value: 'mol'\nmole\n\"\"\"\nfrom .module2 import Unit\nmol = Unit('mol')\n```\nI get this for an output\n```\nmol: my_library.module2.Unit = 'mol'\nmole\n```\nand \"my_library.module2.Unit\" is a clickable link that brings up the documentation for the Unit class\n### Expected behavior\nto be able to do the following\n``` python\n\"\"\"\n.. py:data:: mol\n:type: Unit\n:value: 'mol'\nmole\n\"\"\"\nfrom .module2 import Unit\nmol = Unit('mol')\n```\nand have the output be\n```\nmol: Unit = 'mol'\nmole\n```\nand \"Unit\" be a clickable link that leads to the class that is specified in :type:\n### Your project\nhttps://github.com/kdschlosser/python-utils/tree/unit_conversion\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nWindows\n### Python version\n3.8\n### Sphinx version\n4.2\n### Sphinx extensions\nsphinx.ext.autodoc\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about how the `Unit` class is defined and used, especially in relation to Sphinx documentation. Additionally, checking how Sphinx directives are handled might provide more insight into why the type link is not working as expected. Given the information, here are the appropriate API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"Unit\")`: This will help us find where the `Unit` class is defined across the project.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"from .module2 import Unit\", \"my_library/module1.py\")`: This will give us context on how `Unit` is imported in `module1.py`, which could be important for understanding the scope of the Sphinx documentation issue.\n- `search_code(\".. py:data:: mol\")`: This will help us find other instances of the `.. py:data::` directive being used. It could provide insight into whether the issue is isolated or widespread, and how the `:type:` option is handled in other contexts. \n\nThese calls should provide a good starting point for understanding the bug context and potentially identifying a solution."
