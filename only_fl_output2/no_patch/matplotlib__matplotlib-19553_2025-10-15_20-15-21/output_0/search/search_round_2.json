It includes methods for setting the normalization range (`__init__` with `vmin` and `vmax`), scaling data (`__call__`), and autoscaling based on input data (`autoscale` and `autoscale_None`). \n\n**Relation to the bug:** The 'Normalize' object's change in limits (such as `vmin` and `vmax`) should notify associated scalar-mappable objects like `AxesImage` to clear cache or update themselves accordingly. This link appears to be missing or not functioning as expected.\n\n**Intended behavior:** On changes to its limits, 'Normalize' should have a mechanism to invalidate caches or trigger updates in connected scalar mappable objects to reflect these changes visually.\n\n### `AxesImage` Class Context\nThe `AxesImage` class in `lib/matplotlib/image.py` is an extension for images displayed within an axis, with various attributes for managing its appearance. While the search for `set_clim` within `AxesImage` yielded no direct results, the initializer mentions a `norm` parameter which likely ties back to the `Normalize` instance.\n\n**Relation to the bug:** Given that `AxesImage` objects can receive and store a `Normalize` instance through their constructor but lack an explicit `set_clim` method in the provided context, it may imply that changing normalization limits does not inherently signal the `AxesImage` (or other scalar mappables) to update. Specifically, the mechanic to listen for changes on its normalization (e.g., `norm` parameter) and invalidate caches upon such updates is either not present or not working as required.\n\n**Intended behavior:** `AxesImage` should respond to changes in its normalization settings, such as updates to the `vmin` and `vmax` of its associated `Normalize` object. This would likely necessitate a mechanism for `Normalize` to notify linked scalar-mappables of changes or vice versa.\n\n### Missing Context and Further Analysis\n- **`set_clim` method**: Given that it was not found within `AxesImage`, it might be defined in a base class or manage its behavior differently. It could be useful to further explore where and how `set_clim` is implemented for scalar mappables.\n- **Callbacks mechanism (`callbacksSM.connect`)**: The missing information suggests either this is an outdated reference, misnamed, or a part of a higher abstraction not directly visible through the provided context. Further analysis on how callbacks or event handlers are implemented in matplotlib for property changes could reveal mechanisms intended for this use case.\n\nGiven these insights, further API calls could be considered to uncover:\n1. Implementation details of `set_clim` that might reside in a superclass of `AxesImage` or a related utility function.\n2. The general event/callback mechanism employed within matplotlib to handle changes to object properties like those of a `Normalize` instance."

This could be achieved by implementing an observer pattern where scalar-mappables can register as observers to a `Normalize` instance. Upon any change to the normalization parameters, `Normalize` should iterate over its observers and call a predefined method (e.g., `update_norm`, a new method to be defined) on them to handle the change. This ensures that all visual elements using the `Normalize` instance for normalization update accordingly, preserving sync across the board.\n\n   **Location 2**: File: `lib/matplotlib/image.py`, Class: `AxesImage`\n   \n   **Intended Behavior**: Since `AxesImage` directly uses instances of `Normalize` for handling color normalization, it should be capable of responding to notifications of changes in its associated `Normalize` instance. This entails implementing an `update_norm` method (or similarly named) which is called when the `Normalize` instance it is linked to changes. This method would handle invalidation of any cached data and request a redraw to reflect the updated normalization parameters. This behavior ensures that any modification to shared normalization parameters is reflected across all using instances, maintaining visual consistency.\n\nThese adjustments would address the core issue of changes to `Normalize` limits not being propagated to dependent scalar-mappable objects, thereby improving the flexibility and dynamic response of the visualization to parameter adjustments.\n"

This directly adjusts the `norm` object's limits inside the `ScalarMappable`. After setting these limits, it calls `self.changed()`, which is presumably a method to notify changes to the object state.\n\n**Relationship with the bug:** This is directly related to the issue, as changing the color limits (`clim`) should lead to a graphical update reflecting these new limits on all related objects, such as `AxesImage` objects and associated colorbars. If `set_clim` adjusts the normalization limits but does not trigger updates in a way that reaches all connected visual elements, the desired synchronization does not happen.\n\n**Intended behavior:** When `set_clim` is called, it should ensure that all scalar-mappable objects sharing the same `Normalize` instance respond accordingly. This suggests that the `self.changed()` call should effectively propagate changes in a way that updates all relevant graphical representations.\n\n### Analysis of `ScalarMappable`\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n`ScalarMappable` is a base class that associates a `Norm` (normalization) and a `cmap` (colormap) with data. It effectively controls how data is mapped to colors based on a normalization process.\n\n**Relationship with the bug:** Given that `ScalarMappable` includes the `set_clim` method and controls how data is normalized and mapped to colors, it plays a critical role in ensuring that any changes in normalization parameters are reflected across all visual components that rely on these parameters.\n\n**Intended behavior:** The `ScalarMappable` class, especially through methods like `set_clim` and `changed`, should ensure that updates to normalization or colormap parameters are properly propagated to all instances that use these settings. This includes notifying all associated visual elements to refresh or redraw based on these updates.\n\n### Analysis of Callback Mechanism (add_callback and remove_callback)\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n`add_callback` and `remove_callback` are methods likely used to manage event listeners or callbacks. These methods allow objects to subscribe to changes or events in another object and react accordingly when those events occur.\n\n**Relationship with the bug:** The callback mechanism could be instrumental in implementing the notification system that the issue description suggests is missing. By using callbacks, changes to normalization parameters could automatically notify all subscribed `ScalarMappable` instances (or other relevant objects) to perform necessary updates.\n\n**Intended behavior:** These methods should be used within the `Normalize`, `ScalarMappable`, or related classes to establish a robust notification system. When `Normalize` parameters change, `add_callback` could ensure that all affected objects are alerted and react by updating their visual representation.\n\n### Conclusion\nTo resolve the issue, it's necessary to ensure that adjustments in normalization parameters via `set_clim` or modifications to the `Normalize` instance lead to immediate and synchronized updates on all dependent visual elements. Employing a callback mechanism efficiently within the `ScalarMappable` (and possibly `Normalize`) classes is key to achieving this intended behavior."

This could involve implementing an observer pattern inside the class, where\n   - A new method to add observers (e.g., `add_observer(observer)`) is introduced.\n   - A new method to notify observers (e.g., `notify_observers()`) is implemented. This method should iterate through all registered observers and invoke a callback or a specific method on them (e.g., `update()` method that each observer should implement) whenever `vmin` or `vmax` changes.\n   - These methods ensure that any associated scalar-mappable objects get updated when normalization parameters change.\n\n   **Location 2**: File: `lib/matplotlib/cm.py`, Class: `ScalarMappable`, Method: `set_clim`\n\n   **Intended Behavior**: Upon setting new clim values, `set_clim` should not only update the internal `norm` object's `vmin` and `vmax` but also ensure that any change leads to a cascading update call across related visual elements. It should:\n   - Call `self.changed()` method after setting `vmin` and `vmax`.\n   - Ensure that `self.changed()` properly invalidates cache and notifies all observers about the change. This might require reinforcing the implementation of `self.changed()` to explicitly invoke redraws or updates on depending elements, ensuring synchronization.\n\n   **Enhancement for Synchronization**:\n\n   - For better synchronization among `Normalize`, `ScalarMappable`, and dependent objects like `AxesImage`, it would be beneficial to emphasize the implementation of a messaging or notification system within the `ScalarMappable` and `Normalize` classes. This system would effectively allow instances to subscribe and react to changes, thereby maintaining consistent state across multiple components.\n   - Implement `add_callback` and `remove_callback` functionality specifically within the `Normalize` and `ScalarMappable` classes to manage a list of callback functions or subscribed observers. When a property changes in `Normalize`, all subscribed (or registered) `ScalarMappable` instances get notified and adjust their states (e.g., redraw or refresh visuals) accordingly.\n\nThese adjustments aim to ensure that `Normalize` limits changes trigger updates across all linked scalar-mappable instances, maintaining visual consistency and synchronization in multi-image or complex plotting scenarios."
