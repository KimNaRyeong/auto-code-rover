        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n### `Normalize` Class Context\nFrom the `Normalize` class in `lib/matplotlib/colors.py`, we see basic structure indicating it's responsible for controlling the normalization of data values for display. It includes methods for setting the normalization range (`__init__` with `vmin` and `vmax`), scaling data (`__call__`), and autoscaling based on input data (`autoscale` and `autoscale_None`). \n\n**Relation to the bug:** The 'Normalize' object's change in limits (such as `vmin` and `vmax`) should notify associated scalar-mappable objects like `AxesImage` to clear cache or update themselves accordingly. This link appears to be missing or not functioning as expected.\n\n**Intended behavior:** On changes to its limits, 'Normalize' should have a mechanism to invalidate caches or trigger updates in connected scalar mappable objects to reflect these changes visually.\n\n### `AxesImage` Class Context\nThe `AxesImage` class in `lib/matplotlib/image.py` is an extension for images displayed within an axis, with various attributes for managing its appearance. While the search for `set_clim` within `AxesImage` yielded no direct results, the initializer mentions a `norm` parameter which likely ties back to the `Normalize` instance.\n\n**Relation to the bug:** Given that `AxesImage` objects can receive and store a `Normalize` instance through their constructor but lack an explicit `set_clim` method in the provided context, it may imply that changing normalization limits does not inherently signal the `AxesImage` (or other scalar mappables) to update. Specifically, the mechanic to listen for changes on its normalization (e.g., `norm` parameter) and invalidate caches upon such updates is either not present or not working as required.\n\n**Intended behavior:** `AxesImage` should respond to changes in its normalization settings, such as updates to the `vmin` and `vmax` of its associated `Normalize` object. This would likely necessitate a mechanism for `Normalize` to notify linked scalar-mappables of changes or vice versa.\n\n### Missing Context and Further Analysis\n- **`set_clim` method**: Given that it was not found within `AxesImage`, it might be defined in a base class or manage its behavior differently. It could be useful to further explore where and how `set_clim` is implemented for scalar mappables.\n- **Callbacks mechanism (`callbacksSM.connect`)**: The missing information suggests either this is an outdated reference, misnamed, or a part of a higher abstraction not directly visible through the provided context. Further analysis on how callbacks or event handlers are implemented in matplotlib for property changes could reveal mechanisms intended for this use case.\n\nGiven these insights, further API calls could be considered to uncover:\n1. Implementation details of `set_clim` that might reside in a superclass of `AxesImage` or a related utility function.\n2. The general event/callback mechanism employed within matplotlib to handle changes to object properties like those of a `Normalize` instance."

        "content": "1. We need more context on handling and notification of changes between `Normalize` instances and scalar-mappable objects such as `AxesImage`. Specifically, insight into how changes to normalization parameters are supposed to propagate and notify dependent objects to update their state or redraw themselves. Hence, we should construct the following search API calls:\n   - search_method(\"set_clim\")\n   - search_class(\"ScalarMappable\")\n   - search_method(\"add_callback\")\n   - search_method(\"remove_callback\")\n\n2. **Bug Locations and Intended Behavior**\n\n   **Location 1**: File: `lib/matplotlib/colors.py`, Class: `Normalize`\n   \n   **Intended Behavior**: The `Normalize` class should include a mechanism to notify attached observers (like `AxesImage`) upon changes to its state (e.g., `vmin`, `vmax`). This could be achieved by implementing an observer pattern where scalar-mappables can register as observers to a `Normalize` instance. Upon any change to the normalization parameters, `Normalize` should iterate over its observers and call a predefined method (e.g., `update_norm`, a new method to be defined) on them to handle the change. This ensures that all visual elements using the `Normalize` instance for normalization update accordingly, preserving sync across the board.\n\n   **Location 2**: File: `lib/matplotlib/image.py`, Class: `AxesImage`\n   \n   **Intended Behavior**: Since `AxesImage` directly uses instances of `Normalize` for handling color normalization, it should be capable of responding to notifications of changes in its associated `Normalize` instance. This entails implementing an `update_norm` method (or similarly named) which is called when the `Normalize` instance it is linked to changes. This method would handle invalidation of any cached data and request a redraw to reflect the updated normalization parameters. This behavior ensures that any modification to shared normalization parameters is reflected across all using instances, maintaining visual consistency.\n\nThese adjustments would address the core issue of changes to `Normalize` limits not being propagated to dependent scalar-mappable objects, thereby improving the flexibility and dynamic response of the visualization to parameter adjustments.\n"
