The reason you would want to do this is that by sharing a `Normalize` instance between multiple scalar mappable objects you can stay synced similar to `sharex` and `sharey`.\nColorbar update error with clim change in multi_image.py example\n### Bug report\n**Bug summary**\nIn the multi_image example, the colorbar is responding correctly to `set_clim` only when called on the image to which the colorbar is directly attached.\n**Code for reproduction**\nThis is just the example, https://matplotlib.org/gallery/images_contours_and_fields/multi_image.html, with manipulation of the clim at the bottom.\n```python\nfrom matplotlib import colors\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nnp.random.seed(19680801)\nNr = 3\nNc = 2\ncmap = \"cool\"\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(Nr, Nc)\nfig.suptitle('Multiple images')\nimages = []\nfor i in range(Nr):\nfor j in range(Nc):\n# Generate data with a range that varies from one plot to the next.\ndata = ((1 + i + j) / 10) * np.random.rand(10, 20) * 1e-6\nimages.append(axs[i, j].imshow(data, cmap=cmap))\naxs[i, j].label_outer()\n# Find the min and max of all colors for use in setting the color scale.\nvmin = min(image.get_array().min() for image in images)\nvmax = max(image.get_array().max() for image in images)\nnorm = colors.Normalize(vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax)\nfor im in images:\nim.set_norm(norm)\nfig.colorbar(images[0], ax=axs, orientation='horizontal', fraction=.1)\n# Make images respond to changes in the norm of other images (e.g. via the\n# \"edit axis, curves and images parameters\" GUI on Qt), but be careful not to\n# recurse infinitely!\ndef update(changed_image):\nfor im in images:\nif (changed_image.get_cmap() != im.get_cmap()\nor changed_image.get_clim() != im.get_clim()):\nim.set_cmap(changed_image.get_cmap())\nim.set_clim(changed_image.get_clim())\nfor im in images:\nim.callbacksSM.connect('changed', update)\nimages[1].set_clim(1e-9, 2e-8)\nfig.savefig('ax1_bad.png')\nimages[0].set_clim(1e-9, 2e-8)\nfig.savefig('ax0_good.png')\n```\n**Actual outcome**\nax1_bad.png:\n![ax1_bad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85125/78626771-716b3680-782b-11ea-844b-c12c7eeb396d.png)\n**Expected outcome**\nax0_good.png:\n![ax0_good](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85125/78626732-4f71b400-782b-11ea-8ed4-948dbeb49d20.png)\n**Matplotlib version**\n* Operating system: OSX\n* Matplotlib version:  3.1.2\n* Matplotlib backend (`print(matplotlib.get_backend())`): MacOSX, agg\n* Python version: 3.7\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue mentioned, we need to gather more context about how `Normalize` objects and scalar-mappables like `AxesImage` interact, especially regarding cache invalidation and the mechanism through which notifications of changes should propagate.\n\nThe specific items mentioned in the issue are:\n- `Normalize` class: This seems central to the problem, as the issue mentions \"changing the limit of a normalizer\".\n- `AxesImage` class: Mentioned as not updating caches in response to changes, resulting in the figure not updating.\n- Mechanism for notifying changes between these objects: The issue suggests there's a need for a way to notify scalar-mappable objects of changes in `Normalize` objects.\n- `set_clim` method: This is directly implicated in the issue, as changes via this method are not properly propagated to the colorbar in the example provided.\n- How `callbacksSM` is supposed to work in this context: As it's used in the code example to attempt to propagate changes.\n\nBased on these, we will need to make the following API calls to gather the necessary context from the codebase:\n1. Search for the `Normalize` class to understand how it's implemented.\n2. Search for the `AxesImage` class to see how it interacts with `Normalize` and manages its cache.\n3. Search for the `set_clim` method in the `AxesImage` class, as this seems to be the method that should trigger cache invalidation and updates.\n4. Search for references to `callbacksSM.connect` to understand how callbacks are expected to be handled for propagating changes.\n\nTherefore, the API calls will be:\n- search_class(\"Normalize\")\n- search_class(\"AxesImage\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"set_clim\", \"AxesImage\")\n- search_code(\"callbacksSM.connect\")"
