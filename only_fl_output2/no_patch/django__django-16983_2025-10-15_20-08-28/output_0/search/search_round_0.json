        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` are implemented within the Django admin framework, and how they interact with `ManyToManyField`, especially when a custom intermediary model is specified using the `through` parameter. To gather sufficient context for resolving this issue, let's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the documentation or implementation of `ModelAdmin` class to understand how `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` are defined and used.\n2. Search for the implementation of `ManyToManyField` to understand how the `through` attribute is handled.\n3. Search within the admin framework for where `ManyToManyField` definitions are checked or validated, if such a mechanism exists, to see how this case could be integrated.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are the specific API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"ModelAdmin\")`: To get an overview or any specific details about the `ModelAdmin` class where `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` are defined.\n- `search_class(\"ManyToManyField\")`: To understand the details about the `ManyToManyField`, especially how the `through` parameter is processed or validated.\n- `search_method(\"validate\")`: To check if there's a global validation method that might interact with `ManyToManyField` instances or a place where a new system check can be introduced for this specific case.\n- `search_code(\"filter_horizontal\")` and `search_code(\"filter_vertical\")`: To find the usage or implementation details of these attributes within the Django framework, possibly in the `ModelAdmin` class.\n- `search_code(\"ManyToManyField(through=\")`: To locate any direct mentions or advice within the codebase about using the `through` argument, which could give clues on where the system check should be implemented or if there's an existing warning or validation mechanism that could be enhanced.\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive overview of where and how `filter_horizontal`, `filter_vertical`, and `ManyToManyField` with `through` are implemented or mentioned within the Django codebase, allowing us to gather enough context to formulate a solution or patch."
