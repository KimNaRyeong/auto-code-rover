To gather sufficient context for resolving this issue, let's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the documentation or implementation of `ModelAdmin` class to understand how `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` are defined and used.\n2. Search for the implementation of `ManyToManyField` to understand how the `through` attribute is handled.\n3. Search within the admin framework for where `ManyToManyField` definitions are checked or validated, if such a mechanism exists, to see how this case could be integrated.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are the specific API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"ModelAdmin\")`: To get an overview or any specific details about the `ModelAdmin` class where `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` are defined.\n- `search_class(\"ManyToManyField\")`: To understand the details about the `ManyToManyField`, especially how the `through` parameter is processed or validated.\n- `search_method(\"validate\")`: To check if there's a global validation method that might interact with `ManyToManyField` instances or a place where a new system check can be introduced for this specific case.\n- `search_code(\"filter_horizontal\")` and `search_code(\"filter_vertical\")`: To find the usage or implementation details of these attributes within the Django framework, possibly in the `ModelAdmin` class.\n- `search_code(\"ManyToManyField(through=\")`: To locate any direct mentions or advice within the codebase about using the `through` argument, which could give clues on where the system check should be implemented or if there's an existing warning or validation mechanism that could be enhanced.\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive overview of where and how `filter_horizontal`, `filter_vertical`, and `ManyToManyField` with `through` are implemented or mentioned within the Django codebase, allowing us to gather enough context to formulate a solution or patch."

        "content": "Let's analyze the gathered context from the API calls and address the considerations based on the questions provided:\n\n### Analysis of `ModelAdmin`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  - The `ModelAdmin` class defines how a model should be displayed in the Django admin interface. It includes configuration for list displays, search fields, pagination, and form displays. Importantly, it does not explicitly mention or handle `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` in the method definitions directly. However, we know from the documentation and usage patterns that these configurations impact how many-to-many fields can be presented in the admin using a more user-friendly widget for selection.\n  \n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  - The issue is related to the lack of validation or warning when `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` is used in conjunction with a `ManyToManyField` that specifies a custom `through` model. Given the `ModelAdmin` class manages admin configuration, including these options, any checks or validations to address the bug would likely be situated here or in classes/methods that `ModelAdmin` interacts with.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n  - Ideally, the admin system should either perform a validation check that warns or prevents the use of `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` when a `ManyToManyField` is configured with a custom `through` model. This validation would guide developers to avoid misconfiguration and understand the limitations.\n\n### Analysis of `ManyToManyField`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  - The `ManyToManyField` class defines the behavior of many-to-many relationships in Django models, including the specification of a custom `through` model for complex many-to-many relationships.\n  \n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  - Since the issue arises when a `ManyToManyField` is used with a `through` parameter in combination with `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical`, this part of the code is directly related to the issue. However, the current implementation doesn't seem to provide any warnings or checks for this specific misconfiguration.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n  - The `ManyToManyField` should be capable of indicating to the admin system when it's configured in a way that's incompatible with `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical`. This could be through a check method within the field itself or through a related check in the admin system.\n\n### Considering the Missing Code Snippet Result\n\nThe search for `ManyToManyField(through=` didn't return any results, indicating there's no explicit handling or mention of this scenario. This absence itself is informative, as it highlights a gap in the implementation where such checks or warnings should be integrated.\n\n### Next Steps in Context Gathering\n\nGiven the information and considering the gaps, the next steps could involve:\n\n1. Investigating how `ModelAdmin`'s properties related to `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` are processed, specifically in `checks.py` where their usage is validated. This could uncover how checks are currently performed and where new checks could be introduced.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"filter_horizontal\", \"django/contrib/admin/checks.py\")`\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"filter_vertical\", \"django/contrib/admin/checks.py\")`\n\n2. Exploring the `validate` method within `ManyToManyField` or related classes to understand current validation mechanisms and where a custom check could be introduced.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"validate\", \"ManyToManyField\")`\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"validate\", \"django/db/models/fields/related.py\")`\n\nThese steps aim to locate the exact points in the code where behavior related to the issue is defined or could be modified to introduce the necessary checks for `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` when a `through` model is used in `ManyToManyField`."

This method should raise a validation error or at least a warning if such a configuration is detected, guiding developers away from this unsupported setup. The validation should be integrated into the admin system checks that run when the server starts or the checks framework is otherwise invoked. This preserves the functionality of `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` by clearly communicating their limitations to developers.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/contrib/admin/checks.py`\n  - **Methods:** This location might not pinpoint a specific method without further context, but it's clear that this file involves checks for `ModelAdmin` configurations. \n  - **Intended Behavior:** Extend or introduce checks related to `ModelAdmin` configuration that specifically validate the use of `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` in conjunction with `ManyToManyField`'s `through` option. The check should verify that when either `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` is configured, the related `ManyToManyField` does not declare a `through` model. If such a case is found, the check should emit a warning or error indicating the incompatibility. This enhancement would help developers identify configuration mistakes early in the development process, ensuring the admin interface behaves as expected.\n\nThese locations and behaviors address the issue by introducing a system that actively prevents or warns against the misconfiguration described in the issue. This solution aims to enhance developer experience by providing immediate feedback on an unsupported configuration, preventing wasted time and confusion."
