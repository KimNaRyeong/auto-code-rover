This enum has a deprecated value `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN`. The macro `JXL_DEPRECATED` is defined elsewhere, but it is included in `c_id_attributes` and `cpp_id_attributes`, so that shouldn't be the problem.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/** Data type for the sample values per channel per pixel.\r\n */\r\ntypedef enum {\r\n  /** Use 32-bit single-precision floating point values, with range 0.0-1.0\r\n   * (within gamut, may go outside this range for wide color gamut). Floating\r\n   * point output, either JXL_TYPE_FLOAT or JXL_TYPE_FLOAT16, is recommended\r\n   * for HDR and wide gamut images when color profile conversion is required. */\r\n  JXL_TYPE_FLOAT = 0,\r\n\r\n  /** DEPRECATED: Bitpacked 1-bit. As an alternative, use JXL_TYPE_UINT8.\r\n   */\r\n  JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN JXL_DEPRECATED,\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen building documentation from this, it is parsing it as if the enum value is `JXL_DEPRECATED`, not `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN` as it should be. When there are two or more enum values deprecated like this, it results in `Duplicate C++ declaration`.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nJust like attributes for function definitions, attributes for enum values should be ignored when parsing.\n\n### Your project\n\nhttps://libjxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### OS\n\nLinux\n\n### Python version\n\n3.9.10\n\n### Sphinx version\n\n4.5.0\n\n### Sphinx extensions\n\n_No response_\n\n### Extra tools\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n"

        "content": "To accurately mimic a scenario where Sphinx is required for documentation generation without directly using `sphinx-build` (as the environment might not have Sphinx installed or correctly configured for direct command-line usage), we can leverage Python's ability to invoke Sphinx programmatically. This approach allows indirect handling of the Sphinx operations and ensures the script is self-contained with respect to error-checking and environmental setup. Given the prior attempt had issues due to Sphinx not being found, this revised approach will try to encapsulate Sphinx usage within Python, thus sidestepping direct command invocation.\n\nThe revised script focuses on setting up a minimal Sphinx project programmatically in Python, generating documentation for a header file that contains the problematic `enum` definitions, and then analyzing the generated output to check if the issue (misinterpretation of `enum` values due to attributes) occurs. \n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom sphinx.application import Sphinx\nimport io\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef setup_sphinx_environment():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function sets up a minimal Sphinx environment by generating a conf.py file\n    and an index.rst document pointing at a generated C++ header file.\n    \"\"\"\n    conf_py = \"\"\"\nproject = 'TestProject'\nmaster_doc = 'index'\nextensions = ['breathe']\nbreathe_projects = { 'test': './doxyoutput/xml' }\nhtml_theme = 'alabaster'\n    \"\"\"\n    index_rst = \"\"\"\n.. include:: <isonum.txt>\n\nWelcome to TestProject's documentation!\n=======================================\n\n.. doxygenindex::\n    \"\"\"\n\n    with open(\"conf.py\", \"w\") as f:\n        f.write(conf_py)\n    with open(\"index.rst\", \"w\") as f:\n        f.write(index_rst)\n\ndef generate_header_with_enum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates a C++ header file with an enum that includes a deprecated attribute, to mimic the scenario described.\n    \"\"\"\n    header_content = \"\"\"\n#define JXL_DEPRECATED __attribute__((__deprecated__))\n\ntypedef enum {\n  JXL_TYPE_FLOAT = 0,\n  JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN JXL_DEPRECATED,\n} JXLDataType;\n    \"\"\"\n    with open('example.h', 'w') as f:\n        f.write(header_content)\n\ndef run_sphinx():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the documentation using Sphinx.\n    Checks for errors in enum parsing related to attributes within the build output.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Assuming Sphinx setup is correct in your environment\n    srcdir = os.path.abspath('.')\n    confdir = srcdir\n    outdir = os.path.join(srcdir, '_build', 'html')\n    doctreedir = os.path.join(srcdir, '_build', 'doctrees')\n    app = Sphinx(srcdir, confdir, outdir, doctreedir, 'html')\n    app.build(force_all=True)\n\n    # Check the generated documentation for misparsed enum value\n    try:\n        with io.open(os.path.join(outdir, 'index.html'), 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n            content = f.read()\n            # Performing a simplistic check\n            if \"JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN\" not in content and \"JXL_DEPRECATED\" in content:\n                raise AssertionError(\"Documented enum is incorrectly parsed due to misinterpretation of attributes.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    try:\n        generate_header_with_enum()\n        setup_sphinx_environment()\n        run_sphinx()\n        print(\"No issues detected.\")\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)  # Exit with error if the AssertionError is raised\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)  # Handles any other unexpected errors\n    exit(0)\n```\n\nThis script attempts a more integrated approach to reproduce the issue within a Python environment, indirectly utilizing Sphinx for documentation generation.

Please adjust the script's specifics (e.g., the paths or Sphinx configuration details) to fit the exact setup or requirements of the project in question."
