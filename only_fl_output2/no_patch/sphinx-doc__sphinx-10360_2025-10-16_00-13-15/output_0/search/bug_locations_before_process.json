        "intended_behavior": "The code within this file, especially parts that parse enum declarations and handle `__attribute__` annotations, should be updated to correctly distinguish between enum value names and their attributes. When encountering an `__attribute__` (or a macro that expands to include `__attribute__`), the parser needs to: - Correctly interpret and separate the enum value (e.g., `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN`) from its attributes (e.g., `JXL_DEPRECATED` or any `__attribute__((__deprecated__))` syntax). - Ensure that the enum value itself is recognized and documented as such, not the attribute or macro associated with it. - Attributes like `__attribute__((__deprecated__))` should not affect the identification of the enum value but should still be processed to document the deprecation status if the documentation generator supports such feature. This fix should preserve the existing functionality where attributes provide necessary information (like deprecation) without misinterpreting the attribute as the main identifier for the enum value."
