This enum has a deprecated value `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN`. The macro `JXL_DEPRECATED` is defined elsewhere, but it is included in `c_id_attributes` and `cpp_id_attributes`, so that shouldn't be the problem.\n```\n/** Data type for the sample values per channel per pixel.\n*/\ntypedef enum {\n/** Use 32-bit single-precision floating point values, with range 0.0-1.0\n* (within gamut, may go outside this range for wide color gamut). Floating\n* point output, either JXL_TYPE_FLOAT or JXL_TYPE_FLOAT16, is recommended\n* for HDR and wide gamut images when color profile conversion is required. */\nJXL_TYPE_FLOAT = 0,\n/** DEPRECATED: Bitpacked 1-bit. As an alternative, use JXL_TYPE_UINT8.\n*/\nJXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN JXL_DEPRECATED,\n[...]\n```\nWhen building documentation from this, it is parsing it as if the enum value is `JXL_DEPRECATED`, not `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN` as it should be. When there are two or more enum values deprecated like this, it results in `Duplicate C++ declaration`.\n### Expected behavior\nJust like attributes for function definitions, attributes for enum values should be ignored when parsing.\n### Your project\nhttps://libjxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nLinux\n### Python version\n3.9.10\n### Sphinx version\n4.5.0\n### Sphinx extensions\n_No response_\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context reveals that the only fruitful search was for `__attribute__`, which found matches in the file `sphinx/util/cfamily.py`. This suggests that the handling of attributes within C/C++ code by Sphinx occurs in this utility file, which is likely involved in parsing C-family languages (C, C++, Objective-C, etc.) for documentation purposes. Given the absence of results for `typedef enum` and `JXL_DEPRECATED`, it seems that the issue might not be directly related to the presence of these specific code snippets but rather to how Sphinx's utility for C-family languages interprets and parses attributes in enums.\n\n### Analysis of `sphinx/util/cfamily.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - This code is likely responsible for parsing C/C++ code to generate documentation. It probably includes functions or classes that deal with identifying language constructs, such as functions, variables, and enums, including their attributes. The occurrence of `__attribute__` suggests it deals explicitly with parsing GCC's `__attribute__` syntax, which is widely used for specifying special properties of variables, enum values, functions, etc.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Since the bug involves the misinterpretation of the `__attribute__` applied to enum values, leading to the incorrect parsing of `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN` as `JXL_DEPRECATED`, the mechanisms within `sphinx/util/cfamily.py` that handle attribute parsing are likely where the problem originates. The bug implies that instead of recognizing `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN` as an enum value with an associated deprecated attribute, the parser incorrectly identifies the attribute as the enum value itself.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be for the parser to correctly identify `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN` as the enum value and `JXL_DEPRECATED` (or the `__attribute__` macro expanding to it) as a modifier to this value, which should not alter the parsing or documentation output of the enum's name. Instead of treating the attribute as defining another symbol, the parser should ignore it in terms of naming but still recognize and potentially document the deprecation notice associated with the enum value.\n\nConsidering the analysis, the focus should now be on examining the specific handling of `__attribute__` inside `sphinx/util/cfamily.py` to understand how enum values with attributes are parsed and to identify the reason behind the misinterpretation. Given the specific file to look into, the next step would be to further inspect the `sphinx/util/cfamily.py` file to locate the exact code block responsible for this behavior. \n\n**Next Steps for Context Gathering:**\n\nGiven the analysis, the next logical steps would be:\n\n- Inspect `sphinx/util/cfamily.py` for functions or code blocks related to attribute parsing, particularly with `enum` declarations.\n  \nThe appropriate API call for this next step would be to explore the code in `sphinx/util/cfamily.py` where `__attribute__` occurrences are found:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"__attribute__\", \"sphinx/util/cfamily.py\")`: To get more detailed insight into the handling of attributes in enum declarations within this specific file."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

When encountering an `__attribute__` (or a macro that expands to include `__attribute__`), the parser needs to:\n     - Correctly interpret and separate the enum value (e.g., `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN`) from its attributes (e.g., `JXL_DEPRECATED` or any `__attribute__((__deprecated__))` syntax).\n     - Ensure that the enum value itself is recognized and documented as such, not the attribute or macro associated with it.\n     - Attributes like `__attribute__((__deprecated__))` should not affect the identification of the enum value but should still be processed to document the deprecation status if the documentation generator supports such feature.\n     - This fix should preserve the existing functionality where attributes provide necessary information (like deprecation) without misinterpreting the attribute as the main identifier for the enum value.\n\nThe resolution requires updating the parsing logic to accurately handle attributes without misidentifying the elements they are associated with. This involves refining the syntax parsing rules or the logic that interprets and separates different components of enum declarations."
