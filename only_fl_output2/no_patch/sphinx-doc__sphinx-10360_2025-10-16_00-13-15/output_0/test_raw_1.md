To accurately mimic a scenario where Sphinx is required for documentation generation without directly using `sphinx-build` (as the environment might not have Sphinx installed or correctly configured for direct command-line usage), we can leverage Python's ability to invoke Sphinx programmatically. This approach allows indirect handling of the Sphinx operations and ensures the script is self-contained with respect to error-checking and environmental setup. Given the prior attempt had issues due to Sphinx not being found, this revised approach will try to encapsulate Sphinx usage within Python, thus sidestepping direct command invocation.

The revised script focuses on setting up a minimal Sphinx project programmatically in Python, generating documentation for a header file that contains the problematic `enum` definitions, and then analyzing the generated output to check if the issue (misinterpretation of `enum` values due to attributes) occurs. 

```python
import os
from sphinx.application import Sphinx
import io

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

This script attempts a more integrated approach to reproduce the issue within a Python environment, indirectly utilizing Sphinx for documentation generation. The above code is meant for a scenario where itâ€™s necessary to diagnose or verify the processing of `enum` definitions (with attributes) within Sphinx generated documentation, specifically looking to identify parsing or documentation generation issues related to `enum` attributes. Please adjust the script's specifics (e.g., the paths or Sphinx configuration details) to fit the exact setup or requirements of the project in question.
