        "intended_behavior": "The methods responsible for generating the `<testcase>` elements should be reviewed to ensure that `<properties>` are not incorrectly added within `<testcase>` elements. Instead, a mechanism should be implemented to aggregate properties at the `<testsuite>` level or ensure that `<properties>` are only added to `<testcase>` when appropriate according to the JUnit XML schema. This could involve adjusting the `add_property` method or the logic that determines where and how properties are serialized in the XML document, preserving the ability to add properties while ensuring they are placed correctly in the XML structure according to the JUnit schema."

This could mean enhancing the `add_property` method to distinguish between test case properties and testsuite properties, or creating a new method that specifically handles testsuite level properties and ensuring that during XML generation, these properties are correctly placed in the XML document."
