To create a standalone Python script that reproduces the issue related to `<properties>` tags in JUnit reports generated by pytest, and to validate the XML against the expected schema where `<properties>` must be a child of `<testsuite>` and not `<testcase>`, you can utilize the `lxml` package for parsing and validating XML. This script performs the pytest operation programmatically and then parses the resulting XML to check for the schema compliance. In case of non-compliance or if the issue is present, it raises an `AssertionError`.

First, ensure you have the necessary packages installed:
- pytest
- hypothesis
- lxml

You might install them using pip if you haven't already:
```
pip install pytest hypothesis lxml
```

Here is the `reproducer.py` script:

```python
import subprocess
import sys
from lxml import etree

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_test_file():
    test_content = """
from hypothesis import given, strategies

@given(x=strategies.integers(1, 10))
def test_xml_generation(x):
    assert 1 <= x <= 10
"""
    with open("test_xml_generation.py", "w") as test_file:
        test_file.write(test_content)

def run_pytest():
    subprocess.run(["pytest", "--junitxml=report.xml", "test_xml_generation.py"], check=True)

def validate_xml():
    schema_doc = etree.parse("https://github.com/windyroad/JUnit-Schema/blob/master/JUnit.xsd")
    schema = etree.XMLSchema(schema_doc)
    
    try:
        with open("report.xml", "rb") as result_file:
            xml_doc = etree.parse(result_file)
            schema.assertValid(xml_doc)
            print("XML is valid according to JUnit schema.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "Generated XML does not comply with JUnit schema."

def main():
    create_test_file()
    try:
        run_pytest()
        validate_xml()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Note:** This script creates a test file named `test_xml_generation.py`, runs pytest to generate the JUnit XML report, and attempts to validate this report against the JUnit schema. The `lxml` library is utilized for XML parsing and validation. 

Remember, XML schema validation requires the schema to be accessible. The script tries to directly use the JUnit schema from the given URL which might not work as expected due to restrictions on accessing raw content from GitHub or schema formatting issues. You might need to adjust the schema loading logic to ensure it correctly validates the generated XML report. Consider downloading the schema and referencing it locally if direct URL loading doesn't work.

The script exits with code `0` only if the pytest generated XML report is fully compliant with the JUnit schema without exceptions. Otherwise, it raises an error, prints the stack trace for diagnostic purposes, and exits with code `1`, indicating the presence of the issue.
