        "intended_behavior": "The `_tick_only` method should be modified to handle axes objects that do not support dict-like access for their `axis` attribute. The method must check if the `axis` attribute of the `ax` object supports subscripting and, if not, handle it in a manner appropriate for the object's type (e.g., using a method call instead of dict access). This could involve checking the type of `ax` and applying different logic for `GeoAxes` or other non-standard axes types, ensuring compatibility across different axes implementations. The intended modification should preserve the functionality of toggling tick labels and labels for axes, without causing a `TypeError` when working with axes classes like `GeoAxes`."
