Certainly! Below is a corrected version of the `reproducer.py` file that addresses the problem described in your issue report. This version does not attempt to handle the ImportError directly related to `cartopy` or other modules, assuming that these dependencies are correctly installed in the environment where this script is executed.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import AxesGrid
from cartopy.crs import PlateCarree
from cartopy.mpl.geoaxes import GeoAxes

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    try:
        fig = plt.figure()
        axes_class = (GeoAxes, {'map_projection': PlateCarree()})
        gr = AxesGrid(fig, 111, nrows_ncols=(1, 1), axes_class=axes_class)
    except TypeError as e:
        assert "object is not subscriptable" in str(e), "Different error encountered."
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Unhandled exception encountered.") from e
    else:
        print("The issue could not be reproduced. The expected TypeError did not occur.")
        # The script should exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed or does not occur
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
    # If the script reaches this point without exiting, it suggests the issue was reproduced successfully.
    # However, to reflect that the AssertionError correctly indicates the presence of the bug,
    # we'll not explicitly exit with a non-zero code here, acknowledging successful reproduction.
```

This script aims to explicitly reproduce the `TypeError` detailed in the issue. It tries to create an `AxesGrid` with `GeoAxes` from Cartopy as the `axis_class`. If the `TypeError` mentioning "object is not subscriptable" is encountered, the script captures it and prints a stack trace for debugging purposes. Otherwise, if a different error occurs or no error occurs (indicating the issue doesn't exist or has been fixed), the script will handle these outcomes accordingly, either by asserting unhandled exceptions or confirming the non-existence of the reported issue.

Remember to ensure all dependencies, especially `matplotlib` and `cartopy`, are installed in your environment before running this script. This will prevent errors related to unresolved imports and allow for precise testing of the reported issue.
