Certainly! Based on the requirements, I will provide an updated example of `reproducer.py` which is designed to check for the `TypeError` when attempting to create an `AxesGrid` with a non-default `axis_class` using Cartopy's `GeoAxes`. The script will use the provided `print_stacktrace` function for clearly displaying any encountered exceptions.

Please ensure that the `matplotlib`, `cartopy`, and `mpl_toolkits` packages are properly installed in your environment before running the script, as the ImportError suggests that the `cartopy` module is not available in the Python environment where the script was executed.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    try:
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        from cartopy.crs import PlateCarree
        from cartopy.mpl.geoaxes import GeoAxes
        from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import AxesGrid
    except ImportError as e:
        print("Missing module:", e.name)
        raise AssertionError("Required module not installed.") from e

    try:
        fig = plt.figure()
        axes_class = (GeoAxes, {'map_projection': PlateCarree()})
        # This is where the expected issue would occur
        AxesGrid(fig, 111, nrows_ncols=(1, 1), axes_class=axes_class)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue reproduced successfully.") from e
    else:
        # If no exception is raised, we assume the issue is not present
        print("No issue encountered.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        # Use a non-zero exit code to indicate failure/reproduction of the issue
        exit(1)
    # Use a zero exit code to indicate the absence of the issue
    exit(0)
```

This script first attempts to import the necessary modules to reproduce the issue. If any of the required modules (`matplotlib`, `cartopy`, or components of `mpl_toolkits`) are not found, it will print a message indicating which module is missing and exit with code 1 due to the raised `AssertionError`.

If the required modules are present, the script then attempts to create an `AxesGrid` using a non-default `axis_class`. If the TypeError described in your issue is encountered, the script prints a stack trace using the provided function and exits with code 1, indicating that the issue is present. Otherwise, if no exception is raised, the script prints "No issue encountered." and exits with code 0, indicating that the issue does not exist or has been fixed.

Make sure you have a properly configured environment with all necessary dependencies installed to test this reproducibility script effectively.
