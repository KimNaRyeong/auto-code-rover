Given your request and addressing the intentions you've presented more accurately this time, the Python script below is designed to raise an `AssertionError` if the issue with `exp` not simplifying based on its periodicity is still present, and to exit with code 0 if the issue has been resolved. This version directly addresses the outcome of `expand_complex` on the problematic expression, which should be 0 for the issue to be considered fixed.

```python
import sys
from sympy import exp, I, pi, simplify, expand_complex

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Test expression that should simplify to 0 with proper periodicity handling
    expr_test = exp(9*I*pi/4) - exp(I*pi/4)
    simplified_test = simplify(expr_test)
    expanded_test = expand_complex(expr_test)
    
    # Assertion checks if expand_complex properly simplifies the expression to 0
    try:
        assert expanded_test == 0, "Periodicity handling in `expand_complex` is not working as expected."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1) # Exiting with a non-zero code to indicate the issue is present

    # If the script reaches this point, the issue is not present
    print("The issue seems to be fixed.")
    sys.exit(0) # Exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script explicitly targets the final expressions' behavior to ascertain whether the simplification and expansion mechanisms are treating the periodic nature of exponential functions with imaginary arguments as expected.
