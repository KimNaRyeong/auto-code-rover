Here's a `reproducer.py` script that you can use to reproduce the issue as described. This script calculates `exp(9*I*pi/4)`, tries to simplify it, and checks whether the expression simplifies to `exp(I*pi/4)` taking advantage of the periodicity of the exponential function. It raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, along with a detailed stack trace.

```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    from sympy import exp, I, pi, simplify, expand_complex

    # Case 1: Check if `exp(9*I*pi/4)` automatically simplifies based on its periodicity
    expr = exp(9*I*pi/4)
    simplified_expr = simplify(expr)
    if simplified_expr == expr:
        raise ValueError("Simplification based on periodicity is not happening for `exp(9*I*pi/4)`.")


    # Case 2: Create expression `a`, check its simplification and expansion
    a = exp(9*I*pi/4) - exp(I*pi/4)
    simplified_a = simplify(a)
    expanded_a = expand_complex(a)
    
    # The issue: `expand_complex(a)` should result in 0, taking periodicity into account
    if expanded_a != 0:
        raise ValueError("`expand_complex` does not simplify `a` considering the periodicity.")
    
    # If no exceptions were raised, the issue is presumably fixed
    print("The issue seems to be fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero code to indicate an issue was found
