        "intended_behavior": "The implementation of the `exp` method needs to be enhanced to automatically consider and simplify expressions based on the periodicity of the exponential function, especially for purely imaginary arguments. This means recognizing when the argument is an imaginary number that is equivalent to a multiple of \\(2\\pi i\\) and simplifying the expression accordingly, leveraging Euler's formula. This adjustment should preserve the general handling of `exp` for other types of arguments, ensuring that the functionality remains intact for non-imaginary numbers while enhancing it for imaginary ones."

        "method": "simplify",
        "intended_behavior": "The `simplify` function's logic should be reviewed and possibly expanded to better recognize opportunities to simplify expressions involving the exponential function with imaginary arguments. It should include logic to identify and apply the periodic nature of the exponential function (\\(e^{ix} = e^{ix + 2k\\pi}\\), where \\(k\\) is an integer) during its simplification process. This ensures that expressions that can be reduced based on the periodicity of \\(e^{ix}\\) are indeed simplified, addressing the issue described. The enhancement should be made in a way that integrates smoothly with the existing simplification strategies, ensuring that the function\u2019s ability to simplify a wide range of expressions is not compromised."
