To create a standalone Python file `reproducer.py` that reproduces the issue with `exp` not simplifying based on its periodicity, as well as utilizes the provided function to print stack traces, you can structure the file as follows. This script specifically asserts that the simplification and expansion do not automatically handle the periodicity of the exponent function with a purely imaginary argument as expected. If the issue persists (meaning the `exp` does not simplify as it should), the script will print a detailed stack trace and exit with code 1. If the issue is resolved, it exits with code 0.

```python
import sys
from sympy import exp, I, pi, simplify, expand_complex

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Creating the test expressions
    expr1 = exp(9*I*pi/4)
    expr2 = simplify(exp(9*I*pi/4))
    expr_diff = exp(9*I*pi/4) - exp(I*pi/4)
    simplified_diff = simplify(expr_diff)
    expanded_diff = expand_complex(expr_diff)

    # Checking if the simplification or expansion does not handle periodicity as expected
    try:
        # Asserting that `simplify` does not effectively handle the expression's periodicity
        assert simplify(expr1) == exp(I*pi/4), "Simplification does not handle periodicity correctly."
        # Asserting the difference between expressions simplifies to zero, after expand_complex, indicative of proper periodicity handling
        assert expand_complex(simplified_diff) == 0, "Difference between expressions not simplified to 0."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 indicating issue presence

    print("The issue seems to be fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 if issue fixed

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code intentionally checks for the correct simplification of `exp(9*I*pi/4)` to `exp(I*pi/4)` based on the periodic nature of the exponential function with imaginary arguments. It also asserts that the difference between `exp(9*I*pi/4)` and `exp(I*pi/4)`, when simplified and expanded, yields zero, indicating correct periodicity handling. If these checks fail, it indicates the presence of the issue and prints the relevant error and stack trace.
