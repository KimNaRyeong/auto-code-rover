        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how `plt.sca()`, `fig.subfigures()`, `fig.subplots()`, and how axes are managed within matplotlib's architecture. The traceback explicitly points to a problematic interaction between `plt.sca()` and an object of type 'SubFigure', which seems not to be handled correctly by `plt.figure()` or `plt.sca()` itself. Let's start by gathering more context on these critical pieces:\n\n1. Investigate how `plt.sca()` is implemented and handles its arguments.\n2. Look into `fig.subfigures()` method, to understand how subfigures are created and how they differ from regular figures or subplots.\n3. Since the error mentions a casting issue with `int()` on a 'SubFigure', checking how figures are generally managed in pyplot could also provide insights.\n\nGiven these objectives, the following API calls will be needed:\n\n- `search_method(\"sca\")`: To get an overview of how `plt.sca()` is implemented and any specifics about its argument handling.\n- `search_code(\"fig.subfigures\")`: To understand how subfigures are created using this method, which is not as commonly used or discussed as subplots.\n- `search_method(\"figure\")`: This will help us understand how matplotlib's `figure()` function works, especially in how it manages figure identifiers and possibly subfigures.\n\nLet's execute these API calls to gather the necessary information."
