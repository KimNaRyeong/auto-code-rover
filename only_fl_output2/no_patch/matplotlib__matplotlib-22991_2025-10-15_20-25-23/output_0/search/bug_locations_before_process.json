        "intended_behavior": "The code should correctly handle instances when `ax` is contained within a `SubFigure`, not just a standard `Figure`. Currently, it assumes `ax.figure` can always be directly passed to `figure(ax.figure)`, which fails with `SubFigure` instances due to type errors. The fix should include a check if `ax.figure` is a `SubFigure` instance and handle this case appropriately, possibly by navigating to the parent figure if necessary, without changing the behavior for standard figures."

        "intended_behavior": "This method should be extended or adjusted to correctly recognize and handle `SubFigure` objects. When `num` is a `SubFigure`, instead of attempting (and failing) to convert it to an integer, the method should either navigate to its parent figure or directly manage the `SubFigure` without raising a type error. This change will allow `plt.sca()` to be used with axes that are part of subfigures, aligning with the intended seamless usage between figures and axes across different contexts in Matplotlib."
