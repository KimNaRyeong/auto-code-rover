        "intended_behavior": "The `as_sql` method should ensure that when it constructs SQL queries involving `DecimalField`, the value types are consistently handled, respecting the field's type constraints. Specifically, when wrapping a `DecimalField` value, the SQL generation process should properly cast these values to ensure they are correctly interpreted by SQLite. This preservation requires possibly adjusting how literals are cast within the SQL being generated, ensuring numeric literals are appropriately marked to align with SQLite's type affinity system."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to `ExpressionWrapper`, the `Case` expression's `as_sql` method should be careful with how it constructs SQL queries, particularly when involving `DecimalField`. It must ensure that the case conditions and results involving decimals are correctly cast to preserve the decimal type integrity in the resulting SQL. The intention is to fix the type inconsistency problem, ensuring that CASE expressions involving decimal fields correctly interpret and compare decimal values on SQLite, possibly by explicitly casting field values in the SQL output."

They should be reviewed and possibly adjusted to ensure that decimal values are consistently prepared and cast for SQLite, preventing any type misinterpretation (e.g., treating decimals as integers or strings). The adjustment might involve ensuring that decimals are always passed to SQLite with explicit typing or casting instructions, aligning with the database's handling of numeric types to prevent comparison or annotation issues highlighted in the tests."
