        "intended_behavior": "When creating the pivot datetime object within the `timesince` method, the code should ensure that if the original datetime object (`d`) is timezone-aware (which can occur when Django's `USE_TZ=True`), the pivot datetime object is also created as timezone-aware using the same timezone info (`tzinfo`) from `d`. This adjustment will allow the function to correctly handle the subtraction operation `(now - pivot).total_seconds()` without resulting in a `TypeError` due to attempting to subtract a timezone-aware datetime from a timezone-naive datetime. This change should preserve all existing functionality of the `timesince` method while fixing the bug related to timezone handling. Specifically, the modification will ensure that calculations involving datetime objects more than a month in the past (or any significant time interval requiring the computation of the pivot) are accurately performed regardless of the timezone awareness of the datetime objects."
