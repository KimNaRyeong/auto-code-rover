        "intended_behavior": "This method should be updated or extended to handle cases where `y_true` is a binary relevance list with a single element. The updated behavior could involve adding a condition to check if `y_true` is a single-element list and, if so, treat it as a valid input type for NDCG score calculation. This handling should ensure that users working with binary relevance data can calculate NDCG scores even for single predictions without facing a `ValueError`. This modification should preserve the method's current functionality of ensuring `y_true` is of a correct and expected format for NDCG calculations."

        "method": "ndcg_score",
        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `ndcg_score` function to either preemptively adjust or validate `y_true` inputs that are single-element lists before they are passed to `_check_dcg_target_type`. This could involve a preliminary check for single-element lists and, based on that, either bypassing `_check_dcg_target_type` with a warning or transforming the input in a manner that `_check_dcg_target_type` can process without error. The goal here is to allow `ndcg_score` to compute scores for single-item lists without modification of the core logic that validates input types, thus preserving its existing functionality for all other cases."
