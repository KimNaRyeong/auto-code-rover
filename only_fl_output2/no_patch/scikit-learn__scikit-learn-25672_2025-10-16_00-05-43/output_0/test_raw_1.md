Given the error log you provided, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the request. You're facing an issue related to the environment setup (specifically with `scikit-learn` not being properly installed or built), rather than with the Python code logic itself.

The error message:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sklearn.__check_build._check_build'
...
It seems that scikit-learn has not been built correctly.
```

This indicates that the Python environment you're using to execute the script does not have a properly installed version of `scikit-learn`. However, assuming this issue is fixed and focusing on the original task of creating a standalone Python file (`reproducer.py`) to reproduce an issue with NDCG scores, let's correct the task and ignore the environment setup error.

Below is how you could structure `reproducer.py` according to your original instructions, without taking the environment setup error into account:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def ndcg_single_element_issue():
    from sklearn.metrics import ndcg_score

    y_true = [[1]]
    y_pred = [[0]]
    try:
        score = ndcg_score(y_true, y_pred)
        # Since this issue is expected to raise an error, if execution gets to this point, the expected behavior did not occur.
        raise AssertionError("ndcg_score did not raise an error for a list with a single element when it should.")
    except ValueError as e:
        print("Caught expected exception")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(0)  # Successfully caught the expected exception, exit with code 0.
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected exception occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise  # Reraise the unexpected exception

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ndcg_single_element_issue()
```

To fix the environment error you're encountering:

- Ensure you've correctly installed `scikit-learn`. If you're working in a virtual environment (which is recommended), make sure it's activated.
- You can install `scikit-learn` using pip: `pip install scikit-learn` or if you prefer conda: `conda install scikit-learn`.
- After installation, try running your script again.

Remember, the Python script above assumes that `scikit-learn` is properly installed and focuses solely on reproducing the stated issue with NDCG scores calculations.
