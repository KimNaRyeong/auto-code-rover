1632 def ndcg_score(y_true, y_score, *, k=None, sample_weight=None, ignore_ties=False):
1633     """Compute Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain.
1634 
1635     Sum the true scores ranked in the order induced by the predicted scores,

1637     score (Ideal DCG, obtained for a perfect ranking) to obtain a score between

1639 
1640     This ranking metric returns a high value if true labels are ranked high by
1641     ``y_score``.
1642 
1643     Parameters
1644     ----------
1645     y_true : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_labels)
1646         True targets of multilabel classification, or true scores of entities
1647         to be ranked. Negative values in `y_true` may result in an output
1648         that is not between 0 and 1.
1649 
1650         .. versionchanged:: 1.2
1651             These negative values are deprecated, and will raise an error in v1.4.
1652 
1653     y_score : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_labels)
1654         Target scores, can either be probability estimates, confidence values,
1655         or non-thresholded measure of decisions (as returned by
1656         "decision_function" on some classifiers).
1657 
1658     k : int, default=None
1659         Only consider the highest k scores in the ranking. If `None`, use all
1660         outputs.
1661 
1662     sample_weight : array-like of shape (n_samples,), default=None
1663         Sample weights. If `None`, all samples are given the same weight.
1664 
1665     ignore_ties : bool, default=False
1666         Assume that there are no ties in y_score (which is likely to be the
1667         case if y_score is continuous) for efficiency gains.
1668 
1669     Returns
1670     -------
1671     normalized_discounted_cumulative_gain : float in [0., 1.]
1672         The averaged NDCG scores for all samples.

</code><intended_behavior>Modify the `ndcg_score` function to either preemptively adjust or validate `y_true` inputs that are single-element lists before they are passed to `_check_dcg_target_type`. This could involve a preliminary check for single-element lists and, based on that, either bypassing `_check_dcg_target_type` with a warning or transforming the input in a manner that `_check_dcg_target_type` can process without error. The goal here is to allow `ndcg_score` to compute scores for single-item lists without modification of the core logic that validates input types, thus preserving its existing functionality for all other cases.</intended_behavior>]
