        "intended_behavior": "The `assert` statement at the beginning of the `change_aliases` method needs a reassessment to prevent the `AssertionError` during queryset operations, specifically in complex `OR` scenarios. The revised behavior should include a validation mechanism that avoids alias overlap while ensuring that change mappings are unique and non-intersecting. This might involve adjusting how aliases are generated or updated, to ensure they account for the entire context of both `lhs` and `rhs` querysets in a `combine` operation. A potential approach could be to more intelligently increment or modify new aliases, considering the cumulative alias map of both combined queries, rather than treating them in isolation."

        "method": "combine",
        "intended_behavior": "During the combination of `lhs` and `rhs` querysets, especially with an `OR` connector, the method needs to more robustly handle the alias mapping and changes, particularly ensuring that no conflicts arise that could trigger the assertion in `change_aliases`. This may require an enhanced logic for determining when and how to reuse joins (and their aliases) or creating new aliases in ways that prevent overlap, taking into consideration the complete alias maps of both `lhs` and `rhs` queries. An enhancement could involve a more comprehensive tracking or relabeling of aliases used in both queries, ensuring that they remain unique and consistent across the combined query."
