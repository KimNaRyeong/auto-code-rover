In pure Docutils, they are renderer properly according with RST spec.\n**To Reproduce**\nThe following snippet demonstrantes buggy rendering.\n```\nTwo \\\\\nThree \\\\\\\nFour \\\\\\\\\nFive \\\\\\\\\\\nSix \\\\\\\\\\\\\n```\n**Expected behavior**\nTwo backslashes should be rendered as `\\`. Three still as `\\`. Four and five as `\\\\`. Six as `\\\\\\` and so on. This is how it works in Docutils.\n**Screenshots**\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/383059/80948942-5cb29c00-8df3-11ea-8fe9-ca4bc390eef9.png)\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Linux\n- Python version: 3.6\n- Sphinx version: 3.0.2\n- Sphinx extensions:  none\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to locate where Sphinx handles backslashes in reStructuredText (RST) files. The problem seems to concern the text rendering process, likely where Sphinx parses or encodes RST content. Given the specifics of the issue, we might start by exploring classes and methods related to RST parsing or rendering. Considering Sphinx's architecture, it may involve specific classes for document parsing or a text processing module.\n\nFirst, let's focus on finding relevant classes or methods that handle RST content or specifically deal with escaping characters such as backslashes. This step involves searching for classes or methods that might be named or related to parsing, rendering, or text processing.\n\n1. **Locate the RST content processing area**:\n   - We can start by searching for classes or methods related to document rendering or parsing. Sphinx uses docutils for parsing reStructuredText, but the issue seems to Sphinx's handling, making it Sphinx-specific logic we're after.\n   \nHere are the API calls we might start with to locate the relevant code:\n- `search_class('RSTParser')`\n- `search_class('TextRenderer')`\n- `search_method('render')`\n- `search_method('parse')`\n\n2. **Directly find where backslashes might be handled**:\n   - Since the issue is specifically with how backslashes are rendered, we can search directly for code snippets that might be related to handling or escaping backslashes.\n\nPotential API calls to find backslash handling:\n- `search_code('\\\\')`\n\nThese searches will provide us with code locations relevant to parsing and rendering text content, specifically where backslashes are handled or could be erroneously processed. The results will help us narrow down the exact locations to investigate further and understand how Sphinx is deviating from the expected Docutils behavior regarding backslash rendering."
