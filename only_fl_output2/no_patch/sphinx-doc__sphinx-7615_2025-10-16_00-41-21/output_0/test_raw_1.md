Given the feedback and the requirement to ensure all dependencies like `docutils` and `sphinx` are correctly handled, you might need to automate the setup process within the script itself. This updated version of `reproducer.py` attempts to install necessary packages if they're missing and then reproduces the issue as detailed.

Please note, this script now attempts to install Sphinx and Docutils before trying to reproduce the issue. Make sure that you run this script in a virtual environment to prevent unwanted changes to your Python environment.

```python
import subprocess
import sys
import os
import shutil

def install(package):
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", package])

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def ensure_dependencies():
    try:
        import sphinx
        import docutils
    except ImportError:
        print("Installing missing dependencies: Sphinx and Docutils")
        install("sphinx")
        install("docutils")

    if os.path.exists(build_dir):
        shutil.rmtree(build_dir)
    if os.path.exists(source_dir):
        shutil.rmtree(source_dir)

    os.makedirs(source_dir)

    with open(os.path.join(source_dir, "conf.py"), "w") as conf:
        conf.write("extensions = []\n")
        conf.write("master_doc = 'index'\n")

    with open(os.path.join(source_dir, "index.rst"), "w") as index:
        index.write("""

def build_sphinx():
    from sphinx.application import Sphinx
    app = Sphinx(
        srcdir="source",
        confdir="source",
        outdir="build",
        doctreedir="build/doctree",
        buildername="html"
    )
    app.build(force_all=True)

    ]
    with open(os.path.join("build", "index.html"), "r") as output_file:
        content = output_file.read()
        for expected in expected_substrings:
            if expected not in content:
                raise AssertionError("Sphinx did not render backslashes as expected.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        ensure_dependencies()
        setup_sphinx_environment()
        build_sphinx()
        verify_output()
        print("Sphinx renders backslashes correctly. Issue is fixed.")
    except Exception as e:

```

This script first checks for the presence of Sphinx and Docutils; if they are missing, it attempts to install them. The Sphinx environment setup, build process, and verification steps follow the logic outlined in the initial scenario to identify whether the issue persists.

Always run such scripts in a controlled environment, such as a virtual environment, to avoid potential conflicts or issues with your global Python installation.
