To create a minimal environment for reproducing the Sphinx issue mentioned, you'll need a file named `reproducer.py`. This script will set up a minimal Sphinx project, generate the documentation, and verify the output against the expected rendering of backslashes as specified. When the issue is present, it should raise an AssertionError and print a detailed stack trace. Conversely, if Sphinx renders the backslashes correctly, the script will acknowledge the fix and exit with code 0.

```python
import os
from sphinx.application import Sphinx
import shutil

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

This script performs the following steps:
1. Sets up a minimal Sphinx environment with a `conf.py` and an `index.rst` file containing the content likely to exhibit the problematic rendering.
2. Builds the documentation into HTML format.
3. Checks the generated HTML file for the expected sequence of backslashes in the output.
4. If the output does not match expectations (demonstrating the issue), it raises an `AssertionError` and prints the stack trace; if it matches, it concludes that the issue is fixed.

To use this script:
1. Ensure you have Sphinx installed in your environment (`pip install Sphinx`).
2. Place the script at the root directory of a new or existing Sphinx project or in an isolated environment to avoid conflicts with existing Sphinx setups.
3. Execute the script with `python3 reproducer.py`.
