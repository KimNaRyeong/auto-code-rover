When rendering the LambertW function in LaTeX format, especially when it's raised to a power, the method needs to correctly incorporate the exponent into its output. This could involve adjusting the LaTeX string formatting to include the power or simply passing the exponent to another method capable of handling it. The modification must ensure that expressions like `LambertW(x)**n` are correctly converted into LaTeX, preserving the general capability to render expressions in LaTeX format without interruption."

        "intended_behavior": "The current behavior seems to pass on an 'exp' argument in situations not expected by the methods handling the base function (like `_print_LambertW`). If modification of `_print_LambertW` alone isn't sufficient, this method may require adjustments to correctly handle power expressions involving functions like `LambertW`. Specifically, the method should ensure that when it calls another print method (like `_print_LambertW`), it does so in a manner consistent with the expected arguments of the target method. If necessary, it should implement a fallback strategy for handling exponentiation without passing unexpected arguments, thus ensuring error-free LaTeX rendering of power expressions."
