        "intended_behavior": "The `map` method should be capable of gracefully handling the `hue` parameter, especially when it contains categorical data. This means ensuring that when plotting functions such as `sns.scatterplot` or `sns.regplot` are mapped, the method correctly pre-processes the `hue` data, potentially by validating and transforming it into a format that these plotting functions can handle without error. This may involve adjusting how the `hue` data is passed to the underlying plotting functions or adding a preprocessing step within `PairGrid` to handle categorical hues properly. The solution should preserve the functionality of being able to use `hue` for different types of data without causing errors."

        "intended_behavior": "The `_lookup_single` method, which is involved in processing `hue` values, should correctly handle cases where `hue` is categorical. This includes ensuring that it does not throw a `TypeError` when encountering non-numeric data. The method might need to be adjusted to provide a clear error message or handle categorical data gracefully by either skipping the normalization process for non-numeric data or by implementing a categorization process that safely manages the data types involved. This adjustment will ensure that seaborn can process both categorical and numeric data as `hue` without encountering the described error."
