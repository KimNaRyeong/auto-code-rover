Certainly! Based on your requirements, here is an updated standalone python file named `reproducer.py`. This script should be executed as directed, to reproduce the specific seaborn issue related to the `PairGrid` function. The script now includes error handling that matches your specifications, and it will print a detailed stack trace if the issue is not fixed in the environment where it runs.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import seaborn as sns

    try:
        # Attempt to reproduce the issue.
        iris = sns.load_dataset("iris")
        g = sns.PairGrid(iris, y_vars=["sepal_length", "sepal_width"], x_vars=["petal_length", "petal_width"])
        g.map(sns.scatterplot, hue=iris["species"])
        g.map(sns.regplot, scatter=False)
        
        # If the code above did not raise an exception, the issue is presumed fixed.
        print("Issue does not reproduce with the current environment.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        # If an error occurs, print the stack trace and raise AssertionError.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue reproduced successfully.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate the script ran into the assertion error regarding the issue presence.
```

Ensure to run this file in an environment where the seaborn library and its dependencies are properly installed. The script checks for the issue using the seaborn functionality as described, and it follows your directives for error handling, including the provision of a detailed stack trace and appropriate exit codes.
