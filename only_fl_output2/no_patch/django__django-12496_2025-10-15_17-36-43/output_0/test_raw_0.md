Certainly! Here's a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue as described. The script uses Django ORM to create models that demonstrate the behavior when a custom primary key is used in a multi-table inheritance scenario. It tracks the number of SQL queries to assert the unexpected behavior and prints a stack trace if the issue is present.

```python
import os
import sys
import uuid
from contextlib import contextmanager
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models, connections, DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS
from django.db.backends.signals import connection_created

@contextmanager
def track_queries(using=None):
    using = using or DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS
    connection = connections[using]
    initial_queries = len(connection.queries)
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        final_queries = len(connection.queries)
        print(f"Total queries: {final_queries - initial_queries}")

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Setting up Django (minimal configuration)
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=['__main__'],
    USE_TZ=True,
)

models.signals.post_migrate.connect(lambda *args, **kwargs: None)

# Model definitions
class Parent(models.Model):
    id = models.UUIDField(
        primary_key=True,
        default=uuid.uuid4,
        editable=False
    )
    title = models.TextField()

class Child(Parent):
    body = models.TextField()

# Main section
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        # Set up Django environment
        models.Model.check = classmethod(lambda self, **kwargs: None)  # Disable system check for standalone script
        models.Model.__module__ = "__main__"
        from django.core.management import call_command
        call_command('makemigrations', '__main__', interactive=False)
        call_command('migrate', interactive=False)

        with track_queries() as tq:
            # Create a new Child instance
            Child.objects.create()

        # Assertion logic here (Adjust the number according to observed incorrect behavior)
        # The expected number of queries is to assert against the incorrect behavior of multiple queries where there should be fewer.
        connection = connections[DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS]
        num_queries = len(connection.queries)

        # In a correct implementation, we'd expect only inserts, but due to the bug we see an update followed by insert for the parent
        assert num_queries <= 3, "Extra queries detected due to incorrect behavior!"

    except AssertionError:
        print_stacktrace(sys.exc_info()[1])
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate error due to assertion failure
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate error

    print("Issue not present, exited with code 0.")
    sys.exit(0)
```

Note that this script sets up a minimal Django environment programmatically within the script itself, creates the models, and then performs the operations that are expected to reproduce the issue according to the description provided. If the issue is present, it asserts due to an unexpected number of queries and prints a detailed stack trace of the issue.

Additional adjustments might be needed based on your specific Django project or environment setup.
