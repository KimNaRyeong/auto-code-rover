To address the raised issue, an updated standalone Python script `reproducer.py` will be structured to more accurately replicate the described Django model inheritance issue, along with improvements to handle Django's setup requirements and a constructed context manager to monitor SQL queries. This script will initialize Django within a simple application configuration to ensure correctness and will feature custom primary key usage in the model definition. Please ensure you have Django installed in your environment to run this script.

```python
import os
import sys
import uuid
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models, connection
from django.core.management.commands import migrate

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class QueryCounter:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.initial = len(connection.queries)
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.final = len(connection.queries)
        self.count = self.final - self.initial

def setup_django_env():
    settings.configure(
        DATABASES={
            "default": {
                "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
                "NAME": ":memory:",
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=("__main__",),
        USE_TZ=True,
    )
    django.setup()

    # Apply migrations to in-memory database
    command = migrate.Command()
    command.execute(interactive=False)

class Parent(models.Model):
    id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)
    title = models.TextField()

    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'

class Child(Parent):
    body = models.TextField()

    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    setup_django_env()

    try:
        with QueryCounter() as qc:
            Child.objects.create()

        if qc.count > 3:  # Assuming correct behavior shouldn't exceed 3 queries
            raise AssertionError(f"Too many SQL queries: {qc.count}")

    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
        
    print("Issue not present or fixed, exited with code 0.")
    sys.exit(0)
```

This script integrates several key components to reproduce and diagnose the issue:
- **Django Settings Configuration**: The `setup_django_env` function initializes Django with a minimal in-memory SQLite database for simplicity, compatible with running as a standalone script.
- **Models Definition**: Both parent and child models are defined, with the parent model using a `UUIDField` as its custom primary key.
- **Query Monitoring**: The `QueryCounter` context manager is designed to track the number of queries executed within its block, checking for excessive queries indicative of the problem.
- **Error Handling and Reporting**: Utilizes the given `print_stacktrace` function for clearer error reporting.

To use this script, ensure Django is installed in your environment (e.g., `pip install Django`) and run it with Python 3. Adjustments might be necessary for compatibility with different Django versions or detailed testing setups.
