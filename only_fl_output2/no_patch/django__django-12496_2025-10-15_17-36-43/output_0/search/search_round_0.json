This situation occurs *only* if we define a custom primary key in a parent model (eg. as an UUID field).\nAn example *without* custom primary key (correct behavior):\nclass Parent(models.Model):\ntitle = models.TextField()\nclass Child(Parent):\nbody = models.TextField()\n>> Child.objects.create()\n1. INSERT INTO \"app_parent\" (\"title\") VALUES ('') RETURNING \"app_parent\".\"id\"\n2. INSERT INTO \"app_child\" (\"parent_ptr_id\", \"body\") VALUES (1, '')\nAn example *with* custom primary key (incorrect behavior):\nclass Parent(models.Model):\nid = models.UUIDField(\nprimary_key=True,\ndefault=uuid.uuid4,\neditable=False\n)\ntitle = models.TextField()\nclass Child(Parent):\nbody = models.TextField()\n>> Child.objects.create()\n1. UPDATE \"app_parent\" SET \"title\" = '' WHERE \"app_parent\".\"id\" = 'd750cfdd-ae7b-48a6-a2e0-d49e70e28686'::uuid\n2. INSERT INTO \"app_parent\" (\"id\", \"title\") VALUES ('d750cfdd-ae7b-48a6-a2e0-d49e70e28686'::uuid, '')\n3. INSERT INTO \"app_child\" (\"parent_ptr_id\", \"body\") VALUES ('d750cfdd-ae7b-48a6-a2e0-d49e70e28686'::uuid, '')\nPython 3.6, PostgreSQL 9.6\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about the implementation details of the models involved and any custom save methods or signals that might be affecting the object creation process. Given the information provided in the issue, here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. **search_class** with `class_name` as `\"Parent\"`. This call is aimed at getting an overview of the `Parent` model, focusing on how the custom primary key is defined and any related model metadata.\n   \n2. **search_class** with `class_name` as `\"Child\"`. This call is to understand the `Child` model's structure, specifically looking for any custom methods or overrides that might influence the object creation process leading to the additional query.\n\n3. **search_method_in_class** with `method_name` as `\"save\"` and `class_name` as `\"Parent\"`. This call is to check if there's a custom `save` method in the `Parent` class that could be related to the issue.\n\n4. **search_method_in_class** with `method_name` as `\"save\"` and `class_name` as `\"Child\"`. Since the issue appears during object creation, examining any custom `save` methods in the `Child` class is crucial.\n\n5. **search_code** with `code_str` as `\"class Parent(models.Model)\"`. This call aims to find all occurrences of the `Parent` model definition to ensure we're not missing any alternative definitions or extra inheritance that could affect behavior.\n\n6. **search_code** with `code_str` as `\"class Child(Parent)\"`. Similar to the previous call, this is to catch all instances where `Child` inherits from `Parent`, which could include abstract models or other forms of inheritance not immediately visible.\n\nThrough these calls, we plan to get a comprehensive view of how the models are constructed, any custom logic that could be leading to the extra update query, and whether Django signals or other mechanisms are at play here."
