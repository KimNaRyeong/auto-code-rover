INSERT INTO \"app_parent\" (\"title\") VALUES ('') RETURNING \"app_parent\".\"id\"\n2.

Here are some revised API calls:\n\n1. **search_code** with `code_str` as `\"models.UUIDField\"`. This could help locate models with a custom primary key, particularly those using an UUID which was mentioned in the issue. This way, we might indirectly find the `Parent` model or similar models with custom primary keys that could provide insight into the issue.\n\n2. **search_code** with `code_str` as `\"models.Model\"`. This broader search might reveal how models are typically defined in the project, giving us clues about special base classes, mixins, or abstract models that aren't directly named `Parent` or `Child`.\n\n3. **search_method** with `method_name` as `\"save\"`. By looking at custom implementations of the `save` method throughout the project, we could find explanations for the unexpected behavior during object creation. It\u2019s a shot in the dark but could reveal patterns or common practices in the codebase that relate to the issue.\n\n4. **search_code** with `code_str` as `\"multi-inheritance\"`. While it's a long shot because \"multi-inheritance\" is not a typical code string, there might be documentation strings or comments in the code that discuss multi-inheritance or related setups. This could help us locate the models or mechanisms in use that aren't being directly caught through class names.\n\nThese revised API calls are designed to cast a wider net in the search for relevant code, given the initial direct searches did not return any results.

This might involve adjusting the model instantiation process, perhaps overriding the save method to better handle the creation of related model instances when dealing with custom primary keys.\n\n- **Potential Bug Location 2:** \n  - **File:** Similar to above, any file related to the `Child` model or models exhibiting the multi-inheritance pattern described.\n  - **Class:** The `Child` class or its equivalent which demonstrates the issue upon creation.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Modify the object creation process to tie the child creation directly with the parent record initialization in a single transaction without unnecessary updates. This could potentially involve custom model saving logic or using Django signals to manage the creation process more efficiently.\n\nDue to the lack of specific code and structure information, these locations and intended behaviors are speculative. The actual implementation might differ based on project-specific details such as custom model managers, signals, or save method overrides already in place. The resolution would aim to eliminate the extra UPDATE query by ensuring that the parent model\u2019s fields are correctly set during the initial INSERT phase, possibly by adjusting the save method or the model's inheritance and creation strategy."

        "content": "Analyzing the context provided by the search results, we can derive some insights relevant to the reported issue about Django model inheritance and the unexpected behavior when using a custom UUID primary key. \n\n### Analysis of the Search Results:\n\n1. **models.UUIDField References**\n\n   The references found in `django/contrib/gis/utils/layermapping.py` and `django/contrib/admin/options.py` show how `models.UUIDField` is recognized and handled differently in Django utilities and admin widgets. These snippets don't directly impact the reported issue but illustrate the widespread usage and support for `UUIDField` within Django's ecosystem, implying that custom UUID primary keys should seamlessly integrate with different components of the framework.\n\n2. **models.Model Usage**\n\n   The extensive list of files containing `models.Model` shows its foundational role in Django. Various subsystems, including migrations, serializations, admin, auth, and GIS, all extend `models.Model` to define the structure of data. This ubiquity confirms the standard method of creating and manipulating models within Django. However, none of these snippets were directly related to the inheritance issue described.\n\n3. **\"save\" Methods Found**\n\n   The significant number of `save` methods found across multiple Django components and applications (e.g., forms, sessions, auth) highlights the central role of this method in model lifecycle management. Given the problem involves an extra database update operation when creating `Child` instances, investigating the custom `save` methods within the project (especially in `django/db/models/base.py`) could reveal overrides or signal handlers that inadvertently trigger additional queries. The `save` method's behavior in the context of model inheritance, particularly with custom primary keys, could be a crucial factor in the observed issue.\n\n4. **Multi-Inheritance Check in Model Base**\n\n   The snippet from `django/db/models/base.py` discussing multi-inheritance and field name shadowing reveals Django's internal checks to ensure model inheritance does not lead to conflicting field names. This part is directly relevant to the issue as it deals with inheritance mechanics. While this doesn't directly solve the problem, it indicates the complexity of handling model inheritance in Django and suggests that the framework attempts to manage potential conflicts which could inadvertently contribute to or mitigate issues like the one reported.\n\n### Proposed Next Steps Based on Analysis:\n\nGiven the collected context:\n\n- **Investigate `django/db/models/base.py`:** Especially relevant sections dealing with model field management and the `save` method in the context of model inheritance. Understanding how Django's ORM handles the creation and updates of model instances in inheritance hierarchies, particularly with custom primary keys like `UUIDField`, may offer insights into the root cause of the additional update operation.\n  \n- **Examine Custom Save Methods and Signal Handlers:** In the project-specific code, if any, to see if they're contributing to the extra query. This action wasn't directly informed by the search results but is a logical step given the nature of the issue and the known behavior of Django models.\n\n- **Check Django's Handling of UUID Primary Keys:** Specifically in relation to model inheritance. While the search results did not directly address the interaction between custom primary keys and model inheritance, they highlighted areas where custom primary keys are explicitly accommodated. This suggests a potential avenue for further investigation, particularly looking at how these implementations might differ when models are part of an inheritance chain.\n\nIn conclusion, while the search results did not pinpoint a direct cause or location of the bug, they guide towards areas of the Django framework and project codebase that warrant closer inspection to understand and address the reported issue."

Thus, I leave this section technically empty as per instructions as we've exhausted the logical API calls given the initial failure to locate the models directly.\n\n2. **Where are bug locations:**\n\nAlthough unable to specify exact files and classes due to the lack of direct hits in the search results, we can theorize the general nature and location of where the issues might arise:\n\n- **General Bug Location:** \n  - **File:** Likely in the file(s) where the models (that act as parent and child in the inheritance chain) are defined. This would be where `Parent` and `Child` models are located, noting that these names might be placeholders or indicative of their roles rather than their actual names.\n  - **Class:** `Parent` class with a UUIDField as a primary key; `Child` class inheriting from `Parent`.\n  - **Method:** The `save` method, especially overridden ones or those in classes impacting the `Parent` and `Child` models' creation and save process.\n\n- **Intended Behavior:** \n  - Ensure that during the creation of a `Child` instance, the `Parent` instance is properly initiated with all necessary fields to prevent an extra UPDATE call. This could involve adjusting the save process to fully leverage Django's ORM capabilities for handling inheritance and primary keys \u2013 particularly, ensuring the `Child` creation process correctly links to the `Parent` without needing to revisit the `Parent` for updates.\n  - The ORM's handling of model instance creation involving multi-table inheritance and custom primary keys might need specific attention. Ideally, the process should involve a single transaction where the `Parent` is created alongside the `Child` without needing a revisiting update step to align fields, fully preserving the integrity and efficiency of the database operations.\n\nDue to the lack of direct details on the specific models and the necessary code adjustments, these locations and behaviors are hypothesized. Fixing the issue would hinge on ensuring that Django's model inheritance and object lifecycle management processes are properly coordinated to avoid redundant and performance-degrading database operations."
