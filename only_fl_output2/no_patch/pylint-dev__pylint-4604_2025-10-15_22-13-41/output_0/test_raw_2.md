Given your requirement and the need to accurately reproduce the pylint issue about an unused-import false positive for a module used in a type comment, I'll provide a standalone Python script, `reproducer.py`. This script will programmatically create a temporary Python file containing the code that triggers the pylint issue. Then, it will run pylint on this file to check for the specific false positive. If the issue is detected (i.e., pylint incorrectly reports an unused import), the script will raise an `AssertionError`. If the issue does not occur (meaning the pylint behavior is as expected), the script exits normally with code 0.

```python
import subprocess
import tempfile
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

code_to_test = """\"\"\"Docstring.\"\"\"

import abc
from abc import ABC

X = ...  # type: abc.ABC
Y = ...  # type: ABC
"""

def test_pylint_code():
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=".py", delete=False) as tmpfile:
        tmpfile.write(code_to_test.encode('utf-8'))
        tmpfile_path = tmpfile.name

    try:
        # Check pylint version and presence
        pylint_version = subprocess.check_output(['pylint', '--version'], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, text=True)
        print(f"Using pylint version:\n{pylint_version}")

        # Run pylint on the temporary file
        pylint_output = subprocess.check_output(['pylint', tmpfile_path], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, text=True)
        print(f"pylint output:\n{pylint_output}")

        if 'unused-import' in pylint_output and ('import abc' in pylint_output or 'from abc import ABC' in pylint_output):
            raise AssertionError("Unused import false positive detected for module used in type comment.")

    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Command '{e.cmd}' returned non-zero exit status {e.returncode}. Output:\n{e.output}")
        raise
    finally:
        os.remove(tmpfile_path)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        test_pylint_code()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Exit with non-zero code to indicate an error (assertion failed)
        sys.exit(1)
    # Exit with 0 to indicate success (no error)
    sys.exit(0)
```

Make sure to have pylint installed in the environment where this script will be executed. This script does the following:

- Creates a temporary Python file with problematic code that should cause pylint to emit an unused-import warning.
- Runs pylint on this temporary file.
- Checks if pylint's output contains the expected false positive about unused imports.
- If the expected false positive is found, it raises an `AssertionError`, and the stack trace of the issue is printed.
- Cleans up the temporary file afterwards.

This script should be executed in an environment where `pylint` is installed and accessible. If pylint is not found, execution of the script will fail, indicating that the necessary dependencies are not correctly set up in your environment.
