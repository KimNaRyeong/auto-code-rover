But the first connection will not be closed by browser for very long time.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to comprehend how the Django development server (`runserver`) handles incoming connections, especially when the `--nothreading` option is utilized. The problem description suggests a failure to properly close connections with `Connection: keep-alive` headers when threading is disabled, causing subsequent connections to hang due to the server's inability to accept new connections. \n\nHere's a plan to gather more context and potentially pinpoint the problematic areas in the Django codebase:\n\n1. **Identify where `runserver` is implemented:** Since `runserver` is a management command in Django, we should locate its implementation. This will likely be in a file related to Django's command management system or specifically within the development server code.\n\n2. **Understand how `--nothreading` is handled:** Once we find where `runserver` is implemented, we need to understand how the `--nothreading` option is processed and how it affects the server's behavior regarding threading and connection handling.\n\n3. **Investigate connection handling:** Given the issue is with connection persistence (`Connection: keep-alive`), we need to inspect how connections are accepted, managed, and closed, particularly under the `--nothreading` mode.\n\n4. **Locate the WSGI server implementation:** Django's development server uses WSGI to serve requests. The issue revolves around how the WSGI server handles connections, especially with keep-alive. Locating the WSGI server code will be critical.\n\nBased on this plan, the following API requests seem pertinent to gather the necessary code context:\n\n- `search_code(\"runserver --nothreading\")`: To find references or handling of the `--nothreading` option within the context of the `runserver` command.\n- `search_method(\"handle\")`: Since Django command classes typically implement a `handle` method where the command's logic resides, this search might yield results showing how `runserver` handles its arguments, including `--nothreading`.\n- `search_class(\"WSGIServer\")`: If we assume that Django's development server is utilizing a class (likely named or similar to `WSGIServer`) for the actual web server logic, we should try to find this class to inspect how connections are handled.\n\nThese searches are designed to provide a broad overview of the areas in Django's codebase that are likely involved in the reported issue. Once we identify the relevant pieces of the code, we can narrow down our search further if necessary."
