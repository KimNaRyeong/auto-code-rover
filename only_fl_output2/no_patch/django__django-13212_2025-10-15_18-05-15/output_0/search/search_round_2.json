        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides several insights into the structure and implementation of validators and error handling within the Django framework, particularly in relation to the issue at hand.\n\n### ValidationError Class\nThe `ValidationError` class in `django/core/exceptions.py` is crucial for understanding how Django reports errors during data validation processes. This class is a subclass of Python's built-in `Exception`, designed to carry error messages, including codes and params which can be used for formatting messages programmatically.\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n- The `ValidationError` class encapsulates information about an error in the form of a message, an optional error code, and additional parameters for message formatting.\n- It provides methods to access error messages in various formats (e.g., dictionary and list formats) and to integrate with Django's form and model field validation mechanism.\n\n**Relationship to the Bug**\n- Given the issue description aims to enhance error reporting by including the offending value in the error message, the `ValidationError`'s capability to accept and format messages using parameters (via the `params` argument in its constructor) is directly relevant.\n- The current implementation supports parameterized error messages, but it seems validators might not be utilizing this feature to include input values in errors.\n\n**Intended Behavior**\n- The intended behavior would involve modifying how validators instantiate `ValidationError` to include the value causing validation to fail as part of the error messages. This entails passing the failing value to the `ValidationError` constructor in a manner that allows for dynamic insertion into the error string.\n\n### Validators in Django Codebase\nThe search for \"validators\" returned numerous results across various Django components, indicating that validation is a widespread concern affecting forms, models, and specific fields, including contributions from third-party apps like `postgres`.\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n- Validators are functions or callable objects used throughout Django to enforce database integrity and to validate user input against specified rules or criteria.\n\n**Relationship to the Bug**\n- Built-in validators are the functions or methods likely responsible for raising `ValidationError`s without explicitly including the provided (invalid) value in the error messages.\n- The specific files with a high concentration of matches (`django/forms/fields.py`, `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, and `django/contrib/auth/password_validation.py`) are potential key areas where modifications might be needed to resolve the issue.\n\n**Intended Behavior**\n- Validators should be modified to raise `ValidationError`s that include the failing value in their messages, enabling more informative and context-rich error reporting.\n\nGiven these analyses, the next steps should focus on:\n1. Inspecting how validators currently raise `ValidationError`s, particularly whether and how they pass additional context (like invalid values) to the error messages.\n2. Understanding the instantiation and usage pattern of `ValidationError` in high-priority files like those under `django/forms/fields.py` and `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` since they contain a significant number of references to validators.\n\nTo gain deeper insights, specific API calls that can be useful include:\n- `search_code_in_file(\"ValidationError\", \"django/forms/fields.py\")` to see how `ValidationError` is raised with error messages in form field validations.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"ValidationError\", \"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\")` to understand the usage pattern in model field validations.\n- Further exploration into how parameters are currently passed to `ValidationError` across various validators, specifically whether the invalid value is already available or needs to be explicitly included."

        "content": "The search results offer a precise glimpse into where `ValidationError` is predominantly raised within Django's form and model field validation mechanisms. Let's analyze these findings in relation to the initial issue description.\n\n### django/forms/fields.py Analysis\nIn `django/forms/fields.py`, `ValidationError` is utilized across several methods, notably in `validate`, `run_validators`, `clean`, `to_python`, and `_coerce`. Each of these methods plays a crucial role in ensuring that data submitted via forms adheres to the specified constraints and transformations necessary for correctness.\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n- **validate**: Ensures the input meets field-specific conditions.\n- **run_validators**: Executes field-associated validators that check for conformance to specified rules.\n- **clean**: Processes and validates input data, converting it to a Python-compatible type if necessary.\n- **to_python**: Converts the input data to a Python datatype.\n- **_coerce**: An internal method for type coercion, often used within specialized field logic.\n\n**Relationship to the Bug**\n- Each method mentioned might raise `ValidationError` without including the offending input value that caused the error, leading to less-informative error messages. This is directly related to the issue, which seeks to modify the raising of `ValidationError` to include the failed input value for more clarity.\n\n**Intended Behavior**\n- Enhance these methods to ensure `ValidationError` includes the input value within the error message. This could involve modifying the instantiation of `ValidationError` to include the value directly in the error message or through the `params` argument for dynamic message formatting. The modification must preserve existing validation logic while augmenting error reporting.\n\n### django/db/models/fields/__init__.py Analysis\nSimilar to form fields, model fields also use `ValidationError` extensively in `to_python`, `run_validators`, `validate`, and `get_prep_value` to enforce data integrity at the model level.\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n- **to_python**: Similar to its form counterpart, it ensures data is converted to a suitable Python type.\n- **run_validators**: Runs any attached validators on model fields to ensure input data conforms to defined rules.\n- **validate**: Provides additional field-specific validation outside the standard validator framework.\n- **get_prep_value**: Prepares a field's value for insertion into the database, which can involve type conversions and validation.\n\n**Relationship to the Bug**\n- As with form fields, the lack of input value reporting within `ValidationError`s limits the usefulness of error feedback. The enhancement aimed at enriching error messages with input values has similar implications here, aiming to inform about the exact failing input.\n\n**Intended Behavior**\n- The intended behavior entails modifications to these model field methods to include the offending value when `ValidationError` is raised, similar to the intended modifications for form fields. This involves careful inclusion of the input value in the error messages while maintaining the integrity of data conversion and validation processes.\n\nBy incorporating these enhancements across both form and model field validations, the changes would address the core issue, making Django's validation errors more informative and helpful by revealing not just what kind of data was expected, but also showing what incorrect data was actually provided."

When validating the input, if the validation fails, the error message should dynamically incorporate the value causing the failure, offering clearer insight into why the validation failed.

This requires careful handling to ensure the method continues to reliably perform type conversion or validation while providing more descriptive error messages.\n\n**Bug Location 4**: \n- File: `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`\n- Method: `validate`\n  \n**Intended Behavior**:\nThis method\u2019s adjustments should allow it to explicitly include the user-provided value in any `ValidationError` raised due to validation failures, without altering the core validation logic of ensuring model field data meets specific criteria. \n\nEnhancing these methods to improve the clarity of validation error messages through inclusion of the provided values aligns with the initial issue's goal. These changes will make debugging and data correction easier by pointing developers or users directly to the source of input errors. Such improvements should be implemented conservatively to preserve existing functionality and compatibility across the Django framework."
