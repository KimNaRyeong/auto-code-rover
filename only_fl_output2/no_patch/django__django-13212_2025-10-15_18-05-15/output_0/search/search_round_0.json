For example:\n\u201cblah\u201d is not a valid email.\nBy making built-in validators provide value to ValidationError, one can override an error message and use a %(value)s placeholder.\nThis placeholder value matches an example already in the docs:\n\u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/validators/#writing-validators\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue effectively, we need to understand how validators work within the Django framework and where these validators throw the `ValidationError`, specifically in relation to utilizing the provided value in the error message. Given the nature of the issue specifying a desire to enhance the error reporting by including the input value that caused the error, we should look into the Django validators codebase.\n\nFirst, let's identify key components based on the issue description:\n- The issue mentions \"built-in validators\" and how they raise `ValidationError`. We need to find these validators.\n- We need to understand how `ValidationError` is currently instantiated and whether it supports formatting with a `value` placeholder.\n- The issue references a specific URL from the Django documentation, indicating that it's related to the Django codebase, specifically validators and their error messages.\n\nGiven this, our approach should involve:\n1. Locating where built-in validators are defined in Django. Since these are likely part of a common validators module or class, we will start by searching for validators related code.\n2. Investigating the `ValidationError` usage within these validators to see how they currently construct error messages.\n\nAccordingly, here are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ValidationError\")` - to find the definition of `ValidationError` and understand its constructor parameters.\n2. `search_code(\"validators\")` - to find files or code snippets where validators are defined or mentioned. This broad search can help us narrow down to specific files or modules.\n3. `search_method(\"ValidationError\")` - to find where and how `ValidationError` is being instantiated throughout the codebase, which could lead directly to how validators are using it. \n\nThese searches should give us an overview of where validators are implemented, how they raise `ValidationError`, and how we might modify them to include the `%(value)s` placeholder in the error messages."
