Given the initial script did not successfully run due to the `FileNotFoundError` for `pylint`, it suggests that the environment from which you are running the script might not have `pylint` installed or it is not available in the PATH for the subprocess to locate. Let's adjust the script to ensure it first checks for `pylint`'s existence. 

However, considering that the previous instructions were clear and the failure was due to the system configuration rather than the script itself, I'll provide a similar version with slight modifications that include:

- Checking if `pylint` is installed and available in the system's PATH.
- More clear handling of the expectation according to the description.

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def pylint_is_installed():
    try:
        subprocess.run(["pylint", "--version"], check=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
        return True
    except (subprocess.CalledProcessError, FileNotFoundError):
        return False

def test_pylint_verbose_argument_issue():
    if not pylint_is_installed():
        print("Pylint is not installed or not found in PATH.", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

    try:
        command = ["pylint", "temp_test_file.py", "-v"]
        result = subprocess.run(command, text=True, capture_output=True, check=True)
        
        # Check if pylint executed successfully without requiring an argument for verbose
        assert "expected one argument" not in result.stderr, "Pylint requires an argument for the -v (verbose) option unexpectedly."
    
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    print("No issue found with the pylint verbose option.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_pylint_verbose_argument_issue()
```

This script first checks if `pylint` is properly installed and executable in the current environment to avoid the `FileNotFoundError`. It then proceeds with the logic to reproduce the provided issue. Note that in a real-world scenario, additional context may be necessary such as checking the exact environment configuration, dependency versions, etc., which are factors this script does not address due to its standalone nature.
