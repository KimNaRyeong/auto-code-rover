        "intended_behavior": "This file and specifically the configuration related to the `--verbose` flag should be examined to ensure that the `-v` short option is correctly mapped to the `--verbose` functionality without expecting an argument. The existing implementation for `--verbose` already properly sets up the option to not expect an argument and directly toggles verbosity mode. The intended behavior here is to ensure `-v` behaves identically, enabling verbose mode directly without requiring extra input. This might involve examining where `-v` is defined and making sure it's aligned with the `--verbose` configuration, potentially adjusting how the `-v` flag is parsed or linked to the verbose functionality to mirror the `--verbose` logic."
