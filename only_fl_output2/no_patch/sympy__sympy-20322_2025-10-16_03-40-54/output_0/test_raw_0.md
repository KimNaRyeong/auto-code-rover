Below is the standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that you can use to reproduce the issue described. This script checks for the inconsistency in behavior when using `sympify` and `simplify` with the `ceiling` function in different versions of SymPy. When the result of simplification is different based on the `evaluate` parameter, it will raise an `AssertionError`. If the results are consistent across both uses of `evaluate`, it will exit with code 0, indicating the issue is fixed.

```python
import sympy

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_sympy_behavior():
    x = sympy.symbols('x')
    expr_false = sympy.sympify('4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)', evaluate=False).simplify()
    expr_true = sympy.sympify('4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)', evaluate=True).simplify()

    # Check if both expressions are simplified to the same result
    try:
        assert str(expr_false) == str(expr_true), "Inconsistent behavior detected."
        print("No issue detected. The behavior is consistent.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_sympy_behavior()
    except AssertionError:
        # Exit with non-zero code if an assertion error is raised
        # Indicating that the issue is present
        import sys
        sys.exit(1)
    # Exit with code 0 to indicate the issue is fixed or not present
    sys.exit(0)
```

In this script:
- We first define a function `print_stacktrace(e: Exception)` to print the stack trace of an exception, improving error visibility.
- The function `test_sympy_behavior()` attempts to replicate the given issue by comparing the results of using `sympify` with `evaluate=False` and `evaluate=True`, followed by `simplify`.
- It asserts that the string representations of the results are equal. If they are not, an `AssertionError` is raised, triggering the stack trace print.
- The script's main block calls `test_sympy_behavior()`, catching `AssertionError` if raised and exiting with code 1 to indicate an error state (issue present). If no error is detected, it exits with code 0.
