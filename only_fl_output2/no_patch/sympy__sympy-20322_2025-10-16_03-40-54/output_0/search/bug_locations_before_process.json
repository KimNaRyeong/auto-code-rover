While the method should preserve its general behavior of converting expressions into a form that SymPy can use, it should consistently respect the `evaluate=False` parameter by not simplifying or evaluating expressions prematurely or in an inconsistent manner across versions. The existing functionality for parsing and converting expressions, including the handling of `locals`, `strict`, `rational`, etc., should remain unchanged. Any fix should specifically address the inconsistency observed when handling expressions with `evaluate=False` and ensure that subsequent operations like `simplify` interpret the expression as intended."

        "intended_behavior": "Given that the `simplify` method's behavior on expressions involving the `ceiling` function has changed between versions, this method should be reviewed to ensure it treats such expressions consistently, irrespective of the `evaluate` parameter's state when the expression was first created with `sympify`. The method should maintain its overall objective of simplifying expressions to their simplest form, but it must do so in a way that does not introduce discrepancies depending on the evaluation state during creation. The fix should ensure that no unintended simplifications occur specifically for expressions with the `ceiling` function when `evaluate=False` is used in `sympify`."
