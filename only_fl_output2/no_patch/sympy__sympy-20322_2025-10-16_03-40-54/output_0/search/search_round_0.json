        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to the `sympify` and `simplify` methods along with the `ceiling` function within the SymPy library, I would use the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `sympify` method within the entire codebase to understand how it interprets the string expressions and handles the `evaluate` parameter.\n2. Search for the `simplify` method in the context of where it may be impacting the evaluation of the expression differently across versions.\n3. Since the issue specifically mentions the `ceiling` function, identifying where and how this function is defined or handled during the simplification process could provide insight into why its behavior changes based on the `evaluate` parameter.\n4. Understanding how expressions are evaluated and simplified, especially with the `evaluate=False` parameter, might require looking into the constructor or initializer of relevant classes like `Expr` or its subclasses that might be involved in the process.\n\nBased on this analysis, I propose the following search API calls:\n\n- search_method('sympify')\n- search_method('simplify')\n- search_code('ceiling')"
