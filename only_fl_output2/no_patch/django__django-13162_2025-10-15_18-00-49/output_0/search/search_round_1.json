For example:\n0003_merge_20160102_0304.py\nThis name is more opaque than necessary. When one reads it, it isn't immediately clear which migrations were merged. One must inspect the file to find that information.\nInstead, I suggest the default filename should be created by combining the files being merged. This way, it includes the information without requiring one to inspect the file. This information is also useful in the migrate command's output. As it is most likely to merge two migrations files, this should remain a reasonable length.\nFor example:\n0003_merge_0002_conflicting_second_0002_second.py\nIf preferable, we could decide to join the names in other ways too. For example, separate names by __ (two underscores) or exclude prefix numbers. To start, I'll go with the easiest approach unless there is strong preference for a different naming scheme.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context on how merge migrations are currently named in the codebase. Specifically, we should look into the mechanism that generates filenames for merge migrations. Based on the description, it seems pertinent to locate the class and methods responsible for generating these filenames. We might also need to inspect the part of the code where merge migration files are created to see how the current naming convention is implemented.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls would be useful:\n\n1. **Search for classes and methods related to migration file generation**: This could involve classes or methods with names suggesting they are involved in migration file generation or specifically merge migration handling. However, without specific class or method names, we can start with a generic search related to migration file handling. Assuming a standard naming convention, classes or methods with names like \"Migration\", \"FileGenerator\", or \"MergeMigration\" might exist. We can adjust our search based on common patterns or naming conventions in the project.\n\n2. **Search for code snippets related to filename creation**: Since the file naming convention is at the core of the issue, looking for code snippets that handle the creation of filenames, especially those that include a timestamp in the filename, can provide hints to the right direction. Common string formatting or concatenation operations in code related to migration handling might be a good start.\n\nGiven these considerations, the initial API calls could be:\n\n- `search_class(\"Migration\")`\n- `search_method(\"generate_filename\")`\n- `search_code(\"merge_\")`\n\nThese searches are based on assumptions and common practices. The actual names of classes, methods, or relevant code snippets might differ, and further adjustments to the search terms may be necessary based on the initial findings."

        "content": "Analyzing the results from the API calls, here are some insights and deductions on each of the results:\n\n### 1. Result of `search_class(\"Migration\")`:\nThe search for the \"Migration\" class yielded several classes scattered across various modules related to Django's built-in apps and the migration system itself. The file `django/db/migrations/migration.py` is most likely the core file related to defining migration behavior, including possibly the creation and handling of merge migrations. The other files seem to be specific migration files for Django's contrib apps (e.g., auth, sessions, admin) and might not directly relate to the utility for generating migration filenames.\n\n#### What this part of the code does:\nIt likely defines the structure and behavior of migration objects, including attributes and methods to handle migration files.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug:\nThe `migration.py` file and its contents are directly related to how migrations are handled, including naming, which is the main concern of the issue at hand.\n\n#### Intended behavior:\nThe code in `migration.py` should include functionality to generate filenames for migrations that reflects the nature of the migrations being merged, as described in the issue.\n\n### 2. Result of `search_method(\"generate_filename\")`:\nThe `generate_filename` method was found in `files.py` and `storage.py`. These locations suggest that the method is related to file handling in a broad sense, not specifically to migration filenames. This indicates that the method for generating migration filenames may not explicitly be named `generate_filename`, or it's not handled in a generic manner applicable across all file-related operations in Django.\n\n#### What this part of the code does:\nIt's involved in generating filenames, possibly following a certain format or incorporating metadata, which may include timestamps for files stored as part of Django's FileField or similar models.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug:\nWhile these methods do handle filename generation, they are likely too generic and not directly involved in migration file naming, based on the context of their location in the codebase.\n\n#### Intended behavior:\nThe intended behavior here (if it was related) would be to customize how filenames are generated to include identifiers from merged migrations. However, given the context, this seems unrelated.\n\n### 3. Result of `search_code(\"merge_\")`:\nThe `merge_` code snippets found across several core management commands and query handling files indicate places in the codebase where merging (or the concept of merge) is relevant. Specifically, `makemigrations.py` stands out as it directly relates to the creation of migration files, including perhaps the logic for naming merge migrations.\n\n#### What this part of the code does:\nThe `makemigrations` command is responsible for generating migration files based on changes detected in models. The matches found here suggest locations in the code that potentially handle the logic for creating and naming merge migrations.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug:\nGiven that the issue concerns how merge migrations are named, the snippets within `makemigrations.py` are likely where the logic for naming these files is defined and thus where modifications should be made to address the issue.\n\n#### Intended behavior:\nThis part of the code should ideally implement logic to generate migration filenames in a way that reflects the migrations being merged (as opposed to just using a timestamp), as per the new requirement.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo further address the issue, it would be sensible to:\n- Investigate the code within `django/db/migrations/migration.py` for logic related to naming merge migrations.\n- Look more closely at `makemigrations.py`, specifically around the sections returned by the search, to understand how current naming is implemented and where changes can be integrated.\n\nGiven these insights, further API calls might include:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"makemigrations\", \"django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py\")`\n- `search_class_in_file(\"Migration\", \"django/db/migrations/migration.py\")`\n\nThese calls aim to directly pinpoint the location where changes are necessary to address the issue described."

The naming convention should reflect the identities of the merged migrations (for example, using their names or identifiers in the filename). This change aims to make the merge migration filenames more informative at a glance, indicating which migrations were merged without requiring the developer to open and inspect the file. The new naming scheme could implement a format like \"0003_merge_0001_initial_0002_add_field.py\" where \"0001_initial\" and \"0002_add_field\" are the migrations being merged. This approach would preserve the existing functionality of generating merge migration files while improving the clarity of the filenames regarding their content.\n\n### Additional Notes on Implementation:\nWhile modifying the naming convention in `makemigrations.py`, it's crucial to ensure that:\n- The new naming scheme remains compatible with existing naming conventions and does not affect the ordering or application of migrations.\n- The length of the generated filenames does not exceed file system limits, considering that some operating systems have a maximum filename length. If the combined names are too long, an abbreviation or hash-based approach might be necessary.\n- Special characters or formats that could be problematic in filenames across different operating systems should be avoided or sanitized.\n\nThis solution addresses the issue by improving the self-documenting aspect of merge migration filenames, making maintenance and debugging processes more efficient by providing instant insight into the nature of each merge migration directly through its name."
