For example:\n0003_merge_20160102_0304.py\nThis name is more opaque than necessary. When one reads it, it isn't immediately clear which migrations were merged. One must inspect the file to find that information.\nInstead, I suggest the default filename should be created by combining the files being merged. This way, it includes the information without requiring one to inspect the file. This information is also useful in the migrate command's output. As it is most likely to merge two migrations files, this should remain a reasonable length.\nFor example:\n0003_merge_0002_conflicting_second_0002_second.py\nIf preferable, we could decide to join the names in other ways too. For example, separate names by __ (two underscores) or exclude prefix numbers. To start, I'll go with the easiest approach unless there is strong preference for a different naming scheme.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context on how merge migrations are currently named in the codebase. Specifically, we should look into the mechanism that generates filenames for merge migrations. Based on the description, it seems pertinent to locate the class and methods responsible for generating these filenames. We might also need to inspect the part of the code where merge migration files are created to see how the current naming convention is implemented.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls would be useful:\n\n1. **Search for classes and methods related to migration file generation**: This could involve classes or methods with names suggesting they are involved in migration file generation or specifically merge migration handling. However, without specific class or method names, we can start with a generic search related to migration file handling. Assuming a standard naming convention, classes or methods with names like \"Migration\", \"FileGenerator\", or \"MergeMigration\" might exist. We can adjust our search based on common patterns or naming conventions in the project.\n\n2. **Search for code snippets related to filename creation**: Since the file naming convention is at the core of the issue, looking for code snippets that handle the creation of filenames, especially those that include a timestamp in the filename, can provide hints to the right direction. Common string formatting or concatenation operations in code related to migration handling might be a good start.\n\nGiven these considerations, the initial API calls could be:\n\n- `search_class(\"Migration\")`\n- `search_method(\"generate_filename\")`\n- `search_code(\"merge_\")`\n\nThese searches are based on assumptions and common practices. The actual names of classes, methods, or relevant code snippets might differ, and further adjustments to the search terms may be necessary based on the initial findings."
