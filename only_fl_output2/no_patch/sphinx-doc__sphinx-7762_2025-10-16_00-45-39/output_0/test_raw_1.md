Below is a revised `reproducer.py` file designed to accurately test for the specific issue described, with the given details taken into account. This Python script attempts to simulate a scenario similar to the one described, by directly targeting the behavior that led to a `406 Not Acceptable` response when certain custom headers are present. This time, it will ensure the issue can be reproduced under the conditions described, raising an `AssertionError` if the issue persists (i.e., if a `406 Not Acceptable` is received when it should not be), or it will finish with exit code 0 when the request is successful (indicating the issue may be fixed).

```python
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_custom_http_header_support():
    # Attempt to emulate the Accept header as browsers do, 
    # which caused the issue originally.
    headers = {
        'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9'
    }
    url = 'https://github.com/cherrypy/cheroot/workflows/Test%20suite/badge.svg'
    response = requests.head(url, headers=headers)

    try:
        # The test checks if the response is 406 and raises an error if it is not fixed.
        assert response.status_code != 406, "Issue detected: Server responded with '406 Not Acceptable'."
        print("Issue resolved or not encountered: Received a successful response.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Ensure to exit with a non-zero code to indicate failure in reproducing the fix.
        raise SystemExit(1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    check_custom_http_header_support()
```

This script focuses on sending a `HEAD` request instead of a `GET` request, assuming that the nature of the issue relates to how headers might affect the response from the server for different HTTP methods. This aspect can be adjusted based on further interpretation of the original issue description or subsequent feedback on the efficacy of the test.
