Examples are an actual bug when changing columns: #14237 and how to define number of input features #13603.\nRelated is also the idea of checking for column name consistency: #7242\nMainly I'm asking whether it makes sense to have the same requirements for ColumnTransformer as for other estimators.\nColumnTransformer is the only estimator that addresses columns by name, and so reordering columns doesn't impact the model and actually everything works fine. Should we still aim for checking for reordering of columns?\nRight now, ``transform`` even works if we add additional columns to ``X``, which makes sense, since it only cares about the columns it is using.\nShould we allow that going forward as long as remainder is not used? (if remainder is used, the result of ``ColumnTransformer`` would have a different shape and downstream estimators would break, so I think we shouldn't support it in this case).\nIn either case, what's ``n_features_in_`` for a ColumnTransformer? The number of columns in ``X`` during ``fit`` or the number of columns actually used?\nDoes it even make sense to define it if we allow adding other columns that are ignored?\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue related to `ColumnTransformer` and its input validation requirements, we need to gather information about how `ColumnTransformer` is implemented, how it handles its inputs, especially regarding columns by name, and any validations or checks that occur during the transform process. Given the references to handling of additional columns and the `n_features_in_` attribute, we will look into the `ColumnTransformer` class, its `transform` method, and how `n_features_in_` is calculated or utilized.\n\nHere are the API calls needed to gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue:\n\n1. Search for the `ColumnTransformer` class to understand its current implementation and any input validation already in place.\n   - `search_class(\"ColumnTransformer\")`\n\n2. Search for the `transform` method within `ColumnTransformer` class to understand how it handles input features and additional columns.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"transform\", \"ColumnTransformer\")`\n\n3. Search for the implementation or usage of `n_features_in_` attribute within the `ColumnTransformer` class, to see how it is defined and used, which might provide insight into how the number of input features is managed.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"n_features_in_\", \"<path_to_ColumnTransformer_file>\")`\n\nThe `<path_to_ColumnTransformer_file>` placeholder should be replaced with the actual file path of the `ColumnTransformer` class which can be determined from the result of the first search call. If the first call provides direct access to the file path as part of its response, this value can be refined to accurately specify where to search for the usage of `n_features_in_`. \n\nThis sequence of searches is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of how `ColumnTransformer` manages its input and what changes or enhancements might be required to resolve the issue described."
