        "intended_behavior": "The `doit` method within the `Mod` class needs to incorporate logic that simplifies modulo expressions in a way that is consistent with mathematical principles, especially when dealing with expressions that multiply a variable by a constant. Specifically, for the case of `Mod(3*i, 2)`, the method should be able to recognize and simplify this to `Mod(i, 2)`, under the condition that `i` is an integer. This simplification reflects an understanding that `3*i % 2` can be seen as `i % 2` due to the properties of modular arithmetic. The adjustment aims to preserve all existing functionalities provided by the `doit` method, ensuring that this enhancement does not disrupt other evaluations it performs. This ensures that the simplification of modulo expressions with a multiplied variable only takes place under valid mathematical and logical conditions, enhancing the method's accuracy and making it more comprehensive in handling various types of expressions."
