        "intended_behavior": "The `call_command` function should be enhanced to better handle mutually exclusive arguments that share the same destination (`dest`). Specifically, it needs to accurately differentiate and process these arguments, ensuring that the correct parsing function is applied for each type of mutually exclusive argument. The intended behavior is to allow for clear distinction and proper handling of such arguments (e.g., `--for` versus `--until`) so that commands designed with mutually exclusive groups in their arguments perform as expected when invoked programmatically through `call_command`. This may involve adjusting the logic that constructs the `args` and `options` passed to the command's `execute` method, to ensure mutually exclusive arguments are correctly interpreted and passed along. The functionality must preserve the ability of `call_command` to call any management command with arbitrary arguments and options while ensuring that existing functionality for other commands remains unaffected."

        "intended_behavior": "Although no specific bug was identified within `add_arguments` from the context provided, considering the issue reported, an advisory update or addition might be made to the documentation or implementation notes within this method. This would guide developers on how to define arguments for custom management commands in a way that ensures compatibility with `call_command` for scenarios involving mutually exclusive arguments with the same `dest`. The documentation should clearly specify how to structure commands for compatibility with both CLI executions and programmatic invocations via `call_command`, especially focusing on the unique case of mutually exclusive arguments."
