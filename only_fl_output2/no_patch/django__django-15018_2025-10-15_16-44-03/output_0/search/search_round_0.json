Specifically there are two sides to the failure:\nwhile I can provide an until value (as a string, which is processed by parse_time) there is no mechanism to pass a for value if that's how I want to spell the input\nthe for value is always required and attempts to parse the (string) until value passed, which then errors since the input formats are very different\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue related to the `call_command()` failure when required mutually exclusive arguments use the same `dest`, we need to explore the implementation details of relevant classes and methods mentioned in the issue. Let's plan our search queries as follows:\n\n1. **Search for the `BaseCommand` class** to understand how argument parsing is implemented and if there are any relevant methods that may influence the behavior observed in the issue.\n\n2. **Search for the `call_command` function** to examine how arguments are passed to the command and handled, especially looking for nuances related to mutually exclusive arguments.\n\n3. **Search for the implementation of the `add_arguments` method** within the context of the `Command` class provided in the issue, as this method directly relates to the setup of argument parsing that is failing.\n\n4. **Search for the `handle` method within the `Command` class** to understand how the arguments are processed after being parsed, which might give insights on how `until` and `for` arguments are expected to be received and used.\n\n5. **Search for implementations of `parse_duration_to_time` and `parse_time` functions** to understand how these parsing functions convert input strings into datetime objects and ensure that there's no discrepancy in how they are expected to work with `call_command`.\n\nGiven these areas of interest, let's proceed with specific API calls to fetch the necessary context:\n\n- `search_class(\"BaseCommand\")`\n- `search_method(\"call_command\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"add_arguments\", \"Command\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"handle\", \"Command\")`\n- `search_method(\"parse_duration_to_time\")`\n- `search_method(\"parse_time\")`"
