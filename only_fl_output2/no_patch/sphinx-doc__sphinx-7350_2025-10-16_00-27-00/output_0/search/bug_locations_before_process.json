To resolve the issue, it should be ensured that when handling `Attributes:` directives specifically for Napoleon-generated documentation, the `:noindex:` option is properly recognized and applied, preventing these attributes from being indexed. The existing functionality supports `:noindex:` for other types of objects; thus, extending this capability to include Napoleon's `Attributes:` without affecting other directive processing is necessary."

While the current implementation logs a warning for duplicate object descriptions and handles the `:noindex:` option, it may require adjustments to ensure that `Attributes:` directives processed by Napoleon are appropriately considered. The method's extension or modification should preserve the handling of the `:noindex:` option for other Python objects while incorporating the specific behavior for Napoleon's `Attributes:`."
