Creating a standalone Python script to reproduce the issue you're encountering with the Sphinx `:noindex:` option being ignored by Napoleon's `Attributes:` directive involves simulating a Sphinx documentation build process within the script. Given the context, the testing script will set up a minimal Sphinx project structure in memory or a temporary folder, execute the Sphinx build, and then analyze the build output to check for the presence of the `:noindex:` option's expected behavior.

Given the detailed requirements and the function to print the stack trace, below is an example script, `reproducer.py`, designed to reproduce the issue with Napoleon's `Attributes:` directive. This script:

1. Sets up a minimal Sphinx environment programmatically.
2. Includes an example Python module docstring to test the `Attributes:` directive with `:noindex:`.
3. Builds the Sphinx documentation.
4. Checks the generated index file to confirm if the attribute is indexed or not. It raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is present (i.e., the attribute is wrongly indexed).

```python
import os
import sys
import subprocess
from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_project(directory):
    os.makedirs(os.path.join(directory, "docs"), exist_ok=True)
    with open(os.path.join(directory, "docs", "conf.py"), "w") as f:
        f.write("""
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('..'))
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinxcontrib.napoleon'

""")
    with open(os.path.join(directory, "docs", "index.rst"), "w") as f:
        f.write("""

   :members:
   :noindex:
""")

def create_test_module(directory):
    with open(os.path.join(directory, "test_module.py"), "w") as f:
        f.write("""
\"\"\"Example module for demonstrating the issue.

    test_attribute (int): This attribute should not be indexed.
\"\"\"
test_attribute = 42
""")

def build_docs(directory):
    try:
        subprocess.check_call(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', os.path.join(directory, "docs"), os.path.join(directory, "build")])
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print("Failed to build Sphinx documentation.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

def check_issue(directory):
    index_filename = os.path.join(directory, "build", "index.html")
    with open(index_filename, "r") as f:
        content = f.read()
        assert "test_attribute" not in content, "Failed: `:noindex:` option was ignored."

def main():
    with TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
        setup_sphinx_project(tmpdir)
        create_test_module(tmpdir)
        build_docs(tmpdir)
        try:
            check_issue(tmpdir)
            print("Successfully verified: Issue fixed.")
            sys.exit(0)
        except AssertionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This script does the following:
- Creates a temporary directory where the Sphinx project and test module are set up.
- Writes a minimal `conf.py` and `index.rst` for Sphinx, and a `test_module.py` including docstrings with the `Attributes:` directive intended for testing.
- Runs the Sphinx build process with `sphinx-build`.
- Checks if `test_attribute` is incorrectly included in the generated `index.html`, indicating that the `:noindex:` option was ignored.

To use this script, place it in the root directory of your project (though it sets up its environment in a temporary directory) and execute it with Python 3. Make sure Sphinx and `sphinxcontrib-napoleon` are installed in your environment.

Please note, this reproduction script assumes Sphinx and `sphinxcontrib-napoleon` are correctly installed and configured in your Python environment. You might need to adjust the paths or setup procedures depending on your specific environment or Sphinx configuration.
