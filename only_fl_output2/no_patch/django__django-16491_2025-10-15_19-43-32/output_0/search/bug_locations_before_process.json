        "intended_behavior": "The `Exists` class, when used in conjunction with an empty queryset, should always ensure the output is a boolean value. This behavior is crucial for maintaining consistency with the `BooleanField` output type expected from such queries. Specifically, when an `Exists` query is evaluated against an empty queryset (resulting from a `.none()` call), it should explicitly evaluate to `False`, rather than returning `None`. This might necessitate revisiting how the `Exists` class constructs its SQL representation (within `select_format` or through its template) and ensuring that the evaluation of an exists subquery against an empty queryset correctly results in a boolean `False` in SQL. The implementation should ensure that any SQL produced by the `Exists` class leads the database to return a boolean result, even in edge cases like evaluating an empty queryset. To preserve the existing functionality while fixing the bug, any changes should be scoped only to scenarios where the queryset is known to be empty (as identified by the `query.set_empty()` call within the `none` method of a `QuerySet`). One potential approach could be introducing logic to detect when `Exists` is operating on an empty queryset and adjusting the generated SQL or the interpretation of its result accordingly. This fix should not affect `Exists` operations on non-empty querysets, preserving existing behavior in those cases."
