        "content": "<issue>Exists annotations can return non-boolean results (i.e. None) if used with an empty QuerySet.\nDescription\nI suspect this is following on from, but potentially separate to #33018 -- because that ticket starts out using Django 3.2 to observe that an empty queryset (EmptyQuerySet or whatever, via none()) can short circuit evaluation to be 0 as ... in the SQL query, which is exactly the same problem I observed.\nHowever, as far as I can tell, the result of an Exists(queryset.none()) can still return values outside of True/False, namely, None.\nUsing Django main as of 4593bc5da115f2e808a803a4ec24104b6c7a6152 (from Wed Jan 11 ... 2023), here's the behaviour on both postgres and sqlite. In both scenarios I'm using 3.10.2 with psycopg2==2.9.3 and sqlite3.sqlite_version is 3.37.0 and sqlite3.version is 2.6.0.\nIPython outputs 8 and 11 are the problems.\nclass A(models.Model):\npass\nclass B(models.Model):\npass\nIn [1]: from app.models import A, B\nIn [2]: A.objects.using(\"pg\").create()\nOut[2]: <A: A object (1)>\nIn [3]: B.objects.using(\"pg\").create()\nOut[3]: <B: B object (1)>\nIn [4]: A.objects.using(\"sqlite\").create()\nOut[4]: <A: A object (1)>\nIn [4]: B.objects.using(\"sqlite\").create()\nOut[4]: <B: B object (1)>\nIn [5]: from django.db.models import Exists\nIn [6]: A.objects.using(\"sqlite\").annotate(should_be_bool=Exists(B.objects.all())).first().should_be_bool\nOut[6]: True\nIn [7]: A.objects.using(\"sqlite\").annotate(should_be_bool=Exists(B.objects.filter(pk=99999999))).first().should_be_bool\nOut[7]: False\nIn [8]: A.objects.using(\"sqlite\").annotate(should_be_bool=Exists(B.objects.none())).first().should_be_bool\n# This is the problem, it returned neither True nor False\nIn [9]: A.objects.using(\"pg\").annotate(should_be_bool=Exists(B.objects.all())).first().should_be_bool\nOut[9]: True\nIn [10]: A.objects.using(\"pg\").annotate(should_be_bool=Exists(B.objects.filter(pk=99999999))).first().should_be_bool\nOut[10]: False\nIn [11]: A.objects.using(\"pg\").annotate(should_be_bool=Exists(B.objects.none())).first().should_be_bool\n# This is the problem, it returned neither True nor False\nAnd the queries, which are the same for postgres & sqlite:\n# ...\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"app_a\".\"id\", EXISTS(SELECT 1 AS \"a\" FROM \"app_b\" LIMIT 1) AS \"should_be_bool\" FROM \"app_a\" ORDER BY \"app_a\".\"id\" ASC LIMIT 1',\n'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"app_a\".\"id\", EXISTS(SELECT 1 AS \"a\" FROM \"app_b\" U0 WHERE U0.\"id\" = 99999999 LIMIT 1) AS \"should_be_bool\" FROM \"app_a\" ORDER BY \"app_a\".\"id\" ASC LIMIT 1',\n'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"app_a\".\"id\", NULL AS \"should_be_bool\" FROM \"app_a\" ORDER BY \"app_a\".\"id\" ASC LIMIT 1',\n'time': '0.001'}\nGiven Exists has an output_field of BooleanField and that definition doesn't have null=True as an argument, it seems incongruent from both an expectations (\"exists sounds boolean\") and implementation (\"it doesn't say it could be null\") standpoint.\nWhilst the problem exists in main, it has also changed behaviour (presumably or potentially unexpectedly) since 3.2, where postgres and sqlite actually do different things, hence we tested both above. So main is now consistent, but I'd personally argue it's consistently wrong (for a given value thereof, no judgement made!)\nIn 3.2.16, under sqlite, using annotate(x=Exists(y.none())) returns False but on main it now returns None (see above) -- the 3.2 behaviour is correct for my expectations\nIn [4]: A.objects.using(\"sqlite\").annotate(should_be_bool=Exists(B.objects.none())).first().should_be_bool\nOut[4]: False\nIn [5]: connections['sqlite'].queries\nOut[5]:\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"app_a\".\"id\", 0 AS \"should_be_bool\" FROM \"app_a\" ORDER BY \"app_a\".\"id\" ASC LIMIT 1',\n'time': '0.000'}\nIn 3.2.16 with postgres we get neither None nor False but the integer 0 instead:\nIn [4]: A.objects.using(\"pg\").annotate(should_be_bool=Exists(B.objects.none())).first().should_be_bool\nOut[4]: 0\nIn [5]: connections['pg'].queries\nOut[5]:\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"app_a\".\"id\", 0 AS \"should_be_bool\" FROM \"app_a\" ORDER BY \"app_a\".\"id\" ASC LIMIT 1',\n'time': '0.001'}\nSo we can observe that under 3.2 using the 0 AS ... behaviour\nsqlite appears to behave correctly (returning False)\npostgres appears to behave incorrectly (failing to cast a raw integer to a boolean)\nAnd under main using the NULL AS ... behaviour\nsqlite no longer behaves the same, returning None where I'd expect False (or even True given the way SQL EXISTS works...)\npostgres behaves differently, 0 is now None but I'd still expect True or False as the output.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n### 1. `Exists` Class in `django/db/models/expressions.py`\n- **Purpose**: The `Exists` class represents an SQL EXISTS clause, which is used to test for the existence of any record within a subquery. In Django, it is implemented as a subclass of `Subquery`.\n- **Relationship to the Bug**: The issue mentions that `Exists` annotations can return `None` instead of a boolean value when used with an empty queryset. Given that `Exists` has an `output_field` of `BooleanField`, the expectation is that it should always return a boolean value (`True` or `False`). The issue arises in scenarios where `Exists` is combined with an empty queryset, leading to a possible inconsistency in how `Exists` is evaluated.\n- **Intended Behavior**: `Exists` should strictly return `True` or `False`. Even in cases where it is evaluating an empty queryset, it should adhere to this rule, ensuring consistent boolean output that aligns with the expectation set by its `output_field`.\n\n### 2. `none` Method in `django/db/models/query.py`\n- **Purpose**: The `none` method is used to return an empty `QuerySet`. It essentially short-circuits the query construction to ensure that no actual query is executed against the database, but the result mimics that of an empty table.\n- **Relationship to the Bug**: The issue arises when an `Exists` check is performed on the result of a `none()` call. Based on the issue description, instead of returning `False` (as there are no records to satisfy the `Exists` condition), a `None` value is returned. This behavior suggests that there might be a gap in how the `Exists` wrapper translates the semantics of an empty queryset into SQL or interprets its result.\n- **Intended Behavior**: The `none()` method is correctly producing an empty `QuerySet`; however, the interaction between `Exists` and an empty `QuerySet` (produced by `none()`) needs to ensure a boolean result. The breakdown occurs in translating the empty set condition into a boolean `False`, which is the logically expected outcome when checking for existence in an empty set.\n\n### Next Steps for Context Gathering\n\nGiven the insights and the missing link in the usage example (`annotate` call not found in the codebase), I propose the following additional API calls for further context:\n\n1. **Inspect `Subquery` class**: Since `Exists` is a subclass of `Subquery`, gaining insights into `Subquery` might offer clues on how `Exists` integrates its functionality and how it could be causing the observed issue.\n   - `search_class(\"Subquery\")`\n   \n2. **Dive deeper into how `annotate` integrates with `Exists`**: While the specific `annotate` example wasn't found, looking at how `annotate` method handles its arguments or transforms them into SQL could provide more context. It's possible that the way `annotate` or the ORM layer translates the `Exists` condition with an empty queryset into the final SQL might not be correctly enforcing the boolean expectation.\n   - `search_method(\"annotate\")`\n\nThese steps aim to bridge the gap between the expected behavior of `Exists` with respect to empty querysets and the actual implementation that leads to the returning of `None` values."

This behavior is crucial for maintaining consistency with the `BooleanField` output type expected from such queries. \n- Specifically, when an `Exists` query is evaluated against an empty queryset (resulting from a `.none()` call), it should explicitly evaluate to `False`, rather than returning `None`. This might necessitate revisiting how the `Exists` class constructs its SQL representation (within `select_format` or through its template) and ensuring that the evaluation of an exists subquery against an empty queryset correctly results in a boolean `False` in SQL. The implementation should ensure that any SQL produced by the `Exists` class leads the database to return a boolean result, even in edge cases like evaluating an empty queryset.\n- To preserve the existing functionality while fixing the bug, any changes should be scoped only to scenarios where the queryset is known to be empty (as identified by the `query.set_empty()` call within the `none` method of a `QuerySet`). One potential approach could be introducing logic to detect when `Exists` is operating on an empty queryset and adjusting the generated SQL or the interpretation of its result accordingly. This fix should not affect `Exists` operations on non-empty querysets, preserving existing behavior in those cases.\n\nBy addressing the issue within the `Exists` class to uphold the boolean output expectation, even when interfacing with empty querysets, we align the behavior with both developer expectations and the documented functionality of `BooleanField`. This preserves the integrity and consistency of the Django ORM\u2019s handling of conditional expressions."
