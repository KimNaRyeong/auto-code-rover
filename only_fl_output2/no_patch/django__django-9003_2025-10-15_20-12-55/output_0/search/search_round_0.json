        "content": "<issue>Non-deterministic crash in django.db.models.sql.Query.combine()\nDescription\nHi,\nThere's a logical error somewhere in Query.combine or friends.\nI have a pretty complicated query with many-to-many self-joins and ORs, and after the upgrade to Django 1.9 and Python 3 combine() sometimes, but not always, crashes with the assertion error\nassert set(change_map.keys()).intersection(set(change_map.values())) == set()\nInspecting the change_map, it does indeed contain a circular reference (BTW shouldn't you use \"not\" to test for an empty set rather than comparing with set()?).\nAt first, I didn't understand how it could crash sometimes and sometimes not - we're talking about the same query being executed through a view. But when I examine change_map, its content does indeed change from reload to reload - I suppose this may have something to do with the order of dicts/sets the combine() algorithm is using.\nHere comes some code, I cut out a bunch of unused stuff, but otherwise it's the same:\nclass Invoice(models.Model):\ncustomer = models.ForeignKey(Customer)\ndate_created = models.DateField(default=datetime.date.today, db_index=True)\ndate_sent = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_due = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_paid = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_credited = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_collect = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ninvoice_type = models.CharField(default=\"invoice\", max_length=32)\nreminders = models.ManyToManyField(\"Invoice\", related_name=\"reminded_set\", blank=True)\nreminder_counter = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)\nThat's the model, and in the view:\nimport datetime\nfrom django.db.models import Q\ndate = datetime.datetime.now()\ninvoices = Invoice.objects.filter(\nQ(date_created__lte=date),\nQ(date_paid__gt=date) | Q(date_paid=None),\nQ(date_credited__gt=date) | Q(date_credited=None),\ncustomer=1,\n)\nfiltered_invoices = Invoice.objects.none()\nnot_due = Q(date_due__gte=date) | Q(date_due=None)\nnot_reminded_yet = ~Q(reminders__date_created__lte=date)\nnot_collected = Q(date_collect__gt=date) | Q(date_collect=None)\nfiltered_invoices |= invoices.filter(not_due, not_collected, date_sent__lte=date, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfiltered_invoices |= invoices.filter(not_collected, not_reminded_yet, date_sent__lte=date, date_due__lt=date, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfor r in [1, 2, 3]:\nqs = invoices.filter(not_collected, reminders__date_created__lte=date, reminders__reminder_counter=r, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfor i in range(r + 1, 3 + 1):\nqs = qs.filter(~Q(reminders__reminder_counter=i) | Q(reminders__reminder_counter=i, reminders__date_created__gt=date))\nfiltered_invoices |= qs\nI realize it's pretty complicated but I'm not sure what's essential and what's not. I hope someone knowledgeable of how combine() works can figure out why ordering in some cases matters.\n</issue>"
