But when I examine change_map, its content does indeed change from reload to reload - I suppose this may have something to do with the order of dicts/sets the combine() algorithm is using.\nHere comes some code, I cut out a bunch of unused stuff, but otherwise it's the same:\nclass Invoice(models.Model):\ncustomer = models.ForeignKey(Customer)\ndate_created = models.DateField(default=datetime.date.today, db_index=True)\ndate_sent = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_due = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_paid = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_credited = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_collect = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ninvoice_type = models.CharField(default=\"invoice\", max_length=32)\nreminders = models.ManyToManyField(\"Invoice\", related_name=\"reminded_set\", blank=True)\nreminder_counter = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)\nThat's the model, and in the view:\nimport datetime\nfrom django.db.models import Q\ndate = datetime.datetime.now()\ninvoices = Invoice.objects.filter(\nQ(date_created__lte=date),\nQ(date_paid__gt=date) | Q(date_paid=None),\nQ(date_credited__gt=date) | Q(date_credited=None),\ncustomer=1,\n)\nfiltered_invoices = Invoice.objects.none()\nnot_due = Q(date_due__gte=date) | Q(date_due=None)\nnot_reminded_yet = ~Q(reminders__date_created__lte=date)\nnot_collected = Q(date_collect__gt=date) | Q(date_collect=None)\nfiltered_invoices |= invoices.filter(not_due, not_collected, date_sent__lte=date, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfiltered_invoices |= invoices.filter(not_collected, not_reminded_yet, date_sent__lte=date, date_due__lt=date, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfor r in [1, 2, 3]:\nqs = invoices.filter(not_collected, reminders__date_created__lte=date, reminders__reminder_counter=r, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfor i in range(r + 1, 3 + 1):\nqs = qs.filter(~Q(reminders__reminder_counter=i) | Q(reminders__reminder_counter=i, reminders__date_created__gt=date))\nfiltered_invoices |= qs\nI realize it's pretty complicated but I'm not sure what's essential and what's not. I hope someone knowledgeable of how combine() works can figure out why ordering in some cases matters.\n</issue>"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Based on the collected context, let's analyze the results:\n\n### Analysis of `Query` class structure and `combine` method:\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \n  The `combine` method in the `Query` class is designed to merge two queries (`self` and `rhs` for right-hand side) based on a specified connector (e.g., `AND`, `OR`). It has several checks to ensure that the two queries can be combined (same base model, ability to filter, distinct conditions, etc.). It then manipulates joins, where clauses, selects, and ordering to integrate the RHS query into the LHS (`self`) query.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**  \n  The issue description hints at a non-deterministic crash occurring within this `combine` method, specifically pointing out that the content of `change_map` changes upon each reload, indicating non-deterministic behavior likely tied to the way Python's dicts/sets are ordered and used within this function.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**  \n  The intended behavior would be to consistently combine two queries without crashing, accounting for the possible differences in ordering or the contents of `change_map`. This suggests that the algorithm should handle scenarios where `change_map` might introduce circular references or become sensitive to the non-deterministic ordering of Python collections.\n\n### Analysis of the assertion in `change_aliases` method:\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \n  Within the `change_aliases` method, the assertion checks for circular references in `change_map` by ensuring that there is no intersection between its keys and values when represented as sets. This is intended to validate the integrity of alias changes before proceeding further.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**  \n  This assertion error is directly related to the bug reported. The user's description mentions a crash with this specific assertion, indicating that `change_map` somehow ends up with intersecting keys and values (indicative of circular references), which should not happen under normal circumstances.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**  \n  The intended behavior is to ensure `change_map` does not contain circular references before applying alias changes to a query's select columns, group by, and where clause. This is crucial for maintaining query integrity and preventing infinite loops or other logical errors in query construction.\n\n### Moving Forward:\nGiven these insights, a few steps are clear for moving toward a solution:\n1. **Investigate how `change_map` is populated**: Understanding the logic that leads to changes in `change_map` content across reloads will be key. Specifically, why and how `change_map` might inadvertently be set up to form circular references or reflect the non-deterministic nature of dict/set ordering in Python.\n   \n2. **Review `combine` and related method implementations**: Especially how they interact with `change_map` and any potential for introducing non-deterministic behavior based on the order of operations or joins. The method's handling of aliases and joins seems critical, as indicated by the detailed process described in the method's comments and code.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context:\nGiven that the direct context search around `Invoice` class did not yield results, a broader approach may be needed, perhaps focusing on how models and queries are constructed and executed within Django's ORM system more generally. Also, reviewing related features or methods that interact with `combine` (e.g., `add_q`, `add_filter`, `join`) might shed more light on how queries are built up and why certain orders of operations could lead to the issues observed with `combine`."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g.

The information regarding the `combine` method within the `Query` class and the assertion in `change_aliases` provides a concentrated area to investigate and address the reported bug.\n\n2. **Where are bug locations**:\n\n### Location 1:\n- **File**: `django/db/models/sql/query.py`\n- **Class**: `Query`\n- **Method**: `combine`\n\n  - **Intended Behavior**: The `combine` method should ensure stability and predictability in how queries are merged, regardless of the order in which dict or set operations occur. This might involve introducing order-independent checks or validations to prevent the creation of circular references in `change_map` or handling Python's non-deterministic collections in a manner that does not affect the query's outcome. Additionally, improving error handling around assertions or conditions that lead to the observed non-deterministic crashes could be part of the solution. Ensuring consistent behavior across executions with the same input should be a key aim.\n\n### Location 2:\n- **File**: `django/db/models/sql/query.py`\n- **Class**: `Query`\n- **Method**: `change_aliases`\n\n  - **Intended Behavior**: In the `change_aliases` method, the critical assertion that checks for circular references in `change_map` should be preserved, but the analysis and manipulation of `change_map` may need enhancement. Specifically, the method should implement a more robust mechanism for managing alias changes that inherently avoids the possibility of creating circular references, regardless of the complexity of the query structures or the interactions of combined queries. This might require reevaluating the logic that leads to alias modifications, ensuring that alias changes do not introduce logical inconsistencies or dependencies that break this assertion.\n  \nThese locations pinpoint where modifications are required to resolve the reported issue while ensuring that the functionality designed to merge complex queries in Django remains intact and becomes more reliable."
