        "intended_behavior": "The `combine` method should ensure stability and predictability in how queries are merged, regardless of the order in which dict or set operations occur. This might involve introducing order-independent checks or validations to prevent the creation of circular references in `change_map` or handling Python's non-deterministic collections in a manner that does not affect the query's outcome. Additionally, improving error handling around assertions or conditions that lead to the observed non-deterministic crashes could be part of the solution. Ensuring consistent behavior across executions with the same input should be a key aim."

        "intended_behavior": "In the `change_aliases` method, the critical assertion that checks for circular references in `change_map` should be preserved, but the analysis and manipulation of `change_map` may need enhancement. Specifically, the method should implement a more robust mechanism for managing alias changes that inherently avoids the possibility of creating circular references, regardless of the complexity of the query structures or the interactions of combined queries. This might require reevaluating the logic that leads to alias modifications, ensuring that alias changes do not introduce logical inconsistencies or dependencies that break this assertion."
