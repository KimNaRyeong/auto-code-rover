        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we'll need to identify several key pieces of the Django project where this behavior might be defined or influenced. Since the issue revolves around how changes are tracked and displayed in the admin section, particularly focusing on the use of verbose names instead of field names, we will look for classes and methods that could be responsible for generating history messages, including how changes to model fields are logged and displayed in the Django admin.\n\n1. **Search for classes related to admin history logging**: Understanding if there's a specific class handling the logging of changes in the admin interface could be crucial. The class might not be directly named after \"history\" or \"logging,\" considering Django's architecture, so we should consider broad terms like \"LogEntry\" or \"History\" as they are common in Django admin or third-party packages like `django-simple-history`.\n\n2. **Search for methods that format the change messages**: There are likely methods responsible for formatting the change messages. Methods like `construct_change_message` in Django admin could be responsible for generating the text that describes what changes were made.\n\n3. **Look for code that interacts with model verbose names**: Since the issue involves displaying verbose names instead of field names, we'll need to find where the model's field definitions are accessed to generate these messages.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are the API calls we should make:\n\n- `search_class(\"LogEntry\")`\n- `search_class(\"History\")`\n- `search_method(\"construct_change_message\")`\n- `search_code(\"models.DateTimeField\")`\n\nThese searches should help us identify the relevant classes and methods in the codebase that are likely involved in generating and displaying the change messages within the Django admin. Ensuring we understand where field names and verbose names are utilized will provide a solid foundation for crafting a solution."

        "content": "Analyzing the gathered context in relation to the issue:\n\n### 1. LogEntry Class (django/contrib/admin/models.py)\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `LogEntry` class represents a log entry in the Django admin. It tracks various actions such as additions, changes, and deletions of objects within the Django admin interface. It stores metadata about each action, like the time of action, the user responsible, the type of change, and a message describing the change.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug\nThe `LogEntry` class's `change_message` field likely stores the description that shows up in the admin history. However, this class itself does not format the `change_message`; it only stores it. Therefore, while the class is central to logging changes, the issue lies in how the message is constructed before it's passed to a `LogEntry` instance.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nWhile the `LogEntry` class directly doesn't dictate the format of `change_message`, ensuring that the message includes human-readable, verbose names instead of technical field names involves modifying how the `change_message` is constructed. This would mean intercepting or altering the logic before this data is saved to `LogEntry`.\n\n### 2. construct_change_message Method\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThis function constructs a JSON structure describing changes made to an object. It seems to generate a message that includes details about fields that were added, changed, or deleted. The code differentiates between additions, modifications, and deletions and handles each type of change differently.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug\nThis method is directly related to the issue as it is responsible for constructing the change messages that eventually get saved into `LogEntry` objects. The method constructs messages that currently reflect the \"technical\" names of fields that were changed, rather than their verbose names.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nTo address the issue, this method should be modified or extended to use verbose names (`_meta.verbose_name`) of fields instead of their technical field names when constructing the change messages. This involves adjusting how `{'changed': {'fields': form.changed_data}}` generates its list of fields. For fields that have a verbose name specified, the verbose name should be used in the change message instead of the field's attribute name.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior is to modify the `construct_change_message` function in such a way that whenever a change message is compiled, it substitutes field names with their verbose names if available.\n\nThe `construct_change_message` seems to already have some handling for verbose names in the context of added objects within formsets (`str(added_object._meta.verbose_name)`), indicating that part of the intended mechanism exists but might not be fully applied to all areas of change tracking, particularly the direct field changes on a model.\n\nThe focus should be on expanding or ensuring that this behavior applies consistently across all types of changes, including direct field changes. Specifically, it requires the adjustment in how `form.changed_data` is iterated over, mapping field names to their verbose names where available before appending them to the `change_message` list. \n\nTo implement the solution, understanding exactly how `form.changed_data` is structured and where it gets its field names from will be crucial, which might require looking into Django form handling and how model metadata is used."

Bug Locations:\n\n- **Location 1:** File: django/contrib/admin/utils.py, Function: construct_change_message\n    - **Intended Behavior:** This function should be modified so that when constructing the change message for changed fields (`{'changed': {'fields': form.changed_data}}`), it iterates through `form.changed_data` to replace technical field names with their corresponding verbose names. If a field does not have a verbose name specified, it should fall back to using the technical field name. This would ensure that change messages stored in the `LogEntry` class are human-readable and utilize verbose names where available.\n\n- **Location 2:** File: django/contrib/admin/options.py, Method: construct_change_message (within `ModelAdmin`)\n    - **Intended Behavior:** Although this method directly delegates to the `construct_change_message` function in `utils.py`, ensuring that any necessary adjustments are made for the method to pass along verbose names or enhance its ability to pass context that allows for the resolution of verbose names would be essential. Consideration should be given to ensure this method supports or enhances the functionality to use verbose names in change messages, possibly by providing additional metadata to `construct_change_message`. However, based on the current understanding, the primary changes will occur in `utils.py`, and adjustments here may only be necessary if additional context from the ModelAdmin is required.\n\nThe primary focus is on ensuring that the `construct_change_message` utilizes verbose names, thereby enhancing the readability and usefulness of change logs in the Django admin. This approach would preserve existing functionality while ensuring that change messages are more informative and accessible to users by displaying names that more accurately reflect the model's schema as intended by the developers."
