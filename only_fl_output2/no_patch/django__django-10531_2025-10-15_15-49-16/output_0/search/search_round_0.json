However, this is not currently the case. For example, consider a model with the following class variable:\npub_date = models.DateTimeField(\"date published\")\nChanging the publication date for an object of that model, will display \"Changed pub_date.\" in its admin history, rather than \"Change date published.\" as one would expect (as older versions of Django did).\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we'll need to identify several key pieces of the Django project where this behavior might be defined or influenced. Since the issue revolves around how changes are tracked and displayed in the admin section, particularly focusing on the use of verbose names instead of field names, we will look for classes and methods that could be responsible for generating history messages, including how changes to model fields are logged and displayed in the Django admin.\n\n1. **Search for classes related to admin history logging**: Understanding if there's a specific class handling the logging of changes in the admin interface could be crucial. The class might not be directly named after \"history\" or \"logging,\" considering Django's architecture, so we should consider broad terms like \"LogEntry\" or \"History\" as they are common in Django admin or third-party packages like `django-simple-history`.\n\n2. **Search for methods that format the change messages**: There are likely methods responsible for formatting the change messages. Methods like `construct_change_message` in Django admin could be responsible for generating the text that describes what changes were made.\n\n3. **Look for code that interacts with model verbose names**: Since the issue involves displaying verbose names instead of field names, we'll need to find where the model's field definitions are accessed to generate these messages.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are the API calls we should make:\n\n- `search_class(\"LogEntry\")`\n- `search_class(\"History\")`\n- `search_method(\"construct_change_message\")`\n- `search_code(\"models.DateTimeField\")`\n\nThese searches should help us identify the relevant classes and methods in the codebase that are likely involved in generating and displaying the change messages within the Django admin. Ensuring we understand where field names and verbose names are utilized will provide a solid foundation for crafting a solution."
