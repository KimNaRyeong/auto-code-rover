This should then be stored within an instance variable, say `self.header_rows`, for use when writing the table. This preserves existing functionality for users who do not specify `header_rows`, as the present initialization process will remain unchanged for such cases."

        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `write` method to check for `self.header_rows` and include these rows in the output when present. This adaptation will likely involve creating the correct reStructuredText formatting for these rows ahead of the data rows and ensuring they are correctly positioned at the top of the table output. The method must insert these rows in a manner that is consistent with reStructuredText formatting, which may involve additional processing for alignment and column width calculation based on both the header rows and the actual data rows. Care should be taken to ensure that when `header_rows` is not present, the output remains as it currently is to ensure backward compatibility."
