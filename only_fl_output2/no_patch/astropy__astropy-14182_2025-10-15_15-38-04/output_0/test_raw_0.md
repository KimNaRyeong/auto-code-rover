This script will catch the issue as described: it tries to execute the problematic table writing operation that uses reStructuredText with header rows, which is not currently supported by the `astropy` package and should raise a `TypeError` if the issue is present. If the issue is fixed and no exception is raised, it will print a success message and exit with code 0. If the issue is still there, it will print the stack trace, showing exactly where the error occurred, and asserts that the failure is specifically due to the unexpected keyword argument 'header_rows', indicating that the bug has been successfully reproduced.
