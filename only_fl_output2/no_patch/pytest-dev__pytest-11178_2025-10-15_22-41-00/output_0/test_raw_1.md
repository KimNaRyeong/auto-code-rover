Based on the feedback, the execution environment did not have `pytest` installed which was necessary for the reproduction script. Also, it seems there was a misunderstanding in my previous response; the script provided was indeed attempting to use `pytest` in a standalone Python script without setting up a testing environment or handling the test framework's import and execution mechanism outside of its standard usage with test runners.

Here is a revised version of the script. This version assumes that the `pytest` package is installed in the environment where the script is executed. The script manually invokes pytest's main function to run the test defined within the script. It tries to simulate a situation closer to how pytest would be used within its intended context, but still as a standalone script without directly calling `pytest` from the command line.

```python
import pytest
import sys


def test_pytest_none_approx():
    actual_result = {"a": 1.2}
    expected_result = {"a": None}
    approx_expected_result = pytest.approx(expected_result)
    assert approx_expected_result == actual_result


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', line=f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        # Dynamically add test cases to the module globals so pytest can discover them.
        globals()['test_pytest_none_approx'] = test_pytest_none_approx

        # Use pytest's main function to run the tests.
        sys.exit(pytest.main([__file__]))
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
```

This script defines a test case that should reproduce the specific `TypeError` issue when using `pytest.approx` with a `None` value in the comparison. When run, it dynamically registers the test function and uses `pytest` to execute it. Make sure `pytest` is available in your Python environment. You can install `pytest` using pip:

```sh
pip install pytest
```

Run the script with:

```sh
python3 reproducer.py
```

This setup is a bit unconventional, as it directly invokes pytest from within a Python script, which isn't typically how pytest is used. However, it attempts to address the constraints mentioned in your requirements. Please ensure that the necessary package (`pytest`) is installed in your environment for this script to work as intended.
