To ensure the script can be executed with just a Python interpreter and without requiring a prior setup of a test framework environment (like pytest in a particular virtual environment), you should handle the import of `pytest` within the script. For environments where `pytest` is not installed, you could include installation steps, but it's generally not recommended to modify the environment or install packages directly within a script meant solely to reproduce an issue.

However, based on the specific requirements and constraints, the script cannot dynamically install `pytest` if it's not already installed. Instead, it should instruct the user to ensure their environment is correctly set up before running the script. This revised approach focuses on executing the script in an environment where `pytest` is already installed, avoiding the `ModuleNotFoundError`.

Please ensure you have `pytest` installed in your environment before running this script. If `pytest` is not installed, you can install it by running `pip install pytest` from your terminal.

```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Attempt to import pytest
        import pytest
    except ImportError:
        print("This script requires pytest to be installed.", file=sys.stderr)
        print("Please install pytest by running `pip install pytest` and then re-run this script.", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

    # Minimal example to reproduce the issue
    actual_result = {"a": 1.2}
    expected_result = {"a": None}
    
    try:
        approx_expected_result = pytest.approx(expected_result)
        assert approx_expected_result == actual_result
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Successfully reproduced the issue.", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate the issue was successfully reproduced
    except Exception as e:  # Catch any other exceptions that may occur
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate an unexpected error occurred

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script is intended to run in an environment where `pytest` is already installed. It's crafted to reproduce the reported issue within such an environment, correctly handling exceptions and printing a stack trace when an unexpected error occurs.
