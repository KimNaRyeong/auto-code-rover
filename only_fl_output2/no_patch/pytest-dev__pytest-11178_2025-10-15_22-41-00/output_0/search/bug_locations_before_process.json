        "intended_behavior": "The code at this location should include additional handling for `NoneType` comparisons. When one of the values is `None`, the comparison should default to strict equality instead of attempting a subtraction operation (or any other operation that is not supported between `float` and `NoneType`). This change should preserve the functionality for numeric types while preventing the `TypeError` for `None` comparisons."
