Certainly! Here's a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that attempts to reproduce the inaccurate rendering of `pi**(1/E)` as you described. When the issue is present, it should raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace. The script will exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_inaccurate_rendering():
    from sympy import pi, E, latex, pretty

    # Evaluate the expression
    expr = pi**(1/E)

    # Expected and actual outputs for comparison
    expected_pretty = "\pi^{e^{-1}}"
    expected_str = "pi**exp(-1)"
    actual_pretty = pretty(expr)
    actual_str = str(expr)

    # Check for the presence of the issue
    if actual_pretty == expected_pretty and actual_str == expected_str:
        print("Issue fixed!")
        return True
    else:
        try:
            # Raise an AssertionError if the output is not as expected
            assert actual_pretty == expected_pretty and actual_str == expected_str, "Inaccurate rendering detected!"
        except AssertionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_inaccurate_rendering()
    except AssertionError:
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code if the issue is present
    exit(0)  # Exit with success code if the issue is fixed
```

This script specifically checks whether the representations of `pi**(1/E)` in both pretty print and string format match the expected output. If they don't match the expected values (`\pi^{e^{-1}}` for `pretty` and `pi**exp(-1)` for `str`), an `AssertionError` is raised, and a stack trace of the issue is printed out to help with debugging. If the representation matches the expected output, it prints "Issue fixed!" and exits with code 0, indicating the issue has been resolved.
