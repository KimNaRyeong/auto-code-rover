The code should ensure that it checks for and properly formats such expressions, applying the correct mathematical representation rules that would lead to the printing of expressions in a way that matches their conventional mathematical appearance. This means enhancing or fixing the logic that interprets and renders exponentiation expressions, ensuring that constants and their exponents are pretty printed in a way that's visually accurate and mathematically correct. While fixing this specific case, care must be taken to preserve the functionality for other types of expressions, ensuring that the patch does not introduce regressions or alter the intended display of other mathematical constructs.\n\n- Bug Location 2: File: sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py, Method: render\n    - Intended Behavior: While the specific method `render` was identified, the intended modification here is to ensure that the `render` method appropriately calls into or utilizes the updated logic for handling expressions like `pi**(1/E)` in `pretty.py`. If `render` contributes directly to the way expressions are transformed into their pretty printed versions, then ensuring it respects the improved formatting logic for such expressions is necessary. It should integrate seamlessly with the fixed or enhanced mechanisms for dealing with exponentiation and constants, such that the output is both mathematically correct and visually consistent with expectations. This might involve adjusting how `render` interprets mathematical operations or enhancing the interface between `pretty.py` and `stringpict.py` to support the correct pretty printing of complex expressions."
