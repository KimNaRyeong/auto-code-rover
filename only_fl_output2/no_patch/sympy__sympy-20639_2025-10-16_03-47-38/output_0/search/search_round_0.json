Search for the `pretty` module or similar classes that would likely contain the rendering logic for mathematical expressions since the issue mentions a problem in `printing.pretty`.\n2. Search for any method that might be directly responsible for rendering expressions to their pretty form. Given the nature of the bug, it's possible that methods responsible for handling exponentiation (`**` operator) or formatting of constants like `pi` and `E` would be relevant.\n3. Search for the specific code snippet `pi**(1/E)` in the codebase to see if there are any special handling or known issues around this expression.\n\nBased on this analysis, here are my API calls:\n\n- search_code(\"printing.pretty\")\n- search_method(\"render\")\n- search_code(\"pi**(1/E)\")"
