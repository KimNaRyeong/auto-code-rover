        "intended_behavior": "The `_make_hash_value` method in the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class needs to be altered to include the user's email address in the hash value calculation. This change ensures that any alteration to the user's email results in the invalidation of previously issued password reset tokens.\n\nTo preserve existing functionality and accommodate user models that might not have an email field, the method should first check if the user model has an email field or property and, if it exists, include it in the hash value calculation. This inclusion can be done directly or through a hash of the email to maintain consistency and security.\n\nThe modified code within `_make_hash_value` might look something like this:\n\ndef _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):\n    # Existing code to prepare user's state components.\n    login_timestamp = '' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)\n    email = getattr(user, 'email', '')\n    return f\"{user.pk}{user.password}{login_timestamp}{timestamp}{email}\"\n\nThis modification ensures that any password reset tokens generated henceforth are securely tied not only to the user's password and login state but also to their current email address. Changes to the user's email address will thus require a new token to be generated for password resets, enhancing security and addressing the issue at hand."
