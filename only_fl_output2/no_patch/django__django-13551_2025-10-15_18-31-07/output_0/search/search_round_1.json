        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insights into the components involved in the issue and their role in achieving the intended behavior. Let's break down the analysis based on the information retrieved.\n\n### PasswordResetTokenGenerator in `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n- The `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class generates and checks tokens used for password resets. This is crucial for securing the process of resetting a user's password, ensuring that the request is legitimate and that the token used is valid and unexpired.\n- The `_make_hash_value` method specifically combines the user's primary key, their password, and the timestamp (among other elements) to generate a hash value. This value is part of the mechanism ensuring that each token is unique and tied to the current state of the user's account.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug\n- The issue is that changing the email address of a user doesn't invalidate an existing password reset token, potentially leaving an exploitable gap. Since tokens are meant to be invalidated when significant account information changes (to prevent misuse), the failure to include the user's email in the hash value computation means tokens remain valid even after such changes.\n\n#### Intended behavior\n- Ideally, changing the email address should alter the user's state in a way that invalidates any previously issued password reset tokens. By including the email (or its hash) in the generation of the password reset token's hash value, any change to the email address would result in future checks against older tokens failing, as the tokens would be bound not only to the password and timestamp but also to the email address at the time of token generation.\n\n### AbstractBaseUser in `django/contrib/auth/base_user.py`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n- `AbstractBaseUser` serves as the base class for user models, providing essential fields like `password` and `last_login`, and methods for managing user authentication and identification.\n- This class is designed to be flexible and extendable, allowing developers to build upon it or customize user authentication to fit different projects' needs.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug\n- The reference to `AbstractBaseUser` in the issue description highlights a design consideration: not all user models are required to have an email field, as the base class doesn't enforce it. This variability necessitates a robust and flexible approach to handling password reset tokens, one that accounts for different user model configurations.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nGiven the issue and the analysis, the intention is to ensure that password reset tokens are tied to critical user state information that, when altered, should invalidate these tokens. Since `AbstractBaseUser` does not strictly require an email field, any solution must either conditionally include the user's email in the token generation process or find a universal attribute present in all user configurations to use instead.\n\n---\n\nBased on this analysis, the next steps might involve:\n- Modifying the `_make_hash_value` method to conditionally include the user's email in the token's hash value calculation if the email field is present and utilized.\n- Ensuring that this modification gracefully handles the variability of user models, perhaps by checking for the presence of an email field or a related attribute that changes when significant user details are updated."

This change ensures that any alteration to the user's email results in the invalidation of previously issued password reset tokens.\n\n   To preserve existing functionality and accommodate user models that might not have an email field, the method should first check if the user model has an email field or property and, if it exists, include it in the hash value calculation. This inclusion can be done directly or through a hash of the email to maintain consistency and security.\n\n   The modified code within `_make_hash_value` might look something like this:\n\n   ```python\n   def _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):\n       # Existing code to prepare user's state components.\n       login_timestamp = '' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)\n       email = getattr(user, 'email', '')\n       return f\"{user.pk}{user.password}{login_timestamp}{timestamp}{email}\"\n   ```\n\n   This modification ensures that any password reset tokens generated henceforth are securely tied not only to the user's password and login state but also to their current email address. Changes to the user's email address will thus require a new token to be generated for password resets, enhancing security and addressing the issue at hand."
