Specifically, we are interested in the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class, and possibly the method `_make_hash_value` within it, as well as any reference to AbstractBaseUser with respect to handling emails. Here are the specific API calls that would be helpful:\n\n- `search_class(\"PasswordResetTokenGenerator\")`: This will help us locate the file(s) where `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class is defined.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_make_hash_value\", \"PasswordResetTokenGenerator\")`: This is needed to find the implementation details of the `_make_hash_value` method within the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class, which is essential for the proposed solution.\n- `search_class(\"AbstractBaseUser\")`: Understanding how the `AbstractBaseUser` class is implemented would give insight into how emails and possibly password reset tokens are managed, especially since the issue notes that nothing forces a user to have an email as per this class."
