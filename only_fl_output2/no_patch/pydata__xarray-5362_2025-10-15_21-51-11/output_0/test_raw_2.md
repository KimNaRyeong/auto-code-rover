Certainly! Based on the requirement to properly handle and report an error for weighted operations when dimensions do not exist, I am providing a revised version of the script. This version fully incorporates the correct usage of exception handling and system imports, ensuring that it can accurately report whether the issue is present or not by raising an `AssertionError` for the failure of expectations regarding the behavior of weighted operations.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import sys

    try:
        import xarray as xr
        ds = xr.Dataset({'air': (('time', 'lat', 'lon'), [[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]])})
        # This line should either raise an ValueError for the non-existent dimension or not proceed quietly.
        result = ds.weighted(xr.ones_like(ds["air"])).mean("dummy_dimension")
        
        # If no error is raised, we manually raise an AssertionError.
        raise AssertionError("Weighted operation with non-existent dimension should raise an error, but it did not.")
        
    except AssertionError as e:
        # Catch the AssertionError specifically to print its stack trace.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero exit code to indicate test failure.
        
    except ValueError as e:
        # If a ValueError is caught, this means the expected behavior occurs when a non-existent dimension is referenced.
        print("Correctly caught ValueError for non-existent dimension in weighted operation.", file=sys.stderr)
        exit(0) # Exit with a zero exit code to indicate test success.
        
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch all other exceptions to print their stack trace, indicating an unexpected issue occurred.
        print("An unexpected error occurred:", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1) # Exit indicating test failure due to an unexpected error.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script checks if performing a weighted operation with a non-existent dimension leads to proper error handling. If no exception is raised when `mean()` is called with a dimension that does not exist, this script explicitly raises an `AssertionError`. Conversely, if a `ValueError` is raised, indicating the issue has been fixed (i.e., the behavior now correctly checks for the existence of dimensions), the script exits with code 0, indicating success. Any other unexpected exceptions are also caught and reported, allowing for a quick diagnosis.
