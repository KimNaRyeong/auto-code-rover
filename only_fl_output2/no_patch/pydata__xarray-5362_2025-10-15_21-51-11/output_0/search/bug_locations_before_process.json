        "intended_behavior": "Modify the mean method (and similarly affected methods within the Weighted class) to include a check at the beginning of the method to verify that all specified dimensions exist in the data. If any of the specified dimensions do not exist, the method should raise a ValueError with a message indicating the non-existent dimension(s). This preserves the existing functionality by allowing valid weighted operations to proceed as before while introducing error handling for attempts to operate on non-existent dimensions. This error-checking routine should be designed in a way that it can be reused by other methods within the Weighted class to ensure consistency and reduce code duplication."
