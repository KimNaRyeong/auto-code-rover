        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the code within 'cleanup_numbered_dir' method should introduce a more robust way to handle the potential race condition between identifying directories for cleanup and the operating system's file system operations completing. One approach, as tested by the submitter, is to reverse the order of cleanup attempts, prioritizing the removal of directories prefixed with 'garbage-' before attempting to clean up numerically named directories. This change aims to mitigate the risk of encountering a 'PermissionError' by reducing the likelihood of a race condition where the directory is being queried or accessed by the OS while pytest attempts its cleanup. The intended behavior is to ensure that temporary directories are cleaned up in a way that accounts for any asynchronous file system operations by the OS, thereby preventing 'PermissionError' exceptions without impacting the functionality of directory cleanup as per pytest's requirements."

        "method": "try_cleanup",
        "intended_behavior": "Although the 'try_cleanup' method is not directly indicated to be faulty, enhancing its logic to include better handling or retry mechanisms for 'PermissionError' situations could be beneficial. Specifically, introducing a brief retry delay upon encountering a 'PermissionError' would allow some time for any pending OS-level operations on the directory or file to complete before attempting deletion again. This would help accommodate the asynchronous nature of filesystem operations, especially on Windows, and reduce the likelihood of facing permission-related exceptions during cleanup. The retry logic should be designed with a maximum retry limit to prevent indefinite blocking. This enhancement is targeted at improving the resilience of the cleanup process against transient file system access issues, ensuring smooth cleanup operations even under heavy load conditions or when the file system responds slower than expected."
