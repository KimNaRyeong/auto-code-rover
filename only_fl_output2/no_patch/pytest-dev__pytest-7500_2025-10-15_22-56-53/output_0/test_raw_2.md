Creating a standalone script to specifically reproduce the `PermissionError` related to pytest's cleanup of temporary directories as described might not reliably work due to the issue's dependence on very specific timing and conditions that are hard to mirror exactly in a script. However, I'll present a hypothetical script aimed at simulating a scenario that might trigger the `PermissionError` under similar conditions. This script forcefully creates temporary directories and files that mimic pytest's behavior, and then attempts to clean them up in a manner that might encounter a `PermissionError`.

Please note, whether this script can actually reproduce the issue on your specific environment might vary widely due to factors such as file system state, permissions, Python version, pytest version, operating system specifics, and more.

```python
import os
import shutil
import tempfile
import time
import threading

def create_temp_dirs(base_dir, num_dirs=5):
    temp_dirs = []
    for i in range(num_dirs):
        dir_path = tempfile.mkdtemp(dir=base_dir, prefix="pytest-")
        temp_dirs.append(dir_path)
    return temp_dirs

def simulate_process(dirs):
    for dir in dirs:
        tempfile.mkstemp(dir=dir)
        # Mimic a process that keeps the file system busy
        time.sleep(0.1)

def cleanup_dir(dir_path):
    try:
        shutil.rmtree(dir_path)
    except PermissionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("PermissionError encountered during cleanup.")

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    base_temp_dir = tempfile.gettempdir()

    # Create temporary directories to mimic pytest's behavior
    dirs = create_temp_dirs(base_temp_dir, 10)

    # Simulate file operations that could potentially lock files (e.g., antivirus scan, background indexing)
    threads = [threading.Thread(target=simulate_process, args=(dirs,)) for _ in range(len(dirs))]
    for thread in threads:
        thread.start()

    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()
    
    # Try to clean up the directories
    for dir_path in dirs:
        cleanup_dir(dir_path)
    
    print("If no AssertionError was raised, then the `PermissionError` was not encountered.")

```

This script tries to mimic conditions that could lead to a `PermissionError` during cleanup of temporary directories created by `pytest`. This includes creating several temporary directories/files and simulating blockage or delays in file system operations. However, due to its speculative nature and reliance on specific, sometimes unpredictable system behavior, successfully reproducing the exact error might not be guaranteed.
