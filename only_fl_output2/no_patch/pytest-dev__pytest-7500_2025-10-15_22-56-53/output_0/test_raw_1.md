Given the constraints and goals, writing a script to forcefully reproduce a `PermissionError` during pytest's cleanup phase requires a setup that induces the error condition described. This script will mimic creating temporary directories and files that pytest would use, simulate load, and then try to clean them up, aiming to trigger a `PermissionError`. However, it's important to note that reproducing environmental issues like this one might not always be possible due to the complexities and specific conditions of your original environment.

Here's an attempt to create a more focused `reproducer.py`:

```python
import os
import tempfile
import threading
import time

def create_temp_dirs(base_dir, count=10):
    """Creates temporary directories to simulate the pytest environment."""
    dirs = []
    for _ in range(count):
        temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp(dir=base_dir)
        dirs.append(temp_dir)
    return dirs

def simulate_load_on_dirs(dirs):
    """Simulates load by creating and deleting files within the directories."""
    for d in dirs:
        for _ in range(100):
            file_path = os.path.join(d, tempfile.mkstemp(dir=d)[1])
            with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
                f.write("Simulating load.\n")
            os.remove(file_path)

def cleanup_temp_dirs(dirs):
    """Attempts to cleanup the temporary directories, potentially triggering the issue."""
    for d in dirs:
        try:
            os.rmdir(d)
        except PermissionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("Cleanup failed due to PermissionError.") from e

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    base_temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()

    try:
        dirs = create_temp_dirs(base_temp_dir, 10)

        # Simulating load in parallel to more closely mimic pytest's behavior and issues under load.
        threads = [threading.Thread(target=simulate_load_on_dirs, args=(dirs,)) for _ in range(5)]
        for thread in threads:
            thread.start()
        
        for thread in threads:
            thread.join()

        cleanup_temp_dirs(dirs)
        print("Cleanup successful. If this was reached without errors, the issue did not reproduce.")

    except AssertionError:
        exit(1)  # Non-zero exit code to indicate error.
    finally:
        # Final cleanup in an attempt to remove the base temporary directory.
        try:
            os.rmdir(base_temp_dir)
        except OSError as e:
            # Directory not empty or other issue.
            print(f"Final cleanup failed: {e}")
```

This script goes beyond the straightforward pytest usage described in the original problem by directly attempting to replicate the conditions under which a `PermissionError` might arise. The script focuses on creating and cleaning up temporary directories under load, simulating the behavior that might lead to the observed issue.

Keep in mind, the actual occurrence of the `PermissionError` may depend on many external factors, including OS state, file system specifics, permissions, and timing, making it potentially difficult to reliably reproduce in a simple script.
