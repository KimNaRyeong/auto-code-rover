Certainly! Below is the `reproducer.py` Python script that aims to reproduce the discussed issue with `pytest`. This script intentionally creates multiple temporary directories to mimic the environment that leads to a `PermissionError` during cleanup. It includes checks to trigger an `AssertionError` when the issue is reproducible and prints a detailed stack trace.

```python
import os
import tempfile
from subprocess import PIPE, Popen

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_test_script():
    # Generate a Python test script for pytest
    test_script = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, suffix='.py', mode='w', encoding='utf-8')
    test_script.write("""
import pytest

def test_temp(tmp_path_factory):
    for _ in range(1000):
        tmp_path_factory.mktemp("temp")
""")
    test_script.close()

    # Try running the pytest on the generated script
    try:
        cmd = ['pytest', test_script.name]
        process = Popen(cmd, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE, text=True)
        stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
        if process.returncode == 0:
            print("No issues during cleanup.")
        else:
            raise Exception("Test failed, potential cleanup issue")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Clean up the created temporary test script
        os.unlink(test_script.name)
        raise e

    # Clean up the created temporary test script outside the try-except block
    os.unlink(test_script.name)

def reproduce_issue():
    tmp_dir_path = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    os.environ['TMPDIR'] = tmp_dir_path

    try:
        # Create 3 temporary folders to meet the condition mentioned
        for _ in range(3):
            tempfile.mkdtemp()

        run_test_script()

        # If no exceptions till here, issue is not reproduced
        print("Issue not reproduced. Exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert isinstance(e, PermissionError), "Expected a PermissionError."
    finally:
        # Cleanup: Remove the environment variable after test
        del os.environ['TMPDIR']

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

Note: This script uses subprocess to invoke `pytest` and might need adjustments based on the environment it's being run in. The assumption here is that `pytest` is installed and correctly configured in the environment where this script will execute. Also, it modifies the `TMPDIR` environment variable to ensure temporary files are created in a controlled location for the test. It's essential to run this script in a Python environment where altering `TMPDIR` is safe and does not interfere with other parallel processes or tests.
