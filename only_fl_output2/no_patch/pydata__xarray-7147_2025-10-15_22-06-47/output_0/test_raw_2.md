Given the clarification and instructions, here is an updated standalone python file named `reproducer.py`. This script follows the requirements to print a stack trace clearly and adheres to the logic to exit with the correct status based on whether the issue is reproduced or fixed.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_issue():
    import xarray as xr
    TIME_ATTRS = {"units": "days since 0001-01-01", "calendar": "noleap"}
    valid_times = xr.DataArray([0, 1], dims=["time"], attrs=TIME_ATTRS, name="valid_times")
    invalid_times = xr.DataArray([1e36, 2e36], dims=["time"], attrs=TIME_ATTRS, name="invalid_times")
    ds = xr.merge([valid_times, invalid_times])

    try:
        xr.decode_cf(ds)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        error_message = str(e)
        expected_variable_in_error = "invalid_times"
        if expected_variable_in_error not in error_message:
            raise AssertionError(f"Error message does not contain the problematic variable's name: '{expected_variable_in_error}'")
        else:
            print("The issue seems to be fixed as the error message contains the expected variable name.")
            return True
    return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    issue_fixed = False
    try:
        issue_fixed = check_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
    except Exception as ex:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {ex}")
        print_stacktrace(ex)

    if issue_fixed:
        print("Exiting with code 0. The issue seems to be fixed.")
        exit(0)
    else:
        print("Exiting with code 1. The issue is present.")
        exit(1)
```

This script attempts to catch and display an error specifically when an attempt to decode time units fails due to out-of-bounds time values in a Dataset containing both valid and invalid time variables. The script particularly checks if the error message includes the name of the problematic variable. If not, it raises an `AssertionError` indicating that the issue is present. If the script executes without such an error, it suggests the issue might be fixed, or another unexpected error occurred.
