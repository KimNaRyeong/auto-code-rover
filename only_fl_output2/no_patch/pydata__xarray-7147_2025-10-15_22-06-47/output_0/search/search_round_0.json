However, this error message will not indicate the problematic variable's name.  It would be nice if it did, because it would make it easier for users to determine the source of the error.\ncc: @durack1\nxref: Unidata/cftime#295\n### Example\nThis is a minimal example of the issue.

        "content": "To address the reported issue effectively, I will need to gather more context about the relevant parts of the codebase where modifications may be necessary. Given the error traceback and the details provided in the issue description, I will start by searching for key methods and classes involved in the error:\n\n1. Search for the `decode_cf` method in the conventions module. This is because the error traceback ends in a call to `decode_cf` method, making it a critical point for modification.\n\n2. Search for the `CFDatetimeCoder` class, as it's involved in the decoding process and throws the final error message. Understanding this class will be crucial for implementing a more informative error message, including the variable name causing the issue.\n\n3. Search for the `_decode_cf_datetime_dtype` method in the times module. The traceback indicates that this method is directly involved in throwing the error message, which doesn't include the variable name. Modifying this method could be a direct way to enhance the error message.\n\n4. Search for the use of `decode_cf_variable` in the conventions.py file. This seems to be a higher-level function calling the decoding process and might be a suitable place for catching and enhancing the error message with the variable name.\n\nHere are the API calls based on the above analysis:\n\n- `search_method(\"decode_cf\")`\n- `search_class(\"CFDatetimeCoder\")`\n- `search_method(\"_decode_cf_datetime_dtype\")`\n- `search_code_in_file(\"decode_cf_variable\", \"conventions.py\")`"
