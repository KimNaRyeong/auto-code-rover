This could be done by catching exceptions related to time decoding within the method and raising a new exception that includes both the original error message and the name of the variable being processed. The enhancement should preserve the method's primary functionality of decoding variables, adding only the improvement in error messaging."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to the `CFDatetimeCoder.decode` method, this function should also be modified to accept a variable name as an argument and include this variable name in any error message related to the failure of time decoding. Since it is directly involved in the traceback leading to the error observed by the user, enriching its error output with the variable name provides clearer debugging cues. The modification should ensure that all current calls to this function are updated to pass the necessary variable name without altering the core logic of time decoding."
