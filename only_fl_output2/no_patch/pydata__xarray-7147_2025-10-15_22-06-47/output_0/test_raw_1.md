Based on the feedback and the need to accurately reproduce the issue so it exits with the correct status and prints the stack trace when the issue is present, let's provide a corrected version of the `reproducer.py` script. This iteration will specifically check for the presence of the issue and raise a custom message if the problematic variable's name is not included in the error message.

```python
# reproducerer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    import xarray as xr

    TIME_ATTRS = {"units": "days since 0001-01-01", "calendar": "noleap"}
    valid_times = xr.DataArray([0, 1], dims=["time"], attrs=TIME_ATTRS, name="valid_times")
    invalid_times = xr.DataArray([1e36, 2e36], dims=["time"], attrs=TIME_ATTRS, name="invalid_times")
    ds = xr.merge([valid_times, invalid_times])

    try:
        xr.decode_cf(ds)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Test for issue criteria: Error message does not contain the problematic variable's name
        if "invalid_times" not in str(e):
            raise AssertionError("Error message does not contain the problematic variable's name: 'invalid_times'")
    else:
        print("No exception raised. The issue might be fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with an error code to indicate the issue is present.
    else:
        print("Exiting with code 0. The issue seems to be fixed.")
        exit(0)
```

This script makes sure to:
- Attempt decoding a dataset that includes both valid and invalid time data arrays, which should provoke an error related to time decoding.
- Catch the exception and print out the stack trace for debugging purposes.
- Check specifically if the name of the problematic variable (`"invalid_times"`) is missing in the error message and raises an `AssertionError` if so. This assertion ensures that the specific issue in question is being caught.
- Exit with code `1` if the issue is detected to indicate failure (issue is present) and exit with code `0` if the issue appears to be resolved (no issue detected).
