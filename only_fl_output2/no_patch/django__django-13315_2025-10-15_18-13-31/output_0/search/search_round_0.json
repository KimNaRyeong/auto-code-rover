        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue related to \"limit_choices_to on a ForeignKey can render duplicate options in formfield,\" the following search API calls would be essential:\n\n1. First, we need to identify the Django model field class responsible for handling `ForeignKey` fields, as this is where the `limit_choices_to` attribute would be used. Django models are defined within models.py files or any custom module intended for model definitions. However, the `ForeignKey` field is part of Django's models module, so we would search for the class definition in the entire codebase:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"ForeignKey\")\n```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a problem when passing a `Q` object as `limit_choices_to`, it would be useful to examine how `Q` objects are being handled within the `ForeignKey` field class. Searching for the method that deals with `Q` objects within the `ForeignKey` class could reveal where the issue stems from:\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"limit_choices_to\", \"ForeignKey\")\n```\n\n3. The problem also suggests a regression test has been included in the patch, which means there should be code relating to tests that demonstrate the issue. This might be found in a `tests.py` file or a test module specific to the Django app's models or form fields. We should search for a snippet of code that references `limit_choices_to` in a testing context. For accuracy, the phrase \"test\" would likely appear in the filename:\n\n```python\nsearch_code_in_file(\"limit_choices_to\", \"tests.py\")\n```\n\n(Adjust the file name in the above query if the project uses a different naming convention for test files or if there are multiple test files.)\n\nThese API calls collectively aim to uncover how `ForeignKey` fields process `limit_choices_to` attributes, especially with `Q` objects, and how the existing tests demonstrate the problem. This information should provide a solid foundation for understanding the bug and guiding the code patch development."
