        "intended_behavior": "The `formfield` method should ensure the queryset used for the `ModelChoiceField` is distinct when `limit_choices_to` is applied, especially when it involves a `Q` object with joins that could lead to duplicate options. This might involve adjusting the queryset construction within this method or ensuring that any applied `limit_choices_to` conditions are followed by a distinct filter on the queryset. This change must preserve the method's existing functionality to allow for specifying custom form classes, querysets, and other parameters, only adding the distinct call where applicable to prevent duplicates."
