Given the feedback and the requirements, here's an adjusted `reproducer.py` script. This version does not rely on Django's test infrastructure and should be executable directly in the context of a Django project. It's designed to be self-contained and raises an `AssertionError` with a clear stack trace if the issue is present, and exits with code 0 if the issue is fixed.

Please note, you will need to adjust `your_project.settings` and `your_app.models.Book` to fit your Django project's structure. This script assumes Django is properly installed and configured, and a model named `Book` exists within your application.

```python
import os
import sys
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db.models import Exists, Q

# Setup Django environment
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project.settings')
django.setup()

# Assuming 'Book' is in 'your_app.models'
from your_app.models import Book  

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_combine_negated():
    try:
        q = Q() & ~Exists(Book.objects.all())
        assert q.negated, "The combination of an empty Q object with a negated Exists lookup should be negated."
        print("Test passed: The issue appears to be fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error status if the assertion fails

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_combine_negated()
```

**Instructions:**

1. Replace `'your_project.settings'` with the actual path to your Django project settings (e.g., `'myproject.settings'`).
2. Replace `'your_app.models.Book'` with the actual path to your `Book` model within your project.
3. Save this script as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your Django project.
4. Run the script using `python3 reproducer.py`.

This script directly tests the logic without using Django's `TestCase`. The assertion checks the behavior of combining an empty `Q` object with a negated `Exists` lookup. If the `q.negated` is `True` as expected when the issue is fixed, the script exits successfully. If not, it prints a stack trace and exits with an error status, indicating the problem still exists.
