Certainly! To address the initial misunderstanding and to follow your instructions accurately, below is a standalone python file `reproducer.py` designed to be more generic and not tied to any Django project settings or specific models. This script attempts to dynamically create a testing environment to reproduce the described issue without assuming any particular Django project setup. 

Please note, this script will now attempt to dynamically create a minimal Django configuration and a test model to reproduce the issue. However, remember that dynamically setting up a model and Django environment like this is not a common practice and might not cover all edge cases as a fullyconfigured Django project would.

```python
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Exists, Q

settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=[
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    ],
    USE_TZ=True,
)

django.setup()

# Create a simple model to work with
class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)

from django.test import TestCase

class TestEmptyQExistsCombination(TestCase):
    @classmethod
    def setUpTestData(cls):
        Book.objects.create(title="Sample Book")

    def test_combine(self):
        q = Q() & Exists(Book.objects.all())
        self.assertFalse(q.negated)  # passes

    def test_combine_negated(self):
        q = Q() & ~Exists(Book.objects.all())
        self.assertTrue(q.negated)  # should fail but doesn't

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        TestEmptyQExistsCombination().runTest('test_combine_negated')
        print("Test passed: The issue appears to be fixed.")
        os._exit(0)  # Exit normally
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        os._exit(1)  # Exit with error
```

**How to use this script:**

1. Copy the provided `reproducer.py` script to the root directory of any Django project, or to a new directory if you're testing it in isolation.
2. Run the script using `python3 reproducer.py`.

The script dynamically configures a minimal Django environment, creates a temporary in-memory database, and defines a simple `Book` model. It then defines a test case that replicates the issue described and attempts to run the test. If the assertion fails (meaning the issue is present), it prints a stack trace. If no assertion errors are raised, it implies the issue has been fixed or cannot be reproduced under the test conditions.
