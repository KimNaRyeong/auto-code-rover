        "content": "To address the described issue effectively, we need more context around how `Q` objects and the `Exists` lookup interact, especially when combined using bitwise operators. Here are the API calls that would help gather this context:\n\n1. Search for the `Q` class to understand how it's structured and how it handles logical operations (like `&` and `~`).\n   \n   `search_class(\"Q\")`\n\n2. Search for the `Exists` class to understand its implementation details, particularly how negation is handled or propagated.\n\n   `search_class(\"Exists\")`\n\n3. Since the issue involves combining `Q` objects with `Exists` using bitwise operators, it's crucial to look into how these operators are overridden or implemented within these classes. Specifically, we should examine the `__and__` method for 'Q' and `__invert__` method for both `Q` and `Exists`.\n\n   `search_method_in_class(\"__and__\", \"Q\")`\n   \n   `search_method_in_class(\"__invert__\", \"Q\")`\n   \n   `search_method_in_class(\"__invert__\", \"Exists\")`\n\n4. Given that the issue might be rooted in how negation is handled generally, find how negation (`negated` attribute) is managed within the source code.\n\n   `search_code(\"negated\")`\n\nThese API calls will provide a good starting point for understanding the issue's context and pinpointing where in the Django codebase the logic might need to be adjusted."
