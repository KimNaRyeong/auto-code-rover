This might involve checking if the `other` argument is an instance of `Exists`, and if so, maintaining its `negated` state correctly in the resulting `Q` object. The goal is to keep the logical integrity of the combination, such that combining `Q()` with `~Exists(...)` results in a `Q` object that accurately represents the SQL equivalent of \"AND NOT EXISTS (...).\""

        "intended_behavior": "The `__invert__` method correctly toggles the `negated` attribute of the `Exists` instance. This behavior appears to be implemented as intended. However, the interaction with the `Q` class, particularly how `Q` objects interpret the `negated` state of an `Exists` instance when combined, needs to ensure that the state is preserved correctly. It's not the `__invert__` method itself within `Exists` that needs adjusting but how this negated state is recognized when an `Exists` instance is combined with a `Q` object. Therefore, the focus should be on ensuring interoperability with `Q` rather than changing the `Exists.__invert__` behavior directly."
