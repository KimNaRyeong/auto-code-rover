        "intended_behavior": "The method(s) responsible for comparing FITS file contents, particularly table data, need to correctly handle VLAs by ensuring that their contents are compared accurately. This involves ensuring that VLAs of the same size and containing identical elements are recognized as such, even if their memory representation or the order of elements within each VLA may slightly vary. Existing functionality for comparing FITS files, including header comparison and handling of standard array columns, must be preserved while improving VLA comparison logic to prevent false negatives."

        "intended_behavior": "The `from_columns` method or related processing functions involved in creating binary table HDUs from column definitions should correctly handle and represent VLAs according to FITS standards, ensuring that when such HDUs are written to disk, they are represented consistently. When comparing the resultant file to itself or another file with identical contents, the representation of VLAs should not lead to perceived differences. This means conserving the VLA data integrity during the write-read cycle and ensuring that this process does not introduce discrepancies recognized falsely as differences by `FITSDiff`."
