This script will attempt to reproduce the described issue by creating a FITS file with a single VLA (Variable Length Array) column, writing it to disk, and then using `fits.FITSDiff` to compare this file to itself. If the files are reported as not being identical—which they are, since it's the same file being compared—the script will raise an `AssertionError` with a clear and descriptive message, then print the stack trace where the assertion failed for diagnostic purposes. If `fits.FITSDiff` correctly identifies the files as identical (indicating the issue is fixed or not present), the script will quietly terminate with exit code 0, signalling success.
