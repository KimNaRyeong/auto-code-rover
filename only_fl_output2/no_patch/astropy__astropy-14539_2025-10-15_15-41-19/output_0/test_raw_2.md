To match your requirements and ensure that the `reproducer.py` script correctly detects the described issue, raises an `AssertionError` when the bug is present, and exits cleanly when the issue is resolved, see the updated script below. This version also corrects any misunderstandings from the previous example and ensures that the provided `print_stacktrace` function is utilized correctly.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from astropy.io import fits

    try:
        # Create a FITS file with a variable-length array and write it to disk
        col = fits.Column('a', format='QD', array=[[0], [0, 0]])
        hdu = fits.BinTableHDU.from_columns([col])
        filename = 'diffbug.fits'
        hdu.writeto(filename, overwrite=True)

        # Compare the FITS file to itself using FITSDiff
        diff = fits.FITSDiff(filename, filename)
        identical = diff.identical

        # Check if FITSDiff mistakenly reports the files as not identical
        assert identical, "Identical files are reported to be different."
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with non-zero status code to indicate a failure/reproduction of the issue
    else:
        print("Test passed: Identical files comparison resulted as expected.")
        exit(0)  # Exit with zero to indicate success/no issue

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script will:
- First, try to reproduce the issue by creating a FITS file containing a variable-length array and comparing it to itself using `astropy.io.fits.FITSDiff`.
- If `FITSDiff` incorrectly reports differences (i.e., the `identical` flag is `False` when comparing the file against itself), an `AssertionError` is raised.
- The custom `print_stacktrace` function is called if any exception is caught, providing detailed information about the source of the error.
- The script exits with code `1` if an error occurred (indicating the issue was successfully reproduced) and with code `0` if not (indicating the issue has been resolved or could not be reproduced).

Run this script from the root directory of your project with Python 3 by executing `python3 reproducer.py` in your terminal. It assumes that the required packages (`astropy`) are properly installed in your Python environment.
