Given the requirements and the need to ensure the script behaves as intended, below is an updated version of `reproducer.py` that includes the correct structure and functionality to reproduce the described issue. This script takes into account your request for a clear stack trace upon encountering an error.

```python
# reproducer.py
from astropy.io import fits

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    try:
        col = fits.Column('a', format='QD', array=[[0], [0, 0]])
        hdu = fits.BinTableHDU.from_columns([col])
        hdu.writeto('diffbug.fits', overwrite=True)

        diff_result = fits.FITSDiff('diffbug.fits', 'diffbug.fits').identical
        if not diff_result:
            raise AssertionError("Identical files are reported to be different.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero code to indicate failure
    else:
        print("Test passed: Identical files comparison resulted as expected.")
        exit(0)  # Exit with zero to indicate success

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

This script will generate a FITS file with variable length arrays, then compare this same file against itself using `astropy.io.fits.FITSDiff` to check for differences. If `FITSDiff` asserts the files are not identical (which should not happen as they are the same file), this is caught as an AssertionError, and the stack trace is printed out detailing where the error occurred. This behavior fulfills both the requirement to exit with code 0 when the issue is successfully reproduced (indicating the presence of a bug) and to provide detailed debugging information upon failure.
