While this indeed corresponds to `AxesImage.get_size`, this is not consistent with the numpy API, where `array.shape = (nrows, ncols)` and `array.size = nrows * ncols`.\nPerhaps we can consider 1) tweaking `__str__` to `AxesImage(shape=(nrows, ncols))` instead, and add `get_shape` as an alias for `get_size`?  Alternatively, `get_shape` could return `self._A.shape` (i.e., including whether the data is colormapped, RGB, or RGBA), and we could use *that* info in `__str__`?  (displaying whether the data is colormapped/RGB/RGBA seems reasonably useful)\n### Proposed solution\n_No response_\n</issue>"
