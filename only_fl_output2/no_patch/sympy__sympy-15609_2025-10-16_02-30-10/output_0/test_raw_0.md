Below is the `reproducer.py` file as you requested. This script tries to reproduce the stated issue with the LaTeX string for an indexed matrix expression. It runs the code snippet involving SymPy to produce a LaTeX representation of a matrix operation and checks if the produced LaTeX string contains a double subscript `_`, which LaTeX and MathJax can't compile. Upon detecting the issue, it raises an `AssertionError`, prints a stack trace, and exits with code 0 when the issue does not exist (i.e., the issue is fixed).

```python
import sys

# Function to print a stack trace for exceptions
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import symbols, MatrixSymbol, latex

    # Define symbols and matrices
    i, j, k = symbols("i j k")
    M = MatrixSymbol("M", k, k)
    N = MatrixSymbol("N", k, k)

    # Produce and check the LaTeX representation
    try:
        latex_str = latex((M*N)[i, j])

        # Checking for the double subscript issue in the LaTeX string
        if "__" in latex_str:
            raise AssertionError("Detected double subscript in LaTeX string, which is not compilable.")
        else:
            print("Issue not present, exiting with code 0.")
            sys.exit(0)
            
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # To indicate failure when executed, but the instruction was to exit with 0 when fixed
```

This script:
- Imports necessary functions and classes from `sys` and `sympy`.
- Defines a `main` function that reproduces the issue by generating a LaTeX string for an indexed matrix expression.
- Checks if the resulting LaTeX string contains an impermissible double subscript error.
- Raises an `AssertionError` if the problem persists, prints the stack trace for diagnostic purposes, and exits with code 1 to signify an error.
- Exits with code 0 when the script does not detect the issue, indicating that it has been fixed according to your instructions.
