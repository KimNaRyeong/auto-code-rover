Given the instructions and the specific requirements for handling errors and exit codes, I'm adjusting the approach to ensure the script identifies the issue correctly with an `AssertionError` when the LaTeX string problem (double subscript) is detected, and exits with code 0 only if the issue has been rectified.

```python
import sys

# Function to print a stack trace for exceptions
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import symbols, MatrixSymbol, latex

    # Define symbols and matrices
    i, j, k = symbols("i j k")
    M = MatrixSymbol("M", k, k)
    N = MatrixSymbol("N", k, k)

    # Produce the LaTeX representation
    latex_str = latex((M*N)[i, j])

    # Check the LaTeX string for correctness
    issue_identified = "__" in latex_str  # Checking for the double subscript error
    if issue_identified:
        error_message = "Detected double subscript in LaTeX string, which is not compilable."
        print(error_message)
        raise AssertionError(error_message)
    else:
        print("Issue not present, exiting with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
```

Please note:

- The script will raise an `AssertionError` if it detects the double subscript issue by checking for `__` in the LaTeX string, which should directly match the reported problem of a "double subscript" (`_`) that both LaTeX and MathJax cannot compile.
- When the issue is detected, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints a stack trace by calling the `print_stacktrace` function.
- It exits with code 0 only if the issue is not present, indicating a fix or absence of the problematic behavior.
- If an `AssertionError` is raised due to the detection of the issue, it captures the exception and exits with code 1, indicating an error or issue state. This behavior adheres to your revised criteria for handling execution outcomes based on the problem's presence or resolution.
