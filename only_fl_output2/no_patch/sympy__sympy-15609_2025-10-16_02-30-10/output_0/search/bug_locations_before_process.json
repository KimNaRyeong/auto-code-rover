Specifically, when generating subscripts for matrix elements, it should use brackets or an alternative notation to separate indices clearly without causing LaTeX to interpret them as double subscripts. The fix should maintain the existing functionality for other types of expressions while ensuring that indexed matrix expressions are correctly represented."

        "intended_behavior": "The method should handle the LaTeX printing of matrix multiplication in a way that avoids generating syntactically incorrect LaTeX code, especially for indexed elements resulting from the multiplication. When dealing with the product of matrix symbols that are indexed, it should carefully format the LaTeX code to prevent double subscript errors, possibly by adjusting the way indices are printed or introducing notational changes to keep the output compatible with LaTeX syntax rules. This fix must preserve how all other expressions are printed, focusing solely on correcting the representation of matrix product indices."
