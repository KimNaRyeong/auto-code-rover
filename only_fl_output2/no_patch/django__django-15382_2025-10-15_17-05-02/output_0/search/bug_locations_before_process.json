Specifically, when dealing with negated empty querysets, the SQL should effectively reflect a condition that always evaluates to the intended Boolean value (true for `~Exists(empty queryset)`) without eliminating the WHERE clause of the surrounding query. This ensures that additional filters (e.g., `name='test'`) are correctly applied."

        "intended_behavior": "This method needs to ensure that when combining `filter` with an `Exists` subquery that involves an empty queryset, the resultant queryset correctly translates into a SQL query with the appropriate WHERE conditions. Given the issue, an additional check or handling mechanism might be needed when constructing the SQL to ensure `EmptyResultSet` exceptions or optimizations do not incorrectly prune necessary SQL clauses. This mechanism should preserve the logic that if an `Exists` subquery is applied with other filtering conditions, each part of the query distinction is maintained and correctly represented in the final SQL, including when the `Exists` subquery yields no results."
