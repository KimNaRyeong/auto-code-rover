        "content": "To understand the context of the issue and how it can be resolved, we should gather detailed information about the classes and methods implicated based on the description provided. Specifically, we are looking at how the `filter` and `Exists` query constructions are handled in Django, as well as their interaction with `EmptyResultSet`. Here are the API calls that could provide the necessary context:\n\n1. Investigate how the `Exists` subquery works within the Django ORM. Since it is mentioned explicitly in the issue, understanding its implementation is key:\n   - `search_class(\"Exists\")`\n\n2. Given that the issue affects the queryset's WHERE block when using a combination of `Exists` with an empty queryset and additional filter conditions (`name='test'`), we should look into the queryset's `filter` method:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"filter\", \"QuerySet\")`\n\n3. The issue mentions an `EmptyResultSet` being the output when printing the query of a queryset that experienced the problem. It then hints at a potentially deeper underlying problem within the query construction or optimization phase:\n   - `search_class(\"EmptyResultSet\")`\n\n4. To understand how the WHERE block is formulated and why it may be missing under certain conditions, we should look into the method that constructs the SQL query from a queryset. This might involve the query compilation process within Django ORM:\n   - `search_method(\"as_sql\")`\n\n5. Finally, since the issue is described as being similar to a previous one (`#33018`), it would be insightful to search for any reference of this issue number directly in the codebase, comments, or perhaps in a documentation string that relates to a bugfix or a note. However, acknowledging the limited nature of the provided API capabilities, this specific search might not be directly achievable. Instead, focusing on directly affected areas as discussed is more pragmatic.\n\nThese API calls will give us a foundational understanding of the problem and where exactly in the Django ORM codebase we might start looking for a solution."
