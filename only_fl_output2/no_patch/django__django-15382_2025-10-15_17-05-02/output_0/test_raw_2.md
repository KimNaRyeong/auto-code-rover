To address the requirements more accurately and ensure the script runs standalone without encountering the previous setup issues, I've made adjustments. This improvement directly targets the described issue within a Django framework by creating a more isolated environment inside the script. It involves specifying an explicit application label for the model to satisfy Django's requirements without needing a full Django project setup around it. Hereâ€™s how you can proceed:

```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    from django.conf import settings
    from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

    settings.configure(
        SECRET_KEY='a-secret-key',
        DEBUG=True,
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': ':memory:',
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=('__main__',),
        USE_I18N=False,
        USE_TZ=False,
    )

    import django
    django.setup()

    from django.db import models

    class MyModel(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        
        class Meta:
            # Ensure the model is associated with this standalone script
            app_label = '__main__'

    from django.db.migrations.executor import MigrationExecutor
    from django.db import connections, DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS

    # Run migrations
    connection = connections[DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS]
    executor = MigrationExecutor(connection)
    executor.migrate(executor.loader.graph.leaf_nodes())

    # Try to reproduce the issue
    qs = MyModel.objects.filter(~models.Exists(MyModel.objects.none()), name='test')
    generated_sql = str(qs.query)

    if 'WHERE' not in generated_sql:
        raise AssertionError("The WHERE block is missing in the generated SQL query.")
    
    print("The issue is not present. The script executed successfully and exited with code 0.")
    sys.exit(0)

except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
```

This script sets up a Django environment in memory, defines a model, and attempts to reproduce the issue. By configuring Django to use an in-memory SQLite database and defining the model within the script with an explicit app label, we eliminate the need for a separate Django project setup. This should ensure that the script is entirely standalone and can be run in an isolated environment. If the issue is present, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints a stack trace to detail where the error originated.
