Now widget['attrs']['id'] contains the \"id\" we would like to use when rendering the label of our CheckboxSelectMultiple.\nHowever BoundWidget.id_for_label() is implemented as\nclass BoundWidget:\n...\ndef id_for_label(self):\nreturn 'id_%s_%s' % (self.data['name'], self.data['index'])\nignoring the id available through self.data['attrs']['id']. This re-implementation for rendering the \"id\" is confusing and presumably not intended. Nobody has probably realized that so far, because rarely the auto_id-argument is overridden when initializing a form. If however we do, one would assume that the method BoundWidget.id_for_label renders that string as specified through the auto_id format-string.\nBy changing the code from above to\nclass BoundWidget:\n...\ndef id_for_label(self):\nreturn self.data['attrs']['id']\nthat function behaves as expected.\nPlease note that this error only occurs when rendering the subwidgets of a widget of type CheckboxSelectMultiple. This has nothing to do with the method BoundField.id_for_label().\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue effectively and gather sufficient code context, we should execute the following search API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the `BoundField` class** to understand its role and how it handles `subwidgets`, which are crucial in the context of the issue. This will help us locate the implementation of `subwidgets`.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"BoundField\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the `BoundWidget` class**, as the issue described involves modifying the `id_for_label` method within this class. This is essential to understand the surrounding context and relationships within the class.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"BoundWidget\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for the `id_for_label` method in the `BoundWidget` class**, since the issue specifically points out a problem in how `id_for_label` constructs its return value, ignoring certain `id` values.\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"id_for_label\", \"BoundWidget\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Because the issue mentions that this behavior particularly affects widgets of type `CheckboxSelectMultiple`,** we also need to look into how this widget type is implemented to ensure that any proposed changes adequately address the nuances of these widgets.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"CheckboxSelectMultiple\")\n   ```\n\n5. **Finally, to understand how `auto_id` interacts with form initialization and potentially influences `BoundWidget`'s behavior**, let's search for code snippets where `auto_id` is used in form initialization. This will provide context on how ids are typically set and overwritten.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"auto_id\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive code context to address the issue by examining the relevant classes, methods, and specific interactions affecting `id_for_label` behavior in `BoundWidget` instances, particularly with `CheckboxSelectMultiple` widgets."
