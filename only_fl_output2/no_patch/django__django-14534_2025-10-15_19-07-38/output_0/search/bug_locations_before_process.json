        "intended_behavior": "The `id_for_label` method should first check if an `id` is present in the widget's attributes (`self.data['attrs']['id']`). If so, it should return this `id` for use in rendering labels, which ensures the label's `for` attribute correctly matches the input's `id` attribute, making the form more accessible and respecting developer overrides for `id` attributes. If no specific `id` is set in `attrs`, the method should fall back to its existing behavior of generating an `id` using the field name and index. This preserves the existing functionality for cases where an `id` is not explicitly set, maintaining backward compatibility while fixing the issue for cases where an `id` is overridden."
