        "intended_behavior": "The `__add__` method needs to be optimized to prevent performance degradation when merging a large number of `Media` objects. While preserving the existing functionality of combining CSS and JS lists from two `Media` objects, the method should introduce a more efficient way to handle the merging to avoid significant slowdowns. This could involve setting a threshold for the direct list addition operation and applying a different strategy for merging lists when this threshold is exceeded. For instance, instead of adding the entire lists directly which results in repeated memory allocations, a check could be introduced to see if the combined length of `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` surpasses a certain number (e.g., 1000). If so, the method could switch to a more efficient merging strategy, potentially leveraging in-place updates or extending the existing lists only when necessary. The solution should ensure that the performance of `Media.__add__` remains stable and efficient even with a high number of operations, aligning with the sample improvement provided in the issue description. This optimization must not alter the method's external behavior, ensuring that the final `Media` object still accurately represents the combined media from both operands."
