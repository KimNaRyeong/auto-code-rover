        "content": "<issue>Optimize django.forms.widgets.Media.__add__.\nDescription\nWhile working with another project that make extensive use of django.forms.widgets.Media I discovered that the fix for ticket #30153 has unintended consequences on the performance of Media.__add__. If the number of Media objects added grows beyond a certain point (not sure it may be machine specific) then the performance of all subsequent Media.__add__ calls becomes terrible.\nThis was causing page load times of several minutes on my development machine. I agree that you need to delay as long as possible as #30153 intends but it seems that there probably should be an upper bound on this so that performance does not suddenly decrease.\nHere is some sample code that can reproduce the issue:\nfrom django.forms import Media\nimport datetime\ndef create_media(MediaClass):\n'''Creates a simple Media object with only one or two items.'''\nreturn MediaClass(css={'all': ['main.css']}, js=['main.js'])\nstart = datetime.datetime.now()\nmedia = create_media(Media)\nfor i in range(100000):\nmedia = media + create_media(Media)\nprint('100000 additions took: %s' % (datetime.datetime.now() - start))\nOn my machine several runs of this code result in times between 1:35 - 1:44 (eg. 1 minute 35 seconds to 1 minute 44 seconds). However, taking away one zero from the number of media objects runs in under a second. Near as I can tell this has to do with the memory used to store these arrays and when it gets past a certain point the performance is awful. Since I am not sure if it is machine specific, for reference my machine is a i7-8700 with 64 GB RAM.\nHere is a sample that has a modified Media class that does not have theses issues:\nfrom django.forms import Media\nimport datetime\ndef create_media(MediaClass):\n'''Creates a simple Media object with only one or two items.'''\nreturn MediaClass(css={'all': ['main.css']}, js=['main.js'])\nclass CustomMedia(Media):\ndef __add__(self, other):\ncombined = CustomMedia()\nif len(self._css_lists) + len(other._css_lists) > 1000:\ncombined._css_lists = [self._css, other._css]\nelse:\ncombined._css_lists = self._css_lists + other._css_lists\nif len(self._js_lists) + len(other._js_lists) > 1000:\ncombined._js_lists = [self._js, other._js]\nelse:\ncombined._js_lists = self._js_lists + other._js_lists\nreturn combined\nstart = datetime.datetime.now()\nmedia = create_media(CustomMedia)\nfor i in range(100000):\nmedia = media + create_media(CustomMedia)\nprint('100000 additions took: %s' % (datetime.datetime.now() - start))\nWith this change it again runs in under a second. If I increase the number of loops the performance seems to change at a much more expected level.\nI set an upper limit on the length allowed before a merge occurs. I'm not sure if the number of additions allowed should be a setting that can be adjusted to meet specific needs or if something that is just \"reasonably\" high is sufficient. It does appear that limiting the total number of items in the list to about 1000 works best on my machine. I'm also not sure that this is the best solution.\nThanks for your consideration.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the provided context about the `Media` class and its `__add__` method:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `Media` class is defined within `django/forms/widgets.py`, which suggests it's primarily used for managing media assets (CSS and JS files) that a Django form widget might require. \n   - The `__add__` method allows for the combination of two `Media` instances into a new one, merging their respective CSS and JavaScript files lists (`_css_lists` and `_js_lists`). The way it combines these lists is by performing a simple addition of `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` from `self` and `other` into a new `Media` object.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue description mentions a significant performance degradation when the `__add__` method is used repeatedly in a loop, especially when the number of iterations grows significantly (e.g., 100,000 times). \n   - The direct addition of lists for `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` during each iteration could lead to an exponential increase in memory usage and computational cost, given that Python lists are array-based and every addition operation can potentially involve copying the entire list to a new memory space.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Ideally, the `__add__` method should manage the combination of `Media` objects efficiently, without causing substantial performance degradation, regardless of how many times it's called in succession. This implies optimizing how `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` are merged, to ensure that the operation's time complexity doesn't lead to unacceptable slowdowns.\n   - The issue description's suggestion and the provided sample improvement indicate that introducing a check to limit the number of items being merged (or modifying the merging strategy after a certain threshold) could be a way to maintain performance.\n\nGiven this analysis, we have a clear understanding of the problematic part of the code and the relationship between its current implementation and the described performance issue. The next step would be to explore ways to optimize the list merging process in the `__add__` method, potentially by introducing a threshold for the direct list addition operation and considering alternative merging strategies when that threshold is exceeded."

While preserving the existing functionality of combining CSS and JS lists from two `Media` objects, the method should introduce a more efficient way to handle the merging to avoid significant slowdowns. \n   - This could involve setting a threshold for the direct list addition operation and applying a different strategy for merging lists when this threshold is exceeded. For instance, instead of adding the entire lists directly which results in repeated memory allocations, a check could be introduced to see if the combined length of `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` surpasses a certain number (e.g., 1000). If so, the method could switch to a more efficient merging strategy, potentially leveraging in-place updates or extending the existing lists only when necessary. \n   - The solution should ensure that the performance of `Media.__add__` remains stable and efficient even with a high number of operations, aligning with the sample improvement provided in the issue description. This optimization must not alter the method's external behavior, ensuring that the final `Media` object still accurately represents the combined media from both operands."
