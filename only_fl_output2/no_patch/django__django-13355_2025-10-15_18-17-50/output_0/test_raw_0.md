This script starts by defining a `print_stacktrace` function to help diagnose any exceptions in a clear, detailed way. It then defines the `create_media` function to generate `Media` objects, empowering it to test both the original `Media` class from Django's forms package and a `CustomMedia` class designed to address the performance problem.

The `test_performance` function measures the time taken to execute 100,000 additions of media objects, which is essential to reproducing the performance issue.

Finally, `run_tests` orchestrates the entire process, first checking the performance of Django's default `Media` class. If it detects the slowdown—as evidenced by execution taking more than a minute—it prints an appropriate traceback and tests the `CustomMedia` class as a proposed solution.

An `AssertionError` is raised if the issue is present in the default `Media` class, evidenced by prolonged execution. The custom class is expected to mitigate the slowdown, significantly improving performance so the script can exit with status code 0 if the issue is fixed, or 1 if not, based on the custom class's performance.
