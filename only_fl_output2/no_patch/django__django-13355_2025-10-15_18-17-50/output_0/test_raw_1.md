Given the specific instructions and the detailed function for printing the stack trace, I'll revise the script accordingly, ensuring it closely aligns with the expectations for demonstrating and diagnosing the performance issue, and handling both the error reporting and the exit conditions accurately.

```python
# reproducer.py

import datetime
from django.forms import Media

# Function to print stack trace
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_media(MediaClass):
    '''Creates a simple Media object with only one or two items.'''
    return MediaClass(css={'all': ['main.css']}, js=['main.js'])

def test_default_media_class_performance_issue():
    start = datetime.datetime.now()
    media = create_media(Media)
    for i in range(100000):
        media = media + create_media(Media)
    duration = datetime.datetime.now() - start
    print(f'Default Media class - 100000 additions took: {duration}')
    if duration.total_seconds() >= 60:
        raise AssertionError('Performance issue detected with the default Media class')

def test_custom_media_class_resolves_issue():
    class CustomMedia(Media):
        def __add__(self, other):
            combined = CustomMedia()
            if len(self._css_lists) + len(other._css_lists) > 1000:
                combined._css_lists = [self._css, other._css]
            else:
                combined._css_lists = self._css_lists + other._css_lists

            if len(self._js_lists) + len(other._js_lists) > 1000:
                combined._js_lists = [self._js, other._js]
            else:
                combined._js_lists = self._js_lists + other._js_lists

            return combined

    start = datetime.datetime.now()
    media = create_media(CustomMedia)
    for i in range(100000):
        media = media + create_media(CustomMedia)
    duration = datetime.datetime.now() - start
    print(f'CustomMedia class - 100000 additions took: {duration}')
    if duration.total_seconds() > 60:
        raise AssertionError('CustomMedia class did not fix the performance issue')

def main():
    try:
        test_default_media_class_performance_issue()
        print("Original Media class performance issue detected.")
        print("Attempting to verify the fix with CustomMedia class...")
        test_custom_media_class_resolves_issue()
        print("Issue is fixed in the CustomMedia class.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script first defines the `print_stacktrace` function for detailed error reporting. It then sets up a simple test scenario where it creates many `Media` objects to simulate the performance issue as reported. The default `Media` class test aims to reproduce the prolonged execution time when accumulating a large number of `Media` objects. 

In case the issue is detected (execution takes a long or unexpected amount of time), the script will attempt to verify the solution by testing a `CustomMedia` class designed to avoid the performance degradation. This custom implementation includes a conditional to limit the size of lists being accumulated, which aims to mitigate the root cause of the slowdown observed in the default `Media` class.

If the script finds the issue with the default class and then confirms that the `CustomMedia` class resolves it, it will exit with a code of 0, indicating success. Conversely, if either check fails—revealing that the problem persists or that the `CustomMedia` class doesn't effectively address the issue—it will use the `print_stacktrace` function to present detailed error information and then exit with a code of 1.
