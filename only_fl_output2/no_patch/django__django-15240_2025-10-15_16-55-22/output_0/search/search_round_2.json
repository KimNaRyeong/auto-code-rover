This can be problematic if naming duplication occurs:\nExample:\nI have an app with:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial.py\n0002_blah.py\n0003_blah.py\nI squash and delete replaced migrations:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial_squashed_0003_blah.py\nI create a new migration and use poor naming:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial_squashed_0003_blah.py\n0002_blah.py\nMy new migration never runs because the django_migrations table thinks it has already been applied.\nI propose truncation of the django_migrations table so that it includes only migrations that actually exist in the django project. This could be done automatically (when executor runs, or inside the migrate mcommand). Or have its own mcommand that requires it be run manually. I prefer the automatic approach though.\nPros:\nCleans up old data that just bloats the database.\nProtects users from the trap mentioned above where a new migration is created with the same name as one that was applied in the past.\nCons:\nA loss of historical information.\nNote:\nNeed to be careful with implementation to avoid a possible new trap if a user squashes migrations and then proceeds to delete the replaced migrations before running the squashed migrations on their database -> django will think squashed migrations haven't been applied and will attempt to reapply them. This can be remedied simply by not removing migrations mentioned in replaces lists of other migrations from django_migrations (ie. we'd consider replaced migrations as still existing, even if their actual files have already been removed).\n</issue>"

It offers functionality to check for the table's existence (`has_table`), ensure the table's schema is set up (`ensure_schema`), list applied migrations (`applied_migrations`), record migrations as applied (`record_applied`), record migrations as unapplied (`record_unapplied`), and flush all migration records (`flush`).\n\n#### Relationship to the bug\n\n- The `record_applied` method directly impacts the issue at hand by marking migrations as applied within the `django_migrations` table. The bug arises when migrations that no longer exist physically due to being squashed and deleted are still considered applied because of their records in this table.\n\n- The `flush` method provides a mechanism that outright deletes all migration records but lacks the nuance for addressing the specific problem of selectively ensuring only existing migrations are tracked as applied.\n\n#### Intended Behavior in the Context of the Issue\n\n- Ideally, `MigrationRecorder` should include a method (or an enhancement to an existing method) to validate that the migrations marked as applied in `django_migrations` correspond to actual migration files that exist. If a migration record does not have a corresponding file, especially in cases of squashed migrations, it should be identified and either removed or correctly associated with the new squashed migration file.\n\nSince we didn't find results for `squashmigrations` and `migrate.Command`, we probably need to adjust our search terms to locate the migration squashing mechanism and the implementation of the migration command in Django. This involves looking into the following areas:\n\n1. **Django Migration Framework Source Files**: Specifically, we want to understand the entry points and the command execution flow for migrations to identify where to apply the logic for checking migration files against records.\n2. **Implementation Details of Squashing Mechanism**: Although not directly found via `squashmigrations`, related functionalities can be explored by examining classes or methods involved with creating, running, and squashing migrations.\n\n### Next Steps in API Calls\n\nGiven the current state of our investigation, here are a couple of API calls we could consider next to gather more relevant context:\n\n- `search_class(\"MigrateCommand\")`: This will attempt to find the class handling the `migrate` command directly if \"migrate.Command\" as a search term wasn't successful.\n  \n- `search_method(\"apply_migration\")`: Assuming migrations are applied through a specific method, this might bring insight into how migration files are identified and processed, allowing us to tap into or extend this process to check for file existence.\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"squash\", \"django/db/migrations/operations.py\")`: This assumes that operations related to squashing might be detailed in a file that deals with migration operations, given the lack of results for a direct `squashmigrations` method search."

This includes a number of steps:\n\n- It optionally handles a migration as a \"fake\" application, where the migration is recorded as applied without actually executing the SQL changes (useful for migrations that have been manually applied or to skip over specific migrations).\n- For non-fake migrations, it executes the migration's forward operation, applying the changes to the database schema.\n- It records the migration as applied by calling `self.record_migration(migration)`, which presumably updates the `django_migrations` table to reflect the migration's application.\n- It supports detecting \"soft applied\" migrations in the case of `fake_initial`, where the executor tries to determine if an initial migration has been implicitly applied through a pre-existing schema that matches the migration's expected outcome.\n- The process involves callbacks for progress reporting, indicating the start and successful application of a migration.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug\n\nThe method tightly couples the application of migration changes to the recording of migrations as applied in the database. This method's logic directly impacts the issue at hand by managing how migrations are marked as applied. However, it does not include logic to verify the existence of migration files before recording them as applied, nor does it handle the scenario where squashed migrations replace older, individual migrations.\n\n#### Intended Behavior in the Context of the Issue\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior for this part of the code would involve adding checks to ensure that only migrations corresponding to existing files or acknowledged within the context of squashed migrations are recorded as applied. This could involve:\n\n- Before marking a migration as applied (`self.record_migration(migration)`), verify that the migration file exists or is part of a valid squashed migration.\n- If a migration is being applied and recorded but its file no longer exists (and it's not part of a squashed migration), either skip recording it as applied or provide a warning/logic path that corrects this state, ensuring the `django_migrations` table accurately reflects the state of migrations within the project.\n- For squashed migrations, enhance logic to recognize when a squashed migration effectively replaces older migrations, ensuring those older migrations are treated appropriately if their files have been removed.\n\nGiven these insights and our findings related to the `apply_migration` method, it appears we have sufficient context to address the described issue. To remedy the problem, enhancing the `MigrationExecutor`'s functionality to include verification steps before recording migrations as applied is needed. This solution path aims to maintain integrity between the migration files in the project and the records within `django_migrations` table, thus avoiding the outlined issue while preserving the existing functionality of the code."

This validation step should check if the migration file exists in the project or is acknowledged as part of a squashed migration set. If the migration file does not exist and is not part of a squashed migration, the method should either:\n\n- Prevent recording the migration as applied, issuing a warning that the migration file does not exist. This could be a safeguard against accidentally marking migrations as applied when their files have been removed or renamed without proper migration squashing procedures.\n- Intelligently handle the scenario by checking if this migration has been replaced by a squashed migration. If so, update the record to reflect that the squashed migration is the new source of truth, ensuring that the `django_migrations` table remains consistent with the actual state of migrations in the project.\n\nThese measures aim to maintain the integrity of the migration history in response to squashing and removal of migrations, thus preventing possible issues with reapplying migrations or failing to apply new migrations due to naming conflicts.
