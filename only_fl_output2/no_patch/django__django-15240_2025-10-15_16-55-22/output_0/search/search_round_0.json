        "content": "<issue>Delete nonexistent migrations from django_migrations table\nDescription\nDjango adds a django_migrations table to the database which list all of the migrations that have been applied (and when).\nWith the introduction of squashmigrations, it is possible for this table to contain a lot of old migrations that no longer exist. This can be problematic if naming duplication occurs:\nExample:\nI have an app with:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial.py\n0002_blah.py\n0003_blah.py\nI squash and delete replaced migrations:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial_squashed_0003_blah.py\nI create a new migration and use poor naming:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial_squashed_0003_blah.py\n0002_blah.py\nMy new migration never runs because the django_migrations table thinks it has already been applied.\nI propose truncation of the django_migrations table so that it includes only migrations that actually exist in the django project. This could be done automatically (when executor runs, or inside the migrate mcommand). Or have its own mcommand that requires it be run manually. I prefer the automatic approach though.\nPros:\nCleans up old data that just bloats the database.\nProtects users from the trap mentioned above where a new migration is created with the same name as one that was applied in the past.\nCons:\nA loss of historical information.\nNote:\nNeed to be careful with implementation to avoid a possible new trap if a user squashes migrations and then proceeds to delete the replaced migrations before running the squashed migrations on their database -> django will think squashed migrations haven't been applied and will attempt to reapply them. This can be remedied simply by not removing migrations mentioned in replaces lists of other migrations from django_migrations (ie. we'd consider replaced migrations as still existing, even if their actual files have already been removed).\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context regarding the handling of migrations in Django, specifically around the `migrate` command and the structure that keeps track of migration history, which according to the issue, involves a `django_migrations` table in the database. To get started, we should look into the following areas:\n\n1. The mechanism by which Django tracks applied migrations, likely involving interactions with the `django_migrations` table.\n2. The implementation of the `migrate` command, as modifications or hooks into this process could be a potential solution path for ensuring only existing migrations are considered applied.\n3. How Django handles squashed migrations, including how these are represented in the filesystem versus the database, and ensuring that squashed migrations are correctly applied without duplicating or ignoring new migrations with unfortunate naming.\n\nBased on these points, below are the specific API calls I propose to make to gather the necessary context:\n\n- `search_class(\"MigrationRecorder\")`: Since the `django_migrations` table is involved, there should be a class responsible for interacting with this table. The `MigrationRecorder` class is a likely candidate for this.\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"record_applied\", \"MigrationRecorder\")`: To understand how migrations are marked as applied in the `django_migrations` table.\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"flush\", \"MigrationRecorder\")`: If there's a method designed to clear records, it might be interesting to see how it's implemented, as part of the functionality for the proposed solution could include safely flushing obsolete migration records.\n\n- `search_method(\"squashmigrations\")`: To understand how the squashing mechanism works in detail, since the issue is specifically concerned with squashed migrations leading to potential confusion.\n\n- `search_code(\"migrate.Command\")`: As the proposee suggests modifications could happen within the `migrate` command, looking into the `migrate` command's implementation will provide insights into where and how to integrate the proposed changes.\n\nThese API calls will help gather detailed context around migration handling, tracking, and application logic in Django, which are all relevant to addressing the issue at hand."
