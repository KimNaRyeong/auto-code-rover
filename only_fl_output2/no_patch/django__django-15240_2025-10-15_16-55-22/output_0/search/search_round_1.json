        "content": "<issue>Delete nonexistent migrations from django_migrations table\nDescription\nDjango adds a django_migrations table to the database which list all of the migrations that have been applied (and when).\nWith the introduction of squashmigrations, it is possible for this table to contain a lot of old migrations that no longer exist. This can be problematic if naming duplication occurs:\nExample:\nI have an app with:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial.py\n0002_blah.py\n0003_blah.py\nI squash and delete replaced migrations:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial_squashed_0003_blah.py\nI create a new migration and use poor naming:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial_squashed_0003_blah.py\n0002_blah.py\nMy new migration never runs because the django_migrations table thinks it has already been applied.\nI propose truncation of the django_migrations table so that it includes only migrations that actually exist in the django project. This could be done automatically (when executor runs, or inside the migrate mcommand). Or have its own mcommand that requires it be run manually. I prefer the automatic approach though.\nPros:\nCleans up old data that just bloats the database.\nProtects users from the trap mentioned above where a new migration is created with the same name as one that was applied in the past.\nCons:\nA loss of historical information.\nNote:\nNeed to be careful with implementation to avoid a possible new trap if a user squashes migrations and then proceeds to delete the replaced migrations before running the squashed migrations on their database -> django will think squashed migrations haven't been applied and will attempt to reapply them. This can be remedied simply by not removing migrations mentioned in replaces lists of other migrations from django_migrations (ie. we'd consider replaced migrations as still existing, even if their actual files have already been removed).\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context regarding the handling of migrations in Django, specifically around the `migrate` command and the structure that keeps track of migration history, which according to the issue, involves a `django_migrations` table in the database.

The implementation of the `migrate` command, as modifications or hooks into this process could be a potential solution path for ensuring only existing migrations are considered applied.\n3. How Django handles squashed migrations, including how these are represented in the filesystem versus the database, and ensuring that squashed migrations are correctly applied without duplicating or ignoring new migrations with unfortunate naming.\n\nBased on these points, below are the specific API calls I propose to make to gather the necessary context:\n\n- `search_class(\"MigrationRecorder\")`: Since the `django_migrations` table is involved, there should be a class responsible for interacting with this table. The `MigrationRecorder` class is a likely candidate for this.\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"record_applied\", \"MigrationRecorder\")`: To understand how migrations are marked as applied in the `django_migrations` table.\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"flush\", \"MigrationRecorder\")`: If there's a method designed to clear records, it might be interesting to see how it's implemented, as part of the functionality for the proposed solution could include safely flushing obsolete migration records.\n\n- `search_method(\"squashmigrations\")`: To understand how the squashing mechanism works in detail, since the issue is specifically concerned with squashed migrations leading to potential confusion.\n\n- `search_code(\"migrate.Command\")`: As the proposee suggests modifications could happen within the `migrate` command, looking into the `migrate` command's implementation will provide insights into where and how to integrate the proposed changes.\n\nThese API calls will help gather detailed context around migration handling, tracking, and application logic in Django, which are all relevant to addressing the issue at hand."

        "content": "Analyzing the context gathered from the API calls provides us with insights into how Django records and handles migrations, particularly around the `MigrationRecorder` class and its methods.\n\n### Analysis of `MigrationRecorder` Class\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n\n- The `MigrationRecorder` class is responsible for interacting with the database table (`django_migrations`) that tracks which migrations have been applied to the database. It offers functionality to check for the table's existence (`has_table`), ensure the table's schema is set up (`ensure_schema`), list applied migrations (`applied_migrations`), record migrations as applied (`record_applied`), record migrations as unapplied (`record_unapplied`), and flush all migration records (`flush`).\n\n#### Relationship to the bug\n\n- The `record_applied` method directly impacts the issue at hand by marking migrations as applied within the `django_migrations` table. The bug arises when migrations that no longer exist physically due to being squashed and deleted are still considered applied because of their records in this table.\n\n- The `flush` method provides a mechanism that outright deletes all migration records but lacks the nuance for addressing the specific problem of selectively ensuring only existing migrations are tracked as applied.\n\n#### Intended Behavior in the Context of the Issue\n\n- Ideally, `MigrationRecorder` should include a method (or an enhancement to an existing method) to validate that the migrations marked as applied in `django_migrations` correspond to actual migration files that exist. If a migration record does not have a corresponding file, especially in cases of squashed migrations, it should be identified and either removed or correctly associated with the new squashed migration file.\n\nSince we didn't find results for `squashmigrations` and `migrate.Command`, we probably need to adjust our search terms to locate the migration squashing mechanism and the implementation of the migration command in Django. This involves looking into the following areas:\n\n1. **Django Migration Framework Source Files**: Specifically, we want to understand the entry points and the command execution flow for migrations to identify where to apply the logic for checking migration files against records.\n2. **Implementation Details of Squashing Mechanism**: Although not directly found via `squashmigrations`, related functionalities can be explored by examining classes or methods involved with creating, running, and squashing migrations.\n\n### Next Steps in API Calls\n\nGiven the current state of our investigation, here are a couple of API calls we could consider next to gather more relevant context:\n\n- `search_class(\"MigrateCommand\")`: This will attempt to find the class handling the `migrate` command directly if \"migrate.Command\" as a search term wasn't successful.\n  \n- `search_method(\"apply_migration\")`: Assuming migrations are applied through a specific method, this might bring insight into how migration files are identified and processed, allowing us to tap into or extend this process to check for file existence.\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"squash\", \"django/db/migrations/operations.py\")`: This assumes that operations related to squashing might be detailed in a file that deals with migration operations, given the lack of results for a direct `squashmigrations` method search."

If a migration is recorded as applied but the actual file does not exist, and it is not part of a squashed migration set, it implies reconsideration or extension of this method to validate migration existence.\n\n**Bug Location 2:**  \n- File: `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n- Class: `MigrationRecorder`\n\n**Intended Behavior (New Method):**  \nA new method should be introduced within the `MigrationRecorder` class to validate existing migration records against the file system. This method would be responsible for checking if each migration recorded as applied in the `django_migrations` table has a corresponding migration file in the project. If a migration does not have a corresponding file and is not acknowledged in a squashed migration's replaces list, this method should mark it for removal or adjustment in the database to reflect the current migration state. Incorporating checks during `migrate` operations could automatically trigger this validation to ensure the migration history remains consistent with available migration files, thus preventing the issue of incorrectly blocked migrations due to name reuse."
