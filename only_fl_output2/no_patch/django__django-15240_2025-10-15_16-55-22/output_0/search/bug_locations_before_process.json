        "intended_behavior": "The `apply_migration` method should introduce an additional validation step before a migration is recorded as applied. This validation step should check if the migration file exists in the project or is acknowledged as part of a squashed migration set. If the migration file does not exist and is not part of a squashed migration, the method should either:\n\n- Prevent recording the migration as applied, issuing a warning that the migration file does not exist. This could be a safeguard against accidentally marking migrations as applied when their files have been removed or renamed without proper migration squashing procedures.\n- Intelligently handle the scenario by checking if this migration has been replaced by a squashed migration. If so, update the record to reflect that the squashed migration is the new source of truth, ensuring that the `django_migrations` table remains consistent with the actual state of migrations in the project.\n\nThese measures aim to maintain the integrity of the migration history in response to squashing and removal of migrations, thus preventing possible issues with reapplying migrations or failing to apply new migrations due to naming conflicts. The existing functionality for applying migrations, including handling fake and fake_initial migrations, should be preserved while incorporating this additional validation to enhance the robustness of migration management within Django projects."
