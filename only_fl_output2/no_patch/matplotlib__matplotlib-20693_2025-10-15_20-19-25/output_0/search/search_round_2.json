I looked at this and #20558 and hoped / thought maybe I could find some `selector.set_*` or `selector.handle_props` or something to modify but I don't see anything. How should we update our code? (And it might be worth improving the deprecation warning to give some hints to anyone else who hits this issue.) Maybe with something like this?\n```\nselector.artists[0].set_color(color)\n```\nthe `artists[0]` is the `selector.rect`. But this just seems like a hack workaround, and if there are properties held internally it will not \"stick\" so I'm guessing it's not the right idea...\n_Originally posted by @larsoner in https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/20113#issuecomment-877345562_\n</issue>"

This would help us understand how selectors are implemented and identify potential points where the deprecated functionality is affecting the code or where new, updated methods could be implemented.\n\nHere's a revised approach focusing on understanding the structure around selectors, rectangles, and potentially how colors are managed for these elements:\n\n1. Investigate the class or classes that might define or use selectors and rectangles within the MNE project. This is under the assumption that a `selector` object would belong to a specific class managing interactive selections.\n2. Look for any methods or properties that might relate to updating or setting properties of graphical elements like rectangles, especially focusing on color management.\n\nLet's proceed with these API calls:\n\n- **search_class(\"Selector\")**: This will help us identify the class or classes that might implement or use the selector functionality.\n- **search_method(\"set_color\")**: Since the direct `set_color` method call on `rect` was not found, searching for the method broadly might help us identify where and how color setter methods are implemented across the project.\n- **search_code(\"rectprops\")**: Given that direct usage of `rectprops.update` was not found, this broader search might reveal how rectangle properties (likely including color) are managed or updated elsewhere in the codebase.\n\nHopefully, these calls will provide more context and lead us towards understanding the current mechanism for selector color updates and hint at how the migration away from deprecated methods should be approached."

Here is an analysis of the results:\n\n### Analysis of `set_color` Method Results\nThe `set_color` method is found across several files in the Matplotlib codebase, which indicates this method is quite common for various visual elements such as patches, spines, lines, collections, text, axes, and backend-specific functionalities. \n\n**Intended Behavior:** The intended behavior for any modifications or fixes related to this issue should ensure that the `set_color` method can be called or adapted to work with the selector's rectangle as intended, without causing deprecation warnings. Given the widespread use of `set_color`, it is crucial to pinpoint exactly where and how it should interact with selector functionalities.\n\n### Analysis of `rectprops` Code Snippets Results\nThe presence of `rectprops` in `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py` and `lib/matplotlib/text.py` suggests that properties related to rectangle objects are managed in these parts of the codebase, potentially including the customization of interactive selectors.\n\n**Intended Behavior:** The code handling `rectprops` should be reviewed and, if necessary, updated to ensure its compatibility with the latest Matplotlib standards, particularly regarding property updates without triggering deprecation warnings. For the issue at hand, it's important to figure out how `rectprops` can be compliantly used or modified to custom settings for selectors.\n\n### Conclusions and Next Steps\nGiven the lack of direct hits for a `Selector` class and the fact that both `set_color` and `rectprops` are found in various parts of the codebase, the next step should focus on investigating the areas that are most likely to interact with or impact selector functionality. This specifically means focusing on `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py` for `rectprops`, given the broader context of widgets possibly including functionality related to selectors.\n\n**Where are bug locations:**\n- **File:** lib/matplotlib/widgets.py\n  - **Description:** This file likely contains implementations of widgets, potentially including or affecting selector functionality, and handles `rectprops`. Examination and possibly adapting the handling of `rectprops` within this file could address the issue. The intended behavior should enable color updates to selectors in a way consistent with new Matplotlib API standards, avoiding deprecated methods.\n- **Potential Investigation Areas:**\n  - **Further Search:** A closer inspection of `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py` is needed, particularly around any class or method that manipulates `rectprops`, to understand how it influences selector behavior.\n  - **Review Deprecation Warnings & Migration Guidance:** Given the original issue mentioned the lack of guidance on migrating from deprecated methods, reviewing the Matplotlib documentation or source code annotations might reveal recommended practices for using `set_color` and updating `rectprops` in a compliant manner.\n\nThis analysis outlines the necessary immediate steps focusing on the `widgets.py` file and understanding its interaction with `rectprops` and `set_color` to resolve the issue without triggering deprecation warnings, thereby maintaining or enhancing the functionality of interactive selectors."

While specific classes and methods aren't pinpointed due to the lack of direct references in the returned API call results, this file is a central point for widgets, which are likely to include the selector functionalities mentioned in the issue. The intended behavior here involves adapting the code to use updated Matplotlib APIs for setting selector colors without triggering deprecation warnings. This might involve identifying the current mechanism used for setting the selector color, understanding the deprecation warning related to `rect.set_color` and `rectprops.update`, and then implementing a modernized approach that aligns with the latest Matplotlib guidelines. The goal is to ensure that selector colors can be updated as before but through a method that is future-proof and compliant with the latest library standards."
