I looked at this and #20558 and hoped / thought maybe I could find some `selector.set_*` or `selector.handle_props` or something to modify but I don't see anything. How should we update our code? (And it might be worth improving the deprecation warning to give some hints to anyone else who hits this issue.) Maybe with something like this?\n```\nselector.artists[0].set_color(color)\n```\nthe `artists[0]` is the `selector.rect`. But this just seems like a hack workaround, and if there are properties held internally it will not \"stick\" so I'm guessing it's not the right idea...\n_Originally posted by @larsoner in https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/20113#issuecomment-877345562_\n</issue>"

This would help us understand how selectors are implemented and identify potential points where the deprecated functionality is affecting the code or where new, updated methods could be implemented.\n\nHere's a revised approach focusing on understanding the structure around selectors, rectangles, and potentially how colors are managed for these elements:\n\n1. Investigate the class or classes that might define or use selectors and rectangles within the MNE project. This is under the assumption that a `selector` object would belong to a specific class managing interactive selections.\n2. Look for any methods or properties that might relate to updating or setting properties of graphical elements like rectangles, especially focusing on color management.\n\nLet's proceed with these API calls:\n\n- **search_class(\"Selector\")**: This will help us identify the class or classes that might implement or use the selector functionality.\n- **search_method(\"set_color\")**: Since the direct `set_color` method call on `rect` was not found, searching for the method broadly might help us identify where and how color setter methods are implemented across the project.\n- **search_code(\"rectprops\")**: Given that direct usage of `rectprops.update` was not found, this broader search might reveal how rectangle properties (likely including color) are managed or updated elsewhere in the codebase.\n\nHopefully, these calls will provide more context and lead us towards understanding the current mechanism for selector color updates and hint at how the migration away from deprecated methods should be approached."
