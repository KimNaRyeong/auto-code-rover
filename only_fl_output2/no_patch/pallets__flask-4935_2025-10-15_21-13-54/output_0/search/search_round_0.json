        "content": "<issue>Nested blueprints are not respected when mounted on subdomains\nHello, and thanks for all your work \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\nNested blueprints [as described in the docs](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/blueprints/#nesting-blueprints) work perfectly fine when using `url_prefix`. However, when mounting the parent blueprint using a subdomain, the child routes are not accessible.\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom flask import Blueprint\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config[\"SERVER_NAME\"] = \"localhost:5000\"\nparent = Blueprint(\"parent\", __name__)\nchild = Blueprint(\"child\", __name__)\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\nreturn \"index\"\n@parent.route('/')\ndef parent_index():\nreturn \"parent\"\n@child.route('/child/')\ndef child_index():\nreturn \"child\"\nparent.register_blueprint(child)\napp.register_blueprint(parent, subdomain=\"api\")\nif __name__ == '__main__':\napp.run(debug=True)\n```\nThe index route works as expected:\n```\n\u276f http http://localhost:5000/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 5\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:44:10 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\nindex\n```\nSo does the parent route in the subdomain:\n```\n\u276f http http://api.localhost:5000/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 6\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:44:06 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\nparent\n```\nBut the child responds with a 404:\n```\n\u276f http http://api.localhost:5000/child/\nHTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 207\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:45:42 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=en>\n<title>404 Not Found</title>\n<h1>Not Found</h1>\n<p>The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.</p>\n```\nIf we change the `subdomain=\"api\"` for `url_prefix=\"/api\"` when registering the blueprint however everything works as expected:\n```\n\u276f http http://localhost:5000/api/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 6\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:46:53 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\nparent\n\u276f http http://localhost:5000/api/child/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 5\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:46:59 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\nchild\n```\nThis was surprising to me as I expected the same nesting to apply regardless of whether the parent is mounted using a subdomain or a URL prefix. Am I missing something?\nEnvironment:\n- Python version: 3.10\n- Flask version: 2.2.2\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to investigate how Flask handles the registration of blueprints, particularly with regard to subdomains and the nesting of blueprints. This requires examining the implementation of both blueprints and the server configuration that handles the subdomain routing. Here are the necessary API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"Flask\")`: This will provide insight into the Flask application object, which might contain the logic for initializing and configuring the server, including how it handles subdomains.\n- `search_class(\"Blueprint\")`: Since the issue is directly related to how blueprints, especially nested blueprints, behave when registered with a subdomain, understanding their implementation is crucial.\n- `search_method(\"register_blueprint\")`: This method is used in the issue to register both the parent and child blueprints. Understanding its implementation and parameters is essential for debugging the subdomain issue.\n- `search_code(\"app.config['SERVER_NAME'] =\")`: This will help understand how the Flask app's server name configuration might affect subdomain handling.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"add_url_rule\", \"Blueprint\")`: Since the add_url_rule method is likely involved in how routes are added to blueprints, and by extension how those routes behave under different conditions (like being part of a subdomain), examining its usage within the Blueprint class could provide insights.\n\nThese API calls are designed to gather a comprehensive view of the mechanisms at play when Flask handles blueprint registration, particularly with subdomains, which could lead to resolving the presented issue."
