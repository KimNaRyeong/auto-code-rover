The methods `_print_Derivative` and `_print_Float`, and the class `MCodePrinter` are directly mentioned. Let's structure our search API calls accordingly to investigate these:\n\n1. Search for the class `MCodePrinter` to understand where it's defined and possibly get a grasp of its scope and other methods it contains.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"MCodePrinter\")\n   ```\n\n2. Once we find out where `MCodePrinter` is, we will need to look into it for the `_print_Derivative` and `_print_Float` methods, assuming they might either already exist and need modification, or we need to add them as per the issue. If the class name and file name are clear after the first search, use detailed searches for these methods in that specific class or file.\n\n   Assuming we find out the file name from the first search, we would then want to:\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"_print_Derivative\", \"MCodePrinter\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"_print_Float\", \"MCodePrinter\")\n   ```\n\n   If we need to specify the file locations directly, we can adapt to use `search_method_in_file` with the file path provided from the first search's result.\n\n3. The code snippets provided in the issue description suggest how to handle floats and derivatives. We might want to check if similar patterns or part of these patterns exist already or were previously part of the implementation. This could help understand how similar issues were addressed or if there are any factors to consider when integrating this solution.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"def _print_Derivative(self, expr):\")\n   search_code(\"def _print_Float(self, expr):\")\n   ```\n\nThese steps should give us a well-rounded understanding of how `MCodePrinter` is structured and where our new code might fit within the project."

This is directly related to the bug, which states that derivatives and floats with exponents are not correctly handled when generating Mathematica code. The intended behavior, as described in the issue, is to implement these methods in such a way that:\n- Derivatives are printed in Mathematica's `D[function, variable]` format.\n- Floats with exponents are printed in Mathematica's `number*^exponent` format.\n\nGiven the issue description:\n- The `_print_Derivative` method should take a derivative expression and format it correctly for Mathematica, e.g., `Derivative(f(t), t)` should become `D[f[t], t]`.\n- The `_print_Float` method should handle floating-point numbers, especially those with exponents, converting the Pythonic `1.0e-4` to Mathematica's `1.0*^-4`.\n\n### Relationship with Found `_print_Derivative` and `_print_Float` Implementations\nThe search for `_print_Derivative` and `_print_Float` in other printers (`str.py`, `latex.py`, `repr.py`, `fcode.py`) provides useful insights into how SymPy's printing mechanism is designed to be extensible and adaptable to various output formats (e.g., string, LaTeX, Fortran). Each of these implementations is tailored to the syntax and conventions of its target language/format. This demonstrates that for Mathematica output, the `MCodePrinter` should implement similar methods customized for Mathematica's syntax.\n\n### How This Relates to Intended Behavior\n1. **_print_Derivative:** The existing implementations in other files indicate that this method is intended to transform a SymPy derivative into a format that's understandable in the target language/format. For Mathematica, we'll translate SymPy's derivative representation into Mathematica's derivative notation.\n\n2. **_print_Float:** Similarly, other implementations adjust the format of floating-point numbers to their respective target language/format. For Mathematica, this involves changing the exponent notation from `e` to `*^`.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\nGiven this analysis, our next steps should involve:\n1. Implementing the `_print_Derivative` method in `MCodePrinter` to output the correct Mathematica syntax for derivatives.\n2. Implementing the `_print_Float` method in `MCodePrinter` to convert Pythonic exponent notation to Mathematica's.\n\nThese implementations will directly address the described issue by ensuring derivatives and floating-point numbers with exponents are printed correctly for Mathematica, adhering to the intended behavior described in the issue."

Bug Locations:\n\n   **Location 1:**\n   - File: `sympy/printing/mathematica.py`\n   - Class: `MCodePrinter`\n   - Intended Behavior: Implement a new method `_print_Derivative` within the `MCodePrinter` class. This method should correctly transform a SymPy derivative expression into Mathematica's derivative notation, specifically `D[f[t], t]` for an input of `Derivative(f(t), t)`. The transformation needs to parse the function and variables from the SymPy expression and format them according to Mathematica's syntax, ensuring that derivatives of any order are correctly represented in the output.\n\n   **Location 2:**\n   - File: `sympy/printing/mathematica.py`\n   - Class: `MCodePrinter`\n   - Intended Behavior: Implement a new method `_print_Float` within the `MCodePrinter` class. This method should adapt floating-point numbers from Python's representation (e.g., `1.0e-4`) to Mathematica's (e.g., `1.0*^-4`). It should accurately convert any floating-point number, including those with positive and negative exponents, ensuring they are represented in a format that Mathematica can interpret.\n\nThese implementations aim to extend the `MCodePrinter` class's functionality to handle derivatives and floats with exponents correctly, preserving the general capability of the `MCodePrinter` to translate SymPy expressions into Mathematica-readable code while addressing the specific issue identified."
