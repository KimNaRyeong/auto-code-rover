        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue with the mathematica code printer handling floats and derivatives incorrectly, we need to explore specific methods, classes, and potentially related code snippets that the issue describes. The methods `_print_Derivative` and `_print_Float`, and the class `MCodePrinter` are directly mentioned. Let's structure our search API calls accordingly to investigate these:\n\n1. Search for the class `MCodePrinter` to understand where it's defined and possibly get a grasp of its scope and other methods it contains.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"MCodePrinter\")\n   ```\n\n2. Once we find out where `MCodePrinter` is, we will need to look into it for the `_print_Derivative` and `_print_Float` methods, assuming they might either already exist and need modification, or we need to add them as per the issue. If the class name and file name are clear after the first search, use detailed searches for these methods in that specific class or file.\n\n   Assuming we find out the file name from the first search, we would then want to:\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"_print_Derivative\", \"MCodePrinter\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"_print_Float\", \"MCodePrinter\")\n   ```\n\n   If we need to specify the file locations directly, we can adapt to use `search_method_in_file` with the file path provided from the first search's result.\n\n3. The code snippets provided in the issue description suggest how to handle floats and derivatives. We might want to check if similar patterns or part of these patterns exist already or were previously part of the implementation. This could help understand how similar issues were addressed or if there are any factors to consider when integrating this solution.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"def _print_Derivative(self, expr):\")\n   search_code(\"def _print_Float(self, expr):\")\n   ```\n\nThese steps should give us a well-rounded understanding of how `MCodePrinter` is structured and where our new code might fit within the project."
