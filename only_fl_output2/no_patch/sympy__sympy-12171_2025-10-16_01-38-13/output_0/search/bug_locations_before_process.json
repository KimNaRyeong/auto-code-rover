This method should correctly transform a SymPy derivative expression into Mathematica's derivative notation, specifically `D[f[t], t]` for an input of `Derivative(f(t), t)`. The transformation needs to parse the function and variables from the SymPy expression and format them according to Mathematica's syntax, ensuring that derivatives of any order are correctly represented in the output."

        "intended_behavior": "Implement a new method `_print_Float` within the `MCodePrinter` class. This method should adapt floating-point numbers from Python's representation (e.g., `1.0e-4`) to Mathematica's (e.g., `1.0*^-4`). It should accurately convert any floating-point number, including those with positive and negative exponents, ensuring they are represented in a format that Mathematica can interpret."
