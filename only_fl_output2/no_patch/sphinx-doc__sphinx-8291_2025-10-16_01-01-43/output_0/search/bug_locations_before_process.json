        "intended_behavior": "The `setup` function should be enhanced to ensure that type hints for attributes are correctly interpreted and included in the documentation without duplication. This could involve implementing a new handler for the `autodoc-process-docstring` event specifically tailored to handling type hints in attributes, ensuring they are clearly documented once and in accordance with the Napoleon style guide. Modification of the existing connection to `cut_lines` or its replacement with a mechanism that does not interfere with the documentation of type hints. If `cut_lines` is essential for other aspects of documentation processing, the new implementation should carefully consider how it impacts the interpretation of type annotations to avoid removing or duplicating critical information."
