        "content": "<issue>[Napoleon] Retrieve type of attributes from type hints when using google-style\nFollowing [google style guide for classes](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#384-classes), I added an `Attributes:` section my classes docstring. As I have [PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/) annotations (because I use `attrs`), I did not add types in the docstring., as per the style guide.\nWhen generating the documentation with `.. automodule::` from `autodoc`, with `napoleon`, the attributes are not typed. I tried using the `:undoc-members:` flag of `automodule`, but this resulted in duplicated attributes: one with the explanation, the other with the type-hint.\nWhile it is possible to not use type hints with `attrs` and replace `attr.s(auto_attribs=True)` by `attr.ib()`, this is not an option for e.g. [`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html). I also tried `napoleon_use_ivar=True`, which silenced sphinx's warnings but still resulted in two definition of the attribute in the documentation.\nIt would be nice if `napoleon` (or `autodoc`) extracted the type hint of the class, or merged the attributes when using `:undoc-members:`. That would avoid duplicated types definitions in either the code or the doc. Currently, either the code has an annotation and a type in the docstring, or the generated documentation has two entry for each attribute.\nThis might be related to #7582  and #4074 .\n**Additional info**\n- sphinx version `3.2.1`\n- [`conf.py`](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/docs/conf.py)\n- [code being autodocumented](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/src/pheres/exceptions.py)\n</issue>"

The issue describes a problem with the duplication of attributes in generated documentation when using type hints and Sphinx's Napoleon extension for Google-style docstrings.\n\nGiven the detailed issue content, here are the API calls we should make to gather relevant code context:\n\n1. Look for the configuration of Sphinx in the project, typically found in `conf.py`. This file might contain settings related to Napoleon and autodoc that are crucial for understanding the issue:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"napoleon\", \"docs/conf.py\")`\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"autodoc\", \"docs/conf.py\")`\n\n2. Since the problem is related to how attributes are documented, particularly with the library `attrs` and Python's `dataclasses`, inspect how these are used. First, focus on the `attrs` library usage within the codebase:\n   - `search_code(\"attr.s(auto_attribs=True)\")`\n   - `search_code(\"attr.ib()\")`\n\n3. Then, investigate the usage of `dataclasses` since the issue mentioned these cannot be avoided like `attrs`:\n   - `search_code(\"@dataclass\")`\n\n4. The issue alludes to an existing problem by mentioning Sphinx/Napoleon\u2019s handling of class attributes when using type hints. Although getting the behavior of external libraries might not be directly accessible via the codebase, search for any custom Sphinx extensions or configurations that might be trying to address this issue:\n   - `search_code(\"def setup(app):\")`\n\n5. Lastly, review the specific file and class mentioned in the issue to understand how the documentation is currently attempted for attributes. Since the issue mentions the generation of documentation specifically from classes in `pheres/exceptions.py`, focusing on any class within this file could provide insight into the problem:\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"\", \"src/pheres/exceptions.py\")` (To list all classes for further inspection)\n   \nThese API calls will help us acquire the needed context from the project's codebase to approach a solution for the documented issue."

Normally, `conf.py` is central to configuring Sphinx, including extensions like Napoleon for docstring styles. Since we found results in `doc/conf.py` instead, this mismatch in expected versus actual path names could hint at a configuration oversight related to the issue.\n\n2. **Usage of `attrs` and `dataclasses`**:\n   - Searches for `attr.s(auto_attribs=True)`, `attr.ib()`, and `@dataclass` returned no results, suggesting that either these features are not used within the codebase or they are used in a non-standard way that our searches missed. Given the issue reports problems with attributes from type hints in documentation, this lack of results prompts reevaluation of how the codebase defines its classes and attributes.\n\n3. **Custom Sphinx Setup or Extension Configuration** (`def setup(app):`):\n   - This search returned six snippets across various `doc/development/tutorials/examples/` files and `doc/conf.py`. These examples likely document custom setups or configurations for Sphinx. Since `def setup(app):` is a common pattern for configuring Sphinx extensions or behavior, analyzing these snippets could reveal custom handling of documentation generation that might interfere with or attempt to solve the reported issue.\n\n4. **No Direct Evidence of `pheres/exceptions.py` Usage**:\n   - The inability to find `src/pheres/exceptions.py` suggests either an issue in the file naming or path provided in the issue description, or a larger structural change in the codebase that renders the information outdated.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context Gathering\n\nBased on the initial analysis, we need to correct our approach and gather more context on:\n\n1. **Correct Sphinx Configuration Path**:\n   - Since `docs/conf.py` was not found but `doc/conf.py` was mentioned in the results, it would be prudent to inspect the actual Sphinx configuration. Therefore, a new API call should aim at `doc/conf.py` to understand the Sphinx setup:\n     - `search_code_in_file(\"napoleon\", \"doc/conf.py\")`\n     - `search_code_in_file(\"autodoc\", \"doc/conf.py\")`\n\n2. **Investigate Custom Sphinx `setup` Configurations**:\n   - Further inspect the contents of `def setup(app):` in `doc/conf.py` to understand any custom configurations that might affect documentation generation:\n     - `search_code_in_file(\"def setup(app):\", \"doc/conf.py\")`\n\n3. **Revise Class and Attribute Definition Search**:\n   - Given the absence of results for `attrs` or `dataclasses`, a broader search might be necessary. One possibility is that the project uses these features in a manner not directly captured by the initial search strings or that alternative methods or libraries are in use for attribute definition.\n\n4. **Clarify File Paths and Existence**:\n   - Double-check the existence or paths of files mentioned in the issue. Considering the file and path discrepancies encountered, a broader search in the repository for similar paths or names might be necessary to identify the correct files or configurations related to the issue.\n   \nUnderstanding these areas will be crucial for proposing a solution to the documentation generation issue highlighted."

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\nFrom the results obtained through the search API calls, we can derive the following insights regarding the issue regarding documentation generation, especially about class attributes and type hints.\n\n#### 1. **Autodoc Configuration in `doc/conf.py`**\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The snippets found within `doc/conf.py` that refer to `autodoc` are likely configuring how Sphinx's `autodoc` extension processes documentation. `autodoc` is used to automatically extract documentation from source code comments and is highly configurable, supporting various options that influence the output.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug**\n  Given that the issue involves documentation generation, specifically, the `napoleon` extension not correctly merging or extracting attribute types from type hints when generating documentation, the configuration present in `doc/conf.py` for `autodoc` might be a key area. The customizations in the `setup` method especially could influence how documentation is processed and generated from source code, potentially contributing to the observed behavior of duplicated entry of attributes or missing type hints.\n\n- **Intended behavior of this part of the code**\n  Ideally, the configuration in `doc/conf.py` should be such that it enables `autodoc` and `napoleon` to properly utilize Python type hints for attribute documentation, avoiding duplication and ensuring type information is correctly included. Given the issue description, it seems there might need to be an adaptation or extension of functionality within the `setup` to ensure that type hints in the code translate seamlessly into the generated documentation, without necessitating redundant specification in the docstrings or resulting in duplicated entries.\n\n#### 2. **`setup` Method in `doc/conf.py`**\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `setup` function found in `doc/conf.py` connects a custom process (`autodoc-process-docstring`) to `cut_lines`, which can modify the docstring before it is processed by Sphinx. This is a form of direct intervention in the documentation generation process, allowing for customization of how docstrings are handled.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug**\n  The custom `setup` method's use of `autodoc-process-docstring` might be directly related to the issue if it affects how docstrings and, by extension, type hints are processed. The challenge described in the issue might necessitate adjustments here to ensure that type hints are correctly handled, rather than leading to duplication or omission in the generated documentation.\n\n- **Intended behavior of this part of the code**\n  The intended behavior would be to enhance or adjust the `setup` method such that it helps in correctly incorporating type hints from attributes into the documentation as expected, addressing the core issue. This could mean either refining how `cut_lines` is used, potentially replacing it with a more suitable approach for handling type hints, or adding additional handlers that specifically target the correct processing of type hints for attributes in the documentation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe relationship between the `autodoc` configuration, particularly the custom `setup` function's role in `doc/conf.py`, and the documentation generation issue suggests that modifications here might address the reported problem. The intended enhancements should aim at better integration of Python type hints into the Sphinx documentation generation process, ensuring attributes are correctly documented without duplication or the need for redundant type information in docstrings."

Therefore, I will proceed to outline the likely bug locations and their intended modifications without the need for additional context.\n\n### Bug Locations and Intended Behavior\n\n#### Location 1: File: `doc/conf.py`, Method: `setup`\n\n- **Current Behavior**: The `setup` method in `doc/conf.py` connects an `autodoc-process-docstring` event to a `cut_lines` function, affecting how docstrings are processed. This setup is likely intended for customization of the documentation generation process but might inadvertently contribute to issues with handling type hints in attribute documentation, especially when combined with the Napoleon extension.\n\n- **Intended Behavior**: The `setup` function should be enhanced to ensure that type hints for attributes are correctly interpreted and included in the documentation without duplication. This could involve:\n  - Implementing a new handler for the `autodoc-process-docstring` event specifically tailored to handling type hints in attributes, ensuring they are clearly documented once and in accordance with the Napoleon style guide. This handler might need to integrate logic for detecting and merging type information from Python annotations into the documentation entries generated for class attributes.\n  - Modification of the existing connection to `cut_lines` or its replacement with a mechanism that does not interfere with the documentation of type hints. If `cut_lines` is essential for other aspects of documentation processing, the new implementation should carefully consider how it impacts the interpretation of type annotations to avoid removing or duplicating critical information.\n\nThese changes aim to preserve the core functionality of Sphinx documentation generation while addressing the specific issue of correctly incorporating type hints from Python 3.5+ annotations into attribute documentation. This solution should ensure that the documentation generated is both accurate (in terms of type information) and compliant with the Google style guide, as facilitated by the Napoleon extension, without resulting in redundant or conflicting entries."
