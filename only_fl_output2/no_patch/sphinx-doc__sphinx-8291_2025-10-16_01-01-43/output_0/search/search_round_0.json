        "content": "<issue>[Napoleon] Retrieve type of attributes from type hints when using google-style\nFollowing [google style guide for classes](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#384-classes), I added an `Attributes:` section my classes docstring. As I have [PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/) annotations (because I use `attrs`), I did not add types in the docstring., as per the style guide.\nWhen generating the documentation with `.. automodule::` from `autodoc`, with `napoleon`, the attributes are not typed. I tried using the `:undoc-members:` flag of `automodule`, but this resulted in duplicated attributes: one with the explanation, the other with the type-hint.\nWhile it is possible to not use type hints with `attrs` and replace `attr.s(auto_attribs=True)` by `attr.ib()`, this is not an option for e.g. [`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html). I also tried `napoleon_use_ivar=True`, which silenced sphinx's warnings but still resulted in two definition of the attribute in the documentation.\nIt would be nice if `napoleon` (or `autodoc`) extracted the type hint of the class, or merged the attributes when using `:undoc-members:`. That would avoid duplicated types definitions in either the code or the doc. Currently, either the code has an annotation and a type in the docstring, or the generated documentation has two entry for each attribute.\nThis might be related to #7582  and #4074 .\n**Additional info**\n- sphinx version `3.2.1`\n- [`conf.py`](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/docs/conf.py)\n- [code being autodocumented](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/src/pheres/exceptions.py)\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue, we should focus on the specifics mentioned: Napoleon, autodoc behavior, usage of `attrs` and `dataclasses`, as well as how Sphinx handles attribute documentation. The issue describes a problem with the duplication of attributes in generated documentation when using type hints and Sphinx's Napoleon extension for Google-style docstrings.\n\nGiven the detailed issue content, here are the API calls we should make to gather relevant code context:\n\n1. Look for the configuration of Sphinx in the project, typically found in `conf.py`. This file might contain settings related to Napoleon and autodoc that are crucial for understanding the issue:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"napoleon\", \"docs/conf.py\")`\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"autodoc\", \"docs/conf.py\")`\n\n2. Since the problem is related to how attributes are documented, particularly with the library `attrs` and Python's `dataclasses`, inspect how these are used. First, focus on the `attrs` library usage within the codebase:\n   - `search_code(\"attr.s(auto_attribs=True)\")`\n   - `search_code(\"attr.ib()\")`\n\n3. Then, investigate the usage of `dataclasses` since the issue mentioned these cannot be avoided like `attrs`:\n   - `search_code(\"@dataclass\")`\n\n4. The issue alludes to an existing problem by mentioning Sphinx/Napoleon\u2019s handling of class attributes when using type hints. Although getting the behavior of external libraries might not be directly accessible via the codebase, search for any custom Sphinx extensions or configurations that might be trying to address this issue:\n   - `search_code(\"def setup(app):\")`\n\n5. Lastly, review the specific file and class mentioned in the issue to understand how the documentation is currently attempted for attributes. Since the issue mentions the generation of documentation specifically from classes in `pheres/exceptions.py`, focusing on any class within this file could provide insight into the problem:\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"\", \"src/pheres/exceptions.py\")` (To list all classes for further inspection)\n   \nThese API calls will help us acquire the needed context from the project's codebase to approach a solution for the documented issue."
