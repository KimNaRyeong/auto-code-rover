        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue about pyreverse not reading Python type hints, especially when `None` is used as a default value, it's essential to look into relevant parts of the codebase:\n\n1. Search for the class responsible for generating UML diagrams to see how types are currently being interpreted. Since the issue does not specify the class name, we'll have to make an educated guess based on the functionality. A class name like `UMLDiagramGenerator` or `PyReverseEngine` could be relevant, but since we're guessing, let's start with a method that might be more directly involved in processing type hints.\n2. Search for methods that are likely to be responsible for parsing class definitions or type hints. Since the issue revolves around type hints not being correctly interpreted, methods like `parse_class_definition` or `interpret_type_hint` could be involved.\n3. Given that the issue explicitly mentions the handling of default values, particularly `None`, for class properties, it would be useful to look for code that deals with default values in class constructors.\n   \nLet's start with some API calls that could help us find the relevant parts of the codebase:\n\n- `search_method(\"parse_class_definition\")`\n- `search_method(\"interpret_type_hint\")`\n- `search_code(\"def __init__(self,\")`\n\nThese searches aim to locate where class constructors and type hints are parsed and interpreted within the project, which could highlight where modifications need to be made to accommodate type hints according to PEP 484."
