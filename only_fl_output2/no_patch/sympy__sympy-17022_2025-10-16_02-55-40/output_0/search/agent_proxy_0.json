This will involve looking into the implementation of `lambdify` itself, as well as how matrices and identity matrices are processed within the codebase. Considering the issue description, the following API calls seem pertinent:\n\n1. Investigate the `lambdify` function: Since the issue arises with the usage of `lambdify`, we should start by looking into its implementation to understand how it handles symbolic matrices and identity matrices.\n    - `search_method(\"lambdify\")`\n\n2. Look into the implementation of the identity matrix, given that the issue specifically mentions incorrect handling of identity matrices:\n    - `search_class(\"Identity\")`\n\n3. Since the issue also mentions that the symbol `I` is interpreted as a complex number (`1j`) instead of an identity matrix, it would be useful to understand how `I` is defined and handled in the codebase. This might not direct us to a single function or class but can give context on why `I` defaults to a complex number.\n    - `search_code(\"I\")`\n\nThese calls will give insights into the implementation details and contexts relevant to the issue, providing a solid base to craft a solution."
