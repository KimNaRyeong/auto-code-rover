        "intended_behavior": "The `lambdify` function should explicitly handle the conversion of `Identity` matrices within expressions to a suitable numerical equivalent when targeting libraries like NumPy. This would involve adding a check or condition specifically for `Identity` objects within the expression being lambdified and ensuring that they are converted to an `np.eye(n)` (where `n` is the dimension of the identity matrix) instead of being left as is or misinterpreted as the imaginary unit `I`. This adjustment would ensure that when `lambdify` converts symbolic expressions to numeric functions, any occurrence of the identity matrix is correctly translated into its numeric equivalent according to the library in use (e.g., NumPy), thus preserving the mathematical intention of the expression."
