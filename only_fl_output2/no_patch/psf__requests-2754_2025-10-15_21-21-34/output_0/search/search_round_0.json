        "content": "<issue>.htaccesss redirect to non ASCII folder does not work\nHello,\nI have the following setup on a shared hoster:\n- Apache 2.2.15\n- A Japanese language .\u307f\u3093\u306a (.minna; xn--q9jyb4c) IDN domain.\n- A blog which is in the subfolder \u30d6\u30ed\u30b0 (blog)\n- A redirect in the .htaccess file like this: `Redirect /index.html /\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0/`\nSo I usually open the domain http://test.\u307f\u3093\u306a and the server redirects to http://test.\u307f\u3093\u306a/\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0. This works fine in Firefox etc.\nWith requests, I get the following error (Python 3.4 with Requests 2.7.0 on a Japanese Ubuntu 15.04):\n```\n'<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN\">\\n<html><head>\\n<title>404 Not Found</title>\\n</head><body>\\n<h1>Not Found</h1>\\n<p>The requested URL /\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x83\u00c2\\x96\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x83\u00c2\\xad\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x82\u00c2\u00b0/ was not found on this server.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<address>Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS) Server at test.xn--q9jyb4c Port 80</address>\\n</body></html>\\n'\n```\nSo I guess the request lib gets a redirect from a server with Japanese characters, but then fails to convert the characters correctly. If I do `requests.get(http://test.\u307f\u3093\u306a/\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0)` directly it works, only the redirect does not.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to the .htaccess redirect not working with non-ASCII folder names, let's consider breaking down the issue into components and relevant API calls to make:\n\n1. **Understanding the Redirect Behavior in .htaccess**: The issue explicitly concerns a redirect rule in the .htaccess file that doesn't behave as expected when the destination is a non-ASCII folder name. However, our ability to directly analyze .htaccess file behavior using the search APIs may be limited since .htaccess is not directly part of the application code but Apache server configuration. Still, it's useful to understand how the application could interact with such redirects.\n\n2. **Python Requests Module Handling of Redirects**: Since the issue occurs with the Python requests library, it would be informative to gather context about how redirects are handled within the library.\n   - Explore if there is custom handling or logging of redirects within the application's interaction with the requests library.\n   - Review if the application encodes URLs or manipulates request/response objects in a manner related to redirects.\n\nGiven the above breakdown, the relevant API calls could include:\n\n- Searching for where the Python `requests` library is used in the application, particularly for `requests.get` or redirect handling:\n  ```python\n  search_method(\"get\")\n  ```\n \n- Exploring if there's any custom redirect handling or logging related to HTTP requests that might manipulate URL encoding, for context into how the application deals with redirects at a code level:\n  ```python\n  search_code(\"requests.get\")\n  search_code(\"redirect\")  # Broad search for redirect handling logic\n  ```\n\n- Since the issue seems to revolve around URL or URI encoding, especially with non-ASCII characters, looking into sections of the code dealing with such encoding might also be helpful:\n  ```python\n  search_code(\"urlencode\")\n  search_code(\"quote\")\n  ```\n\nThese API calls are designed to provide a broad landscape of how redirects and URL manipulations are handled within the application code, which should help in identifying the root cause of the issue or at least provide context for further debugging."
