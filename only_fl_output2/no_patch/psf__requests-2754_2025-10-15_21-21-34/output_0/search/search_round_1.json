This works fine in Firefox etc.\nWith requests, I get the following error (Python 3.4 with Requests 2.7.0 on a Japanese Ubuntu 15.04):\n```\n'<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN\">\\n<html><head>\\n<title>404 Not Found</title>\\n</head><body>\\n<h1>Not Found</h1>\\n<p>The requested URL /\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x83\u00c2\\x96\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x83\u00c2\\xad\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x82\u00c2\u00b0/ was not found on this server.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<address>Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS) Server at test.xn--q9jyb4c Port 80</address>\\n</body></html>\\n'\n```\nSo I guess the request lib gets a redirect from a server with Japanese characters, but then fails to convert the characters correctly. If I do `requests.get(http://test.\u307f\u3093\u306a/\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0)` directly it works, only the redirect does not.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to the .htaccess redirect not working with non-ASCII folder names, let's consider breaking down the issue into components and relevant API calls to make:\n\n1. **Understanding the Redirect Behavior in .htaccess**: The issue explicitly concerns a redirect rule in the .htaccess file that doesn't behave as expected when the destination is a non-ASCII folder name. However, our ability to directly analyze .htaccess file behavior using the search APIs may be limited since .htaccess is not directly part of the application code but Apache server configuration. Still, it's useful to understand how the application could interact with such redirects.\n\n2. **Python Requests Module Handling of Redirects**: Since the issue occurs with the Python requests library, it would be informative to gather context about how redirects are handled within the library.\n   - Explore if there is custom handling or logging of redirects within the application's interaction with the requests library.\n   - Review if the application encodes URLs or manipulates request/response objects in a manner related to redirects.\n\nGiven the above breakdown, the relevant API calls could include:\n\n- Searching for where the Python `requests` library is used in the application, particularly for `requests.get` or redirect handling:\n  ```python\n  search_method(\"get\")\n  ```\n \n- Exploring if there's any custom redirect handling or logging related to HTTP requests that might manipulate URL encoding, for context into how the application deals with redirects at a code level:\n  ```python\n  search_code(\"requests.get\")\n  search_code(\"redirect\")  # Broad search for redirect handling logic\n  ```\n\n- Since the issue seems to revolve around URL or URI encoding, especially with non-ASCII characters, looking into sections of the code dealing with such encoding might also be helpful:\n  ```python\n  search_code(\"urlencode\")\n  search_code(\"quote\")\n  ```\n\nThese API calls are designed to provide a broad landscape of how redirects and URL manipulations are handled within the application code, which should help in identifying the root cause of the issue or at least provide context for further debugging."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the API calls provides insight into several areas of the codebase, particularly those related to handling HTTP requests, redirects, and URL encoding. Below, I'll analyze the relevance of these results to the described issue.\n\n### Analysis of `requests.get`\nThe mention of `requests.get` in `requests/__init__.py` simply demonstrates a basic usage of the `requests` library to make a GET request to a URL and check the response. This snippet is straightforward and primarily illustrative, showing how the requests library is intended to be used in applications.\n\n#### Relevance to the Issue\nThis piece of code doesn't directly relate to the issue but underscores the standard mechanism for making requests. The issue likely lies in how redirects are handled by the library or how non-ASCII URLs are encoded/decoded during the redirect process, not in the basic operation of `requests.get` itself.\n\n### Analysis of `redirect` Handling\nThe search for \"redirect\" across the codebase returned 190 snippets in various files, most notably within `requests/sessions.py`, `requests/models.py`, and files within `requests/packages/urllib3/`. \n\n#### Relevance to the Issue\nRedirects are a complex part of HTTP interactions, involving status codes, header manipulation, and URL adjustments. Since the issue involves a failure during a redirect (specifically to a non-ASCII URL), these parts of the code are critically relevant. They may contain logic for how redirects are followed, including how the destination URLs are processed and encoded/decoded. The issue might arise if the redirect mechanism mishandles non-ASCII characters, potentially due to incorrect or insufficient URL encoding or decoding logic.\n\n### Analysis of `urlencode` and `quote` Usage\nThe searches for `urlencode` and `quote` returned snippets mainly in `requests/compat.py`, `requests/utils.py`, and `requests/models.py`, as well as in files under `requests/packages/urllib3/`. \n\n#### Relevance to the Issue\n`urlencode` and `quote` are functions used for encoding URL parameters and paths, converting non-ASCII characters into a format that can be transmitted over HTTP. Given the issue's nature\u2014problems redirecting to a URL with non-ASCII characters\u2014these parts of the code are highly likely to be involved. The intended behavior would ensure that any URLs, including those with non-ASCII characters, are correctly encoded for transmission and correctly decoded upon receipt. The problem described suggests that the actual behavior may involve incorrect, incomplete, or inconsistent encoding/decoding, leading to the observed error.\n\n### Next Steps for Detailed Analysis\nGiven this context, further examination should focus on how redirects are followed (particularly in `requests/sessions.py`) and how URLs are encoded/decoded during these processes (`requests/utils.py`, `requests/models.py`). Specifically, it would be beneficial to examine:\n- **Redirect Following Logic**: How `requests` handles the HTTP status codes for redirects (302, 301, etc.), and how it reconstructs URLs for the \"Location\" header. This involves looking into `requests/sessions.py`.\n- **URL Encoding/Decoding**: How and where `requests` encodes URLs before making a request and decodes them after receiving a redirect. This involves a closer look into the usage of `quote`, `unquote`, and `urlencode` within `requests/utils.py` and `requests/models.py`.\n\nTo refine the investigation further, it makes sense to look directly into the code handling redirects and URL encoding/decoding:\n- Inspect `requests/sessions.py` for HTTP redirect handling logic.\n- Inspect `requests/utils.py` and `requests/models.py` for URL encoding/decoding logic, focusing on the use of `quote` and `urlencode`."

The method must validate and, if necessary, re-encode the URL from the \"Location\" header in the redirect response to ensure that non-ASCII characters are correctly interpreted and called by the requests. This might involve using the `quote` and `unquote` functions appropriately to handle URLs with non-ASCII characters. Additionally, the method should include logic to debug or log encoding issues for easier troubleshooting of similar issues in the future.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: \n  - **File**: `requests/utils.py`\n  - **Class**: (Util functions, not necessarily within a specific class)\n\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Functions within this file responsible for encoding URLs (`quote`, `unquote`, `urlencode`, or similar) should be modified or extended to handle non-ASCII characters in URLs and redirects appropriately. It must ensure that any URL or part of a URL passed to it, especially those extracted from redirects, is encoded (or decoded) in a way that preserves non-ASCII characters without corruption. This behavior is essential to maintain the validity of URLs and to ensure they are accessible regardless of the character set they contain.\n\nThese locations and behaviors are critical for resolving the issue while maintaining the existing functionality of handling HTTP redirects and URL encoding in the requests library."
