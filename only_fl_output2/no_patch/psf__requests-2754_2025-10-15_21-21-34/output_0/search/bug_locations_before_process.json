The method must validate and, if necessary, re-encode the URL from the 'Location' header in the redirect response to ensure that non-ASCII characters are correctly interpreted and called by the requests. This might involve using the quote and unquote functions appropriately to handle URLs with non-ASCII characters. Additionally, the method should include logic to debug or log encoding issues for easier troubleshooting of similar issues in the future."

This behavior is essential to maintain the validity of URLs and to ensure they are accessible regardless of the character set they contain."
