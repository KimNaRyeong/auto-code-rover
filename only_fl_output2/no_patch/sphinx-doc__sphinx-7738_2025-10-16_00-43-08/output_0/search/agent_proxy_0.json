To understand how these extensions are configured and if there are any custom settings that might affect the parsing of attributes, searching the `conf.py` for the relevant setup lines is necessary.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"'sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'sphinx.ext.napoleon'\", \"conf.py\")`\n\n3. **Search for custom Napoleon extensions or overrides:** Given that the issue could stem from a custom extension or an overridden behavior specifically affecting Napoleon, searching for any custom implementation related to Napoleon across the project could provide important insights.\n   - `search_code(\"napoleon\")`\n\nThese API calls will help gather the required context around the class definition, Sphinx configuration, and any potential custom implementations affecting the rendering of attribute names, specifically addressing the issue with the overescaped trailing underscore."
