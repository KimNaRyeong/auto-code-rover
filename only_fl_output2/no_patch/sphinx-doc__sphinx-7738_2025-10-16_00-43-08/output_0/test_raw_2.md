Based on the requirements, it looks like the task aims to programmatically reproduce a Sphinx documentation issue regarding the display of a trailing underscore in attribute names, specifically when using the Napoleon extension. The Python script should set up a minimal Sphinx project, incorporate documentation that demonstrates the issue, and then check if the issue is indeed present in the generated HTML files. 

Implementing such a script within a single `reproducer.py` file requires handling several tasks: creating a minimal Sphinx environment programmatically, adding contents that exhibit the bug, building the documentation, and finally scanning the output for the problem. Given the complexity of simulating the full Sphinx environment in a standalone script without any external configuration, the approach will focus on a simplified skeleton that may need to be adapted slightly if run in environments that significantly differ from the expected one.

Here is an attempt to create such a `reproducer.py` file considering the simplicity of the task and the described requirements:

```python
import os
import shutil
import sys
import subprocess

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_environment():
    # Sphinx setup directories
    source_dir = 'src'
    build_dir = 'build'

    # Ensure clean environment
    if os.path.exists(source_dir):
        shutil.rmtree(source_dir)
    if os.path.exists(build_dir):
        shutil.rmtree(build_dir)

    os.makedirs(source_dir, exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs(build_dir, exist_ok=True)

    # Sphinx content that should trigger the issue
    conf_py = """
extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'sphinx.ext.napoleon']
project = 'Bug Reproducer'
    """

    index_rst = """
.. autoclass:: a.A
    """

    a_py = \"\"\"
class A:
    \"""
    Attributes
    ----------
    hello_: int
        hi
    \"""
    pass
\"\"\"

    # Write the files needed by Sphinx
    with open(os.path.join(source_dir, 'conf.py'), 'w') as f:
        f.write(conf_py)
    with open(os.path.join(source_dir, 'index.rst'), 'w') as f:
        f.write(index_rst)
    with open(os.path.join(source_dir, 'a.py'), 'w') as f:
        f.write(a_py)

def build_docs():
    cmd = ['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', 'src', 'build']
    try:
        subprocess.run(cmd, check=True, capture_output=True)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

def check_output_for_issue():
    try:
        with open('build/index.html', 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
            if "hello\\_" in content:
                raise AssertionError("Overescaped trailing underscore found in HTML.")
            else:
                print("Issue not resolved, documentation generated correctly.")
                sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

def main():
    setup_sphinx_environment()
    build_docs()
    check_output_for_issue()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script follows these steps:
1. Sets up a minimal Sphinx project with a configuration that includes the necessary extensions and a Python file that demonstrates the issue.
2. Builds the Sphinx documentation using the `sphinx-build` command.
3. Checks if the generated HTML contains the issue.
4. It calls `print_stacktrace` and uses `sys.exit` to properly report errors or successful detection of the issue.

Note: Running this script as is may require you to have Sphinx installed and possibly accessible within the current Python environment or system path. This script may also need modifications to match certain system-specific configurations or constraints.
