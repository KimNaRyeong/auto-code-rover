Sure! Below is a Python script named `reproducer.py`, which aims to programmatically reproduce the aforementioned issue with Sphinx where an overescaped trailing underscore on an attribute with Napoleon results in an unwanted backslash in the generated HTML documentation.

The script does the following:
1. It sets up a minimal Sphinx project with all necessary configurations.
2. It then generates documentation for a simple Python class with an attribute ending in an underscore.
3. Finally, it checks the generated HTML for the presence of the backslash before the underscore, raising an `AssertionError` if found.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_project():
    if not os.path.exists("docs"):
        os.makedirs("docs")
    with open("docs/conf.py", "w") as conf_file:
        conf_file.write(
            "extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'sphinx.ext.napoleon']\n"
            "project = 'Test Project'\n"
        )
    with open("docs/index.rst", "w") as index_file:
        index_file.write(".. autoclass:: a.A\n")
    with open("a.py", "w") as a_py:
        a_py.write(
            "class A:\n"
            '    """\n'
            "    Attributes\n"
            "    ----------\n"
            "    hello_: int\n"
            "        hi\n"
            '    """\n'
            "    pass\n"
        )

                raise AssertionError("Overescaped underscore found in HTML.")
    except Exception as e:

        raise

**Note**:
- This script assumes that you have Sphinx installed (`sphinx`, `sphinx-autodoc`, `sphinxcontrib-napoleon`) and that it's compatible with your Python version.
- Ensure you replace `subprocess.run(["sphinx-apidoc", "-o", "docs", "."])` and `subprocess.run(["sphinx-build", "-b", "html", "docs", "docs/_build"])` with the appropriate commands if your setup requires something different.
- This script may need modifications to run in environments with specific configurations or restrictions.
- The directory and file creation in `setup_sphinx_project`, and Sphinx command invocations in `run_sphinx` are minimal and might need adjustments to fully emulate your Sphinx setup.
