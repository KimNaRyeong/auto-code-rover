        "content": "To address the issue and gather sufficient code context, we need to understand the structure and implementation of the `inspectdb` command in Django. Specifically, we are interested in how the command converts table names to model names, as well as how it handles column names, since these areas are directly related to the described issue. Given the information provided, here is a list of API calls that will help us collect the relevant code context:\n\n1. Search for the class where the `inspectdb` command is implemented to understand its current structure and methods:\n   - `search_class(\"Command\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a public method for column names, let's also look at the implementation of this method to understand the current logic for name conversion and how it might be extended or overridden:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"column_name_to_python\", \"django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py\")`\n\n3. The issue suggests a modification or extension to allow overriding the table name to model name conversion logic. To ensure we grasp the current implementation and consider the right place for this extension, we need to locate where the existing conversion happens:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"table name to model name\", \"django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py\")`\n\n4. To ensure completeness, reviewing the cited proposed PR might provide insights into what changes are being suggested or how the contributor is approaching this enhancement. Unfortunately, we don't have direct access to an external URL fetching mechanism here, but it's important to consider reviewing this PR (`https://github.com/django/django/pull/16883`) for detailed specifics on the proposed change when you have access to Github. \n\nThese API calls will give us a good starting point by shedding light on the existing implementation of the `inspectdb` command, its method for converting column names, and the area where table name to model name conversion logic is located.

The relevant file for our issue is `django/contrib/gis/management/commands/inspectdb.py` as well as `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py`. Given the nature of the issue, it seems we're interested in the core `inspectdb` implementation rather than any GIS-specific extensions.\n   * **Relation to the issue:** Our task involves modifying or extending the `inspectdb` command, hence the relevance.\n   * **Intended behavior:** Ideally, the `inspectdb` class in this file should offer a customizable way for users to override table name to model name conversion logic.\n\n2. **Method column_name_to_python**:\n   * This method doesn't appear in the `inspectdb` command file, which might indicate a mistake in our search term or that the logic is handled differently or named differently.\n   * **Relation to the issue:** Given that the issue mentions a method for column names that can be overridden, we may need to look for similar functionality related to table names.\n   * **Intended behavior:** Based on the issue's description, the methodology to convert table names to model names should ideally be modular or override-able, similar to how column names might be handled.\n\n3. **Search for \"table name to model name\"**:\n   * No direct code references were found with this search term, which may suggest either the logic is embedded within a larger method without explicit comments or it's identified differently in the source code.\n   * **Relation to the issue:** Understanding how `inspectdb` currently translates table names to model names is crucial for adding an override mechanism.\n   * **Intended behavior:** We are looking for the part of the code that establishes this naming convention, which the issue intends to make customizable.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis:\n\n1. **Correct Identification of the Method for Table to Model Conversion**:\n   * Given the provided information and results, it's clear we need to focus on the correct identification of the part of the `inspectdb` command that handles table to model name conversion. The initial search may have been too broad or misspecified.\n\n2. **Redefine Search Terms**:\n   * We should look for a method that could logically handle table name to model conversion within the `inspectdb` file. The naming might not be as straightforward as the initial search terms suggested.\n\n3. **Additional API Calls**:\n   - Consider searching for methods in `inspectdb.py` that handle string or name processing to find our target logic.\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"table2model\", \"django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py\")` as a guess based on common naming conventions might be worth trying. If this method name is incorrect, replacing \"table2model\" with another logical guess or partial method names relevant to model creation or naming might be necessary.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"class\", \"django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py\")` might also help narrow down sections where models are declared, potentially revealing how table names are converted to model names.\n    \nThese steps aim at pinpointing the exact location within the `inspectdb` command where the logic for converting table names into model names resides, allowing us to understand the current behavior and paving the way for implementing the requested feature."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This method should provide a customizable mechanism for users extending the `inspectdb` command. The default implementation can utilize the existing conversion logic, thus preserving current functionality. The new method would ideally accept a table name as input and return the desired model name as output. This would allow developers to implement custom naming schemes, such as preserving PascalCase from database table names directly in the Django model names, which is not currently supported by default. This enhancement will improve the flexibility of the `inspectdb` command, enabling it to accommodate a wider range of database naming conventions and schema designs."
