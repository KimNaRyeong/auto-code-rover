        "intended_behavior": "The `Command` class within this file should include a new method that allows for overriding the table name to model name conversion logic. This method should provide a customizable mechanism for users extending the `inspectdb` command. The default implementation can utilize the existing conversion logic, thus preserving current functionality. The new method would ideally accept a table name as input and return the desired model name as output. This would allow developers to implement custom naming schemes, such as preserving PascalCase from database table names directly in the Django model names, which is not currently supported by default. This enhancement will improve the flexibility of the `inspectdb` command, enabling it to accommodate a wider range of database naming conventions and schema designs."
