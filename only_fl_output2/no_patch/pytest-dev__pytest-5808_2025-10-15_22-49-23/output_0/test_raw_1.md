Given the feedback and addressing the mistake regarding `urllib.request.Response` which doesn't exist as a direct type or class in the `urllib.request` module, let's correct the standalone Python script to properly reproduce the issue. We'll adjust the function's return type annotation and the error handling mechanism. Here's the revised `reproducer.py` script without assuming the incorrect type annotation:

```python
import urllib.request
import urllib.parse

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def submit_to_paste_service(contents: bytes, lexer: str = 'python3'):
    data = urllib.parse.urlencode({
        'lexer': lexer,
        'code': contents.decode('utf-8'),
    }).encode()
    req = urllib.request.Request("https://bpaste.net/api", data=data, method='POST')
    # This will return the HTTP response which can be used to check the status code or any result
    return urllib.request.urlopen(req)

def main():
    try:
        # Ensure data.txt exists with some content that triggers the error
        with open("data.txt", "rb") as in_fh:
            data = in_fh.read()
        
        # Try submitting to bpaste.net with lexer=python3, expecting to trigger an HTTP 400 error
        response = submit_to_paste_service(data)
        # If response code is not 200, we expect an error
        assert response.getcode() == 200, "Expected HTTP 200 OK, indicating an issue with lexer='python3'."

    except AssertionError as assert_error:
        print("AssertionError: The test reproduced the issue as expected.")
        # If you wish to raise the AssertionError uncomment the next line
        # raise assert_error
    except urllib.error.HTTPError as http_error:
        # Catching HTTPError separately to handle expected 400 error
        if http_error.code == 400:
            print("HTTPError: Bad Request - the issue is reproduced successfully.")
        else:
            print_stacktrace(http_error)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An unexpected Exception occurred.") from e
    else:
        print("The script didn't reproduce the issue, indicating the issue might have been fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script ensures we are capturing the correct behavior and handling the HTTP responses appropriately. The `submit_to_paste_service` function now correctly doesn't claim to return a non-existent type, and we properly handle the possible `urllib.error.HTTPError` which can be thrown when the server returns error status codes (like 400). 

Ensure the `data.txt` file exists with content known to cause the issue before running the corrected script. This script also adapts to capture the HTTP 400 error as an expected outcome to confirm the issue's presence.
