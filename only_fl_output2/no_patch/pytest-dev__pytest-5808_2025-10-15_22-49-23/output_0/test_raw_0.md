This script attempts to reproduce the issue described. Save it as `reproducer.py` and execute it in the project's root directory. The script expects a file named `data.txt` in the same directory for the test case. 

- When the bug is present, it should catch the failure of submitting the paste with `lexer=python3` and raise an `AssertionError`, printing a stack trace if any error other than the AssertionError intended to indicate the success/failure state occurs.
- The script exits with code 0 only if the attempt to submit with `lexer='python3'` unexpectedly succeeds, implying the issue may have been fixed.
