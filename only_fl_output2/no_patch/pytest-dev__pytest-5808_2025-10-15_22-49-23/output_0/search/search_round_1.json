        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insight into the functionality and issues surrounding the `--pastebin` feature in the pytest project.\n\n### Analysis of `create_new_paste` in `src/_pytest/pastebin.py`\n\n1. **What this part of the code does:**\n   - The function `create_new_paste` attempts to upload given contents to `bpaste.net`. It uses the parameters `code` for the paste content, `lexer` for syntax highlighting (set to `python3`), and `expiry` for the paste's expiration time (set to `1week`).\n   - The code constructs a URL-encoded set of parameters, sends a request to `bpaste.net`, and parses the response to extract a URL that points to the newly created paste if successful. If the request fails or the response format is not as expected, it returns an error message.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:**\n   - The issue reported is a HTTP 400 error when using `lexer=python3` for certain contents. This piece of code is directly responsible for making the HTTP request with those parameters. Hence, the bug occurs here during the call to `urlopen`, which raises an `OSError` due to the bad request.\n   - Given the bug report's detail that changing `lexer` from `python3` to `text` avoids the error, the problematic part is clearly the parameter setup (`params` dict) where `lexer` is set.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n   - The intended behavior of this part of the code is to submit the test output from pytest to `bpaste.net` for easy sharing, regardless of the content type. Since the issue report suggests that console outputs are not specifically Python code and can be arbitrary text, the correct behavior should not assume it's always Python code for syntax highlighting purposes. Therefore, changing `lexer` from `python3` to `text` should align the implementation with the intended behavior: successfully uploading and sharing console outputs without causing HTTP errors.\n\n### Moving forward with this knowledge, the intended patch would involve altering the `lexer` parameter from `python3` to `text` in the `params` dictionary within `create_new_paste`. This would presumably resolve the HTTP 400 errors reported by users when arbitrary (non-Python-specific) text is uploaded using the `--pastebin` feature. Further testing would be required to ensure this change does not introduce any new issues and that it fully addresses the reported bug."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Instead, it should be set to `text`. This change ensures that arbitrary text, such as the console output of a `pytest` run, can be successfully uploaded to `bpaste.net` without encountering a \"HTTP Error 400: Bad Request\" due to improper syntax highlighting expectations.\n   - The changed line should look like this: `params = {\"code\": contents, \"lexer\": \"text\", \"expiry\": \"1week\"}`\n   - This modification preserves the existing functionality of uploading paste contents to `bpaste.net` and receiving a URL to the pasted contents or an error message. The adjustment only changes the assumption about the type of content being uploaded, aligning it more closely with the actual use case of the `--pastebin` feature which is to share `pytest` output, thus resolving the associated bug."
