        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `create_new_paste` method should no longer hard-code the `lexer` parameter to `python3` when constructing the `params` dictionary for the HTTP request. Instead, it should be set to `text`. This change ensures that arbitrary text, such as the console output of a `pytest` run, can be successfully uploaded to `bpaste.net` without encountering a \"HTTP Error 400: Bad Request\" due to improper syntax highlighting expectations. The changed line should look like this: `params = {\"code\": contents, \"lexer\": \"text\", \"expiry\": \"1week\"}` This modification preserves the existing functionality of uploading paste contents to `bpaste.net` and receiving a URL to the pasted contents or an error message. The adjustment only changes the assumption about the type of content being uploaded, aligning it more closely with the actual use case of the `--pastebin` feature which is to share `pytest` output, thus resolving the associated bug."
