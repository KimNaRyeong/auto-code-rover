Here is the standalone Python script `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the given issue and check for its resolution. It follows the instructions you provided for raising an `AssertionError` if the issue is present and printing a stack trace of the issue. It exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_simplify_cos_i():
    from sympy import Symbol, cos, simplify
    x = Symbol('x')
    try:
        result = simplify(cos(x)**I)
        # The operation should raise an Exception for the issue
        # If it succeeds, then the issue is presumed to be fixed
        print("Issue seems to be resolved, exiting with code 0")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert isinstance(e, TypeError), "Expected TypeError, got different exception"
        assert "Invalid comparison of complex I" in str(e), "Expected specific error message, got different message"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_simplify_cos_i()
```

This Python script is meant to be executed in the environment where the SymPy library is installed and its path is correctly set up. Make sure you have the correct version of SymPy where this issue is known to exist for the script to effectively reproduce the issue. When the issue is fixed in a future version of SymPy, this script should exit gracefully, indicating the resolution.
