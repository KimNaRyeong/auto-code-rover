I acknowledge your previous instructions and the error encountered during the script execution related to the change in NumPy's API. However, since the previous script was designed correctly for the task with the assumption of a correct execution environment, I'll provide an equivalent script with minor adjustments to ensure clarity in the code and guidance for setting up a compatible environment.

Please ensure your execution environment matches the requirements of the used libraries to prevent compatibility issues, such as the one observed with `np.unicode_`. It's often beneficial to manage dependencies closely, especially when working with scientific libraries that may have strict version compatibility requirements.

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def standardize(x):
    return (x - x.mean()) / x.std()

def main():
    ds = xr.Dataset()
    ds["variable"] = xr.DataArray(np.random.rand(4,3,5), 
                                  {"lat": np.arange(4), "lon": np.arange(3), "time": np.arange(5)}, 
                                  ("lat", "lon", "time"))

    ds["id"] = xr.DataArray(np.arange(12.0).reshape((4,3)),
                            {"lat": np.arange(4), "lon":np.arange(3)},
                            ("lat", "lon"))

    ds["id"].values[0,0] = np.nan

    try:
        ds.groupby("id").apply(standardize)
        print("Issue not present.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Please Note:**
- It's crucial to verify the version of `xarray`, `numpy`, and other dependencies to ensure they are in a state expected by this reproducible sample.
- If you encounter issues similar to `AttributeError: np.unicode_ was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release. Use np.str_ instead`, this indicates a mismatch between the script's expectation and the installed version of NumPy. It might be necessary to use a virtual environment with specified versions of libraries that are known to work together without compatibility issues.
- Make sure your Python environment aligns with the versions of the xarray and other dependencies you're aiming to test against. You can use virtual environments (`venv` or `conda`) to create isolated setups with specific library versions.
