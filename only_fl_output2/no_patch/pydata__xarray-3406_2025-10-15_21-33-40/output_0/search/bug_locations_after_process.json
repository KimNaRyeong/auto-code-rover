        "intended_behavior": "The `inverse_permutation` function should be modified or extended to handle cases where NaN values are present within the indices array. Given that the presence of NaN values in group identifiers leads to an `IndexError` during permutation, the function must incorporate a mechanism to either ignore NaN values or handle them in a manner that does not affect the calculation of inverse permutation. A potential approach could involve filtering out NaN values before calculating the permutation indices or assigning them a default index that is omitted from the final permutation array. This change ensures that operations on datasets with NaN values in group identifiers proceed without causing an `IndexError`, aligning with the user's expectation that NaN values are automatically excluded from group operations similar to pandas' behavior."
