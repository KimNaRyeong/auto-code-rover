Here's the corrected standalone Python script named `reproducer.py`, which aims to reproduce the issue described. This file should be saved to the root directory of your project and executed with Python 3. Follow the instructions in the code comments if modifications are needed based on the library versions or Python environment.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        import xarray as xr
        import numpy as np

        def standardize(x):
            return (x - x.mean()) / x.std()

        ds = xr.Dataset()
        ds["variable"] = xr.DataArray(np.random.rand(4, 3, 5),
                                      {"lat": np.arange(4), "lon": np.arange(3), "time": np.arange(5)},
                                      ("lat", "lon", "time"))

        ds["id"] = xr.DataArray(np.arange(12.0).reshape((4, 3)),
                                {"lat": np.arange(4), "lon": np.arange(3)},
                                ("lat", "lon"))

        # Introducing a NaN to potentially cause the issue
        ds["id"].values[0, 0] = np.nan

        # This operation is expected to possibly raise an error
        ds.groupby("id").apply(standardize)
        
        # If the operation succeeds without raising an Exception, then the issue is not present
        print("Issue not present, exited with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # AssertionError is raised to indicate the presence of the issue described
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script attempts to reproduce the `IndexError` issue arising from the use of `groupby().apply()` on a dataset with `NaN` values in `xarray`. Upon execution, it should reproduce the error, and through the provided `print_stacktrace()` function, it will output a detailed traceback. This traceback can be used to understand at which point and why the error occurs.

- If the script raises the `AssertionError`, it means the issue is present as expected.
- If the script exits with code 0 (printing "Issue not present, exited with code 0."), it means the issue has been resolved in the current environment or library versions you are using.
