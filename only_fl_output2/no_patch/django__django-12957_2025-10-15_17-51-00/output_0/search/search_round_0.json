        "content": "To address the issue described, it would be beneficial to collect more context from the specified file and location where float values are handled, particularly within the `gis/admin/openlayers.js` template mentioned. Since this involves a JavaScript template file used in a Django admin context, specific template tags or value presentation methods are likely to be in focus. The issue points towards ensuring that float values are rendered with a dot as the decimal separator, regardless of the locale settings that might modify this behavior ('DECIMAL_SEPARATOR'). A direct code search within the specific file might provide insights into how float values are currently processed.\n\nHere are the API calls that will be necessary to gather the required details:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_code_in_file(\"DECIMAL_SEPARATOR\", \"contrib/gis/templates/gis/admin/openlayers.js\")\nsearch_code_in_file(\"{{\", \"contrib/gis/templates/gis/admin/openlayers.js\")\n```\n\nThese calls are designed to:\n1. Identify any explicit references to `DECIMAL_SEPARATOR` that could affect how float values are handled in the JavaScript context.\n2. Look for Django template variable tags (`{{ }}`) where floating point numbers might be used, to see how they are currently being output and to identify where the `|safe` filter could be beneficially applied."
