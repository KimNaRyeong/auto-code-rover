The key to solving the issue lies not directly within modifications to this Python file but understanding its role in defining the template used (`gis/admin/openlayers.html`) points towards where the fix should be applied, which is within the HTML template itself. The intended behavior at this location is correct and does not require modification; it serves as a pointer to where the actual change needs to be made (in the HTML template or the JavaScript it integrates)."

        "intended_behavior": "Ensure all floating-point values are formatted with a dot (`.`) as the decimal separator for JavaScript compatibility. This might require modifications where variables containing floating-point numbers are handed off to JavaScript code within the template. Using the Django template language, apply appropriate filters or methods to convert these values to strings that conform to JavaScript's expected format, potentially combining `floatformat` and `safe` filters where appropriate. Additionally, it's important to verify or add explicit comments/documentation within the template or related Python views to highlight the necessity of this formatting for future maintainability and clarity, acknowledging the potential for `DECIMAL_SEPARATOR` to affect JavaScript syntax."
