        "content": "The collected context from the API calls yields insightful details on the structure and functionality related to the issue:\n\n### 1. LocaleMiddleware in `django/middleware/locale.py`\n- **Functionality**: This middleware is responsible for determining the user's language by looking at various hints (like the `Accept-Language` HTTP header) and then setting the appropriate translation object in Django. It is the first touchpoint for locale determination, thus playing a crucial role in the internationalization (i18n) framework of Django.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: Given the nature of the bug, it's likely that `LocaleMiddleware` relies indirectly on the outcome of `get_supported_language_variant` to set the request's language. However, the middleware itself may not be directly at fault; rather, how `get_supported_language_variant` interprets and selects language codes based on the `Accept-Language` header and the `settings.LANGUAGES` setup might be.\n- **Intended Behavior**: Ideally, `LocaleMiddleware` should correctly interpret `zh-Hant-HK` from the `Accept-Language` header and select the most appropriate language variant available in `settings.LANGUAGES`, respecting the specificity of the `Accept-Language` specifications.\n\n### 2. get_supported_language_variant method in various locations\n#### `django/utils/translation/trans_real.py`\n- **Functionality**: This method attempts to find the best match for a provided language code (`lang_code`) within the application's list of supported languages. It deals with both strict and non-strict matching, allowing fallbacks to generic language codes (e.g., `fr` for `fr-CA`) or specific dialects/regional languages if an exact match is not found.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: This method is at the core of the reported issue. The mechanism by which it attempts to find a suitable language variant does not seem to account correctly for scenarios where there might be multiple dialects or scripts (like `zh-Hans` vs. `zh-Hant`) for the same base language code. Specifically, the lookup and fallback logic might not prioritize regional or script subtags adequately.\n- **Intended Behavior**: The method should ideally resolve `zh-Hant-HK` to a language code provided in `settings.LANGUAGES` that best matches this specification, preferring `zh-Hant` over `zh-Hans` when both are possible matches.\n\n#### Other occurrences (`__init__.py` and `trans_null.py`)\n- These implementations of `get_supported_language_variant` delegate to the real implementation (`trans_real.py`) or serve as placeholders (in the case of `trans_null.py`), indicating how the translation system abstracts over actual and null implementations.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\nGiven the context:\n- The core issue seems to reside within `django/utils/translation/trans_real.py` in how `get_supported_language_variant` handles language selection, especially when dealing with languages that have multiple scripts or regional dialects.\n- To address the issue, examining how `possible_lang_codes` and `supported_lang_codes` are generated and checked against each other is essential, particularly how the algorithm prioritizes or fails to prioritize regional or script subtags appropriately.\n\nConsidering these insights, the next concrete step towards resolving the bug would involve closer inspection of `get_supported_language_variant` logic in `trans_real.py`, especially lines involving the generation and iteration over `possible_lang_codes`. Further investigation could include analyzing how `settings.LANGUAGES` and the Accept-Language header's values are interpreted and matched against each other."

This involves:\n\n- Improving the logic that generates `possible_lang_codes` to ensure that if a language code with a script or region is requested (e.g., `zh-Hant-HK`), the method should prioritize finding a match for this specific request over a more general language code that might also be a valid match but not as specific (e.g., preferring `zh-Hant` over `zh-Hans` when `zh-Hant-HK` is requested).\n- In the part of the code that iterates through `possible_lang_codes` and checks these against `supported_lang_codes`, the function should implement a more nuanced selection process. This might involve checking all possible variations of the language code (including both script and regional specificity) before defaulting to a more generic code.\n- The lookup process should explicitly account for script variations (such as `Hans` and `Hant` for Chinese) as well as regional variations, ensuring that the most appropriate and specific match is selected according to the preferences expressed in the `Accept-Language` header and available in `settings.LANGUAGES`.\n\nThis enhancement should maintain the method's existing functionality for languages without script or regional variations, ensuring that the method continues to select the best match for language codes that do not include such specificity."
