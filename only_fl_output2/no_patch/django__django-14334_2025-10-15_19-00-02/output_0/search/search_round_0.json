Search for the `LocaleMiddleware` class to understand how it integrates within the Django framework, which files it is located in, and potentially how it utilizes the faulty `get_supported_language_variant` method.\n2. Search directly for the `get_supported_language_variant` method to see where it is defined, which will likely point us to the location of the code that needs patching.\n3. Since the issue description specifically mentions `django.utils.translation.trans_real.get_supported_language_variant`, it's clear that the `get_supported_language_variant` method is within the `trans_real.py` module under `django.utils.translation`. Although we know the module path from the issue description, searching for the method can provide additional context such as method definition and related comments in the code.\n\nLet's perform these API calls:\n\n- search_class(\"LocaleMiddleware\")\n- search_method(\"get_supported_language_variant\")"
