        "intended_behavior": "The `get_supported_language_variant` function should be enhanced to more accurately prioritize and select language codes that include script or regional subtags, particularly in scenarios where multiple options (like `zh-hans` and `zh-hant`) are available. This involves:\n\n- Improving the logic that generates `possible_lang_codes` to ensure that if a language code with a script or region is requested (e.g., `zh-Hant-HK`), the method should prioritize finding a match for this specific request over a more general language code that might also be a valid match but not as specific (e.g., preferring `zh-Hant` over `zh-Hans` when `zh-Hant-HK` is requested).\n- In the part of the code that iterates through `possible_lang_codes` and checks these against `supported_lang_codes`, the function should implement a more nuanced selection process. This might involve checking all possible variations of the language code (including both script and regional specificity) before defaulting to a more generic code.\n- The lookup process should explicitly account for script variations (such as `Hans` and `Hant` for Chinese) as well as regional variations, ensuring that the most appropriate and specific match is selected according to the preferences expressed in the `Accept-Language` header and available in `settings.LANGUAGES`.\n\nThis enhancement should maintain the method's existing functionality for languages without script or regional variations, ensuring that the method continues to select the best match for language codes that do not include such specificity."
