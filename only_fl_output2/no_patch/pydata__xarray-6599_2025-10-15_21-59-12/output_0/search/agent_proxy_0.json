Based on the description and the code provided in the issue, the relevant information includes the `polyval` function itself and any recent changes that might affect its behavior when used with `timedelta64` types.\n\nLet's start with the following API calls to get the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the `polyval` function in the entire codebase to identify where it is defined and how it's implemented.\n2. Since `polyval` is likely to operate on arrays or data structures (given its usage with `xarray.DataArray` and numpy arrays), understanding how these types are handled will be crucial. The issue mentions a change in behavior between versions, suggesting a recent modification might be the culprit. However, without direct references to specific classes or methods that were modified, investigating `polyval` itself is our best starting point.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"polyval\")\n```"
