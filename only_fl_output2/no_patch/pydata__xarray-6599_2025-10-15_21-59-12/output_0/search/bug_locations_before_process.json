        "intended_behavior": "The method `polyval` within `xarray/core/computation.py` should be revised to ensure it properly handles inputs of type `timedelta64`. This involves ensuring that any arithmetic or evaluation performed by `polyval` accurately accounts for the nuances of `timedelta64` data types. The intended behavior is for `polyval` to return consistent and accurate polynomial evaluations when given `timedelta64` coordinates as inputs, aligning with the results observed in version `2022.3.0`. This likely requires validating the data type of the coordinates and applying any necessary conversions or adjustments to ensure that polynomial coefficients are applied correctly during the evaluation. The fix should preserve the existing functionality of `polyval` for all other data types it supports while rectifying the regression observed with `timedelta64` types."
