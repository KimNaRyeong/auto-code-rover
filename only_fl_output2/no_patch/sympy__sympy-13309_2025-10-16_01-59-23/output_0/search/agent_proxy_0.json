Here are the API calls we should perform:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Max\")` - To find the class definition or implementation details of Max.\n2. `search_class(\"Min\")` - Similarly, to find information on the Min class or function to understand its current structure.\n3. `search_method(\"rewrite\")` - To find existing implementations of the rewrite method, which might be on the Max, Min classes, or any other class that could give insight into how to implement the rewrite method for these.\n4. `search_code(\"Piecewise\")` - Since the issue mentions rewriting in terms of Piecewise, searching for existing code snippets that involve Piecewise might reveal implementation details or how Piecewise is typically handled in the project, aiding in the correct implementation of the feature request."
