        "intended_behavior": "Implement a new method named `_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise` within the `Max` class. This method should take the Max function's arguments and rewrite them in terms of a `Piecewise` expression. For example, `Max(a, b)` should be rewritten as `Piecewise((a, a>b), (b, True))`, indicating that `a` is chosen when `a > b`, and `b` is the default choice. This implementation should preserve the general contract of rewrite methods in SymPy, allowing expressions to be conditionally transformed into equivalent forms. This new method would enable symbolic manipulation and simplification of expressions where the maximum is defined by a condition."

        "method": "_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise",
        "intended_behavior": "Similarly, for the `Min` class, define the method `_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise`. This method handles the transformation of `Min` expressions into `Piecewise` format, using logical conditions to determine the minimum value. For instance, `Min(a, b)` would be expressed as `Piecewise((a, a<b), (b, True))`, signifying that `a` is selected if `a` is less than `b`, with `b` being the fallback option. This method provides a structured way to logically and symbolically deduce the minimum of the given parameters, fitting with the SymPy's approach to expression rewriting and enhancing the toolkit available for mathematical and symbolic computations."
