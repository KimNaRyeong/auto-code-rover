Here is a standalone Python script designed to reproduce the issue as you described. It will attempt to rewrite a `Max` function using `Piecewise` and will raise an `AssertionError` if the output does not match the expected result. If the issue is reproduced, it will print a stack trace of the issue. If the issue is fixed and the output matches the expected result, the script should exit with code 0 without any error.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import Max, symbols, Piecewise

    a, b = symbols('a b')
    try:
        result = Max(a, b).rewrite(Piecewise)
        expected = Piecewise((a, a>b), (b, True))
        # An assertion check to make sure the result matches the expected output
        assert result.equals(expected), f"Result did not match expected output. Got: {result}"

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # If the assertion fails or any other Exception occurs, exit with a non-zero exit code
        exit(1)
    else:
        # If the rewrite matches the expected behavior and no exception occurs, exit with code 0
        print("The issue is fixed.")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

When you run `python3 reproducer.py` with this script, it tries to rewrite `Max(a, b)` as a `Piecewise` function. If `sympy` can't do this or does it incorrectly (not matching the expected output), an `AssertionError` will be raised if the output is wrong, or another exception type will be raised for other types of failures, and the exception's stack trace will be printed to stderr.

Remember, for this script to work, you need to have `sympy` installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip if necessary:

```
pip install sympy
```
