Given the clarification and aiming to directly address the scenario involving Sphinx and its specific issue parsing the `**` operator in argument lists, a revised approach is necessary. This scenario can be potentially cumbersome to replicate merely through subprocess execution or standard Python script flow, especially considering the interaction with Sphinx internals. However, the illustration below attempts to create a scenario closer to a genuine Sphinx extension or script running Sphinx programmatically, which might face the issue when encountering specific rst syntax.

We will create a minimalistic Sphinx environment within a Python script and attempt to compile a small piece of documentation that includes the described problematic syntax. If Sphinx emits the specific warning regarding parsing the argument list, we'll catch it and act accordingly.

```python
import sys
import os
from sphinx.application import Sphinx
from sphinx.errors import SphinxWarning

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx(source_dir, conf_dir, output_dir, doctree_dir):
    app = Sphinx(
        srcdir=source_dir,
        confdir=conf_dir,
        outdir=output_dir,
        doctreedir=doctree_dir,
        buildername='html'
    )
    return app

def add_documentation(app):
    index_rst = os.path.join(app.srcdir, 'index.rst')
    with open(index_rst, 'w') as f:
        f.write(".. py:method:: f(*, a=2**4)\n")
        f.write(".. py:method:: g(a=2**4)\n")

def main():
    try:
        # Setup directories
        source_dir = '_source'
        conf_dir = '_conf'
        output_dir = '_build'
        doctree_dir = '_doctrees'
        
        os.makedirs(source_dir, exist_ok=True)
        os.makedirs(conf_dir, exist_ok=True)
        os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
        os.makedirs(doctree_dir, exist_ok=True)

        # Minimal conf.py
        with open(os.path.join(conf_dir, 'conf.py'), 'w') as f:
            f.write("extensions = []\n")

        app = setup_sphinx(source_dir, conf_dir, output_dir, doctree_dir)
        add_documentation(app)

        app.build()

        print("Sphinx build completed successfully, no issues found.")
        sys.exit(0)

    except SphinxWarning as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert "could not parse arglist" in str(e), "Unexpected SphinxWarning caught."
        sys.exit(1)

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script attempts to replicate the Sphinx documentation generation process programmatically, including the creation of an `index.rst` that contains the problematic syntax. This approach is based on leveraging Sphinx's API directly, offering a targeted way to simulate the documentation compilation process that leads to the described issue. While this script still focuses on the generation of documentation and catching errors or warnings at a high level, the internal behavior of Sphinx, including how it handles and emits warnings during the parsing phase, can be more nuanced and might require additional handling based on the actual Sphinx version used and its internal logging mechanisms.
