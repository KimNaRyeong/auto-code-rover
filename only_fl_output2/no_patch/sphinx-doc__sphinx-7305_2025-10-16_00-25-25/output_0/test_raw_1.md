Given the specifics of your request, the aim is to craft a `reproducer.py` that directly targets the issue within a Sphinx environment. As the reported issue pertains to Sphinx's handling of specific reStructuredText (rst) syntax, particularly around the parsing of default arguments that use the `**` operator, the standalone script has to simulate as close as possible the conditions under which Sphinx parses docstrings or rst files. It should check for the presence of the specific warning or error mentioned ("could not parse arglist").

However, capturing warnings directly emitted to stdout or stderr by Sphinx (or any other application) in a way that influences the execution flow (e.g., raising an AssertionError) can be challenging without hooking into the logging mechanism or overriding parts of the Sphinx application itself. Below is a conceptual approach that attempts to do this within the limitations described:

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_sphinx_build():
    # Create minimal Sphinx project directories and files
    with open('conf.py', 'w') as f:
        f.write("extensions = []\n")

    with open('index.rst', 'w') as f:
        f.write(".. py:method:: f(*, a=2**4)\n")
        f.write(".. py:method:: g(a=2**4)\n")

    # Invoke Sphinx build process as a subprocess to capture its output and errors
    result = subprocess.run(['sphinx-build', '.', '_build'], capture_output=True, text=True)

    # Check if the specific warning is present in stderr
    if "WARNING: could not parse arglist" in result.stderr:
        raise AssertionError("Sphinx issue detected: could not parse arglist with ** operator.")

    print("Test passed, no issues found.")
    return result.returncode

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        exit_code = run_sphinx_build()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error status if AssertionError is caught
    sys.exit(exit_code)  # Exit with the same status as the Sphinx build process
```
This script attempts to:
1. Dynamically create a minimal Sphinx project with a `conf.py` and `index.rst` containing the problematic syntax.
2. Run `sphinx-build` as a subprocess, capturing its stdout and stderr output.
3. Check the stderr output for the specific warning indicating the issue.
4. If the warning is detected, an AssertionError is raised, and the script exits with status code 1. Otherwise, it exits with the status code returned by the Sphinx build process (typically 0 on success).

Notes:
- This script assumes `sphinx-build` is available in the environment's PATH. The environment should have Sphinx installed and be Python 3-compatible.
- Before running this script, ensure that the current directory is suitable for creating the temporary Sphinx project files (`conf.py` and `index.rst`).
- Depending on your environment and Sphinx configuration, you might need to adjust the `subprocess.run` call's arguments, particularly the paths to `sphinx-build` or the source/destination directory arguments.
