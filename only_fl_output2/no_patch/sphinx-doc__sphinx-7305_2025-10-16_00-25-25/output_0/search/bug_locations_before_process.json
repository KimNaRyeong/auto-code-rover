        "intended_behavior": "The `handle_signature` method should be enhanced to successfully parse argument lists (`arglist`) containing binary operations like `2**4`. This requires implementing or improving upon logic that accurately interprets and represents these operations within default arguments of Python method/function signatures in documentation. The enhancement should maintain the method's existing functionality for parsing other types of arguments and default values, ensuring it does not regress current capabilities. This update should eliminate the generation of warnings such as 'WARNING: could not parse arglist' for valid Python syntax involving binary operations in default values and should correctly display the evaluated result or the expression itself in the generated documentation, adhering to Python syntax rules."
