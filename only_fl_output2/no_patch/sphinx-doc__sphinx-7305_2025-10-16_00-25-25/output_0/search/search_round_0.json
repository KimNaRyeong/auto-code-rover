        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context around the processing of reStructuredText (rst) and specifically how Sphinx handles parsing of the `py:method` directives with default arguments involving binary operations like `2**4`. Let's start by identifying related components in the Sphinx codebase:\n\n1. Since the bug mentions parsing issues with a `py:method` directive, looking into the Sphinx extension or component that processes Python domain directives would be fruitful. This is likely related to classes or methods handling Python-specific reStructuredText (rst) directives.\n\n2. The error messages suggest difficulty in parsing the argument list (`arglist`) when encountering binary operations (`BinOp` object). This points towards the code that parses method/function signatures.\n\nGiven these insights, the following API calls will help us gather the necessary context:\n\n- `search_code(\"py:method\")`: Identify how `py:method` directives are processed.\n- `search_code(\"could not parse arglist\")`: Find where the error message is generated to understand where and how the parsing fails.\n- `search_code(\"BinOp\")`: Since the error mentions inability to handle `BinOp` objects, finding code references to `BinOp` could clarify how binary operations are supposed to be parsed and where the process might be breaking down.\n\nThis approach will provide a broad overview of the involved components and where the parsing problem might originate."
