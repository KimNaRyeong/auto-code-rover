We then have multiple Apps that talk to their own databases. Some share the same table names.\nWe have used this setup for a while, but after upgrading to Django 2.2 we're getting an error saying we're not allowed 2 apps, with 2 different models to have the same table names.\nIs this correct behavior? We've had to roll back to Django 2.0 for now.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue of Django throwing an error when different apps with the same model names have the same table name, especially after upgrading to Django 2.2, we need to understand how the model definitions and database configurations are implemented in the project codebase. Specifically, we are interested in the `Meta` class of model definitions where `db_table` is defined and how database routers or app configurations are set up to handle multiple databases. Here are the API calls that I would make to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. Search for the `Meta` class within the `ModelName` in the base application, since the issue mentions `base.ModelName` having a conflict with `app2.ModelName`.\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"Meta\", \"base/models.py\")`\n\n2. Similarly, search for the `Meta` class within the `ModelName` in `app2` to compare the `db_table` values.\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"Meta\", \"app2/models.py\")`\n\n3. The issue appears to involve multiple databases and their configurations, so I want to find how the databases are set up in Django settings.\n   - `search_code(\"DATABASES =\")`\n\n4. Since Django's database router might be involved in routing model queries to the correct database, let's look for any custom database routers.\n   - `search_code(\"class DatabaseRouter\")`\n\n5. Lastly, since we know that the issue started after upgrading to Django 2.2, locating any custom app configurations that might interact with model tables might provide additional insights.\n   - `search_code(\"class AppConfig\")`\n\nThese API calls should bring back enough information to start understanding the root cause of the issue and formulating a strategy to address it, such as adjusting `db_table` names, reviewing database router logic, or modifying app configurations."
