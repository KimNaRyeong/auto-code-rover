Certainly. To adhere to the requirement and ensure that the script specifically targets the issue of using `drop_sel` with indices on dimensions without coordinates, and to correctly use the provided function for printing the stack trace upon encountering errors, here is a refined approach.

```python
import numpy as np
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Attempt to create a dataset and drop indices from a dimension without coordinates
    try:
        data = np.random.randn(2, 3)
        ds = xr.Dataset({"A": (["x", "y"], data)})
        # This should fail as per the user's description, because `y` does not have coordinate labels
        ds_after_drop = ds.drop_sel(y=[1])
        print(f"Operation succeeded unexpectedly, resulting dataset:\n{ds_after_drop}")
        # If the code reaches this point without exceptions, assert failure to catch mistaken success.
        assert False, "The operation should not succeed as it involves dropping selections on a dimension without coordinates."
    except KeyError as e:
        # Expected failure path
        print("Successfully caught the expected exception. This indicates the issue is present.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as e:
        # Unexpected failure path
        print("An unexpected exception occurred, indicating a different issue might be present.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "An unexpected exception type was raised, which is not consistent with the described issue."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This script checks for the failure mode described by attempting to use `drop_sel` on a dimension without coordinates, and captures the whole scenario precisely while ensuring that the stack trace is printed as requested if an exception occurs. It should raise an assertion error if the operation unexpectedly succeeds, which acts as a check against any future changes that might inadvertently resolve or alter the behavior of the issue described.
