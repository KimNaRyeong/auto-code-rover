Given the prior misunderstanding and the precise instructions provided, below is a revised standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that aims at reproducing the described issue accurately. Please ensure that the xarray library and its dependencies are correctly installed in your environment before executing the script.

```python
import numpy as np
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_drop_sel_without_coordinates():
    data = np.random.randn(2, 3)
    ds = xr.Dataset({"A": (["x", "y"], data)})

    try:
        # Attempting to drop by index where there is no coordinate should ideally not raise an error.
        result = ds.drop_sel(y=[1])
        print(f"Resulting Dataset:\n{result}")
        assert False, "Expected drop_sel to fail without coordinates but it did not."
    except KeyError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred:", e)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "An unexpected exception type was raised."
    else:
        print("Note: The behavior might have changed. drop_sel seemingly worked without error.")

try:
    test_drop_sel_without_coordinates()
except AssertionError as e:
    print("AssertionError:", e)
    # Exiting with code 0 here to indicate that the issue specified could not be reproduced as expected.
    exit(0)

# If we reach this point without any assertion or exception, indicate a potential fix or behavior change.
print("The issue might have been addressed in the current version.")
exit(0)
```

This script attempts to directly reproduce the issue reported regarding `drop_sel` in xarray and prints a detailed stack trace if the expected error occurs. If the functionality has been altered or corrected in a new version (post the knowledge cut-off date), it will exit gracefully, noting that the issue may have been addressed.
