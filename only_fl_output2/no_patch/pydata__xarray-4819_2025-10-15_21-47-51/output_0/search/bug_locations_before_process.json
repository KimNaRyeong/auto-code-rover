        "intended_behavior": "Add a new method `drop_isel` analogous to `drop_sel` which allows users to drop indices from dimensions regardless of whether those dimensions have coordinate labels. This would involve adding a new method to the `Dataset` class that provides functionality similar to what the user described: index-based dropping of data without the need for coordinate labels. This functionality would parallel `drop_sel` but work with integer indices (positions) instead of label names. The method signature could be something like: `def drop_isel(self, indexes=None, *, errors=\"raise\", **indexes_kwargs)` where: `indexes`: mapping of dimension names to index positions. For example, `{ 'x': [1, 2], 'y': [0] }` to drop indices 1, 2 along dimension 'x' and index 0 along dimension 'y'. `errors`: controls what happens when specified indices are out of bounds. `\"raise\"` (default) would throw an error, while `\"ignore\"` would overlook such indices silently. The method would iterate over each dimension and the corresponding indices specified, removing the specified index positions from each dimension. Care would be needed to handle dimensions with and without coordinate labels uniformly, ensuring that indices refer to positions in the case of unlabeled dimensions. Additionally, error handling should include bounds checking for specified indices, with behavior controlled by the `errors` parameter. This implementation would preserve existing functionality while extending the capability of the `Dataset` class to allow for more flexible data manipulation."
