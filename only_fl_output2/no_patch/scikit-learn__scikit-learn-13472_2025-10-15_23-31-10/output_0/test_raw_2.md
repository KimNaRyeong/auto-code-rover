Given your specifications, here's how you can create a `reproducer.py` script designed to address the mentioned issue with using a `Pipeline` as the initial estimator in `GradientBoostingRegressor`. This script validates the problem and abides by your instructions to raise an `AssertionError` when the issue persists and exits normally when resolved.

```python
import numpy as np
import sklearn.pipeline
import sklearn.ensemble
import sklearn.decomposition
import sklearn.linear_model


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys

    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def main():
    try:
        init = sklearn.pipeline.make_pipeline(sklearn.decomposition.PCA(), sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNet())
        model = sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor(init=init)
        x = np.random.rand(12, 3)
        y = np.random.rand(12)
        model.fit(x, y)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue with GradientBoostingRegressor and Pipeline as init.") from e

    print("No issues detected.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(1)
    exit(0)
```

This standalone script attempts to use a `Pipeline` comprising a `PCA` and an `ElasticNet` as the `init` argument to a `GradientBoostingRegressor`. Upon encountering the faulty behavior where it fails due to incompatible signatures (as described in your problem statement), it prints a detailed stack trace of the error it encounters. If the particular implementation issue within the `GradientBoostingRegressor` is present, the script ensures an `AssertionError` is raised, thereby confirming the existence of the problem. Conversely, if the script runs successfully without triggering the exception block, it indicates the issue has been resolved, printing "No issues detected." and exiting with code 0.

Remember, for reproducing and verifying the fixing of such issues, ensure you're working within a virtual environment with the specific versions of libraries involved in the initial problem to accurately assess resolution.
