It seems there was confusion in my initial response. If you're encountering an error due to sklearn not being correctly installed or built, that's not directly related to the issue described. However, for the sake of clarity and focusing on the original issue with the `GradientBoostingRegressor` and `Pipeline`, here is the corrected and concise script:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_gradient_boosting_with_pipeline():
    import sklearn
    import sklearn.pipeline
    import sklearn.ensemble
    import sklearn.decomposition
    import sklearn.linear_model
    import numpy as np
    
    # Ensuring the sklearn version context
    print("Using sklearn version:", sklearn.__version__)

    init = sklearn.pipeline.make_pipeline(
        sklearn.decomposition.PCA(), 
        sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNet()
    )
    model = sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor(init=init)
    
    x = np.random.rand(10, 3)
    y = np.random.rand(10)
    
    try:
        model.fit(x, y)
        print("Successfully used a Pipeline as init for GradientBoostingRegressor.")
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("GradientBoostingRegressor does not support Pipeline as init.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_gradient_boosting_with_pipeline()
```

This script is designed to test whether the `GradientBoostingRegressor` can accept a `Pipeline` as its `init` parameter. If there's an incompatibility causing a `TypeError`, the script will print a detailed stack trace and terminate with an `AssertionError`. If the operation is successful, it confirms that the issue has been addressed and prints a success message. 

Please ensure your sklearn installation is correct and updated to avoid module import errors or other unrelated issues before running the script.
