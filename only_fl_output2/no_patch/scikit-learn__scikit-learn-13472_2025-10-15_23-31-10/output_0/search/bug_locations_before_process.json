        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `fit` method within the `GradientBoostingRegressor` class to ensure that when it calls the `fit` method of its initial estimator (`init_`), it correctly handles passing of `sample_weight` as a named parameter, preserving compatibility with any estimator (such as `Pipeline`). This means if an `init` estimator is used, the method should invoke something like `self.init_.fit(X, y, sample_weight=sample_weight)` instead of its current call which improperly passes the `sample_weight` as a positional argument, leading to compatibility issues with the `Pipeline`'s `fit` method signature. This change is intended to allow users to use more complex initial estimators without facing signature mismatch errors, thereby preserving and extending the existing functionality to cover a wider range of use cases."
