This script attempts to reproduce an issue described for the sympy library, where converting certain `Pow` expressions with `Rational` objects to LaTeX format leads to a `RecursionError`. The `test_latex_pow_recursion` function is designed to trigger this issue by calling `latex()` on a `Pow` expression that satisfies the criteria mentioned in the issue.

- If the issue is present (i.e., a `RecursionError` is raised), it prints the stack trace to identify where the error occurs and asserts that the test failed because the issue is not fixed yet.
- If the issue is resolved (i.e., no `RecursionError` is raised), it simply prints a message indicating the test passed and implicitly asserts the issue is fixed due to the absence of an `AssertionError`.

This approach facilitates tracking the presence of the bug over time, allowing for automated testing to verify whether a software change fixes the reported problem.
