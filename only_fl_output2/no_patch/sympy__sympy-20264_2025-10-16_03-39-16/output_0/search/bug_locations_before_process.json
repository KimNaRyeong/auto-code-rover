        "intended_behavior": "The method should include a specific check or implementation logic to handle expressions of the form `Pow(1/n, -1)` where `n` is a positive integer and `evaluate=False` is set. This logic should prevent the infinite recursion currently caused by such expressions. Specifically, it should detect when an expression would lead to a recursive printing scenario and instead directly convert it into the appropriate LaTeX form without further delegating to methods that could trigger recursion. The existing functionality for handling powers, including fractional and negative powers, should be preserved."

        "method": "_print_Mul",
        "intended_behavior": "Depending on the resolution strategy chosen for `_print_Pow`, it may be necessary to ensure `_print_Mul` correctly handles expressions returned by `_print_Pow` that are marked `evaluate=False`. This adjustment should ensure that multiplication expressions involving powers that are intended to be unevaluated do not trigger unnecessary or erroneous simplification steps that could contribute to recursion issues. This method should be capable of printing the multiplication operation involving unevaluated power expressions directly, safeguarding against recursion while maintaining its handling of conventional multiplication expressions."
