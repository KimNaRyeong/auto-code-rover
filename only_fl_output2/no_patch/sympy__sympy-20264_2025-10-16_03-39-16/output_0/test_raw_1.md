Based on your requirements, here is a revised version of the `reproducer.py` script. This updated script will attempt to recreate the reported issue using the information provided, and it will use the function for printing the stack trace as you requested. 

Please note that the `AssertionError` is raised only when the issue is not reproduced (i.e., when no `RecursionError` occurs), which follows the instructions reversed compared to standard practices for clarity based on the initial request. If the script encounters the `RecursionError` as expected, it prints the stack trace. Otherwise, it will notify that the issue seems to be fixed and raise an `AssertionError`.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_latex_pow_recursion():
    from sympy import Pow, Rational, latex
    try:
        # Attempting to reproduce the issue described
        latex(Pow(Rational(1, 2), -1, evaluate=False))
        # If no exception is raised, assume the issue has been fixed
        print("No exception was raised. It seems the issue might be fixed.")
        raise AssertionError("Expected RecursionError was not raised, indicating the issue may be fixed.")
    except RecursionError as e:
        # RecursionError is expected according to the reported issue
        print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_latex_pow_recursion()
```

Make sure you update your environment accordingly to run this script as intended, specifically ensuring you have the correct version of the `sympy` library that exhibits the reported issue. This script makes an assumption about the behavior based on the description provided and aims to verify if the issue is reproducible under those conditions.
