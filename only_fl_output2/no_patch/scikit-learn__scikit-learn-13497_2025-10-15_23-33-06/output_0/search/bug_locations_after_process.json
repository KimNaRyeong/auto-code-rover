        "intended_behavior": "The code within `_estimate_mi` where `discrete_features` is compared to `'auto'` needs modification. Currently, this direct comparison poses a risk for future compatibility issues with NumPy. The intended behavior here is to ensure that the function can correctly handle `discrete_features` when it is provided as `'auto'`, a boolean, or an array (either as indices or a boolean mask) without raising errors. Specifically:\n       - The check for `discrete_features == 'auto'` must first ascertain that `discrete_features` is not an array or a boolean. This could be achieved by incorporating additional type checks to ensure that the comparison to a string (`'auto'`) is only performed when `discrete_features` is indeed a string.\n       - If `discrete_features` is an array or a boolean, the existing logic to handle these cases should proceed without attempting to compare these types directly to a string.\n       - This restructuring should preserve the current functionality where `'auto'` triggers automatic determination of discrete features based on whether `X` is sparse or dense, while other types of `discrete_features` inputs are handled appropriately as per their intended function.\nThe resolution should ensure the method remains fully functional for existing use cases while eliminating the risk of future errors related to the comparison of `discrete_features` with a string."
