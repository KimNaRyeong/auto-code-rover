        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\nThe gathered context provides significant details on how session expiration is currently managed within the Django framework. Let's analyze the results in accordance with the posed questions.\n\n#### `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date` Methods\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - Both `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date` methods, found in `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py` under `SessionBase`, are responsible for determining the expiration of sessions. `get_expiry_age` calculates the number of seconds until the session expires, considering optional `modification` and `expiry` keyword arguments. `get_expiry_date` calculates the session's actual expiry date, again taking optional `modification` and `expiry` parameters into account.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue described relates directly to these methods, as they define the logic that currently uses a static value (`SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`) to calculate session expiry. The bug or feature request centers around making this expiry age dynamic based on session parameters, requiring an extension or modification of this logic.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would involve modifying these methods\u2014or the logic around these methods\u2014to allow the `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` to be dynamic. This could involve adding functionality to determine `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` based on session parameters or the context of a request, rather than relying solely on a fixed setting.\n\n#### Usage of `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` in Codebase\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` setting is used throughout the session management backend to define the default expiry time for sessions. It is used directly in the methods we analyzed and is referenced across several backend implementations (`file.py`, `base.py`, and `signed_cookies.py`), indicating its central role in session expiration management.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The current implementation, which directly references the static `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` setting, is the core of the issue at hand. To address the issue, it's necessary to look at each point where `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` is used and evaluate how to introduce flexibility in those areas.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The code should be adaptable to use a dynamic value for `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` that can change based on the specific session or request context, rather than a constant value defined in the settings. This might involve additional checks or hooks within the session management process to determine the appropriate expiry time.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nBased on this analysis, the next steps towards resolving the issue would involve:\n- Proposing a way to pass dynamic values for session expiry into `SessionBase.get_expiry_age` and `SessionBase.get_expiry_date`.\n- Identifying mechanisms to override or specify dynamic session expiry ages without requiring a deep customization of the session backend.\n- Considering how to best integrate this dynamic behavior with the existing Django settings and session management infrastructure to minimize breaking changes and maintain backward compatibility."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

Instead of directly returning `settings.SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`, the method could check for a dynamic expiry age possibly set on the session instance or passed via kwargs, and fall back to `settings.SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` if no dynamic value is provided. This preserves existing functionality while adding the capability for dynamic expiry ages.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py\n  - **Class:** SessionBase\n  - **Method:** get_expiry_date\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Similar to `get_expiry_age`, this method should be updated to account for a dynamic session expiry age that can be set per-session or passed via kwargs. The calculation of `expiry` should first consider if a dynamic value is available before defaulting to `settings.SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`. This approach allows for custom expiry logic to be implemented without changing the underlying structure or expected behavior of session handling.\n\nThese modifications aim to introduce flexibility in session expiry handling while ensuring that existing applications relying on the default `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` setting continue to function as before."
