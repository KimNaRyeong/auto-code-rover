It would be more logical and naturel to use the normal python of doing that by implementing the iter function like that:\ndef __iter__(self):\nfor page_num in self.page_range:\nyield self.page(page_num)\n</issue>"

Here are the API calls that will help gather the required context:\n\n- `search_class(\"Paginator\")`: This will help locate the `Paginator` class within the project.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__iter__\", \"Paginator\")`: To check if `__iter__` is already implemented in any form.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"page_range\", \"Paginator\")`: To get details on the `page_range` method that is currently used for iterating through pages.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"page\", \"Paginator\")`: To understand how individual pages are retrieved, which is necessary for the proposed `__iter__` implementation."
