        "intended_behavior": "Implement an `__iter__` method within the `Paginator` class that allows for iteration over all the pages in a more natural and Pythonic way, as if iterating over a list. The method should loop through each page number in the `page_range`, and for each number, it should yield the result of calling the `page` method with that number. This means inside the `__iter__` method, for every `page_num` in `self.page_range`, it should `yield self.page(page_num)`. This new method preserves the existing functionality while enhancing usability by allowing iteration directly over a `Paginator` instance."
