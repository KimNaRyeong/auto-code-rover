        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather the context where `SparseSeries` is used and how we can replace it with a `Series` that contains sparse values. Specifically, we'll aim to locate the usage of `SparseSeries` within the codebase, understand the context of its application, and identify any method or class that directly interacts with `SparseSeries`. \n\nGiven the description, we do not have specific file names or class names where the deprecated `SparseSeries` is being used. Hence, we will start by searching for code snippets that utilize `SparseSeries` directly. Once we have located the occurrences of `SparseSeries`, we can then proceed to evaluate the surrounding code to understand how it's being used. This will guide us in formulating an adequate substitution strategy with `Series` containing sparse values.\n\nSince the issue description does not provide explicit details about classes or methods involved, our initial search will focus on finding `SparseSeries` within the codebase:\n\n1. `search_code(\"SparseSeries\")`: This will help us find snippets of code where `SparseSeries` is directly referenced. \n\nThis initial search is broad but essential for pinpointing where our attention is needed. Based on its results, we can tailor subsequent search requests to gather more specific contextual information necessary for resolving the issue."
