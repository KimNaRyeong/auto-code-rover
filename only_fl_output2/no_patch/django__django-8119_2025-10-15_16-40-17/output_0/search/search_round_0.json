        "content": "To address the issue properly, we need to gather more context about the parts of the project that deal with `.filter()` calls. These are likely part of an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework. I'll start by looking for how `.filter()` is implemented and then look for places where expressions could be integrated.\n\n1. **Search for the `.filter()` method in the codebase**: This will give us an overview of where `.filter()` is defined and used. Since `.filter()` is a method, the appropriate API call would be `search_method(method_name: \"filter\")`.\n\n2. **Search for a class that might handle query operations**: Since the issue mentions wanting to allow expressions in `.filter()` calls, there's likely a core class in the ORM that handles queries. Without knowing the exact class name, I'll make an educated guess that such a class could be named something around \"Query\", \"QueryBuilder\", or \"QuerySet\". Thus, I will search for these classes. These calls would be `search_class(class_name: \"Query\")`, `search_class(class_name: \"QueryBuilder\")`, and `search_class(class_name: \"QuerySet\")`.\n\n3. **Search for where expressions are handled in the codebase**: To integrate expressions into `.filter()` calls, we need to know how expressions are currently handled. The issue mentions using `F()` expressions, so searching for this could be insightful. This would be a call to `search_code(code_str: \"F(\")` to find relevant code snippets where an `F` class or function is used.\n\nThese API calls will provide a solid understanding of the project's current handling of filter operations and expression handling, setting the stage for integrating expressions into filter calls.\n\n- `search_method(method_name: \"filter\")`\n- `search_class(class_name: \"Query\")`\n- `search_class(class_name: \"QueryBuilder\")`\n- `search_class(class_name: \"QuerySet\")`\n- `search_code(code_str: \"F(\")`"
