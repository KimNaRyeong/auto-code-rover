This involves extending the method's logic to not only handle keyword arguments representing field lookups and simple value comparisons but also to recognize and correctly interpret expressions involving model fields. The method should delegate the handling of these expressions to the underlying `Query` object, ensuring that complex expressions like `F('some_field').lower() == 'anssi'` are translated into the appropriate SQL. The enhancement must preserve the method's ability to handle its current argument types without regression."

        "intended_behavior": "Modifications in the `Query` class are necessary to support translating expressions received from `QuerySet.filter()` into valid SQL. This might include extending the `build_filter` and related methods to detect when an argument is an expression rather than a simple filter. The logic should be capable of parsing these expressions, integrating their logic into the SQL where clause, and handling any argument values accordingly. This enhancement should retain the class's current functionality for cases that do not involve the newly supported expressions."
