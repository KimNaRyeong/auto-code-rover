        "intended_behavior": "The `check_filterable` method needs to properly handle instances or fields related to the `ProductMetaDataType` model in such a way that they are considered filterable when used in a filter operation within a query. Since the reported issue indicates that filtering by `metadata_type` raises a `NotSupportedError`, the intended correction involves ensuring that the `filterable` attribute of expressions related to model instances or relationships (like foreign keys) properly reflects the capability to be used in filter operations.\n\n   This might not necessitate a direct change in the `check_filterable` method itself; instead, the solution could require ensuring that any field or model involved in the reported issue is correctly configured to be recognized as `filterable` by this method. Therefore, while `check_filterable` is the direct source of the error, the underlying issue may relate to model and field configuration elsewhere in the codebase that misleads this method into treating the `metadata_type` filter expression as non-filterable.\n\n   To resolve the issue while preserving existing functionality, it is crucial to verify and adjust (as necessary) the configuration or properties of the `ProductMetaDataType` model or its usage in queries so that its related fields are always treated as filterable unless explicitly stated otherwise. This assessment might involve revisiting model field definitions, particularly looking into how `ProductMetaDataType` instances are used within `ProductMetaData` queries and ensuring that no unintended attribute or property is causing Django\u2019s ORM to flag these instances as non-filterable in the context of query construction."
