Below is a potential `reproducer.py` script that will reproduce the specified issue about `RenameModel` migration failure when duplicate model names are present in a Many-to-Many (M2M) relationship across Django applications:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_rename_model_migration_failure():
    from django.core.management import call_command
    from django.db.utils import OperationalError
    try:
        # This attempts to apply all migrations including those potentially causing the issue
        call_command('migrate')
    except OperationalError as e:
        # Specifically checks if the encountered exception matches the scenario of the reported issue
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Advisory: The assertion below merely deduces the occurrence of the issue based on command failure.
        # It might be triggered by unrelated OperationalErrors as well.
        # Therefore, validate that the exception is related to RenameModel migration by inspecting the trace.
        assert "FieldDoesNotExist" in str(e), "Migration failed but not due to the RenameModel issue."
        return

    else:
        # When migration applies successfully without exceptions, assume the issue has been fixed.
        print("Migration applied successfully. The rename model issue appears to be fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_rename_model_migration_failure()
```

### Instructions:
1. **Integration:** Place this script in the root of your Django project, at the same level as the `manage.py` file.
2. **Execution:** Run the script using `python3 reproducer.py` from the terminal.
3. **Expected Outcome:** 
   - If the issue is present, the script triggers an `AssertionError`, indicating the specific RenameModel migration failure. The stack trace of the failed operation is printed, showcasing the error's origin.
   - If the issue has been resolved, it prints "Migration applied successfully..." and exits with a 0 (successful) exit code, indicating the absence of the issue.

Please make sure that your Django project is set up correctly and that you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., via a `requirements.txt` file) before running this script.
