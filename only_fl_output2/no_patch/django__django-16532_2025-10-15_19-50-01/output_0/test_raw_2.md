To craft a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that reproduces the specific issue you've encountered with Django's `RenameModel` migration operation involving duplicate model names in a Many-to-Many (M2M) relationship, a precise approach is needed. It is implicit this should be a mock or simplified representation of the actual models and migrations in your Django project, focusing on triggering the reported error condition.

This script assumes basic familiarity with Django models and the migrations system. Also, it presumes the Django environment is correctly configured and relies on Django's ORM to simulate the model renaming process within a controlled test environment.

```python
# reproducerer.py

import os
import sys
import django
from django.core.management import call_command
from django.db import migrations, models
from django.db.models.fields.related import ManyToManyField
from django.conf import settings

settings.configure(
    DEBUG=True,
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'testdb',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=('__main__',),
    USE_TZ=True,
)

django.setup()

# Dummy models to simulate the scenario
class Incident(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Folder(models.Model):
    incidents = models.ManyToManyField(Incident, related_name='folders')

class VaultIncident(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    incidents = models.ManyToManyField(Incident, related_name='vault_incidents')


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def simulate_issue():
    try:
        # Mimic RenameModel operation
        class RenameIncidentToFolder(migrations.RenameModel):
            old_name = 'VaultIncident'
            new_name = 'Folder'
        
        # Applying a mock migration to simulate the renaming issue
        operation = RenameIncidentToFolder('VaultIncident', 'Folder')
        state_operations = migrations.StateOperations([], [])
        operation.state_forwards('__main__', state_operations)

        # If the operation does not raise, we assert False to indicate unexpected success
        assert False, "Expected RenameModel operation to fail due to duplicate model names in M2M relationship."

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    simulate_issue()
```

Key points about this script:
- This script sets up a minimal Django environment programmatically with an SQLite database for simplicity.
- It defines mock models to represent the situation described: two different models named `Incident` in potentially different apps, with an M2M relationship involved.
- A "mock migration" operation is attempted to rename a model similar to your scenario, aiming to reproduce the error.
- Proper handling of settings is crucial, as improperly configured settings could lead to Django raising errors unrelated to the specific migration issue being reproduced.

Remember, this script is a conceptual example intended for educational or illustrative purposes. Migrating actual Django models and dealing with complex database schema changes requires a deeper understanding of Django migrations and potentially manual adjustments to migration files or models.
