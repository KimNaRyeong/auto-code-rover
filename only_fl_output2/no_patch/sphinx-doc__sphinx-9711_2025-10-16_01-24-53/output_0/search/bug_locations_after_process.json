To resolve the issue, this function needs to accurately compare semantic version numbers instead of relying on lexicographical string comparison. The adjustment should:\n\n- Parse both `reqversion` and `extension.version` into a format that can be numerically compared. This could involve splitting the version strings by their dots (`.`) and comparing each segment as an integer, from most significant (major version) to least significant (patch version).\n- Preserve existing functionality for when extension versions are specified correctly and meet the required minimum. It should only alter the behavior when the current string comparison logic would incorrectly evaluate the version order.\n- Continue to raise an error if the version of an extension does not meet the required version, but ensure that the comparison correctly interprets versions like \"0.10.0\" as higher than \"0.6.0\".\n\nIn addition to modifying this function, it's recommended to ensure that any function or method in the project that compares version numbers follows a similar, correct approach to version comparison, to maintain consistency and avoid similar issues elsewhere."
