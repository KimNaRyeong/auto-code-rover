This seems inconsistent, so can we try and make things more consistent for the 3.1 release? (I see this as bug-like, so I think it can be addressed after feature freeze).\nNote that this is related to https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/8003 - if we change the default cosmology to Planck 2015, then we can change the ``thermodynamic_temperature`` equivalency to use the default cosmology without changing results (for now).\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve this issue and ensure consistency in the use of default cosmologies across the Astropy project, we will need to understand the current implementation of both the thermodynamic temperature equivalency and the `with_H0` equivalency. We need to review the usages of default cosmology values in these equivalencies, specifically in relation to the Planck 2015 and WMAP9 cosmologies. Here are the API calls we should make based on the information provided in the issue:\n\n1. Search for the code snippet where the Planck 2015 value is used as a default for T_cmb:\n   - `search_code(\"from ..cosmology import Planck15\\nT_cmb = Planck15.Tcmb0\")`\n\n2. Search for the code snippet related to the `with_H0` equivalency where the default cosmology is used:\n   - `search_code(\"from .. import cosmology\\nH0 = cosmology.default_cosmology.get().H0\")`\n\n3. Since the issue mentions a pull request (https://github.com/astropy/astropy/pull/7970) which is related to the `with_H0` equivalency, there might be modifications or relevant discussion there. However, we cannot directly access external web content such as GitHub pull requests through these APIs. We should focus on locating the implementation of the `with_H0` equivalency to understand how it uses the default cosmology:\n   - `search_method(\"with_H0\")`\n\n4. It will also be beneficial to understand how and where the default cosmology (currently WMAP9) is defined and potentially changed in the project. This would help us in figuring out the impact of changing the default cosmology to Planck 2015:\n   - `search_code(\"default_cosmology.get()\")`\n\nThese API calls will help us gather the necessary code context to address the inconsistency between the usage of default cosmology values in different parts of the Astropy project."
