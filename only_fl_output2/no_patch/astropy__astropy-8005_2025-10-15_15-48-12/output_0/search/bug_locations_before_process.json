        "intended_behavior": "The `with_H0` method should use a consistent default cosmology across Astropy. Considering the discussion around making Planck 2015 the project-wide default, the intended behavior here is conditional on that decision. If Planck 2015 is adopted as the default, this method should seamlessly align with that change without explicitly specifying Planck15, ensuring it uses the project-wide default cosmology. If it's decided to keep or change to a different default cosmology, `with_H0` needs to reflect this choice to maintain consistency. The method should continue to provide the option to specify a custom `H0`, but by default, retrieve the `H0` value from the currently set default cosmology in the project, thus preserving existing functionality while resolving the inconsistency issue."
