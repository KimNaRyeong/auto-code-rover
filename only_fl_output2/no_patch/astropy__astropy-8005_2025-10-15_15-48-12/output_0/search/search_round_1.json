        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. `with_H0` method in `astropy/units/equivalencies.py`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `with_H0` method provides functionality to convert between quantities with little-h (a dimensionless Hubble constant) and those with physical units, by assuming a value for the Hubble constant (`H0`). If `H0` is not provided, it defaults to the current default cosmology's `H0`.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug**\n  This part of the code directly relates to the issue as it uses the `default_cosmology.get().H0`, which, according to the issue description, defaults to WMAP9. This is in contrast to the `thermodynamic temperature` equivalency which explicitly uses Planck15, leading to inconsistency.\n\n- **Intended behavior**\n  Based on the issue, the intended behavior is to unify the default cosmologies across different equivalencies, likely by ensuring that both equivalencies either explicitly define which cosmology they're using (Planck 2015 or another) or by adopting a project-wide default that is consistent. Changing the `thermodynamic_temperature` equivalency to use the `default_cosmology.get().H0` without explicitly setting it to Planck15 would align the behavior if Planck 2015 becomes the project-wide default.\n\n#### 2. Usage of `default_cosmology.get()` in `astropy/coordinates/distances.py`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  These snippets are from the `Distance` class, showing that the default cosmology's luminosity distance (`luminosity_distance`) or the redshift at a given value (`z_at_value`) is used when no specific cosmology is provided. This mechanism ensures that distance calculations can fall back on a consistent cosmological model by default.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug**\n  While these snippets do not directly reference the `thermodynamic temperature` equivalency, they illustrate how `default_cosmology.get()` is used elsewhere in Astropy. It provides context on how adopting a new project-wide default cosmology (e.g., changing from WMAP9 to Planck 2015) would not only resolve the reported inconsistency but also impact other functionalities relying on default cosmology.\n\n- **Intended behavior**\n  These parts of the code reinforce the necessity for a consistent default cosmology across the Astropy project. If the default cosmology is updated (for instance, to Planck 2015), it should be reflected here and in other places where `default_cosmology.get()` is invoked, ensuring that all parts of Astropy that rely on a default cosmology are internally consistent.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Collected Context\n\nGiven the analysis, the immediate step concerns addressing the inconsistency highlighted in the issue. There are two routes:\n\n1. **Update the Thermodynamic Temperature Equivalency Implementation:** If the equivalency does not currently use `default_cosmology.get()`, as suggested by the issue and the lack of a relevant code snippet found, updating it to do so might align its behavior with `with_H0`.\n\n2. **Consider Updating the Project-Wide Default Cosmology:** Before making specific equivalency changes, it would be wise to settle on whether Planck 2015 should be the new default. This broader change would better precede or coincide with equivalency-specific updates to ensure consistency.\n\nHowever, without direct access to the `thermodynamic temperature` equivalency code or a declaration of the project-wide default cosmology, specific recommendations or patches can't be finalized. Further investigation into these parts of the codebase is needed. Potential next steps could include:\n\n- **Search for the Thermodynamic Temperature Equivalency Implementation:**\n  Since the initial search for the Planck15 usage did not return results, another approach might be needed. It might be useful to look directly for the term \"thermodynamic temperature\" in the codebase or for functions/equivalencies related to temperature conversion that might internally set `T_cmb`.\n\n- **Review Project-Wide Default Cosmology Settings:**\n  Exploring where and how the default cosmology (i.e., the choice of WMAP9 or potentially Planck 2015) is defined within the Astropy configuration or initialization files could provide insight.\n\nThese steps are pivotal in developing a comprehensive patch that resolves the reported inconsistency while ensuring that any changes align with the broader project standards and defaults."

Considering the discussion around making Planck 2015 the project-wide default, the intended behavior here is conditional on that decision. If Planck 2015 is adopted as the default, this method should seamlessly align with that change without explicitly specifying Planck15, ensuring it uses the project-wide default cosmology. If it's decided to keep or change to a different default cosmology, `with_H0` needs to reflect this choice to maintain consistency. The method should continue to provide the option to specify a custom `H0`, but by default, retrieve the `H0` value from the currently set default cosmology in the project, thus preserving existing functionality while resolving the inconsistency issue.\n\nWithout access to the specific implementation of the `thermodynamic temperature` equivalency, it's challenging to specify the exact location and intended adjustments required. Based on the provided context and analysis, the primary consideration for fixing the inconsistency lies within ensuring that the default cosmology used across different parts of the Astropy project aligns, particularly within implementations leveraging default cosmological parameters."
