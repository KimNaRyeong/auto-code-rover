        "content": "<issue>Blocktranslate asvar escapes variables, but stores the result as str instance, leading to double escaping\nDescription\nIn the docs, this snippet is given as an example usage of blocktranslate with the asvar argument (here: \u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/i18n/translation/#blocktranslate-template-tag:\n{% blocktranslate asvar the_title %}The title is {{ title }}.{% endblocktranslate %}\n<title>{{ the_title }}</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"{{ the_title }}\">\nHowever, this template is buggy when title is a string, which I'd argue is a common use case.\ntitle will be escaped when formatting the content of the blocktranslate block, but the \"was escaped\" information is discarded, and the_title will be a str instance with escaped content.\nWhen later using the the_title variable, it will be conditionally escaped. Since it is a str, it will be escaped, so control characters are escaped again, breaking their display on the final page.\nMinimal example to reproduce (can be put in any view):\nfrom django.template import Template, Context\ntemplate_content = \"\"\"\n{% blocktranslate asvar the_title %}The title is {{ title }}.{% endblocktranslate %}\n<title>{{ the_title }}</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"{{ the_title }}\">\n\"\"\"\nrendered = Template(template_content).render(Context({\"title\": \"<>& Title\"}))\nassert \"&amp;lt;\" not in rendered, \"> was escaped two times\"\nI'd argue that blocktranslate should:\nEither assign a SafeString instance to prevent future escaping\nor not escape the variables used within the translation, and store them marked as unsafe (= as str instance)\n</issue>"

Search for instances of the `blocktranslate` tag in the codebase to understand how it's implemented. This will give us a starting point.\n   - `search_code(\"{% blocktranslate asvar\")`\n   \n2. Since the issue deals with how variables are escaped within the `blocktranslate` implementation, it's pertinent to look for the specific method responsible for rendering the `blocktranslate` tag and its interaction with variables.\n   - `search_method(\"blocktranslate\")`\n   \n3. Given that the issue mentions that variables are stored as a `str` instance with escaped content, it might be beneficial to investigate how the rendering context handles these variables. As such, we'll look for any relevant methods in the `Context` class.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__getitem__\", \"Context\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"render\", \"Context\")`\n   \n4. Additionally, since the `SafeString` type is suggested as a possible solution to prevent future escaping, let's get more information about the `SafeString` class and its usage in the context of variable escaping.\n   - `search_class(\"SafeString\")`\n   \nThis selection of API calls aims to gather comprehensive background information on how the `blocktranslate` tag works, how variables are handled and possibly escaped within the Django template context, and how a `SafeString` instance might be utilized to address the issue."
