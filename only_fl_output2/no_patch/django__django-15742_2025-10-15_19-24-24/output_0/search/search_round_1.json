Since it is a str, it will be escaped, so control characters are escaped again, breaking their display on the final page.\nMinimal example to reproduce (can be put in any view):\nfrom django.template import Template, Context\ntemplate_content = \"\"\"\n{% blocktranslate asvar the_title %}The title is {{ title }}.{% endblocktranslate %}\n<title>{{ the_title }}</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"{{ the_title }}\">\n\"\"\"\nrendered = Template(template_content).render(Context({\"title\": \"<>& Title\"}))\nassert \"&amp;lt;\" not in rendered, \"> was escaped two times\"\nI'd argue that blocktranslate should:\nEither assign a SafeString instance to prevent future escaping\nor not escape the variables used within the translation, and store them marked as unsafe (= as str instance)\n</issue>"

The presence of `__add__`, `__str__` methods indicates it has some custom behavior for string operations, likely to preserve the \"safe\" status when manipulated.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  The issue at hand involves the double escaping of variables within the `blocktranslate` template tag when using the `asvar` argument. Since `SafeString` is designed to prevent strings from being escaped, it plays a crucial role. The bug implies that when `blocktranslate` stores a variable, it does not utilize a `SafeString` to indicate the content should not be re-escaped. Thus, `SafeString` is directly related to the proposed solution.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n  The intended behavior, in relation to the bug, would be for `blocktranslate` to either convert variables to `SafeString` instances after initial escaping (to prevent further automatic escaping) or to properly handle these instances if it currently does not.\n\n### Gap in Collected Context and Further Steps\n\n1. No information was found directly related to the `blocktranslate` template tag implementation or its handling in Django's templating engine. This is crucial for understanding how variables are handled and escaped within this tag, especially with `asvar`.\n\n2. No details were obtained about the `Context` class's handling of variables, which is essential for understanding how variables (potentially `SafeString` instances) are processed and returned during template rendering.\n\n### Additional API Calls Needed\n\nTo fill these gaps and better understand the underlying issue, we can try a broader approach:\n\n1. The initial search terms were very specific (`blocktranslate` as a method and searching for `__getitem__` and `render` within `Context`). Given the results, it appears necessary to explore the template tags more generically and how Django template context is handled:\n   - `search_code(\"TemplateTag\")` to find any references or base classes related to template tags, including `blocktranslate`.\n   - `search_code(\"Context\")` to find any file or reference where the `Context` class is defined or significantly modified.\n\n2. Investigate how Django determines if a string should be escaped:\n   - `search_class(\"SafeData\")` Since `SafeString` is also a `SafeData`, understanding this class might provide clues on how the \"safety\" of a string is determined.\n\nThese further steps aim to get a comprehensive understanding of how the `blocktranslate` tag works with context variables and how the templating engine's escaping mechanism interacts with `SafeString`."
