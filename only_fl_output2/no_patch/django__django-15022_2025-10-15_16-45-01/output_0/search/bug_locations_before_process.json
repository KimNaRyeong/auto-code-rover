        "intended_behavior": "The `get_search_results` method should be optimized to handle searches across related models more efficiently to avoid performance degradation due to excessive JOIN operations. This optimization can include: 1. **Batching Search Terms:** Instead of creating a separate JOIN for each search term, combine search terms using OR conditions within a single JOIN operation when possible. This requires careful construction of the queryset to ensure logical grouping of search terms based on their intended target fields. 2. **Full-text Search Utilization:** For database backends that support it, utilizing full-text search capabilities can significantly improve performance for text-based searches, especially in multi-word scenarios. This would entail detecting support for such features and conditionally applying them as an alternative to the default `icontains` iteration per search term. 3. **Smart Related Fields Handling:** Implement a smarter mechanism for handling searches on fields of related models to minimize unnecessary database JOINs. This could involve: - Pre-checking if the search terms match any pattern that could benefit from a direct search on related fields without resorting to JOINs. - Leveraging `select_related` or `prefetch_related` to optimize database hits for known patterns where related model data will be required."
