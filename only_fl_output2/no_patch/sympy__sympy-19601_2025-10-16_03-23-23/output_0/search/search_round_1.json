[We're unfortunately stuck with 1.5.1](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/blob/master/requirements.txt#L3), but the patches we've submitted have already been merged into SymPy master, and we're looking forward to jump to 1.6. Thanks!\n</issue>"

The question pertains to project management and release scheduling, which would not directly correlate with specific API calls as designed for codebase interrogation.\n\nHowever, if we aim to understand general contexts around versions and patch incorporations, we might consider indirect approaches like searching for potential release handling or version increment mechanisms within the SymPy codebase. Without specific code elements or files mentioned, this general approach could include searching for terms like \"version\", \"release\", or possibly finding changelog entries, though these are not precise enough for targeted API calls here.\n\nFor a precise action, we would need specifics like class names, method names, or exact code snippets that were mentioned as part of the submitted patches to SymPy master, which are not provided in this request. Therefore, I am unable to proceed with effective API calls without more detailed information related to the project's coding aspects."

However, if we were to look for general practices or standards that might provide insight into how SymPy approaches version increments or how release planning is documented within the code or commit messages, we could consider generic search terms related to versioning.\n\nSince no specific classes, methods, or code statements are mentioned directly related to SymPy's version handling or the patches submitted, making targeted API calls is challenging. However, to illustrate a hypothetical approach, if we were looking for how versions are managed or to get insights related to version incrementation practices in SymPy, one might consider using generic terms related to the project structure or release process, albeit this strays from the provided capabilities.\n\nIn the absence of precise directives or knowledge of what the patches entailed (e.g., if they were improvements or bug fixes to specific parts of the SymPy library), actionable API calls cannot be properly constructed. \n\nFor those seeking to investigate code changes or release practices within projects like SymPy, reviewing the project's GitHub repository directly, checking recent pull requests, commits related to version increments, or release documentation would provide the most direct insights, beyond what structured API calls to a code base can offer without specific targets."
