[We're unfortunately stuck with 1.5.1](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/blob/master/requirements.txt#L3), but the patches we've submitted have already been merged into SymPy master, and we're looking forward to jump to 1.6. Thanks!\n</issue>"

Each API call must have concrete arguments as inputs."

The question pertains to project management and release scheduling, which would not directly correlate with specific API calls as designed for codebase interrogation.\n\nHowever, if we aim to understand general contexts around versions and patch incorporations, we might consider indirect approaches like searching for potential release handling or version increment mechanisms within the SymPy codebase. Without specific code elements or files mentioned, this general approach could include searching for terms like \"version\", \"release\", or possibly finding changelog entries, though these are not precise enough for targeted API calls here.\n\nFor a precise action, we would need specifics like class names, method names, or exact code snippets that were mentioned as part of the submitted patches to SymPy master, which are not provided in this request. Therefore, I am unable to proceed with effective API calls without more detailed information related to the project's coding aspects."
