        "intended_behavior": "The `delete_cookie` method should be updated to handle the `samesite` attribute properly, ensuring it either retains the original samesite setting of the cookie being deleted or allows specifying a samesite value when calling `delete_cookie`. This adjustment would require modifying the method to include a `samesite` parameter in the call to `self.set_cookie` within `delete_cookie`. By doing so, it will make sure that when cookies are removed, they are done in compliance with modern web standards, especially concerning the handling of `SameSite` attributes. This change preserves the existing functionality of expiring cookies to prompt their deletion, while also enhancing compatibility with web browser policies that mandate specific conditions for cookies marked with `SameSite=None`."
