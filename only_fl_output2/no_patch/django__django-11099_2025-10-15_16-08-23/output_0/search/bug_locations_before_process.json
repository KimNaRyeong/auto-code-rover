This change ensures that the validator accurately assesses usernames from the very start (\\A) to the very end (\\Z) of the string without allowing a trailing newline character. The primary functionality remains the same, enforcing a rule set for valid characters in usernames but now correctly excludes usernames that improperly end with a newline."

This adjustment mirrors the intention of preventing trailing newline characters in usernames, ensuring validators comply with the specifications for what constitutes valid usernames across all supported character sets, particularly those beyond the basic ASCII set."
