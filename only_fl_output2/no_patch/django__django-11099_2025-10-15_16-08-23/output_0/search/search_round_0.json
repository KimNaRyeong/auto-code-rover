However, a little known quirk of Python regexes is that $ will also match a trailing newline. Therefore, the user name validators will accept usernames which end with a newline. You can avoid this behavior by instead using \\A and \\Z to terminate regexes. For example, the validator regex could be changed to\nr'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\nin order to reject usernames that end with a newline.\nI am not sure how to officially post a patch, but the required change is trivial - using the regex above in the two validators in contrib.auth.validators.\n</issue>"

This information will ensure a precise understanding of the context and how the proposed change can be integrated. Based on this, here are the specific API calls I plan to make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ASCIIUsernameValidator\")` - This will help locate the file and location of the ASCIIUsernameValidator class.\n2. `search_class(\"UnicodeUsernameValidator\")` - Similar to the first call, this will help locate the UnicodeUsernameValidator class.\n3. `search_code(r\"^[\\w.@+-]+$\")` - By searching for the regex pattern, I can find all occurrences in the codebase, which helps verify the issue and understand its usage scope, including any other validators or instances that might be affected or need similar fixes."
