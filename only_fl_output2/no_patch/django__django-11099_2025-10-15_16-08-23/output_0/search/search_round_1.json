However, a little known quirk of Python regexes is that $ will also match a trailing newline. Therefore, the user name validators will accept usernames which end with a newline. You can avoid this behavior by instead using \\A and \\Z to terminate regexes. For example, the validator regex could be changed to\nr'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\nin order to reject usernames that end with a newline.\nI am not sure how to officially post a patch, but the required change is trivial - using the regex above in the two validators in contrib.auth.validators.\n</issue>"

        "content": "The provided search results offer direct insights into the original issue reported:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n   Both the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` classes extend the functionality of a `RegexValidator`, applying a regex pattern to validate usernames. They specify rules for what constitutes a valid username in their respective contexts: `ASCIIUsernameValidator` is intended for usernames with characters from the ASCII character set only, while `UnicodeUsernameValidator` permits a broader range, accommodating any letter character from various languages and scripts.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   The central issue stems from the regex pattern `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` used in both validators. The end anchor `$` matches the position right before a newline at the end of the string as well as the end of the string itself. This behavior allows usernames that end with a newline character to be considered valid, which is contrary to the intended behavior of these validators. This quirk in Python's regex behavior can lead to inconsistent or undesirable handling of username validation, particularly in environments where precise input validation is necessary to prevent issues related to formatting, storage, and security.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   The intention behind using these regex patterns is to validate usernames based on a specified set of characters (alphanumeric characters and certain special characters `.`, `@`, `+`, `-`, and `_`). The intended behavior explicitly excludes trailing newline characters from being considered valid parts of usernames. Changing the regex to use `\\A` and `\\Z` as start and end matchers (respectively) instead of `^` and `$` addresses this oversight by strictly enforcing the match from the very beginning to the very end of the string, including the prevention of newline characters at the end of usernames.\n\nGiven the results of the API search and considering the issue reported, further action is straightforward:\n\n- Update the `regex` attribute in both `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` classes in `django/contrib/auth/validators.py` to use the corrected regex pattern `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`.\n\nThis change should resolve the reported issue by ensuring the validators reject usernames ending with a newline, aligning with the intended validation logic. Given the specific and targeted nature of this change, impact on the broader system should be minimal, primarily enhancing validation accuracy for usernames without introducing backward compatibility concerns or affecting other systems' components."

This change ensures that the validator accurately assesses usernames from the very start (`\\A`) to the very end (`\\Z`) of the string without allowing a trailing newline character. The primary functionality remains the same, enforcing a rule set for valid characters in usernames but now correctly excludes usernames that improperly end with a newline. \n\n   - **Location 2:**\n     - **File:** `django/contrib/auth/validators.py`\n     - **Class:** `UnicodeUsernameValidator`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** Similarly, within the `UnicodeUsernameValidator` class, the regex pattern needs alteration from `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`. This adjustment mirrors the intention of preventing trailing newline characters in usernames, ensuring validators comply with the specifications for what constitutes valid usernames across all supported character sets, particularly those beyond the basic ASCII set.\n\nThese updates directly address the reported issue by refining the validation logic to precisely match the original intent: ensuring that usernames adhere strictly to the defined character rules while specifically excluding trailing newline characters."
