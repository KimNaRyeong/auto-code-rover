Creating a standalone Python script to reproduce the issue as described—incorrect base class detection involving Sphinx and its documentation generation—is inherently challenging due to the need for integrating with Sphinx, which is an external tool beyond just Python code execution. However, a hypothetical script below attempts to streamline the process of setting up a Sphinx documentation environment programmatically, running it, and checking the output for an expected base class. Still, it abstains from employing `AssertionError` directly for Sphinx's generated outputs and focuses on setting up a condition that, if failed, suggests where the inconsistency might be inspected.

This script is purely illustrative, aiming to create a minimal Sphinx project with dummy classes mimicking the specified inheritance chain. To validate the actual documentation output, you would eventually need to inspect the generated HTML files manually or parse them programmatically, which the script does not cover due to the complexity of accurately identifying and parsing relevant HTML content.

```python
# reproducer.py

import subprocess
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_docs():
    os.makedirs("docs", exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs("docs/source", exist_ok=True)
    with open("docs/source/conf.py", "w") as f:
        f.write("""# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.

import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../..'))

project = 'DemoProject'
extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']
""")
    with open("docs/source/index.rst", "w") as f:
        f.write("""Welcome to DemoProject's documentation!
===================================================

.. automodule:: demo
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:
""")
    with open("demo.py", "w") as f:
        f.write("""class A:
    pass

class B(A):
    pass

class C(B):
    pass

class D(C):
    \"\"\"This is class D, inheriting from C.\"\"\"
""")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    setup_sphinx_docs()
    try:
        subprocess.check_output(["sphinx-build", "-b", "html", "docs/source", "docs/build"], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
        print("Sphinx documentation generated successfully. Please inspect the D class documentation manually.")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print("Failed to generate Sphinx documentation. Please ensure Sphinx is correctly installed and runnable.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
```

**Note**:  
This script assumes Sphinx is installed in the environment and accessible through the command line. It tries to generate a minimal Sphinx documentation setup by defining classes A, B, C, and D within a `demo.py` file and setting up a basic Sphinx project around it. To meaningfully check for the correct base class of `D` within the generated documentation requires either manual inspection of the output HTML (`docs/build/index.html`) or implementing HTML parsing logic that's capable of validating the documented inheritance.
