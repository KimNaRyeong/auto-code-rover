        "intended_behavior": "The configuration within `doc/conf.py` should be reviewed and potentially adjusted to ensure the `autodoc` extension accurately documents class hierarchies according to the direct superclass of each class, rather than an ancestor further up the chain. This may involve: ensuring `autoclass_content` is set to `class` to prioritize class docstrings and possibly affect inheritance documentation; reviewing any custom Sphinx extensions or handlers that might influence or override standard documentation behavior regarding class inheritance; verifying that the `autodoc_inherit_docstrings` setting is true (the default), which allows subclasses to inherit docstrings from their parent classes if not overridden; adjusting this setting might not directly resolve the issue but could be part of a broader review to ensure inheritance is handled as expected; inspecting and possibly overriding `autodoc_default_options` to ensure they're set in a way that supports correct base class documentation."
