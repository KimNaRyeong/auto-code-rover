When I document class D, it lists the base class as A instead of C.\n### How to Reproduce\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo.git\n$ cd torchgeo/docs\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n$ make html\n$ # open _build/html/api/datasets.html and see that the base class is torch.utils.data.Dataset instead of RasterDataset\n```\n### Expected behavior\nI would expect the base class to be the direct super class.\n### Your project\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nmacOS 10.15.7, Linux (whatever RtD uses)\n### Python version\n3.8.11\n### Sphinx version\n4.0.1, 4.0.2\n### Sphinx extensions\nsphinx.ext.autodoc\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\nI don't think this is the same as #9504 because I can reproduce it with 4.0.1 too.\nCould be related to #9395.\nFor a class like [Landsat](https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo/blob/main/torchgeo/datasets/landsat.py#L14), even though the super class is `RasterDataset`, the base class is listed as `torch.utils.data.Dataset`.\n@calebrob6\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, where the base class detection is incorrect in the Sphinx-generated documentation for the class chain in the `torchgeo` project, we need to gather information about the classes mentioned and the documentation process. Specifically, we are interested in how the classes `Dataset`, `RasterDataset`, and `Landsat` are defined and how they are related. Additionally, we want to know how the documentation strings are handled for these classes which could affect Sphinx's autodoc behavior.\n\nThus, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n- `search_class(\"Dataset\")`: Since `torch.utils.data.Dataset` is a well-known PyTorch base class, we'll look for subclasses within the `torchgeo` project that directly extend it to understand the class hierarchy.\n- `search_class(\"RasterDataset\")`: To get details about the `RasterDataset` class definition within the `torchgeo` project, which seems to be a direct or indirect superclass of `Landsat`.\n- `search_class(\"Landsat\")`: To find the implementation of the `Landsat` class, which is directly experiencing the documentation issue.\n- `search_code(\"class Landsat\")`: This would help in identifying the file and exact location where `Landsat` is defined, since the issue mentions specific behavior when documenting this class.\n- `search_code(\"class RasterDataset\")`: Similar to the Landsat search, this aims to find the implementation details of `RasterDataset`, which is crucial for understanding the inheritance chain that is not correctly documented.\n\nThese calls collectively should provide a comprehensive overview of how the classes are structured and possibly lead to insights on why Sphinx's autodoc extension is not properly detecting the immediate base class for `Landsat`."
