When I document class D, it lists the base class as A instead of C.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo.git\r\n$ cd torchgeo/docs\r\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n$ make html\r\n$ # open _build/html/api/datasets.html and see that the base class is torch.utils.data.Dataset instead of RasterDataset\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI would expect the base class to be the direct super class.\n\n### Your project\n\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### OS\n\nmacOS 10.15.7, Linux (whatever RtD uses)\n\n### Python version\n\n3.8.11\n\n### Sphinx version\n\n4.0.1, 4.0.2\n\n### Sphinx extensions\n\nsphinx.ext.autodoc\n\n### Extra tools\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\nI don't think this is the same as #9504 because I can reproduce it with 4.0.1 too.\r\n\r\nCould be related to #9395.\r\n\r\nFor a class like [Landsat](https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo/blob/main/torchgeo/datasets/landsat.py#L14), even though the super class is `RasterDataset`, the base class is listed as `torch.utils.data.Dataset`.\r\n\r\n@calebrob6\n"

        "content": "To create a standalone file to reproduce the issue as described, you'll need a simplified class hierarchy that mimics the situation in the `torchgeo` project, and an attempt to introspect or represent the classes in a way that would exhibit the base class detection issue using Sphinx or a mock behavior closely mimicking how Sphinx's autodoc extension might work. Since the exact behavior of Sphinx's autodoc cannot be easily replicated in a simple script without invoking Sphinx itself, the following reproduction effort focuses on simulating the conditions under which the bug would be observed.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\n\nclass Dataset:\n    pass\n\nclass RasterDataset(Dataset):\n    pass\n\nclass Landsat(RasterDataset):\n    pass\n\ndef get_base_class(cls):\n    # Simulate Sphinx's autodoc base class detection logic\n    bases = cls.__bases__\n    if not bases:\n        return None\n    return bases[0]  # This simplistic approach mimics the issue\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        base_class = get_base_class(Landsat)\n        assert base_class is RasterDataset, \"Incorrect base class detected\"\n\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)  # Non-zero exit code for failure\n    else:\n        print(\"Base class detected correctly.\")\n        exit(0)  # Zero exit code for success\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis script defines a basic class structure similar to the one in the `torchgeo` issue, with `Dataset` as the most base class and `Landsat` as the subclass in question. The `get_base_class` function simulates a faulty logic similar to what might happen inside Sphinx's autodoc mechanism that leads to the reported issue\u2014specifically, it always returns the first base class it finds, which may not be the immediate parent class in a deep inheritance chain.\n\nRunning this script in the root directory of a project (or in isolation, as it does not depend on the specifics of the `torchgeo` project) should raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, as the script asserts that the direct superclass of `Landsat` should be `RasterDataset`, not `Dataset`. The script uses a custom `print_stacktrace` function to clearly show where the assertion fails, aiding in understanding and diagnosing the issue.\n"
