To create a standalone file to reproduce the issue as described, you'll need a simplified class hierarchy that mimics the situation in the `torchgeo` project, and an attempt to introspect or represent the classes in a way that would exhibit the base class detection issue using Sphinx or a mock behavior closely mimicking how Sphinx's autodoc extension might work. Since the exact behavior of Sphinx's autodoc cannot be easily replicated in a simple script without invoking Sphinx itself, the following reproduction effort focuses on simulating the conditions under which the bug would be observed.

```python
# reproducer.py

class Dataset:
    pass

class RasterDataset(Dataset):
    pass

class Landsat(RasterDataset):
    pass

def get_base_class(cls):
    # Simulate Sphinx's autodoc base class detection logic
    bases = cls.__bases__
    if not bases:
        return None
    return bases[0]  # This simplistic approach mimics the issue

def main():
    try:
        base_class = get_base_class(Landsat)
        assert base_class is RasterDataset, "Incorrect base class detected"

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Non-zero exit code for failure
    else:
        print("Base class detected correctly.")
        exit(0)  # Zero exit code for success

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script defines a basic class structure similar to the one in the `torchgeo` issue, with `Dataset` as the most base class and `Landsat` as the subclass in question. The `get_base_class` function simulates a faulty logic similar to what might happen inside Sphinx's autodoc mechanism that leads to the reported issueâ€”specifically, it always returns the first base class it finds, which may not be the immediate parent class in a deep inheritance chain.

Running this script in the root directory of a project (or in isolation, as it does not depend on the specifics of the `torchgeo` project) should raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, as the script asserts that the direct superclass of `Landsat` should be `RasterDataset`, not `Dataset`. The script uses a custom `print_stacktrace` function to clearly show where the assertion fails, aiding in understanding and diagnosing the issue.
