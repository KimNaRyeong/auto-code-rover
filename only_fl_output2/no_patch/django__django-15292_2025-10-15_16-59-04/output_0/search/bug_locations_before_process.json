The intended behavior here is to ensure that when class-based views (CBVs) are reported in the 'Raised by' section, they are displayed using their proper Python path ('app.views.ViewName') instead of the '<class 'app.views.ViewName'>' format. This might involve adjusting how the view class is converted to a string in the context of error reporting, ensuring that it checks if the object is a class and uses its '__module__.__name__' attributes instead of a direct 'str()' conversion or similar mechanism that leads to the class representation issue."

The code here should ensure that when an exception involves a CBV, the view's name is accurately formatted in the error report. The adjustment needed could be similar to the one in 'debug.py', focusing on proper identification and representation of class-based views within exceptions. The goal is to preserve the functionality of detailed error reporting while correcting the display of CBV names in error contexts, adhering to a more readable and consistent format."
