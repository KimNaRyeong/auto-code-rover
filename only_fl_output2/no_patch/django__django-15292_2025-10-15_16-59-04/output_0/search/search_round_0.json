        "content": "To address the issue properly, I would first look for the commit mentioned in the regression to understand what changes were made that led to the issue. However, since I don't have access to the repository history directly and considering the nature of my capabilities, I will focus on gathering code context related to the way CBVs (Class-Based Views) and the technical 404 debug page are implemented and interact with each other in Django. Here are the specific API calls I would make to gather relevant information:\n\n1. Search for the class `Http404View` to understand its declaration and any inheritance that might influence how it's represented in debug pages:\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"Http404View\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions an incorrect view name being reported, it's likely related to how views are introspected or logged. I would search for any code that is responsible for rendering or logging the \"Raised by\" part in the technical 404 debug page. This might not map to a specific class or method without more context, so I'll search by a code snippet that might appear in the logging or rendering process. Assuming a snippet like `\"Raised by:\"` appears in the relevant code paths, here is the search I would make:\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"Raised by:\")\n   ```\n\n3. Given that the issue specifies a comparison between `view_tests.views.<class 'view_tests.views.Http404View'>` and `view_tests.views.Http404View`, it would be useful to see how the view's name or representation is generated or modified, particularly in the context of a 404 page. This suggests introspection or reflection might be involved, possibly in a method that handles or logs exceptions or 404s specifically. Without exact method names, we're looking for possible string handling related to class representations. A plausible search could include looking for code snippets related to obtaining a class's name:\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"__name__\")\n   ```\n\n4. Lastly, it's beneficial to understand the general handling of 404 responses in Django, specifically in views or middleware that could modify the view's representation in debug logs. This requires finding methods that specifically handle 404 exceptions in Django, which can be broadly searched for as:\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"get_404_response\")\n   ```\n\nThese steps are designed to collect a broad context because without access to the actual codebase or specific filenames and knowing the issue highlights a misrepresentation of CBVs in debug information, it's essential to understand how views are logged during exceptions and how class representations are generated or modified in these scenarios."
