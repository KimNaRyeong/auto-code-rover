        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `Round` class to support an optional precision argument. This enhancement entails adjusting the class to accept a second parameter that specifies the number of decimal places to round to. The class should be adapted to dynamically adjust its SQL representation based on whether this precision argument is provided. When the precision argument is omitted, the `Round` function should behave as it currently does, rounding to the nearest integer. When it is provided, the generated SQL function call should include this precision argument, thereby allowing rounding to the specified number of decimal places. This change ensures backward compatibility while extending the functionality to support more complex rounding operations as supported by the underlying database backends."
