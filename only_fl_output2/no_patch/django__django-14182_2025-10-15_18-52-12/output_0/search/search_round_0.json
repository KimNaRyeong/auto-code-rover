If you need to round to a more specific precision you need to roll out your own solution.\nBut as far as I can tell, all backends natively supported by Django support a second argument to Round:\nPostgres: \u200bhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-math.html#FUNCTIONS-MATH-FUNC-TABLE\nSqlite: \u200bhttps://sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html#round\nMySQL: \u200bhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mathematical-functions.html#function_round\nOracle: \u200bhttps://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/functions135.htm\nIn my project (postgres only) my work around was to declare my own custom function:\nclass Round(Func):\nfunction = 'ROUND'\narity = 2\nBut having this built-in would be quite useful.\n</issue>"

Given the nature of the issue, it would be prudent to look into:\n\n1. The implementation or definition of the `Round` function class to understand its current capabilities and see how it can be extended to support an additional precision argument.\n2. Any existing usage of the `Round` function or similar arithmetic or mathematical functions within Django to understand the standard implementation pattern, especially regarding database function classes.\n\nLet's start by searching for the `Round` function class, as this will likely give us direct insight into how rounding is currently handled:\n\n- `search_class(\"Round\")`\n\nAdditionally, it would be helpful to understand how Django currently handles database functions that might take multiple arguments, to ensure consistency with the existing framework's design pattern:\n\n- `search_class(\"Func\")`\n\nThese two searches should provide a good starting point for understanding how to approach adding a precision argument to the `Round` function."
