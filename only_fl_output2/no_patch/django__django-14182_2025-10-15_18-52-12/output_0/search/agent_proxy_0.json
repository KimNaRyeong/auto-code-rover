Given the nature of the issue, it would be prudent to look into:\n\n1. The implementation or definition of the `Round` function class to understand its current capabilities and see how it can be extended to support an additional precision argument.\n2. Any existing usage of the `Round` function or similar arithmetic or mathematical functions within Django to understand the standard implementation pattern, especially regarding database function classes.\n\nLet's start by searching for the `Round` function class, as this will likely give us direct insight into how rounding is currently handled:\n\n- `search_class(\"Round\")`\n\nAdditionally, it would be helpful to understand how Django currently handles database functions that might take multiple arguments, to ensure consistency with the existing framework's design pattern:\n\n- `search_class(\"Func\")`\n\nThese two searches should provide a good starting point for understanding how to approach adding a precision argument to the `Round` function."
