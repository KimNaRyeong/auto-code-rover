To resolve the issue, the method needs to be adjusted to handle `indptr` arrays with `dtype=int64` on 32-bit systems without causing a `TypeError`. This could involve ensuring any operations that involve `indptr` explicitly check and handle the `dtype` in a manner that's compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit systems. For example, if the computation requires indexing with `indptr`, it might be necessary to safely cast `indptr` to `int32` when on a 32-bit system, but only if it can be done without losing data (i.e., the indices actually fit in an `int32`). Additionally, care must be taken to avoid changing the behavior for systems where `int64` indices are already handled correctly."

        "intended_behavior": "This function is responsible for delegating the `min` or `max` operation to the appropriate handler based on the axis specified. To address the bug, the function must ensure that any handling or manipulation of `indptr` is performed safely, respecting the dtype of `indptr` and the operating system's architecture. This might involve verifying and adjusting the dtype of `indptr` before performing operations that could lead to unsafe casting. Specifically, in operations that could raise a `TypeError` due to dtype mismatch, the code should include checks or conversions that safely accommodate `int64` `indptr` on a 32-bit system without affecting the logic for systems that do not exhibit this issue."
