Certainly! Below is a standalone Python script `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue you've described with `utils.sparsefuncs.min_max_axis` encountering a `TypeError` when executed on a large CSC matrix under a 32-bit Windows OS. The script includes detailed comments, conditionally raises an `AssertionError` to denote the presence of the issue, and uses the provided function to output stack traces clearly. Note: The actual behavior might depend on specific library versions and the operating system environment, which this script assumes is correctly configured per the issue description.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    import scipy.sparse as sp
    from sklearn.utils.sparsefuncs import min_max_axis

    X = sp.csc_matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    X.indptr = X.indptr.astype('int64')

    Y = sp.csr_matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    Y.indptr = Y.indptr.astype('int64')

    csr_result = min_max_axis(Y, 0)
    csc_result = min_max_axis(X, 0)

    # Expected results as per description
    expected = (np.array([1, 2], dtype=np.int32), np.array([3, 4], dtype=np.int32))

    # Assertion to verify the issue
    # If the issue exists, an error should be raised specifically for csc_matrix processing
    assert csc_result == expected, "TypeError not raised for CSC matrix as described in the issue."

except AssertionError as ae:
    # If AssertionError is caught, it means the test failed as expected, so we print a custom message and re-raise the error.
    print(f"Issue reproduced successfully: {ae}")
    raise ae

except Exception as e:
    # For any other exception, print the stacktrace.
    print_stacktrace(e)
    # Exiting with non-zero code to indicate the presence of the issue.
    sys.exit(1)
else:
    # If no exceptions are raised, the issue has likely been resolved.
    print("The issue has been fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)
```

This script initially tries to perform the actions that lead to the issue, explicitly converting the `indptr` attributes of the sparse matrices to `int64`, which is noted to be part of the problem. When running, the script checks if the operations proceed without raising an exception. A specific `AssertionError` is used to check for the expected faulty behavior with the CSC matrix; its absence indicates that the previous issue might have been resolved.

Please note that for the actual execution environment, dependencies (such as NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn) and the system must be set up to mimic the conditions described (32-bit Windows environment). This script as written assumes those conditions are met and does not explicitly verify them.
