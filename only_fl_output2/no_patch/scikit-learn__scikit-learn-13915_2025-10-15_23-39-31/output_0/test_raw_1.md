Based on your requirements and the previous feedback, here is a revised version of the standalone Python file `reproducer.py`. This script aims to reproduce the issue where `utils.sparsefuncs.min_max_axis` gives a `TypeError` when the input is a large CSC matrix on a 32-bit Windows system. This version includes a correct usage of try-except blocks and properly asserts the absence of the issue without specific dependency on the system architecture directly in the code. Remember to adjust the expected results if the actual function's output format differs.

```python
import numpy as np
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    import scipy.sparse as sp
    from sklearn.utils.sparsefuncs import min_max_axis

    X = sp.csc_matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
    X.indptr = X.indptr.astype('int64')

    Y = sp.csr_matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
    Y.indptr = Y.indptr.astype('int64')

    expected_result = (np.array([1, 3], dtype=int), np.array([2, 4], dtype=int))

    Y_min_max = min_max_axis(Y, 0)
    assert (Y_min_max[0] == expected_result[0]).all() and (Y_min_max[1] == expected_result[1]).all(), "CSR matrix result does not match expected"

    X_min_max = min_max_axis(X, 0)
    assert (X_min_max[0] == expected_result[0]).all() and (X_min_max[1] == expected_result[1]).all(), "CSC matrix result does not match expected"

    print("Test passed")

except AssertionError as ae:
    print(ae)
    sys.exit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
```

This script:

1. Attempts to run the `min_max_axis` function on both CSR and CSC matrices after casting their `indptr` to `int64`, which simulates the conditions described in the issue.
2. Checks if the results match the expected outcome and correctly handles exceptions by:
   - Printing an informative stack trace if a generic exception occurs.
   - Raising an `AssertionError` if the results don't match the expected values, indicating the issue is present.
3. Exits with code `0` only if the test passes, signaling the issue is resolved, or with code `1` if the issue remains or an error is encountered.

This approach provides a clear output indicating whether the issue has been reproduced successfully, along with detailed error information if needed.
