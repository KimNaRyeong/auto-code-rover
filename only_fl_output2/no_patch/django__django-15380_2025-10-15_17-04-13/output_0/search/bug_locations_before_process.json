        "intended_behavior": "The `generate_renamed_fields` method should correctly handle scenarios where both a model and its fields are being renamed within the same migration action. This means ensuring that when querying `self.to_state.models` for the new model state, it accounts for the fact that the model's name might have already been changed. This could be achieved through a more robust mapping or tracking of old to new names in `self.renamed_models` (considering both the model and the fields) and then using this updated mapping to correctly access new and old model states without causing a `KeyError`. Specifically, before accessing `self.to_state.models` with an old model name, the method must ensure that if the model has been renamed, it uses the new name for this access. Similarly, it must ensure that the field rename detection logic precisely matches fields from the old model name to the new one, accounting for renames that may not directly translate because of simultaneous model and field renames. The confirmation prompt (`ask_rename`) that occurs should continue to correctly trigger for field renames to give users control over these migration steps. However, the method must ensure that any \"yes\" response to model or field renames consistently updates its internal state mapping so the rest of the detection process can proceed without encountering mismatches in model or field names."
