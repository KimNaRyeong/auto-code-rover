Since the issue is likely to be within the method that handles bound data, we would want to look into any method that relates to the processing or rendering of the field data, particularly when it's bound. From the description, it sounds like a method that handles data before rendering might be raising the issue when it encounters `None` as the input.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls should be made to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"JSONField\")`: This will help us find where the class `JSONField` is defined.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"bound_data\", \"JSONField\")`: Assuming `bound_data` is a method within `JSONField`, this will locate the method that may be causing the issue when dealing with `None`.\n3. `search_code(\"form = JSONForm({})\")`: To get context on how the form is instantiated which may also provide clues to where the issue arises when no data is provided."
