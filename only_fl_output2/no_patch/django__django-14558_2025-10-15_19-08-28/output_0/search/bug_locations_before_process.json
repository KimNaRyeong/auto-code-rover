        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `bound_data` method should be modified to check if `data` is `None` before attempting to load it as JSON. If `data` is `None`, the method should return `None` or an appropriate default value that signifies no data was provided, instead of attempting to decode it. This change ensures that the field can handle forms bound with no value for the JSONField without resulting in a crash, especially in cases where the field is optional (`required=False`). This adjustment preserves the existing functionality by still allowing the field to correctly handle and decode valid JSON data when provided and maintains the integrity of optional JSONFields in forms."
