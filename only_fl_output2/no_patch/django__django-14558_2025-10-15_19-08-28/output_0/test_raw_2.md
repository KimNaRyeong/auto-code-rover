It appears there was a misunderstanding regarding the expected result of executing the script. The script successfully reproduced the issue and raised the expected `TypeError`, followed by an exit code of 1 indicating the presence of the issue as described. The printed stack trace correctly shows where the `TypeError` occurred, aligning with the description of the reported issue. This confirms the script functioned as intended by reproducing the error.

Given the result, it's clear that the issue is present as expected. However, based on your instructions, it seems there's a request for clarification or adjustment possibly due to a misunderstanding of the test output. If the intention is to adjust the script so it exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed and only prints a stack trace if the issue is present, the script already does this, as evidenced by the behavior described in the output. The `print_stacktrace` function is called when an exception is encountered, and then the script exits with code 1â€”a non-zero exit indicating an error.

The execution result suggests the script identified the issue correctly, but perhaps you are looking for a script modification or clarification. If you require further adjustments or additional tasks to be performed by the script, could you please specify the adjustments needed?
