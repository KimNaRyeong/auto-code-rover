        "intended_behavior": "The `__new__` method should be enhanced to: \n- Explicitly support non-disjoint cycles by applying them sequentially from left to right to compute the final permutation. This ensures that input like `[[0,1], [0,1]]` will correctly result in the identity permutation instead of raising a `ValueError`.\n- Introduce a preprocessing step for cycle inputs to merge or apply non-disjoint cycles before proceeding with the remaining validation and conversion logic in the `__new__` method.\n- Maintain rigorous input validation for all other scenarios (ensuring no unwanted modifications to the handling of other input forms), thereby preserving the existing functionality while extending support for non-disjoint cycle inputs."
