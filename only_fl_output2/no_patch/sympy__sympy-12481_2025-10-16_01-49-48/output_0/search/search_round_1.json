        "content": "Given the results from the API calls and the original issue, let's analyze the context and consider the next steps.\n\n### Analysis of Collected Context\nThe `Permutation` class is located in the file `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`, and it's quite feature-rich based on the listed methods. There doesn't seem to be an `__init__` method directly in the class, which means the initialization process likely relies on the `__new__` method for constructing instances. This is common in immutable types or classes extending certain base types in Python, which `sympy` itself often does for its algebraic types.\n\n### Relation to the Bug\nThe issue pertains to the failure of constructing a `Permutation` object with non-disjoint cycles, leading to a `ValueError`. Since the `__init__` method is not directly involved in object construction (it does not exist, and thus, `__new__` is likely used), the handling of cycle arguments to build the permutation might be located within the `__new__` method or related utility methods that process the input before the actual object instantiation.\n\n### Intended Behavior\nThe reporter expects that non-disjoint cycles should not cause an error. Instead, those cycles should be processed sequentially from left to right to result in the final permutation, so their example with `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` should create an identity permutation rather than throwing an error. This implies the process handling these cycles needs to be capable of merging or applying these cycles in the specified order to compute the resultant permutation.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the analysis, additional context is necessary to address the issue:\n1. **Explore `__new__` Method**: Since `__new__` is utilized for object construction in the `Permutation` class, examining its implementation is crucial for understanding how it processes input cycles and why it might fail for non-disjoint cycles.\n2. **Identify Any Utility Methods for Input Processing**: It's possible that the input cycles undergo validation or preprocessing with utility methods. Identifying these methods can provide insight into where the current process fails for non-disjoint cycles and how it might be augmented.\n\n**Proposed API Calls**:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"__new__\", \"sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py\")`: This should reveal how the `Permutation` object instantiates and processes the incoming data.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"ValueError\", \"sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py\")`: Understanding where and why `ValueError` is raised in this file can link us directly to the code block responsible for the current handling of cycle inputs, which is likely where the bug manifests."
