The issue mentions a failure when non-disjoint cycles are passed to the constructor, suggesting that we should look into how the constructor handles its input and specifically how it deals with cycles.\n\nThus, we should:\n1. Find the `Permutation` class to understand its structure and locate the constructor.\n2. Search for the constructor code or any method that might be called when initializing a `Permutation` object, which includes handling of the input cycles.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls:\n- search_class(\"Permutation\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"Permutation\")"
