The issue at hand concerns how index entries leading with characters ('@', '\u00a3', and '\u2190') are categorized and displayed in the HTML output, leading to duplicated 'Symbols' sections. Since our initial, more specific queries did not yield any results, we should try broader search terms and consider functionalities related to indexing and HTML generation that might not be directly mentioned in the issue description.\n\nConsidering these aspects, here are the next steps and API calls we should make to get more context:\n\n1. Broaden the search to include methods or functions that might handle the indexing process in a more general sense. The methods may not be explicitly named after the generation of indexes or handling of special characters.\n   - `search_method(\"indexEntries\")`\n   - `search_method(\"buildIndex\")`\n\n2. Search for code that might be responsible for sorting or categorizing entries within the index. This could involve more general terminology.\n   - `search_code(\"sort index entries\")`\n   - `search_code(\"categorize entries\")`\n\n3. Given the issue might stem from how entries are displayed in HTML, it's wise to look for methods that directly contribute to the HTML structure of the index, aside from those directly mentioned to generate or create HTML output.\n   - `search_method(\"formatHtml\")`\n   - `search_method(\"outputHtml\")`\n\n4. Since no results were found with the more direct searches related to the 'Symbols' section and handling of special characters, we might need to broaden our search to look at how the system handles characters or entries that don't fit typical categories.\n   - `search_code(\"non-alphabetic index entries\")`\n   - `search_code(\"index special handling\")`\n\nBy taking these broader approaches, we aim to identify relevant sections of the code that might influence how index entries starting with special characters are processed, categorized, and displayed in the HTML output, and how the 'Symbols' sections are generated and linked."
