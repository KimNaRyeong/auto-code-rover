Looking into documentation or asking colleagues knowledgeable about the index generation and HTML output system within the project might provide new directions for search terms or areas of the code to investigate.\n\nSince we still need more context to identify the bug's location accurately and propose a fix, we'll undertake these additional search strategies."

The issue noted occurs in the HTML output; thus, any logic controlling the structure and content of index pages could be located here.\n- **sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py**: This file, with its significant number of matches, indicates a comprehensive role in HTML building, possibly including the creation of HTML indexes or handling special sections within generated HTML pages.\n\n#### Code Analysis and Relationship to Bug\n- These parts of the code are presumably responsible for generating HTML content for various documentation elements, including index pages where symbols and characters need to be categorized appropriately. The duplication of the \"Symbols\" sections suggests there might be a flawed logic in categorizing or rendering these sections when the HTML pages are generated.\n- The intended behavior here should ensure that index entries beginning with special characters are correctly categorized into a single \"Symbols\" section in the generated HTML. Any logic responsible for categorizing index entries should recognize all relevant special characters and treat them uniformly, avoiding the creation of multiple sections for what should logically be consolidated.\n\n### Section Titles Snippets\n\nThe search for `\"section titles\"` led to results in files that might manage the formatting or organization of sections and titles within the documentation, including:\n\n- **sphinx/environment/collectors/__init__.py**\n- **sphinx/builders/latex/transforms.py**\n\n#### Code Analysis and Relationship to Bug\n- Parts of the code in these files might be involved in determining how section headers (including \"Symbols\") are generated and managed across different formats (e.g., LaTeX, manpage). If the logic for identifying or categorizing \"Symbols\" sections is inconsistent or overly fragmented, it could lead to the observed duplication in the generated HTML output.\n- The intended behavior would be to streamline the identification and categorization of sections titled \"Symbols,\" ensuring a unified approach across different file types and outputs. This would help in preventing the duplication of \"Symbols\" sections in HTML pages, likely by modifying how sections are defined or recognized based on their titles and associated characters.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nGiven the collected context:\n- The next steps should involve a deeper review of the **sphinx/writers/html.py**, **sphinx/writers/html5.py**, and **sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py** files to identify exactly how they contribute to the generation of index pages and the categorization of entries, specifically looking for how \"Symbols\" are handled.\n- Additionally, understanding the logic within **sphinx/environment/collectors/__init__.py** and **sphinx/builders/latex/transforms.py** might provide insights into how section titles, including those for specialized sections like \"Symbols\", are managed and rendered. \n\nThis analysis should focus on pinpointing inconsistent handling or categorization of entries that lead to the creation of multiple \"Symbols\" sections and adjusting it to ensure a unified and correct representation in the generated HTML output."

This might involve adjusting how characters are compared or adding a unified category for all such special characters.\n\n### Bug Location 2:\n- **File**: `sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py`\n- **Intended Behavior**: In this central file for HTML building, the target would be to ensure the logic that organizes index entries into sections recognizes and groups any entries starting with special characters like '@', '\u00a3', and '\u2190' into one \"Symbols\" section to prevent duplication.
