Here are the API calls I would invoke to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for any method that might be responsible for generating or categorizing index entries. This could involve methods that parse index entries, generate HTML output, or specifically handle special characters in index entries.\n   - `search_method(\"generateIndex\")`\n   - `search_method(\"categorizeIndexEntries\")`\n   - `search_method(\"createHtmlOutput\")`\n\n2. If the project uses a specific class to handle the index entries or HTML output, it might help to search for classes that are likely involved in this process.\n   - `search_class(\"IndexGenerator\")`\n   - `search_class(\"HtmlOutputCreator\")`\n\n3. Since the issue mentions the handling of special characters and the appearance of duplicated 'Symbols' sections, search for code snippets that directly handle or categorize these characters. This might involve specific comparisons or category assignments.\n   - `search_code(\"special characters in index\")`\n   - `search_code(\"Symbols section\")`\n\nThese searches aim to uncover the parts of the codebase that are most likely involved in the issue described, focusing on index entry generation, special character handling, and HTML output creation."
