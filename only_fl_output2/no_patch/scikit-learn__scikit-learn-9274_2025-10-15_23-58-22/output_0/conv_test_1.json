Below is the content of `reproducer.py` designed to verify the specific issue with the MLP training iterations being limited due to an incorrect argument mapping for the `max_iter` parameter in the context of using the L-BFGS solver.

Conversely, if the issue has been addressed and the bug is fixed, the script should execute without any errors, indicating that the MLP model's training could proceed for the desired number of iterations."
