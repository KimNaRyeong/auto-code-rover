        "content": "To effectively gather context for resolving the issue regarding MLP training being limited to the default L-BFGS maxiter value, we need to explore the relevant parts of the sklearn (scikit-learn) codebase. Given the description of the problem, we're interested in the implementation details of the MLPRegressor class, specifically how it interfaces with the L-BFGS solver to handle iterations. The following API calls will help us to gather the required details:\n\n1. Search the MLPRegressor class to understand its structure and where the `fit` method is implemented.\n   - `search_class(\"MLPRegressor\")`\n\n2. Search the MLPClassifier class for completeness since the issue and the steps mentioned in the example include both regressor and classifier, and the fix might be applicable to both.\n   - `search_class(\"MLPClassifier\")`\n\n3. Look into the implementation of the `fit` method within these classes, or the common base class if they share one, to understand how the solver settings are applied.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"MLPRegressor\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"MLPClassifier\")`\n\n4. Get more details on how the L-BFGS solver is configured by searching for any code snippets or methods that deal directly with setting `max_iter` and `maxfun` for MLP training.\n   - `search_code(\"solver='lbfgs'\")`\n\n5. Since the issue mentions the actual and expected behavior of iterations, exploring the L-BFGS solver configuration further could help. Specifically, where `max_iter` and `maxfun` parameters of the L-BFGS solver are set or passed.\n   - `search_code(\"`max_iter`\")\n\nThese specific searches should provide us with the detailed code context needed to understand how the `max_iter` and `maxfun` settings are currently applied and how they could be adjusted to respect the user-specified `max_iter` setting for MLP training sessions using the L-BFGS solver."
