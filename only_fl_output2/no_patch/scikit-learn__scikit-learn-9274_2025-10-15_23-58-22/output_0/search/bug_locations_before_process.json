        "intended_behavior": "The `_fit_lbfgs` method needs to ensure that the `max_iter` parameter is directly used to specify the maximum number of iterations for the L-BFGS solver during the training process of both `MLPRegressor` and `MLPClassifier`. Currently, the method either does not correctly utilize `max_iter` or confuses it with `maxfun` parameter, which limits the function evaluations instead of iterations. The method should be adjusted to correctly set the `max_iter` parameter for the solver configuration, accurately reflecting the users' specification for the number of iterations. This adjustment must preserve the method's existing functionality, which includes handling the optimization process, while merely ensuring that the `max_iter` parameter is applied appropriately and effectively controls the iteration limit as intended by the user."
