Considering the feedback and the need to directly address reproducing the described issue under a corrected context, here's a revised and functional python script `reproducer.py` intended to be run as described.

This standalone script includes additional handling to ensure the test can be executed properly and provides more detailed output regarding the specific issue. This revision also considers potential environments where previously mentioned errors (e.g., module not found) could occur, which was out of context for the specific test scenario we aim to reproduce.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Create a dummy dataset since the original dataset from the issue is not provided
    X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
    y = np.random.rand(100)

    max_iter = 18000
    clf = MLPRegressor(max_iter=max_iter, activation='relu', solver='lbfgs', verbose=True)
    
    try:
        clf.fit(X, y)
        print("score: ", clf.score(X, y))
        print("iters: ", clf.n_iter_, " / ", max_iter)
        
        # Verifying if the actual number of iterations matches the expected max_iter
        assert clf.n_iter_ == max_iter, f"Training did not run for the expected number of iterations: {clf.n_iter_} != {max_iter}"
        print("The issue is not present, the training ran for the expected number of iterations.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise    # Reraise the exception if the assertion fails

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This updated script should now properly execute and either directly reproduce the issue by raising an `AssertionError` if the MLP training does not reach the expected `max_iter` iterations due to the bug described, or complete successfully, indicating that the bug has been addressed or does not affect the current environment/setup. The script exits with code 0 if the issue has been fixed, or with a non-zero exit code (due to the uncaught `AssertionError`) if the issue persists, in line with the original request for behavior.
