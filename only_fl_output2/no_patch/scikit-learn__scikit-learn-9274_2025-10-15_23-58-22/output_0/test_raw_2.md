Based on the instructions and context provided, the following is an adapted version of the previous standalone python script designed to address the specified requirements. This version incorporates exceptions handling, specifically aimed at raising an `AssertionError` if the MLP training does not reach the designated `max_iter` iterations due to the bug described. It also properly utilizes the `print_stacktrace` function for error reporting:

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Generate a dummy dataset to simulate the use case
    X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
    y = np.random.rand(100)

    max_iter = 18000
    clf = MLPRegressor(max_iter=max_iter, activation='relu', solver='lbfgs', verbose=False)
    
    try:
        clf.fit(X, y)
        print("Score: ", clf.score(X, y))
        print("Iterations: ", clf.n_iter_, " / ", max_iter)
        
        # This assertion checks if the training process ran for the specified number of iterations
        assert clf.n_iter_ == max_iter, "Did not run for the expected number of iterations."
        print("Test passed: The training ran for the expected number of iterations.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)    # Exit with code 1 to indicate failure

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)    # Handle unexpected errors gracefully

    sys.exit(0)    # Exit with code 0 to indicate success if no issues are found

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script checks if the bug initially described (related to an iteration limit in MLP training with the L-BFGS solver) is present and offers clear traceback information when exceptions are raised, aiding in pinpointing the source of the issue. It ensures the script exits with a non-zero code if the issue is detected (or any other error occurs) and exits with code 0 upon successful completion without encountering the specific issue.
