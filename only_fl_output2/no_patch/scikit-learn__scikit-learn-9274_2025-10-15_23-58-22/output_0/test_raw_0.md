Certainly! Below is the content of `reproducer.py` designed to verify the specific issue with the MLP training iterations being limited due to an incorrect argument mapping for the `max_iter` parameter in the context of using the L-BFGS solver. This script attempts to train a minimal MLP model with a high number of iterations to surpass the default `max_iter` limit and checks whether the final iteration count is as expected. It raises an AssertionError when the issue is present, showing a stack trace that helps in identifying the problematic code path.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Create a dummy dataset
    X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
    y = np.random.rand(100)

    # Set a max_iter value beyond the default limit
    max_iter = 18000
    clf = MLPRegressor(max_iter=max_iter, activation='relu', solver='lbfgs', verbose=True)
    
    # Train the MLP
    clf.fit(X, y)
    
    print("score: ", clf.score(X, y))
    print("iters: ", clf.n_iter_, " / ", max_iter)
    
    # Assert the actual iterations against expected iterations
    try:
        assert clf.n_iter_ == max_iter, "Training did not run for the expected number of iterations."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script, when executed in an environment where the issue is present (e.g., with a version of Scikit-Learn where this bug is not yet fixed), should result in an `AssertionError` if the training process does not reach the specified `max_iter` iterations due to the incorrect handling of the `max_iter` parameter for the L-BFGS solver in MLPRegressor. Conversely, if the issue has been addressed and the bug is fixed, the script should execute without any errors, indicating that the MLP model's training could proceed for the desired number of iterations.
