Certainly, here's how you can create a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that attempts to reproduce the issue described. The script checks whether the `DataArray.quantile` method correctly keeps the attributes (`keep_attrs=True`) as expected and raises an `AssertionError` when it fails to keep the attributes. It exits with code `0` when the issue is fixed, indicating the absence of the problem.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import xarray as xr
    try:
        da = xr.DataArray([0, 0], dims="x", attrs={'units': 'K'})
        out = da.quantile(.9, dim='x', keep_attrs=True)
        assert 'units' in out.attrs and out.attrs['units'] == 'K', "The `keep_attrs` parameter did not work as expected."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exits with code 1 to indicate the test failed due to AssertionError.

    print("Success: The issue is fixed. `keep_attrs` is working as expected.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Save this script and execute it in the context where the issue is reproducible. It tries to ensure `keep_attrs` parameter functionality is as expected, printing a detailed stack trace if it fails, which can be very useful for debugging and verifying the issue.
