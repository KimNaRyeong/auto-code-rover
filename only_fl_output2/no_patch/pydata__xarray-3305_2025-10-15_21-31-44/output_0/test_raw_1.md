I see there was confusion in my response, and you've encountered an issue with the compatibility of numpy version and the script execution context. Let me correct and provide you with a revised script, considering the feedback:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import xarray as xr
    try:
        da = xr.DataArray([0, 0], dims="x", attrs={'units': 'K'})
        out = da.quantile(.9, dim='x', keep_attrs=True)
        assert out.attrs == {'units': 'K'}, "Attributes not preserved"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred:", e)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

    print("Test passed. `keep_attrs` is working as expected.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script aims to correctly replicate the issue regarding `keep_attrs` in the `quantile` method, ensuring it either fails due to the assert if the bug exists, or exits gracefully with code 0 confirming the absence of the bug. Note that the script now handles unexpected errors as well, which should help in avoiding misinterpretations in cases where the environment is not set up correctly or other errors unrelated to the `keep_attrs` functionality occur.
