Certainly! To create a standalone Python file for reproducing the issue, we will craft a script that mimics the environment setup and execution sequence resulting in the mentioned error. This script aims to trigger the `TypeError` related to the unexpected keyword argument 'path' when using `pytest-black` or `pytest-checkdocs` as plugins. Given the nature of the original issue, which involves the pytest framework, installing plugins, and executing a test collection, the reproducer will have to simulate these steps programmatically.

Please note that this script assumes you have a suitable Python environment set up with `pytest`, and the plugins mentioned (`pytest-black`, `pytest-checkdocs`) available or accessible for installation. Modify the script as necessary to accommodate any specific environment configurations or dependency versions.

```python
import subprocess
import sys
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_test_with_plugin(plugin):
    env = os.environ.copy()
    # Ensure the local python environment is used
    env["PYTHONPATH"] = "."
    command = [sys.executable, "-m", "pytest", "--plugins", plugin, "test_dummy.py"]
    result = subprocess.run(command, env=env, capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result

def install_plugin(plugin):
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", plugin])

def main():
    # Step 1: Ensure necessary plugins are installed
    try:
        install_plugin("pytest-black")
        install_plugin("pytest-checkdocs")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print("Failed to install necessary plugins.", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    # Step 2: Create a dummy test file
    with open("test_dummy.py", "w") as f:
        f.write("def test_dummy(): pass\n")

    # Step 3: Run tests with each plugin and check for TypeError
    for plugin in ["pytest-black", "pytest-checkdocs"]:
        result = run_test_with_plugin(plugin)
        if "TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'path'" in result.stderr:
            print(f"Issue reproduced with {plugin}: Unexpected keyword argument 'path'.")
            print(":::::: Error Trace ::::::::")
            print(result.stderr)
            assert False, f"Issue present with {plugin}"
        else:
            print(f"No issue found with {plugin}. It appears to be fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error if the issue is present
    else:
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit gracefully if no error
```

This script does the following:
- Installs the necessary plugins (`pytest-black`, `pytest-checkdocs`).
- Creates a dummy test file (`test_dummy.py`).
- Attempts to run `pytest` with each plugin and captures the output.
- Checks if the captured output contains the specific `TypeError` related to the unexpected keyword 'path'. 
- Prints an informative message based on whether the issue could be reproduced.

When executed in an environment where the issue is present, it should raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace of the issue. If the issue has been resolved, it exits gracefully with code 0. Remember to run this script in a python environment where pytest and the mentioned plugins can be installed and executed.
