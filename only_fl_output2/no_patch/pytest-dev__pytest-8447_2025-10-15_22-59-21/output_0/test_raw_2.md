The description of the issue suggests that the problem arises from running `pytest` with the `pytest-black` or `pytest-checkdocs` plugin and encountering a `TypeError` due to an unexpected keyword argument 'path'.

Given that directly reproducing plugin interaction issues through a simple script can be complex, it's important to approach this by simulating the environment and conditions under which `pytest` is executed with these plugins. Since the direct execution in a controlled environment didn't reproduce the problem initially, this script aims to mimic the user scenario more closely by invoking pip and pytest through subprocess calls. Note, however, that doing so requires the environment to have `pip`, `python`, and the ability to create virtual environments.

Here's how you might write such a script to attempt to reproduce the conditions under which the error occurs:

```python
import subprocess
import sys
import os
import virtualenv

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_command(cmd):
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True, shell=True)
    if result.returncode != 0:
        print(f'Command failed: {" ".join(cmd)}')
        print(f'Stderr: {result.stderr}')
        sys.exit(result.returncode)
    return result

def setup_virtual_environment():
    dir_path = "./pytest_env"
    virtualenv.create_environment(dir_path)
    print(f"Created virtual environment in {dir_path}.")
    return dir_path

def install_packages(env_dir):
    commands = [
        f"{env_dir}/bin/pip install pytest",
        f"{env_dir}/bin/pip install git+https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-black.git",
        f"{env_dir}/bin/pip install git+https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-checkdocs.git"
    ]
    for cmd in commands:
        print(f"Executing: {cmd}")
        run_command(cmd)

def create_dummy_test_file(filename="test_dummy.py"):
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        f.write("def test_dummy():\n    assert True\n")
    print(f"Created dummy test file {filename}.")

def run_pytest_with_plugins(env_dir):
    try:
        results = {}
        for plugin in ["black", "checkdocs"]:
            cmd = f"{env_dir}/bin/pytest --{plugin}"
            print(f"Running pytest with {plugin} plugin...")
            result = run_command(cmd)
            results[plugin] = result.stdout + result.stderr
        
        for plugin, output in results.items():
            if "TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'path'" in output:
                raise AssertionError(f"TypeError with plugin {plugin} is still present.")
            else:
                print(f"No TypeError detected with {plugin}, issue seems fixed.")
                
    except AssertionError as error:
        print_stacktrace(error)
        sys.exit(1)

def main():
    env_dir = setup_virtual_environment()
    install_packages(env_dir)
    create_dummy_test_file()
    run_pytest_with_plugins(env_dir)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script takes a more comprehensive approach:
- It starts by creating a new virtual environment to isolate the test run.
- Then, it installs `pytest` and the specified plugins directly from their Git repositories.
- It creates a minimal test file that would trigger the collection phase (where the error seems to occur).
- Finally, it runs `pytest` with each plugin activated to check for the presence of the error.
- If the error is detected, it prints the stack trace; otherwise, it reports back that the issue seems fixed.

Please be aware that this script involves network operations (cloning repositories, installing packages) that can fail due to external factors such as network issues or changes in the repositories' structure. Ensure the environment running the script has access to the necessary tools and the internet.
