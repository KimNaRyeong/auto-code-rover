        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather context on how the current printer functions work within our Mathematica code support. We should start by identifying classes or methods responsible for printing or handling output in the current implementation. Here are the API calls that could help us gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for printer class or methods**: Since the issue is with printers not supporting matrices and arrays, we first need to find any classes or methods likely responsible for printing or output functionality. We can start with general searches for any class or method with \"print\" in its name as Mathematica-related functionality might be encapsulated there.\n   - `search_class(\"Print\")`\n   - `search_method(\"print\")`\n\n2. **Search for existing array or matrix handling**: We should also check if there are existing implementations for handling arrays or matrices, even if they're not directly related to printing. This could give us clues on how to integrate array or matrix printing support.\n   - `search_code(\"matrix\")`\n   - `search_code(\"array\")`\n\n3. **Search for Mathematica support**: It's essential to understand how the existing code interacts with Mathematica objects. Searching for any code snippets related to Mathematica might reveal classes or methods we need to extend or modify.\n   - `search_code(\"Mathematica\")`\n\nThese API calls are targeted to help us understand the current project structure concerning Mathematica support, particularly for printing functionalities, and to find any potential integration points for matrices and arrays."
