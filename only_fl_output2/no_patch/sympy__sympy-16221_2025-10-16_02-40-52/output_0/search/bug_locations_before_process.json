To resolve the issue, it should be ensured this module can correctly parse and translate Mathematica matrices and arrays into SymPy's equivalent representations. If necessary, new handling routines or enhancements should be added specifically targeting the representation of matrices and arrays from Mathematica, including how they are represented in textual or printed form. This might involve adding new methods or enhancing existing ones to parse Mathematica syntax for arrays and matrices, ensuring they are converted into appropriate SymPy objects that can be printed correctly."

        "intended_behavior": "Given that LaTeX printing is a significant part of SymPy's output capabilities, ensuring that this module can handle and correctly print the SymPy representations of Mathematica matrices and arrays is essential. This might involve modifying or extending the LaTeX printer to detect when a matrix or array (possibly parsed from Mathematica syntax) is being printed and applying the correct formatting so that the output resembles or is compatible with Mathematica's own representation, or more generally, is mathematically accurate. If necessary, specific case handling for arrays and matrices originating from Mathematica syntax might be added to preserve the fidelity of the original expressions."
