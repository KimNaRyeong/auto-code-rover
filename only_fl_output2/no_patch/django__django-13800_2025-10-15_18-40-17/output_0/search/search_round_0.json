        "content": "To address the issue related to RFC 6265 compliance in Django's contrib.messages, we need to investigate how cookies are handled, particularly focusing on how cookie values are escaped or serialized. Here are the API calls I'm going to make to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the relevant class in the Django codebase that handles message cookies. The `messages` framework might be managed by a specific class or module. Given the specialized nature of this issue, it would be most likely related to the backend class that handles storing messages in cookies.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"CookieStorage\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the `CookieStorage` class or a similar class could be spread across files, let's also find out where messages are actually being set or saved since the issue mentions that Django is trying to use an escape character in cookie values. This action typically happens in some method that serializes the message data to be stored.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"encode\")\n   search_method(\"set_cookie\")\n   ```\n\n3. Given that the issue is specifically about how the values are escaped, let's look for any explicit code snippets that perform escaping or serialization in a way that might not comply with RFC 6265.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"messages=\")\n   ```\n\nThis combination of API calls should help us pinpoint where the problematic handling of cookies in `contrib.messages` is occurring and provide a foundation for how to approach fixing the non-compliance issue."
