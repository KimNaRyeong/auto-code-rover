        "content": "To address the issue related to RFC 6265 compliance in Django's contrib.messages, we need to investigate how cookies are handled, particularly focusing on how cookie values are escaped or serialized. Here are the API calls I'm going to make to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the relevant class in the Django codebase that handles message cookies. The `messages` framework might be managed by a specific class or module. Given the specialized nature of this issue, it would be most likely related to the backend class that handles storing messages in cookies.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"CookieStorage\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the `CookieStorage` class or a similar class could be spread across files, let's also find out where messages are actually being set or saved since the issue mentions that Django is trying to use an escape character in cookie values. This action typically happens in some method that serializes the message data to be stored.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"encode\")\n   search_method(\"set_cookie\")\n   ```\n\n3. Given that the issue is specifically about how the values are escaped, let's look for any explicit code snippets that perform escaping or serialization in a way that might not comply with RFC 6265.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"messages=\")\n   ```\n\nThis combination of API calls should help us pinpoint where the problematic handling of cookies in `contrib.messages` is occurring and provide a foundation for how to approach fixing the non-compliance issue."

It defines methods for getting messages (`_get`), updating cookies (`_update_cookie`), storing messages (`_store`), encoding messages (`_encode`), and decoding messages (`_decode`), among others.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug:** Since the problem involves escapement in cookie values, the methods `_encode` and `_update_cookie` are of particular interest. These methods likely handle the serialization of message data into a string that is stored as a cookie value, including the escape-character issue mentioned.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:** The intended behavior would be to serialize messages in a way that is compliant with RFC 6265, avoiding the use of any non-compliant characters or escape sequences in cookie values.\n\n### `set_cookie` Method in `django/http/response.py`\n\n1. **What it does:** This method is responsible for setting a cookie on the response object. It allows specifying various attributes of the cookie, such as `key`, `value`, `max_age`, `expires`, `path`, `domain`, `secure`, `httponly`, and `samesite`.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug:** Given the nature of the issue, the way this method handles the `value` could be relevant. The method involves directly setting the cookie value without explicitly detailing how values are encoded or escaped, implying that any non-compliance with RFC 6265 could stem from how values are prepared before they are passed to this method.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:** The `set_cookie` method should ensure that any value set is compliant with RFC 6265. This implies that values passed to it need to be safely encoded, without using problematic escape characters that violate the RFC.\n\n### Analysis and Next Steps\n\nGiven this context, the core of the problem seems likely to reside in how message values are encoded before being saved as cookies, particularly in the `_encode` method of `CookieStorage`. The use of escape characters not permitted by RFC 6265 suggests that this method's encoding mechanism might need to be reviewed and potentially revised.\n\nThe `set_cookie` method's direct relation to the issue is less evident but understanding its handling of cookie values is crucial since it's the final step in setting cookie data that clients receive. Although the method itself does not perform encoding, ensuring that input values are compliant with RFC 6265 before reaching this point is essential.\n\nGiven these insights, further analysis should focus on the encoding process within `CookieStorage`, particularly the `_encode` method, to identify how it might produce non-compliant cookie values. Understanding the specific encoding logic and any applied escape mechanisms can pinpoint where the compliance breach occurs."

This entails ensuring that the serialization process does not introduce escape characters or sequences that violate the RFC. The intended behavior is to modify or replace the current encoding mechanism with one that safely encodes message content, perhaps using a base64 encoding or another mechanism that avoids problematic characters, ensuring the cookie value remains valid per RFC 6265. The functionality to decode messages (`_decode` method) would also need to be compatible with any new encoding strategy adopted.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py`\n  - **Class:** `CookieStorage`\n  - **Method:** `_update_cookie`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** While the `_update_cookie` method directly might not be encoding messages, it's responsible for updating the cookie with the encoded message data. The intended behavior here is to ensure that when the `_update_cookie` method calls the response object's `set_cookie` method, the value passed is fully compliant with RFC 6265. This may involve additional validation or sanitization steps right before setting the cookie to guarantee compliance. The method should continue to support all existing functionalities, such as handling max cookie size and ensuring proper cookie attributes are set.\n\nThe adjustments to these methods aim to ensure that Django's `contrib.messages` framework remains fully functional and feature-complete, while also complying with the web standards outlined in RFC 6265 for cookies. This compliance is critical for interoperability with various web infrastructure components, such as WAFs, which may strictly enforce these standards."
