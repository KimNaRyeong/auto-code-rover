        "intended_behavior": "The `_encode` method should serialize messages into a string format that is compliant with RFC 6265 for cookie values. This entails ensuring that the serialization process does not introduce escape characters or sequences that violate the RFC. The intended behavior is to modify or replace the current encoding mechanism with one that safely encodes message content, perhaps using a base64 encoding or another mechanism that avoids problematic characters, ensuring the cookie value remains valid per RFC 6265. The functionality to decode messages (`_decode` method) would also need to be compatible with any new encoding strategy adopted."

        "intended_behavior": "While the `_update_cookie` method directly might not be encoding messages, it's responsible for updating the cookie with the encoded message data. The intended behavior here is to ensure that when the `_update_cookie` method calls the response object's `set_cookie` method, the value passed is fully compliant with RFC 6265. This may involve additional validation or sanitization steps right before setting the cookie to guarantee compliance. The method should continue to support all existing functionalities, such as handling max cookie size and ensuring proper cookie attributes are set."
