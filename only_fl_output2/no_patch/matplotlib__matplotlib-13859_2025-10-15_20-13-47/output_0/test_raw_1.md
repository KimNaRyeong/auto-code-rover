To address the issue mentioned above, specifically the failure due to the `ModuleNotFoundError` when trying to import `matplotlib`, we need to ensure that `matplotlib` is correctly installed before running the script. You can ensure `matplotlib` is installed by running `pip install matplotlib` in your environment.

The following `reproducer.py` script is designed with the same objective as previously mentioned: to reproduce the noted issue where creating a zero-width figure causes `libpng` to crash. This script includes error handling that will catch the exception, print a stack trace for debugging purposes, and assert the presence of the issue. It will exit gracefully with code 0 if the issue is resolved, thus no exceptions related to the specific error are thrown.

Please ensure your environment has the correct dependencies installed before proceeding with this test.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    # Fixed formatting issue in function definition
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{type(e).__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def execute_test():
    try:
        plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(3, 0))  # This line is expected to trigger the specific issue.
        plt.savefig("test.png")  # Attempt to save the figure with zero height.
        
        # If the execution reaches this point, the issue did not occur.
        print("The issue has been fixed, no exception raised.")
        return 0  # Exit code 0: Success
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)  # Print the detailed stack trace of the caught exception.
        raise AssertionError("The issue is still present.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        exit_code = execute_test()
        exit(exit_code)  # Exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed, will not reach this line if AssertionError is raised.
    except AssertionError as e:
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate failure, i.e., the issue is still present.
```

Before running this script, ensure that your Python environment has `matplotlib` installed, and your environment supports running scripts that utilize it. This script is configured to demonstrate whether the issue with saving a zero-width figure in `matplotlib`, causing a `libpng` crash, still exists in the version of `matplotlib` and `libpng` you are using.
