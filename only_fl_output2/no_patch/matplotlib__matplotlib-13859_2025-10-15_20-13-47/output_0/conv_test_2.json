You can ensure `matplotlib` is installed by running `pip install matplotlib` in your environment.\n\nThe following `reproducer.py` script is designed with the same objective as previously mentioned: to reproduce the noted issue where creating a zero-width figure causes `libpng` to crash. This script includes error handling that will catch the exception, print a stack trace for debugging purposes, and assert the presence of the issue. It will exit gracefully with code 0 if the issue is resolved, thus no exceptions related to the specific error are thrown.\n\nPlease ensure your environment has the correct dependencies installed before proceeding with this test.\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    # Fixed formatting issue in function definition\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{type(e).__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef execute_test():\n    try:\n        plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(3, 0))  # This line is expected to trigger the specific issue.\n        plt.savefig(\"test.png\")  # Attempt to save the figure with zero height.\n        \n        # If the execution reaches this point, the issue did not occur.\n        print(\"The issue has been fixed, no exception raised.\")\n        return 0  # Exit code 0: Success\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)  # Print the detailed stack trace of the caught exception.\n        raise AssertionError(\"The issue is still present.\") from e\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        exit_code = execute_test()\n        exit(exit_code)  # Exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed, will not reach this line if AssertionError is raised.\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate failure, i.e., the issue is still present.\n```\n\nBefore running this script, ensure that your Python environment has `matplotlib` installed, and your environment supports running scripts that utilize it. This script is configured to demonstrate whether the issue with saving a zero-width figure in `matplotlib`, causing a `libpng` crash, still exists in the version of `matplotlib` and `libpng` you are using."
