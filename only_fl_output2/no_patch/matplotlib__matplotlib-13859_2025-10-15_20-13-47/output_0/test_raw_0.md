Here's a Python script named `reproducer.py` that attempts to reproduce the specified issue. The script will raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present, complete with a stack trace detailing the error. The script will exit with code 0 when the issue is not encountered, indicating that the potential problem has been resolved.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def execute_test():
    try:
        plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(3, 0))
        plt.savefig("test.png")
        print("The issue has been fixed, no exception raised.")
        return 0  # The issue is fixed if the code reaches here
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is still present.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    execute_test()
```

This script attempts to spot the specific matplotlib and libpng error triggered by attempting to save a figure with a zero height. An `AssertionError` indicates an unhandled error state likely due to the described bug, signaling that the matplotlib or related library handling of zero-dimension figures to PNG format may still be prone to crashing when encountering specific sizes.
