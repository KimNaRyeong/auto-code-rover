I will start with the following search API calls to get the required context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"degree\")`: This will help in understanding if there's a dedicated `degree` function for rational functions or if the same `degree` function is expected to handle them.\n2. `search_class(\"RationalFunction\")`: Assuming that SymPy might have a class dedicated to rational functions, or a closely named one, this search will help in understanding the underlying implementation for rational functions.\n3. `search_code(\"degree((x-2)/(x**2+1), x)\")`: This specific use case presented in the issue will help find if there's an explicit handling or example in the codebase that matches the use case."
