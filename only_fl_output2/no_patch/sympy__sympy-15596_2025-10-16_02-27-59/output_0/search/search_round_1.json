        "content": "Given the results from the API calls, here's the analysis and the next steps:\n\n1. **Search for `degree` Method:**\n   The search for the `degree` method revealed multiple matches across various files. The most promising file appears to be `sympy/polys/polytools.py`, which, based on the naming, is likely to deal with polynomial tools, a category under which computing the degree of a polynomial would fall. Given the issue at hand involves computing the degree of a rational function, which mathematically is a quotient of two polynomials, the methods found within `polytools.py` are possibly the most relevant to the issue.\n\n2. **Search for `RationalFunction` Class:**\n   The search did not find a class named `RationalFunction`. This indicates that SymPy might not explicitly treat rational functions as a distinct class or it might use a different naming scheme for handling them. This absence suggests that operations on rational functions are likely handled by the same infrastructure that deals with polynomials or expressions in general.\n\n3. **Search Code for Specific Use Case:**\n   Since the specific use case with `degree((x-2)/(x**2+1), x)` did not yield any direct references in the codebase, it implies that this case might not have explicit handling or examples documented within the source code. This could mean that the issue arises from a more generalized handling of expressions that does not account for the particularities of rational functions regarding degree computation.\n\n### Intended Behavior Analysis:\nThe intended behavior, based on the issue description, is for SymPy to either correctly compute the degree of a rational function or explicitly fail when such a computation is not supported natively. Given the confusion represented in the issue, it is possible that the current implementation treats the numerator and denominator separately in some way, leading to an unintended result when asked to compute the degree.\n\n### Next Steps:\nTo understand the implementation details and potentially identify the source of the issue, the following API calls would be necessary:\n\n1. **Search for the Implementation in `polytools.py`:**\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"degree\", \"sympy/polys/polytools.py\")`: This call would provide insights into how the `degree` function is implemented within the context of polynomial tools, which could reveal how it handles or fails to handle rational functions appropriately.\n\n2. **Explore General Handling of Expressions:**\n   Since there was no direct reference to `RationalFunction`, investigating how SymPy processes expressions, especially those involving both a numerator and denominator (like rational functions), could be insightful.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"Rational\", \"sympy/polys/polytools.py\")`: Given the absence of a `RationalFunction` class, looking for \"Rational\" might reveal how rational numbers or expressions are treated.\n   - `search_code(\"rational function\")`: Broadening the search to see if there are documented mentions or handling of rational functions elsewhere in the codebase could provide additional insights.\n\nThese steps aim to uncover how the `degree` function is expected to work with rational functions and identify if the observed behavior is a bug or a limitation of the current implementation."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

To resolve the issue, the method might need an enhancement to correctly identify and compute the degree of a rational function as the maximum degree of its numerator polynomial minus the degree of its denominator polynomial, following the mathematical definition of the degree of a rational function. This functionality should be added in such a way that it doesn't interfere with the existing handling of polynomial degree computation, potentially by adding a check to see if the input is a rational function and then applying the appropriate logic. If the implementation cannot support rational functions, it should fail more gracefully with a specific error message indicating that the degree of a rational function is not supported or directly compute it if possible."
