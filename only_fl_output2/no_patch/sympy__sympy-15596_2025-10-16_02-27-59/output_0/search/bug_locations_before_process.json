        "intended_behavior": "The `degree` method in `polytools.py` should have a clear mechanism to handle rational functions directly or provide a meaningful exception if such computation cannot be conducted. To resolve the issue, the method might need an enhancement to correctly identify and compute the degree of a rational function as the maximum degree of its numerator polynomial minus the degree of its denominator polynomial, following the mathematical definition of the degree of a rational function. This functionality should be added in such a way that it doesn't interfere with the existing handling of polynomial degree computation, potentially by adding a check to see if the input is a rational function and then applying the appropriate logic. If the implementation cannot support rational functions, it should fail more gracefully with a specific error message indicating that the degree of a rational function is not supported or directly compute it if possible."
