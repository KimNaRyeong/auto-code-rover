        "intended_behavior": "The `_g_sig_digits` function needs to safely handle cases when `delta` could be zero or negative to avoid math domain errors. This could involve checking if `delta` is positive before attempting to calculate its logarithm. If `delta` is non-positive, the function should either avoid the logarithmic operation by defaulting to a preset number of significant digits or by another means that retains its purpose without causing errors."

        "intended_behavior": "While the primary issue does not directly originate from this method, ensuring that the inputs to `_g_sig_digits` from this method are always valid for logarithmic operations could be an additional safeguard. Specifically, when determining `delta` for cursor data representation, ensure it\u2019s calculated in a way that it remains positive. Moreover, given the method deals with formatting data for visual representation, it could also benefit from handling exceptions gracefully, maintaining user interaction without spewing errors for edge cases in data."
