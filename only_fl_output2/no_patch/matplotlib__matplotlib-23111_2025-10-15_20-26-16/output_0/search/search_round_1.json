        "content": "Analyzing the collected context related to the bug where `imshow` with all negative values leads to math domain errors during mouse hover reveals several key insights:\n\n### 1. `_g_sig_digits` in `cbook/__init__.py`\nThe code snippet from `cbook/__init__.py` shows the function `_g_sig_digits`, which calculates the significant digits for displaying the cursor data. The logic includes a conditional logarithmic calculation that does not explicitly handle cases where `delta` could be non-positive (i.e., zero or negative), which leads directly into the `ValueError: math domain error`.\n\n- **Relation to bug**: The error occurs because `math.log10(delta)` is called without ensuring `delta` is strictly positive. Given the issue occurs with a numpy array of identical negative values, it is plausible that `delta` calculated in this scenario is not positive, leading to a math domain error when attempting the logarithm.\n- **Intended behavior**: Ideally, this part should safely handle cases where `delta` could be non-positive by either preventing the log operation for non-positive values or by implementing a fallback mechanism.\n\n### 2. `format_cursor_data` in `matplotlib/artist.py`\nThis method is intended to format the data for cursor display, converting data points to a string representation. Specifically, it has a block for scalar values associated with a `ScalarMappable` artist (like images shown with `imshow`), which uses `_g_sig_digits` to calculate a number of significant digits for formatting.\n\n- **Relation to bug**: The bug manifests when this formatting logic is executed for an array with identical negative values, which should be scalar-treated due to its uniformity. The call to `_g_sig_digits` within this code block suggests that the math domain error arises as part of the process to display cursor data values meaningfully.\n- **Intended behavior**: This method should robustly format cursor data for all valid input data, including uniform negative arrays, without raising exceptions. Handling or checking input data within this method or by `cbook._g_sig_digits` to prevent math domain errors would align with the intended behavior.\n\nGiven the lack of results for `set_clim()`, it could be informative to explore related functions or mechanisms that influence the color limits (clim) or normalization of data in images displayed by `imshow`, as these may intersect with how `delta` is calculated or applied. Since `set_clim()` impacts how data is normalized and displayed, understanding its implementation could offer hints towards a solution.\n\nFrom here, the next steps could involve:\n- Exploring `ScalarMappable` and its `set_clim` method or equivalent properties that impact data normalization and representation, as understanding these might illuminate how `delta` is calculated and used.\n- Investigating how `delta` is derived within the cursor data display chain could reveal direct adjustments to prevent non-positive values causing domain errors."

This could involve checking if `delta` is positive before attempting to calculate its logarithm. If `delta` is non-positive, the function should either avoid the logarithmic operation by defaulting to a preset number of significant digits or by another means that retains its purpose without causing errors.\n\n- **Location 2:** File: `lib/matplotlib/artist.py`, Method: `format_cursor_data`\n    - **Intended Behavior:** While the primary issue does not directly originate from this method, ensuring that the inputs to `_g_sig_digits` from this method are always valid for logarithmic operations could be an additional safeguard. Specifically, when determining `delta` for cursor data representation, ensure it\u2019s calculated in a way that it remains positive. Moreover, given the method deals with formatting data for visual representation, it could also benefit from handling exceptions gracefully, maintaining user interaction without spewing errors for edge cases in data.\n\nImplementing these changes would address the direct cause of the error and improve the resilience of data formatting in the visualization, maintaining the functional expectations of Matplotlib's cursor interaction with images generated by `imshow`."
