This script is designed to reproduce the described issue with `imshow` in matplotlib when displaying an array of negative values. It attempts to simulate the hover behavior that causes the math domain error by accessing the cursor data for each point in the array, which is related to the code path executed when hovering over the image in the UI.

Because the actual UI interaction (mouse movement and hovering) involves GUI event handling that is not easy to replicate in a standalone script without a complex setup, this approach focuses on the logic that could lead to similar computation (retrieving cursor data), expecting it might trigger the same underlying issue if not perfectly mimicking the hover event.

Keep in mind that depending on the exact conditions under which this bug manifests (specifically tied to GUI event handling and real-time data display in the matplotlib backend), this script may not perfectly emulate the scenario. However, if the issue is fundamentally about how `imshow` data is processed or represented under these conditions, this should offer a relevant test.
