See below:\n# Test with matched Queryset. Sum will return 50\nOrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[1]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))\n>>>{'test': 50}\n# Test with unmatched Queryset. Sum will return 0\nOrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[-1]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))\n>>> {'test':0}\n# Test with unmatched Queryset (using empty list). EmptyResultSet returned because of empty list. Sum will return NONE\nOrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))\n>>> {'test': None}\nSimon Charette on django-users suggested the following:\nFrom what I understand the ORM simply doesn't perform any query in this case\nas the pk__in lookup cannot match any OrderItem and result in an\nEmptyResultSet exception[1].\nThis exception is caught in the Query.get_aggregation() method where all\naggregates are converted to None[2].\nI suppose we should alter the except EmptyResultSet clause to account for\nouter_query.annotation_select items that are Coalesce() instances used with\nValue() but I'm unsure about how it should be done.\n[1] \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/2e0cd26ffb29189add1e0435913fd1490f52b20d/django/db/models/lookups.py#L221-L223\n[2] \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/2e0cd26ffb29189add1e0435913fd1490f52b20d/django/db/models/sql/query.py#L439-L445\nSee full discussion here:\n\u200bhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/django-users/HGD3Vv3IerA\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to `EmptyResultSet` affecting aggregate functions like `Coalesce` in Django's ORM, we should focus on several key areas mentioned in the issue description. Specifically, we need to look into the `EmptyResultSet` exception, how aggregates are handled in queries especially when an empty list is passed to `__in` filter, and where and how `Coalesce` with `Value` is processed in the context of an 'EmptyResultSet'. The locations and functionalities mentioned in the issue are within `lookups.py` and `query.py`, and may involve specific classes and methods such as the handling of exceptions and the process of aggregating query results.\n\nHere are the specific API calls we can make to gather the required information:\n\n1. **Search for the `EmptyResultSet` exception definition to understand its implementation and intended use case.**\n   - `search_class(\"EmptyResultSet\")`\n\n2. **Inspect the part of the code where the `EmptyResultSet` exception is raised during lookup operations.**\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"raise EmptyResultSet()\", \"django/db/models/lookups.py\")`\n\n3. **Explore how aggregates are converted to `None` in the `Query` class when an `EmptyResultSet` exception is caught.**\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"get_aggregation\", \"Query\")`\n\n4. **Since the handling of `Coalesce` and `Value` in the presence of an `EmptyResultSet` is crucial, let's search for where `Coalesce` might be defined or used within aggregations.**\n   - `search_class(\"Coalesce\")`\n   - `search_method(\"Coalesce\")`\n\n5. **Finally, understand how `Value` is processed in these scenarios since it's used with `Coalesce`.**\n   - `search_class(\"Value\")`\n   - `search_method(\"Value\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive view of the affected areas in the codebase, which will be instrumental in developing a fix for the issue described."
