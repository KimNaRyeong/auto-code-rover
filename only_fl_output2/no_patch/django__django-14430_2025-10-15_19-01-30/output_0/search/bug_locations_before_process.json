        "intended_behavior": "This method, which prepares and retrieves aggregate results, should be modified to ensure that when an `EmptyResultSet` scenario is recognized (i.e., when filtering with `pk__in=[]` results in no rows to aggregate), it should still allow for `Coalesce` functions with `Value` to return the specified default value, instead of converting all aggregates to `None`. This enhancement would involve checking for `Coalesce` instances within the query's annotation and ensuring that their defined fallback values are returned in the aggregate result dictionary instead of `None`. This modification must preserve the method's existing functionality for handling non-empty result sets and other kinds of aggregate functions.\n\nThe method will need additional logic around the handling of empty results, specifically acknowledging when aggregates can bypass the `EmptyResultSet` limitation (such as with `Coalesce`). This could involve:\n- Detecting when an aggregate query contains `Coalesce` with `Value`.\n- Ensuring that these cases return the fallback value provided by `Value` within `Coalesce`, even if the query result set is empty.\n\nThis approach maintains the existing functionality for queries that do not involve this specific `Coalesce`-`Value` use case, thus keeping the impact of changes scoped only to the necessary conditions that address the bug."
