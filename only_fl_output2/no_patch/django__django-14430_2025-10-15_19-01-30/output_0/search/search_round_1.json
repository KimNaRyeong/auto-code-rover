        "content": "### Analysis of the Collected Context\n\n#### EmptyResultSet Class\n- **Location:** `django/core/exceptions.py`\n- **Code Context:** It's a class derived from `Exception`. There\u2019s no additional context given in the snippet, but knowing it's an exception allows us to understand that it's being raised under specific conditions where a query result is expected to be empty.\n- **Relation to Bug:** This exception is central to the issue, as it's raised when the `__in` filter is applied with an empty list, leading to an `EmptyResultSet`. This exception handling appears to alter the expected behavior of `Coalesce` in aggregation queries.\n- **Intended Behavior:** In the context of the bug, rather than completely bypassing the aggregation operation or transforming aggregates into `None`, the intended behavior might be to allow `Coalesce` to provide a default value even when the `EmptyResultSet` exception is caught.\n\n#### `get_aggregation` Method in `Query` Class\n- **Location:** `django/db/models/sql/query.py`\n- **Code Context:** This method tries to return a dictionary with the values of existing aggregations. It constructs an outer and, if necessary, an inner query based on certain conditions (like `group_by`, `is_sliced`, etc.) and performs several checks and transformations to handle distinct aggregates and limits correctly.\n- **Relation to Bug:** This method is where aggregates are processed, and potentially where the behavior of returning `None` for aggregates in empty result sets is determined. However, this snippet doesn't specifically show handling of the `EmptyResultSet` scenario directly or how it converts aggregates to `None`.\n- **Intended Behavior:** Given the issue's context, this method might need additional logic to handle cases where `EmptyResultSet` is encountered, ensuring that `Coalesce` with a `Value` fallback operates correctly, returning the fallback value instead of `None` for empty queries.\n\n#### Coalesce Class\n- **Location:** `django/db/models/functions/comparison.py`\n- **Code Context:** It defines a `Coalesce` class inheriting from `Func`, with `COALESCE` as the function name. This setup suggests that it's used to construct SQL COALESCE expressions that let you return non-null values from a list of arguments.\n- **Relation to Bug:** `Coalesce` is directly related to the reported issue. It appears that while `Coalesce` should return the first non-null value from its arguments (or a default value if all are null), the `EmptyResultSet` situation bypasses the normal aggregation process, preventing `Coalesce` from executing properly.\n- **Intended Behavior:** `Coalesce` should be able to return its `Value` argument as the default in case the rest of the query does not return any results, even under `EmptyResultSet` circumstances.\n\n#### Value Class\n- **Location:** `django/db/models/expressions.py`\n- **Code Context:** The `Value` class represents a literal value in SQL queries. It\u2019s used in conjunction with other expressions like `Coalesce` to pass in literal values.\n- **Relation to Bug:** `Value` is used with `Coalesce` in the issue's test cases to provide a fallback value. The handling or mis-handling of `Value` in the aggregation process could be part of why the expected behavior isn\u2019t observed when an `EmptyResultSet` is encountered.\n- **Intended Behavior:** Within the context of an aggregation using `Coalesce`, `Value` should serve as the fallback value regardless of the query\u2019s result set size, including when it's empty.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the above context and its relationship to the reported issue, we can deduce that adjustments are likely needed in how `Query.get_aggregation` handles an `EmptyResultSet`, specifically with respect to allowing `Coalesce` and `Value` to function as intended. To further hone in on a solution, additional exploration might be necessary, particularly around:\n\n1. **Direct handling of `EmptyResultSet` within aggregation-related methods.** It seems there's a gap in how `EmptyResultSet` is handled or communicated between the method where it's raised and where aggregates are resolved (`get_aggregation`). A closer examination of any specific interception or exception handling logic in the aggregation process could provide further insight.\n\n2. **How `Coalesce` and `Value` are executed within the SQL compilation process.** Given their definitions, understanding exactly how they are compiled into SQL and executed, especially in scenarios where the dataset is empty (`EmptyResultSet`), might offer clues to the underlying issue.\n\nConsidering these angles, further API calls could involve inspecting more closely the handling of exceptions within `Query` methods and exploring how SQL functions like `Coalesce` are compiled and executed."

This enhancement would involve checking for `Coalesce` instances within the query's annotation and ensuring that their defined fallback values are returned in the aggregate result dictionary instead of `None`. This modification must preserve the method's existing functionality for handling non-empty result sets and other kinds of aggregate functions.\n  \n  The method will need additional logic around the handling of empty results, specifically acknowledging when aggregates can bypass the `EmptyResultSet` limitation (such as with `Coalesce`). This could involve:\n  - Detecting when an aggregate query contains `Coalesce` with `Value`.\n  - Ensuring that these cases return the fallback value provided by `Value` within `Coalesce`, even if the query result set is empty.\n  \n  This approach maintains the existing functionality for queries that do not involve this specific `Coalesce`-`Value` use case, thus keeping the impact of changes scoped only to the necessary conditions that address the bug."
