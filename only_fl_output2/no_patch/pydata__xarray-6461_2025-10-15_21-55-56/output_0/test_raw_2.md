It seems there was a misunderstanding regarding the intended execution scenario. Let's correct the approach and craft a `reproducer.py` that is aimed correctly at reproducing the initially reported issue: failure of `xr.where` when used with a scalar as the second argument and `keep_attrs=True`, leading to an `IndexError`.

Here is a corrected `reproducer.py` script:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_xr_where_issue():
    import xarray as xr
    try:
        # Attempt the operation that's been reported to fail.
        xr.where(xr.DataArray([1, 2, 3]) > 0, 1, 0, keep_attrs=True)
        # If the operation succeeds, then the issue has been fixed.
        print("Success: The operation completed without raising an exception.")
        return True
    except IndexError as e:
        # Catch the specific exception that indicates the presence of the reported issue.
        print("Failure: The operation raised an IndexError as reported.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch any other exception to provide useful debug information.
        print("Failure: The operation raised an unexpected exception.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

def main():
    if not check_xr_where_issue():
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    exit(0)
```

This script directly assesses whether the specific issue with `xr.where` reported is present, by attempting to execute the problematic line and catching an `IndexError`. The `print_stacktrace` function is used to reveal where the exception is raised if it occurs. The script exits with a status code of 0 if the issue has been resolved (meaning, the operation succeeds without raising an exception) and exits with 1 if the issue persists, ensuring clear and actionable output for debugging and verification purposes.
