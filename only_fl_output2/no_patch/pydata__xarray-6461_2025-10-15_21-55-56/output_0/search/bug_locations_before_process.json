        "intended_behavior": "The `apply_ufunc` function should implement a more sophisticated handling of the `keep_attrs` argument when dealing with scalar inputs or operations that result in simplified results where the traditional attribute handling could lead to errors. This includes verifying the type and structure of inputs for `keep_attrs=True` and providing clear behavior for scalar inputs regarding attributes without raising exceptions."
