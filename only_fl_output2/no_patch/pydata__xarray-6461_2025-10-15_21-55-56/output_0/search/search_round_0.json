        "content": "To gather sufficient context and understand how the reported bug occurs within the codebase, we should consider the following API calls based on the information provided in the issue:\n\n1. The reported error involves `keep_attrs` within an operation likely related to the `xr.where` function. Since the traceback points to a lambda function attempting to use `attrs[1]`, it's valuable to look at the implementation of `keep_attrs` handling in the context of `xr.where`. However, the `xr.where` might be a wrapper or utilizer of a more complex underlying code structure, possibly in a utility function or a method related to handling array operations within `xarray`. \n\n2. The issue indicates the failure occurs at lines 1809 to 1824, which appear to be handling `keep_attrs`. The error message \"list index out of range\" suggests a problem with accessing an element of a list (or array-like structure) that does not exist, which is a direct consequence of the mentioned lambda function (`lambda attrs, context: attrs[1]`). Therefore, examining the code around these lines could provide insight into how `keep_attrs` is intended to work with `xr.where` and why it might fail when `xr.where` is called with a scalar as the second argument, as demonstrated in the user's example.\n\nGiven the above considerations, let's invoke some API calls to retrieve relevant code and references:\n- `get_code_around_line(file_path, line_number, window_size)`: Since the issue description provides specific lines where the error occurs (`1809` to `1824`), we should look at the context around these lines. Let's arbitrate a `window_size` that would likely encompass useful context, such as `10` lines before and after the given range. A good starting point could be around line `1810` with a `window_size` of `10` to get a broader view of the surrounding code.\n\nThese API calls aim to retrieve code that directly deals with the issue at hand, providing a more complete view of the problem's context within the `xarray` library."
