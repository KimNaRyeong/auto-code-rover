Given the misunderstanding in the initial execution context and the feedback provided, here's a revised version of the `reproducer.py` script that is designed to accurately reproduce the described issue with `xarray` and specifically handle the exception related to `keep_attrs=True` causing an `IndexError`. This script assumes the described behavior exists as reported in the context of `xarray` version `2022.3.0`.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_xarray_where():
    import xarray as xr
    # The operation that's expected to fail under the specific conditions.
    try:
        # Perform the where operation with keep_attrs=True to reproduce the issue.
        result = xr.where(xr.DataArray([1, 2, 3]) > 0, 1, 0, keep_attrs=True)
        # If no exception was raised, it implies the operation succeeded unexpectedly.
        print("The test did not raise an exception as anticipated.")
        # Explicitly failing the test if the issue is presumed to be present.
        return False
    except IndexError as e:
        # This is the expected exception based on the reported issue.
        print("IndexError caught as expected:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        # Catching any other unexpected exceptions.
        print("An unexpected exception was caught:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

def main():
    if test_xarray_where():
        print("The test has successfully reproduced the issue.")
    else:
        # Failing the test if the issue was not reproduced as expected.
        raise AssertionError("Failed to reproduce the issue.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    else:
        exit(0)
```

This script aims to directly test for the `IndexError` exception as a result of using `keep_attrs=True` in the `xr.where` function call, which according to the reported issue, should not happen and thus indicate the presence of the bug. The custom `print_stacktrace` function will display the stack trace if an `IndexError` occurs, helping to clarify the error context. Keep in mind the effectiveness of this script in detecting the issue may vary based on the exact environment setup and `xarray` version being used, although it is targeted at the version `2022.3.0` as specified.
