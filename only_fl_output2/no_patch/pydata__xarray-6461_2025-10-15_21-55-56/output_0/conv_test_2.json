This script assumes the described behavior exists as reported in the context of `xarray` version `2022.3.0`.\n\n```python\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef test_xarray_where():\n    import xarray as xr\n    # The operation that's expected to fail under the specific conditions.\n    try:\n        # Perform the where operation with keep_attrs=True to reproduce the issue.\n        result = xr.where(xr.DataArray([1, 2, 3]) > 0, 1, 0, keep_attrs=True)\n        # If no exception was raised, it implies the operation succeeded unexpectedly.\n        print(\"The test did not raise an exception as anticipated.\")\n        # Explicitly failing the test if the issue is presumed to be present.\n        return False\n    except IndexError as e:\n        # This is the expected exception based on the reported issue.\n        print(\"IndexError caught as expected:\")\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        return True\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Catching any other unexpected exceptions.\n        print(\"An unexpected exception was caught:\")\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        return False\n\ndef main():\n    if test_xarray_where():\n        print(\"The test has successfully reproduced the issue.\")\n    else:\n        # Failing the test if the issue was not reproduced as expected.\n        raise AssertionError(\"Failed to reproduce the issue.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        main()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)\n    else:\n        exit(0)\n```\n\nThis script aims to directly test for the `IndexError` exception as a result of using `keep_attrs=True` in the `xr.where` function call, which according to the reported issue, should not happen and thus indicate the presence of the bug. The custom `print_stacktrace` function will display the stack trace if an `IndexError` occurs, helping to clarify the error context. Keep in mind the effectiveness of this script in detecting the issue may vary based on the exact environment setup and `xarray` version being used, although it is targeted at the version `2022.3.0` as specified."
