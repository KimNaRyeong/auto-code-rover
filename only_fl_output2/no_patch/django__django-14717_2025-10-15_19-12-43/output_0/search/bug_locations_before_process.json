This means restructuring the method to invoke `timezone.now()` only if and when it's determined that `self.default` is a date or datetime object that necessitates the check. This preserves the method's functionality of issuing warnings about potentially unintended fixed default values while optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary computation."

This would mean adding an initial conditional check to see if `self.has_default()` is `True` and if the default value type requires time comparison. This adjustment ensures that the performance is optimized by not calling `timezone.now()` prematurely."

The rest of the method\u2019s logic remains unchanged to ensure that it still serves its warning purpose correctly."
