            "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue related to `get_prep_value` no longer being called for `JSONField` after the upgrade to Django 4.2, we should target both the `JSONField` class itself and any related methods or code snippets mentioned in the issue. Based on the description, here are the search API calls that we need to make:\n\n1. Search for the `JSONField` class to get an overview of its implementation and to see if there are any comments or documentation about the change in behavior with `get_prep_value`.\n   - `search_class(\"JSONField\")`\n\n2. Since the issue specifically mentions that `get_prep_value()` is no longer called in version 4.2 and suggests changes in `get_db_prep_value()`, we should look into these methods within the `JSONField` class.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"get_prep_value\", \"JSONField\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"get_db_prep_value\", \"JSONField\")`\n\n3. The suggested fix involves a specific code change in `get_db_prep_value()`, replacing a call to `connection.ops.adapt_json_value(value, self.encoder)` with `connection.ops.adapt_json_value(self.get_prep_value(value), self.encoder)`. We need to find this code snippet to see the current implementation and figure out where to exactly apply the suggested modification.\n   - `search_code(\"connection.ops.adapt_json_value(value, self.encoder)\")`\n\nThese searches will provide a detailed overview of the `JSONField`'s current implementation, specifically focusing on the methods mentioned in the issue. This information is vital for understanding the problem and preparing for a patch."
