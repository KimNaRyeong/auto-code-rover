        "content": "<issue>`get_prep_value` no longer called for JSONField\nDescription\n(last modified by Julie Rymer)\nHello, I just upgraded from django 4.1 to 4.2 and I have a custom JSONField with a get_prep_value() override that stopped working. After searching a bit, I saw that was because JSONField.get_prep_value() is no longer called in 4.2 (\u200b5c23d9f0c32f166c81ecb6f3f01d5077a6084318).\nI think this issue need a resolution either:\nJSONField should call get_prep_value() like all other fields type, because this is the method that the \u200bdocumentation tell us to override in custom fields.\nOtherwise we need to override get_db_prep_value() which is heavier and does not have the same purpose. I think simply replacing connection.ops.adapt_json_value(value, self.encoder) with connection.ops.adapt_json_value(self.get_prep_value(value), self.encoder) in JSONField.get_db_prep_value() would fix this\nIf there is a good reason to no longer call get_prep_value(), this exception for JSONField should be clearly documented in \u200bcustom get_prep_value() doc. It should also be added to \u200bBackwards incompatible changes in 4.2 release note because I got stuck with this issue with no warning when migrating.\nPS: #34397 seems to be related but in fact is about Django 3.2 so it is not the current issue\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue related to `get_prep_value` no longer being called for `JSONField` after the upgrade to Django 4.2, we should target both the `JSONField` class itself and any related methods or code snippets mentioned in the issue. Based on the description, here are the search API calls that we need to make:\n\n1. Search for the `JSONField` class to get an overview of its implementation and to see if there are any comments or documentation about the change in behavior with `get_prep_value`.\n   - `search_class(\"JSONField\")`\n\n2. Since the issue specifically mentions that `get_prep_value()` is no longer called in version 4.2 and suggests changes in `get_db_prep_value()`, we should look into these methods within the `JSONField` class.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"get_prep_value\", \"JSONField\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"get_db_prep_value\", \"JSONField\")`\n\n3. The suggested fix involves a specific code change in `get_db_prep_value()`, replacing a call to `connection.ops.adapt_json_value(value, self.encoder)` with `connection.ops.adapt_json_value(self.get_prep_value(value), self.encoder)`. We need to find this code snippet to see the current implementation and figure out where to exactly apply the suggested modification.\n   - `search_code(\"connection.ops.adapt_json_value(value, self.encoder)\")`\n\nThese searches will provide a detailed overview of the `JSONField`'s current implementation, specifically focusing on the methods mentioned in the issue. This information is vital for understanding the problem and preparing for a patch."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context regarding the `get_prep_value` method not being called in `JSONField` after upgrading to Django 4.2, and examining the results of our API calls:\n\n### Analysis of `JSONField` Classes\nWe found three classes named `JSONField` in different parts of Django:\n- In `django/forms/fields.py`, which is a form field representation for JSON data.\n- In `django/db/models/fields/json.py`, which is the model field for JSON data storage. This is likely the relevant class for the issue at hand, given it is part of the models layer where `get_prep_value` would typically be overridden.\n- In `django/contrib/postgres/fields/jsonb.py`, which is specific to PostgreSQL's `JSONB` field. This class is less relevant for the issue as it suggests using `django.db.models.JSONField` instead.\n\n### Relation to the Bug\nThe issue description specifically mentions the behavior change in `django/db/models/fields/json.py`, so the `JSONField` class found in this file is our primary focus. This class does include a `get_db_prep_value` method but, as confirmed by our search, does not show an implementation for `get_prep_value`, suggesting this method is either handled by inheritance or not implemented at all for `JSONField`.\n\nThe search results confirm there's an implementation of `get_db_prep_value` within `JSONField`, but no direct call to `get_prep_value`, aligning with the issue description where `get_prep_value` is no longer called.\n\n### Analysis of `get_db_prep_value`\nThe `get_db_prep_value` method appears to handle converting the Python object (`value`) into a format suitable for storage in the database. According to the issue description, the previous behavior allowed for preprocessing of the value through `get_prep_value`, a step that seems to have been bypassed or removed in Django 4.2 based on the commit referenced.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   The code snippet within `get_db_prep_value` seems to be handling different scenarios where the `value` could be an instance of `expressions.Value`, have an `as_sql` method, or other types that can be directly adapted for JSON storage using `connection.ops.adapt_json_value`.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:**\n   The absence of a call to `get_prep_value` aligns with the bug description, indicating a change in Django 4.2 where this method is no longer implicitly invoked as part of the `get_db_prep_value` process. This change affects custom fields that rely on overriding `get_prep_value` for pre-processing data before it reaches the database.\n\n3. **Intended behavior according to the issue description:**\n   The intended behavior, as suggested by the issue poster, would involve reintroducing the call to `get_prep_value` within `get_db_prep_value`, allowing for custom preprocessing of the value. This step would effectively allow custom `JSONField` implementations to maintain their logic for adjusting the serialized data before storage.\n\nGiven this analysis, our next steps toward resolving the issue could involve modifying the `get_db_prep_value` method to incorporate a call to `get_prep_value`, consistent with the issue's proposed solution. Additionally, considering the impact of such a change, it's crucial to evaluate backwards compatibility and whether this reintroduction aligns with the Django development philosophy and other field types' implementations."

This reintroduction will enable the custom `JSONField` implementations that rely on overriding `get_prep_value` for data pre-processing to function as intended. This change involves modifying the last return statement in `get_db_prep_value` to pass the value through `self.get_prep_value` before it is passed to `connection.ops.adapt_json_value`. The modification must ensure that this change does not affect the existing functionality for cases that do not override `get_prep_value`, thus keeping the behavior consistent with previous Django versions and ensuring backward compatibility. The specific line to be changed (assuming line 129 is the correct line number based on the provided code context) is:\n   \n   - **Current Implementation**:\n     ```python\n     return connection.ops.adapt_json_value(value, self.encoder)\n     ```\n   \n   - **After Modification** should be something like:\n     ```python\n     prepped_value = self.get_prep_value(value)\n     return connection.ops.adapt_json_value(prepped_value, self.encoder)\n     ```\n   \n   This adjustment leverages the `get_prep_value` method, which subclasses could override to modify the value before it's saved to the database, reinstating the expected behavior as per Django documentation. This change is aimed at addressing the regression introduced in Django 4.2 without adding undue overhead or complexity to the `JSONField` implementation."
