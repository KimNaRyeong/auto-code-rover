        "intended_behavior": "The `get_db_prep_value` method should incorporate a call to `get_prep_value` to allow for custom preprocessing of the value before it is adapted for JSON storage. This reintroduction will enable the custom `JSONField` implementations that rely on overriding `get_prep_value` for data pre-processing to function as intended. This change involves modifying the last return statement in `get_db_prep_value` to pass the value through `self.get_prep_value` before it is passed to `connection.ops.adapt_json_value`. The modification must ensure that this change does not affect the existing functionality for cases that do not override `get_prep_value`, thus keeping the behavior consistent with previous Django versions and ensuring backward compatibility."
