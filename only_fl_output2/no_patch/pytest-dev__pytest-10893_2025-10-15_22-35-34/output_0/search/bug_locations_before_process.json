        "intended_behavior": "The method's implementation should be modified to use the onexc parameter in place of onerror when calling shutil.rmtree. This change should ensure compatibility with Python 3.12 while also preserving backward compatibility for earlier Python versions. This can be achieved by checking the Python version at runtime and using the appropriate parameter accordingly. The error-handling functionality provided by onerror (now to be handled by onexc) should continue to make the files writable in case of permission errors, thus preserving the existing functionality of cleaning up directories and files that may have restricted permissions."

        "intended_behavior": "A new method named addDuration should be implemented within the TestCaseFunction class. This method should appropriately handle the duration of the test, tracking the start and end times of a test case execution. The implementation should ensure that this time duration information is captured and processed in a way that is compatible with CPython\u2019s test result protocol introduced in Python 3.12. The method does not necessarily need to display this information directly but should ensure that it is available for any operations or handling that Pytest does with test durations, potentially including fixtures, hooks, or result reporting to align with Python 3.12's testing protocol enhancements."
