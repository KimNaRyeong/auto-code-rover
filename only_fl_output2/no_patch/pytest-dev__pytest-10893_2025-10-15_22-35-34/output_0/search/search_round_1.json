Something in Pytest's temp path fixtures calls an `rm_rf` function which calls `rmtree` with the `onerror` parameter. https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/6dcd652d4a55bacda01a15017e155caa816e15a5/src/_pytest/pathlib.py#L147 When warnings are treated as errors, this makes pytest fail any test using temp paths.\nAdd `addDuration` to `TestCaseFunction`\ncpython 3.12  (alpha) has added an `addDuration` API to test results (python/cpython#12271).\nThis would not be an issue, except it was designed to trigger a warning if the test result doesn't have such a method (hence e.g. python/cpython#103309). This means when using pytest as runner for unittest tests *and* running `-We` an error is triggered as pytest's test result (which seems to be `TestCaseFunction`) does not support this protocol.\nNow obviously this should be non-blocking, as hopefully nobody is running CI which blocks on testing 3.12, but there you go, I figure an early forewarning can't hurt.\n</issue>"

Firstly, we should look into the usage of `rmtree` that now needs to adapt to the change from `onerror` to `onexc` in Python 3.12. Secondly, investigating how `addDuration` can be integrated with `TestCaseFunction` due to the new API introduced in Python 3.12 is crucial. Let's break down the investigation process:\n\n1. **Investigating `rmtree` usage with `onerror`:**\n   - Given the file path in the issue, we should look at the implementation around the line number mentioned for `rmtree` to understand the current use of `onerror`.\n   - We would also want to check if `rmtree` is called with `onerror` anywhere else in the code base or only in the specified spot.\n\n2. **Understanding integration of `addDuration` with `TestCaseFunction`:**\n   - Since `TestCaseFunction` seems to be a crucial part of handling test results, and with the introduction of `addDuration` in Python 3.12, it's important to check the current structure and methods of `TestCaseFunction`.\n   - Investigate the relevant test runner or handler in Pytest that utilizes `TestCaseFunction` to see where the `addDuration` method can be integrated.\n\nBased on this plan, the API calls needed are as follows:\n\n- `get_code_around_line(\"src/_pytest/pathlib.py\", 147, 10)` to get the context around the mentioned `rmtree` usage.\n- `search_code(\"rmtree(\")` to find all usages of `rmtree` in the code base, focusing on those using the `onerror` parameter.\n- `search_class(\"TestCaseFunction\")` to find the definition and usage context of `TestCaseFunction`.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"addDuration\", \"TestCaseFunction\")` to check if `TestCaseFunction` already has something similar to `addDuration` or to assess how the method could be integrated. Given the description of the issue, this may not yield results directly if `addDuration` does not exist yet, but it helps understand the necessary context."

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### `rm_rf` Function in `src/_pytest/pathlib.py`\n\n1. **Functionality**: The `rm_rf` function is designed to remove a file path recursively. To handle potential errors related to permissions or locked files, it utilizes a custom `onerror` function, which adjusts the file permissions to make them removable.\n   \n2. **Relationship with the Bug**: Python 3.12 deprecates the `onerror` parameter in `shutil.rmtree` and replaces it with `onexc`. The current implementation of `rm_rf` in Pytest uses the `onerror`, which will cause a deprecation warning in Python 3.12 alpha and could lead to errors if warnings are treated as errors in the test suite.\n   \n3. **Intended Behavior**: With the introduction of Python 3.12, the `rm_rf` function should adapt to use the new `onexc` parameter instead of `onerror`, to comply with the latest Python standards without causing deprecation warnings.\n\n#### Usage of `rmtree(` in the Codebase\n\n1. **General Observation**: The search revealed that `rmtree(` is used in three different files: `testing/test_cacheprovider.py`, `src/_pytest/pathlib.py`, and `src/_pytest/tmpdir.py`, with a total of four usages across these files. This indicates that `rmtree` is an integral part of Pytest's handling of temporary directories and cache management.\n\n2. **Relationship with the Bug**: Each usage of `rmtree` with the deprecated `onerror` parameter could potentially lead to the same deprecation warning in Python 3.12 alpha, affecting a range of functionalities in Pytest, predominantly around resource cleanup in temp directories and caches.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: Each instance of `rmtree(` that uses the deprecated `onerror` should be updated to use the new `onexc` parameter. It's necessary to implement a new error handling callback compatible with `onexc` or adapt the existing one, if possible, to work with both parameters for backward compatibility.\n\n#### `TestCaseFunction` Class in `src/_pytest/unittest.py`\n\n1. **Functionality**: The `TestCaseFunction` class extends `Function` and seems tailored to integrate Pytest with Python's `unittest.TestCase`. It oversees the execution, setup, teardown of unittest-based tests, and handling various test outcomes like errors, failures, skips, and successes.\n\n2. **Relationship with the Bug**: Given Python 3.12's introduction of the `addDuration` API to test results, and Pytest's apparent lack of this method in `TestCaseFunction`, attempting to use this feature in Pytest as a test runner for `unittest` tests would lead to a warning or error under the `-We` flag.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: To align with Python 3.12's changes, `TestCaseFunction` should implement the `addDuration` method to accept test duration details. This would allow Pytest to correctly interact with Python 3.12's enhanced test result protocol, enhancing Pytest's utility as a versatile test runner for unittest.\n\n### Next Steps for Resolution\n\nGiven the analysis, the resolution involves coding tasks on two fronts:\n\n1. **Updating `rmtree` Usage**: Replace `onerror` with `onexc` in all instances of `rmtree` and ensure the custom error handling is compatible with Python 3.12's expectations while maintaining backward compatibility for older versions of Python. This will require modifying the `rm_rf` function and potentially other places where `rmtree` is used directly.\n\n2. **Implementing `addDuration` in `TestCaseFunction`**: Add an `addDuration` method to the `TestCaseFunction` class that aligns with the expectations set forth by Python 3.12, ensuring that Pytest can handle the new test result protocol without causing warnings or errors.\n\nTo further this analysis and prepare for implementation, it may be useful to check the implementations of `rmtree` in the other mentioned files and investigate how other test runners or frameworks are accommodating the `addDuration` addition to their test cases."

This change should ensure compatibility with Python 3.12 while also preserving backward compatibility for earlier Python versions. This can be achieved by checking the Python version at runtime and using the appropriate parameter accordingly. The error-handling functionality provided by `onerror` (now to be handled by `onexc`) should continue to make the files writable in case of permission errors, thus preserving the existing functionality of cleaning up directories and files that may have restricted permissions.\n\n**Bug Location 2:**\n   - **File**: `src/_pytest/unittest.py`\n   - **Class**: `TestCaseFunction`\n   - **Method**: N/A (New method to be added)\n   - **Intended Behavior**: A new method named `addDuration` should be implemented within the `TestCaseFunction` class. This method should appropriately handle the duration of the test, tracking the start and end times of a test case execution. The implementation should ensure that this time duration information is captured and processed in a way that is compatible with CPython\u2019s test result protocol introduced in Python 3.12. The method does not necessarily need to display this information directly but should ensure that it is available for any operations or handling that Pytest does with test durations, potentially including fixtures, hooks, or result reporting to align with Python 3.12's testing protocol enhancements."
