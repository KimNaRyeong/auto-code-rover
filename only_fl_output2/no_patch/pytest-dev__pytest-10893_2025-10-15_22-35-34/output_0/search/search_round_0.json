        "content": "<issue>Use of `rmtree` causes `DeprecationWarning` on Python 3.12 alpha\nThe current Python 3.12 alpha has made a change to `rmtree` https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/102828, deprecating the `onerror` parameter and replacing it with an `onexc` parameter. Something in Pytest's temp path fixtures calls an `rm_rf` function which calls `rmtree` with the `onerror` parameter. https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/6dcd652d4a55bacda01a15017e155caa816e15a5/src/_pytest/pathlib.py#L147 When warnings are treated as errors, this makes pytest fail any test using temp paths.\nAdd `addDuration` to `TestCaseFunction`\ncpython 3.12  (alpha) has added an `addDuration` API to test results (python/cpython#12271).\nThis would not be an issue, except it was designed to trigger a warning if the test result doesn't have such a method (hence e.g. python/cpython#103309). This means when using pytest as runner for unittest tests *and* running `-We` an error is triggered as pytest's test result (which seems to be `TestCaseFunction`) does not support this protocol.\nNow obviously this should be non-blocking, as hopefully nobody is running CI which blocks on testing 3.12, but there you go, I figure an early forewarning can't hurt.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue mentioned, we would need to gather more context around the affected areas in the code base. Firstly, we should look into the usage of `rmtree` that now needs to adapt to the change from `onerror` to `onexc` in Python 3.12. Secondly, investigating how `addDuration` can be integrated with `TestCaseFunction` due to the new API introduced in Python 3.12 is crucial. Let's break down the investigation process:\n\n1. **Investigating `rmtree` usage with `onerror`:**\n   - Given the file path in the issue, we should look at the implementation around the line number mentioned for `rmtree` to understand the current use of `onerror`.\n   - We would also want to check if `rmtree` is called with `onerror` anywhere else in the code base or only in the specified spot.\n\n2. **Understanding integration of `addDuration` with `TestCaseFunction`:**\n   - Since `TestCaseFunction` seems to be a crucial part of handling test results, and with the introduction of `addDuration` in Python 3.12, it's important to check the current structure and methods of `TestCaseFunction`.\n   - Investigate the relevant test runner or handler in Pytest that utilizes `TestCaseFunction` to see where the `addDuration` method can be integrated.\n\nBased on this plan, the API calls needed are as follows:\n\n- `get_code_around_line(\"src/_pytest/pathlib.py\", 147, 10)` to get the context around the mentioned `rmtree` usage.\n- `search_code(\"rmtree(\")` to find all usages of `rmtree` in the code base, focusing on those using the `onerror` parameter.\n- `search_class(\"TestCaseFunction\")` to find the definition and usage context of `TestCaseFunction`.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"addDuration\", \"TestCaseFunction\")` to check if `TestCaseFunction` already has something similar to `addDuration` or to assess how the method could be integrated. Given the description of the issue, this may not yield results directly if `addDuration` does not exist yet, but it helps understand the necessary context."
