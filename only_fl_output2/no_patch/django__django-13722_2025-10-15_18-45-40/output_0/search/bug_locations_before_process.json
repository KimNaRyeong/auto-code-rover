        "intended_behavior": "The `InlineModelAdmin` class should be modified to include a new method, potentially named `get_formset_initial_data` (mirroring the `get_changeform_initial_data` naming convention found in `ModelAdmin`). This method would not alter any existing functionality but provide an extension point for developers to customize initial data for inline formsets. The method's signature could resemble `get_formset_initial_data(self, request, obj=None, **kwargs)`, allowing it to access the request object and the parent object for which the formset is being rendered (if applicable). It should return a dictionary or a list of dictionaries with the initial data for the formset forms, considering the multi-instance nature of formsets. This customization hook facilitates dynamically setting initial values based on request parameters, similar to the existing method but tailored for inline formsets."

        "intended_behavior": "This method likely requires modification to incorporate the new `get_formset_initial_data` logic. Without changing its primary responsibilities, `get_formset` should be updated to check for and incorporate initial data provided by the new method. When constructing the formset instance, this method would merge or replace the default initial data with that obtained from `get_formset_initial_data`, if any. This ensures that any custom initial data logic defined by developers is respected when the inline formset is rendered, thereby enhancing the flexibility of Django's admin form handling."
