However jQuery's popularity, especially for making requests, is decreasing thanks to changes such as the new fetch() JS API.\nAlso in the cases this property is used to determine the kind of content to send to a client, it'd be better to inspect the HTTP standard Accept header.\nFor these reasons Flask has deprecated its similar property is_xhr.\n</issue>"

This includes methods for accessing request headers, body, and other metadata related to the HTTP request.\n   \n   - The `is_ajax` method checks if the request was made via AJAX by looking for the `HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH` header and comparing its value to `'XMLHttpRequest'`. This is a convention adopted by JavaScript libraries like jQuery to indicate an AJAX request.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   The issue at hand is the decision to deprecate the `is_ajax` method. The primary reason for deprecation is that the method relies on a non-standard HTTP header (`X-Requested-With`) for checking if the request is an AJAX request. With the advent of the Fetch API and the reduced usage of jQuery (which traditionally adds this header in AJAX requests), relying on this header becomes less reliable. Furthermore, the issue description suggests that it would be more appropriate to determine the response type by examining the standard `Accept` header, aligning with practices seen in other frameworks like Flask which have deprecated similar functionality.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   The intended behavior moving forward would be to discourage or prevent the use of the `is_ajax` method for determining AJAX requests due to its reliance on a non-standard header which may not be present in modern JavaScript-based requests. Instead, developers should use alternative ways (such as inspecting the `Accept` header) to determine the nature of the request and the appropriate response format. The deprecation requires making the `is_ajax` method issue a warning when used, informing developers of its deprecated status and suggesting alternative approaches.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps would involve modifying the `is_ajax` method to issue a deprecation warning and potentially documenting or implementing a recommended alternative approach for achieving the same functionality without relying on the `X-Requested-With` header."

This change is necessitated by the decreasing relevance of the `X-Requested-With` header, which the method relies on to determine if a request is made via AJAX. The method should continue to perform its current function to maintain backward compatibility, but it should also advise developers to use alternative methods for detecting AJAX requests, such as inspecting the `Accept` header themselves. The warning message should guide developers towards these alternative practices, ensuring they are aware of the reason for deprecation and the recommended approach moving forward.\n\n   This modification aims to alert developers to the changing best practices in detecting AJAX requests while avoiding immediate disruption to existing applications that currently rely on the `is_ajax` method."
