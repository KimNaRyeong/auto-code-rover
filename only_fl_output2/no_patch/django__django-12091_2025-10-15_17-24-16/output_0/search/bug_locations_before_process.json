        "intended_behavior": "The `is_ajax` method within the `HttpRequest` class needs to be modified to issue a deprecation warning indicating that it is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. This change is necessitated by the decreasing relevance of the `X-Requested-With` header, which the method relies on to determine if a request is made via AJAX. The method should continue to perform its current function to maintain backward compatibility, but it should also advise developers to use alternative methods for detecting AJAX requests, such as inspecting the `Accept` header themselves. The warning message should guide developers towards these alternative practices, ensuring they are aware of the reason for deprecation and the recommended approach moving forward. This modification aims to alert developers to the changing best practices in detecting AJAX requests while avoiding immediate disruption to existing applications that currently rely on the `is_ajax` method."
