The method should gracefully handle or skip such paths, logging a warning about the malformed path, thereby preserving the auto-reloading functionality without interruption. Implementing a pre-validation of paths to detect null bytes before attempting to resolve them through pathlib or before invoking os.readlink can achieve this. This ensures that auto-reloading remains robust against unexpected file system anomalies."

If any problematic file path is detected, it should either be corrected (if possible) or excluded from the watch list with an appropriate warning logged. This intended behavior ensures that the system's robustness is improved without altering its primary functionality of monitoring for file changes."
