        "content": "<issue>Linkchecker croaks on specific anchors of GitHub-rendered reStructuredText documents\nDear Sphinx developers,\nfirst things first: Thanks a stack for your paramount work on Sphinx. You already saved many souls of people writing technical documentation and probably also beyond this audience.\nWe just observed a minor woe with Sphinx' linkchecker we wanted to share with you. We really like that the linkchecker is able to check anchors within HTML documents as contributed by @intgr on behalf of #842.\nWith kind regards,\nAndreas.\n---\n**Describe the bug**\nWe had the link [1] in our documentation, and, maybe after upgrading to more recent versions of Sphinx, the linkchecker suddenly started croaking on that. After changing it to [2], it worked again. When inspecting the source code of the respective HTML page, you can clearly see that the anchor name `#user-content-make-changes` defined by\n```html\n<a name=\"user-content-make-changes\"></a>\n<a id=\"user-content-make-changes\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#make-changes\">\n```\nis technically correct. However, it apparently has worked before by referencing `#make-changes`. So, we are wondering if something changed on GitHub's reStructuredText renderer or even Browsers interpreting the HTML link anchors differently. When invoking those links [1,2] in the Browser, actually both work, including navigation to the appropriate place within the page. Funny, hm?\n[1] https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst#make-changes\n[2] https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst#user-content-make-changes\n**Expected behavior**\nTechnically, from the perspective we know our way around HTML, the behavior is probably the right thing and correct.\nHowever, as we can see, something might have been changed on the HTML standard that Browsers are capable of interpreting different styles of defining link anchors. So, it might be worth to revisit this space and maybe improve the linkchecker implementation on those aspects.\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Linux\n- Python version: 3.9.2\n- Sphinx version: 3.5.2\n- Firefox: 86.0\n</issue>"

Given the information in the issue, we're particularly interested in how anchors are parsed and validated by Sphinx, and whether any recent changes might have affected this process.\n\nLet's start by gathering relevant code context from the Sphinx project. Based on the description, we would want to locate:\n1. The class or module responsible for the linkchecker functionality.\n2. The specific methods within that class or module which handle anchor checking in HTML documents.\n3. Any code that might have been modified recently that could affect anchor handling.\n\nTo get this context, let's perform the following search API calls:\n- search_class(\"LinkChecker\")\n- search_method(\"check_anchor\")\n\nThese calls aim to locate the LinkChecker class (or a similarly named class responsible for link checking), and any methods related to anchor checking. Depending on the specific naming conventions and code organization within the Sphinx project, the actual class or method names might vary, but these searches should give us a starting point."

        "content": "Analyzing the result from the `check_anchor` method found in `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py`, here's what we can gather:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   The `check_anchor` function is designed to read HTML data from a `response` object (which contains the fetched HTML page) and searches for a specified `anchor` within that HTML content. It returns `True` if the anchor is found in the HTML, indicating a successful match, and `False` otherwise. The function makes use of an `AnchorCheckParser` (presumably a custom HTML parser focused on finding anchors) to parse the content in chunks, allowing for efficient processing by potentially avoiding the need to download and parse the entire document if the anchor is found early on.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   The issue reported indicates that Sphinx's linkchecker (which this `check_anchor` function is a part of) has problems with specific anchors in GitHub-rendered reStructuredText documents. Specifically, it fails to recognize anchors that do not follow the GitHub-specific `user-content-` prefix format. Given that this function is responsible for validating whether an anchor exists within a downloaded HTML page, the problem likely lies in how the function or its dependencies (like `AnchorCheckParser`) handle or recognize anchor formats, particularly those prefixed with `user-content-`.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   Ideally, the `check_anchor` function should be capable of handling both traditional anchor formats and those modified by GitHub (or similarly processed HTML documents) that include prefixes like `user-content-`. This means the method, along with its associated parser, should adapt to recognize anchors regardless of such prefixes, ensuring it correctly validates links to GitHub-rendered documentation or any HTML document that employs similar anchor naming strategies.\n\nGiven these insights, to further address the issue, it would be beneficial to:\n- Investigate how `AnchorCheckParser` is implemented, specifically how it searches for anchors within HTML content. This would require examining the class definition and any relevant methods within it.\n- Explore how `check_anchor` and `AnchorCheckParser` handle different anchor formats and whether there's an explicit check or limitation handling the `user-content-` prefix.\n\nTo proceed, the following search API calls are pertinent:\n- search_class_in_file(\"AnchorCheckParser\", \"sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py\")\n- This call will help us find the implementation of the `AnchorCheckParser` class within the identified file, which is key to understanding and potentially resolving the issue."

While preserving its existing functionality of efficiently searching for and validating the presence of anchors within HTML documents, the method (and by extension, the `AnchorCheckParser` if necessary) should be updated to:\n\n   - Recognize and handle different anchor formats seamlessly. This entails detection and appropriate interpretation of anchors with or without specific prefixes.\n   - Include logic that treats anchors prefixed with `user-content-` as equivalent to their non-prefixed counterparts for the purposes of link validation. This could involve pre-processing steps within the `check_anchor` method itself or within the `AnchorCheckParser` to normalize anchor references before attempting to locate them within the HTML content.\n   - Ensure that this adjustment does not negatively impact the function\u2019s ability to validate other anchor formats or disrupt existing functionalities that correctly handle standard anchor references.\n\n   This update will address the issue reported with linking to GitHub-rendered reStructuredText documents, while also maintaining the utility and accuracy of the Sphinx link checker across various document and link formats."
