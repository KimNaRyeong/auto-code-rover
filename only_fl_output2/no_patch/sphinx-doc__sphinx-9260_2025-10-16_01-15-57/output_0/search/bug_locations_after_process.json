        "intended_behavior": "The `check_anchor` method should be enhanced to properly account for anchors that may include specific prefixes, such as `user-content-`, which are commonly introduced by GitHub or other platforms when rendering documents into HTML. While preserving its existing functionality of efficiently searching for and validating the presence of anchors within HTML documents, the method (and by extension, the `AnchorCheckParser` if necessary) should be updated to:\n\n- Recognize and handle different anchor formats seamlessly. This entails detection and appropriate interpretation of anchors with or without specific prefixes.\n- Include logic that treats anchors prefixed with `user-content-` as equivalent to their non-prefixed counterparts for the purposes of link validation. This could involve pre-processing steps within the `check_anchor` method itself or within the `AnchorCheckParser` to normalize anchor references before attempting to locate them within the HTML content.\n- Ensure that this adjustment does not negatively impact the function\u2019s ability to validate other anchor formats or disrupt existing functionalities that correctly handle standard anchor references.\n\nThis update will address the issue reported with linking to GitHub-rendered reStructuredText documents, while also maintaining the utility and accuracy of the Sphinx link checker across various document and link formats."
