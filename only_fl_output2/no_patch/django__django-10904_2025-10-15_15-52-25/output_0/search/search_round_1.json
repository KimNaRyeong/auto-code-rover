With this in mind, the Django code base can be cleaned up.\nFor additional details, see the Python 3.3 release notes:\n\u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#pep-3151-reworking-the-os-and-io-exception-hierarchy\nYou don\u2019t have to worry anymore about choosing the appropriate exception type between OSError, IOError, EnvironmentError, WindowsError, mmap.error, socket.error or select.error. All these exception types are now only one: OSError. The other names are kept as aliases for compatibility reasons.\nAdditionally, since Python 3.4, SMTPException is subclass of OSError . So exception handles catching both can be simplified to just OSError.\n\u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html#smtplib.SMTPException\nSubclass of OSError that is the base exception class for all the other exceptions provided by this module.\nChanged in version 3.4: SMTPException became subclass of OSError\n</issue>"

Given this information, the following API calls will help us gather the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_code(\"IOError\")` - This will help identify occurrences of `IOError` being used throughout the Django project.\n2. `search_code(\"EnvironmentError\")` - This will find where `EnvironmentError` is specifically referenced.\n3. `search_code(\"WindowsError\")` - Since `WindowsError` might be used in platform-specific code, its occurrences are also relevant.\n4. `search_code(\"mmap.error\")` - Finds instances where `mmap.error` exception is explicitly caught.\n5. `search_code(\"socket.error\")` - To see where network-related exceptions are caught using the old `socket.error`.\n6. `search_code(\"select.error\")` - Identifies where `select.error` is used, typically in code dealing with I/O multiplexing.\n7. `search_code(\"SMTPException\")` - Given its change in Python 3.4, we need to see where `SMTPException` is caught, either by itself or with other exceptions.\n\nThese searches will provide a comprehensive view of where the project is utilizing these now-redundant exception names, enabling us to plan and execute the necessary refactoring to use `OSError` exclusively."

        "content": "Analyzing the gathered context from the search results in relation to the issue of replacing obsolete OSError alias exceptions in the Django codebase with `OSError`, we can make a few observations:\n\n### `IOError` Usage Across Various Django Components\n- **Occurrences**: Spread across middleware, HTTP components, utils, views, contrib modules, and core files.\n- **Purpose**: Primarily used for handling I/O-related errors, such as file and network operations.\n- **Relation to Bug**: `IOError` is now an alias for `OSError` in Python 3.3 and onwards. Its usage is redundant and can be streamlined by directly using `OSError`.\n- **Intended Behavior**: Replace `IOError` with `OSError` to unify exception handling without changing the logic.\n\n### `EnvironmentError` in GIS Components\n- **Occurrences**: In the GeoSpatial (`GIS`) components dealing with external library paths.\n- **Purpose**: Catches configuration and import-related errors when setting library paths.\n- **Relation to Bug**: Similar to `IOError`, `EnvironmentError` is also an alias for `OSError`. The code fragment catches a variety of errors including `EnvironmentError` which could be simplified.\n- **Intended Behavior**: Use `OSError` to maintain the same catch-all functionality while adhering to modern Python practices.\n\n### `WindowsError`, `mmap.error`, and `select.error`\n- **Findings**: No occurrences of `WindowsError`, `mmap.error`, or `select.error` in the search results.\n- **Implication**: Either these exceptions are not used in the Django codebase, or their use cases might be sufficiently obscure or removed from the main branches. It may also indicate that specific platform or module-related exception handling is not explicitly coded or needed in the current state of the project.\n- **Action**: No immediate action unless a deeper, targeted search is warranted based on specific modules or files known to interact with Windows system calls, memory-mapped files, or select operations specifically.\n\n### `socket.error` in Server and Mail Components\n- **Occurrences**: In server command handling and SMTP email backend.\n- **Purpose**: Handles network-related errors during server operations and mail sending.\n- **Relation to Bug**: As `socket.error` is now encapsulated by `OSError`, using the latter can simplify exception handling.\n- **Intended Behavior**: Transition to `OSError` to catch these network-related errors more generally.\n\n### `SMTPException` in Mail Backend\n- **Occurrences**: Various parts of the SMTP email sending backend.\n- **Purpose**: Specifically catches SMTP-related exceptions during email operations.\n- **Relation to Bug**: Since `SMTPException` is now a subclass of `OSError`, catching `OSError` could encompass these SMTP issues as well.\n- **Intended Behavior**: There may still be value in catching `smtplib.SMTPException` specifically alongside `OSError` for more granular exception handling unless every such case is deemed to be adequately handled by `OSError` alone.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue and the findings, the intended behavior across all identified parts of the code should be to consolidate exception handling under `OSError` wherever possible without losing specificity where it matters for application logic (such as in SMTP handling). \n\nNext steps would involve preparing refactoring plans for each identified area, ensuring that replacing the exception types does not inadvertently broaden or narrow exception catching in a way that would change application behavior negatively."

Preserve logic for handling cases where I/O errors occur.\n\n2. **File**: `django/http/response.py`\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Update exception handling to use `OSError` instead of `IOError`, ensuring responses continue to gracefully handle file-related errors during processing.\n\n3. **File**: `django/http/request.py`\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Swap `IOError` for `OSError` in file upload and reading operations, maintaining robustness in request handling.\n\n4. **File**: `django/utils/translation/trans_real.py`\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Use `OSError` to handle file-related translation loading issues, keeping functionality to catch and manage translation file errors.\n\n5. **File**: `django/views/debug.py`\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Amend to use `OSError` for managing file access errors in debug views, ensuring error pages render correctly upon issues.\n\n6. **File**: `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py`\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Replace `IOError` with `OSError` for static files storage operations, preserving integrity in static file serving and error logging.\n\n7. **File**: `django/contrib/sessions/backends/file.py`\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Update session file backend to use `OSError` for session file management errors, maintaining session data integrity and error handling.\n\n8. **File**: `django/contrib/gis/geos/libgeos.py`, Function: `load_geos`\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Transition from `EnvironmentError` to `OSError` while loading GEOS libraries, ensuring library path issues are captured under a unified exception.\n\n9. **File**: `django/contrib/gis/gdal/libgdal.py`\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Use `OSError` for handling GDAL library path configurations, keeping the GIS component adaptable to configuration and file access issues.\n\n10. **File**: `django/core/management/commands/runserver.py`\n    - **Intended Behavior**: Change `socket.error` to capture with `OSError` during server run operations, to handle network-related errors uniformly.\n\n11. **File**: `django/core/servers/basehttp.py`\n    - **Intended Behavior**: Update exception handling to `OSError` instead of `socket.error` for HTTP server operations to manage connection and network errors consistently.\n\n12. **File**: `django/core/mail/backends/smtp.py`, Classes: `EmailBackend`, Methods: `open`, `close`, `_send`\n    - **Intended Behavior**: For SMTP operations, adjust to use `OSError` while considering to keep or remove specific catches for `smtplib.SMTPException` based on whether the additional granularity is required for email sending error handling.\n\nFor each location, the refactoring towards `OSError` should verify that the change does not unintentionally alter the catch behavior in a way that could omit previously handled error conditions or introduce new bugs due to broader exception catching."
