With this in mind, the Django code base can be cleaned up.\nFor additional details, see the Python 3.3 release notes:\n\u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#pep-3151-reworking-the-os-and-io-exception-hierarchy\nYou don\u2019t have to worry anymore about choosing the appropriate exception type between OSError, IOError, EnvironmentError, WindowsError, mmap.error, socket.error or select.error. All these exception types are now only one: OSError. The other names are kept as aliases for compatibility reasons.\nAdditionally, since Python 3.4, SMTPException is subclass of OSError . So exception handles catching both can be simplified to just OSError.\n\u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html#smtplib.SMTPException\nSubclass of OSError that is the base exception class for all the other exceptions provided by this module.\nChanged in version 3.4: SMTPException became subclass of OSError\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to identify where in the Django codebase the now-obsolete exception names (`IOError`, `EnvironmentError`, `WindowsError`, `mmap.error`, `socket.error`, `select.error`) are used, as well as any specific handling of `SMTPException` alongside these or as a standalone catch since it now also falls under `OSError`. Given this information, the following API calls will help us gather the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_code(\"IOError\")` - This will help identify occurrences of `IOError` being used throughout the Django project.\n2. `search_code(\"EnvironmentError\")` - This will find where `EnvironmentError` is specifically referenced.\n3. `search_code(\"WindowsError\")` - Since `WindowsError` might be used in platform-specific code, its occurrences are also relevant.\n4. `search_code(\"mmap.error\")` - Finds instances where `mmap.error` exception is explicitly caught.\n5. `search_code(\"socket.error\")` - To see where network-related exceptions are caught using the old `socket.error`.\n6. `search_code(\"select.error\")` - Identifies where `select.error` is used, typically in code dealing with I/O multiplexing.\n7. `search_code(\"SMTPException\")` - Given its change in Python 3.4, we need to see where `SMTPException` is caught, either by itself or with other exceptions.\n\nThese searches will provide a comprehensive view of where the project is utilizing these now-redundant exception names, enabling us to plan and execute the necessary refactoring to use `OSError` exclusively."
