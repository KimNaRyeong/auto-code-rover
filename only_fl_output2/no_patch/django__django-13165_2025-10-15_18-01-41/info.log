</code><intended_behavior>This method should include improved logic for resolving `output_field` types when dealing with mixed types between `AutoField` and `IntegerField`. Specifically, it should either default to a compatible type that can handle both field types without loss of precision or provide a more informative error message that guides the developer towards a resolution. This update would involve refining the type inference process to accommodate scenarios where mixed field types are combined, ensuring that operations do not fail due to unresolved or mismatched output types.</intended_behavior>, <file>django/db/models/expressions.py</file>
