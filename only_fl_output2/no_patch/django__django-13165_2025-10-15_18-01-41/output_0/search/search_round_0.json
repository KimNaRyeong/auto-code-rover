        "content": "For understanding and creating a patch for the described issue, we need to investigate specific classes and methods mentioned in the issue description. Here's how we will proceed using the search APIs:\n\n1. **Understand the `ExpressionWrapper` class**, since the issue revolves around `ExpressionWrapper` losing its `output_field`:\n   - `search_class(\"ExpressionWrapper\")`\n\n2. **Examine the `Expression` class**, as `ExpressionWrapper` might inherit from it, and the error mentions an issue with mixed types requiring an `output_field` resolution:\n   - `search_class(\"Expression\")`\n\n3. **Investigate `AutoField` and `IntegerField` classes**, as the error specifically mentions a conflict between these types. Understanding their interactions could provide insight into how to enforce a unified type or resolve type conflicts in expressions:\n   - `search_class(\"AutoField\")`\n   - `search_class(\"IntegerField\")`\n\n4. **Look into the `_resolve_output_field` method**, since the traceback ends with an exception thrown by this method, it's crucial to understand its logic and why it fails to resolve a unified field type:\n   - `search_method(\"_resolve_output_field\")`\n\n5. **Inspect the code where `select_format` is called**, as the traceback mentions the method `select_format` and it\u2019s essential to see its implementation and the context in which it's called to understand how it interacts with `output_field`:\n   - `search_method(\"select_format\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the classes, methods, and logic involved in the issue. Understanding these components is a crucial step before attempting to write a patch."
