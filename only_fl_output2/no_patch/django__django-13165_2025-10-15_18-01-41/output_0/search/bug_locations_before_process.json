        "intended_behavior": "The `ExpressionWrapper` class should ensure that when expressions involve mixed types, such as `AutoField` and `IntegerField`, it can intelligently resolve or default to an appropriate `output_field` to prevent type mismatch errors. This behavior might require enhancing the logic within the `__init__` method or `_resolve_output_field` method to better handle mixed types or provide clearer exceptions when necessary. The intended solution should maintain compatibility with expressions that already specify an `output_field` explicitly, only intervening in cases where automatic resolution is necessary to prevent errors."

        "intended_behavior": "This method should include improved logic for resolving `output_field` types when dealing with mixed types between `AutoField` and `IntegerField`. Specifically, it should either default to a compatible type that can handle both field types without loss of precision or provide a more informative error message that guides the developer towards a resolution. This update would involve refining the type inference process to accommodate scenarios where mixed field types are combined, ensuring that operations do not fail due to unresolved or mismatched output types."
