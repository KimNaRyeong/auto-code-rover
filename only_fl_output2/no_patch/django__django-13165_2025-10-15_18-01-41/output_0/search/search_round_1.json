        "content": "The collected context provides vital details about the classes and methods involved in the issue related to the `ExpressionWrapper` losing its `output_field` for combined expression without an explicit `output_field` set. Let's analyze the results:\n\n### ExpressionWrapper and Expression Classes\n- **ExpressionWrapper Class**: A subclass of `Expression`, designed to wrap another expression and apply an additional `output_field`. It\u2019s crucial for specifying or converting the type of the resulting expression in Django's ORM.\n- **Expression Class**: Acts as the base class for all expressions in Django's ORM, providing foundational behavior and interfaces for all expression types.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The `ExpressionWrapper` is used to ensure that expressions have a specified output type, which is essential when the result of an expression doesn't inherently match the field type where it's stored or used.\n- Given the issue, the problem might arise from how `ExpressionWrapper` and possibly `Expression` manage or infer the `output_field` property, especially when involving fields of different data types (like `IntegerField` and `AutoField`).\n\n### AutoField and IntegerField Classes\n- **AutoField Class**: A special case of `IntegerField` used for implementing auto-incrementing primary keys. It inherits from `IntegerField`, adding functionality specific to auto-generated values.\n- **IntegerField Class**: Represents an integer field in both the database model and the forms layer.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- The error message \"Expression contains mixed types: IntegerField, AutoField. You must set output_field\" suggests that the underlying issue involves operations between `AutoField` and `IntegerField`, which `ExpressionWrapper` fails to reconcile without an explicit `output_field`.\n- This indicates a type resolution problem within expressions involving fields of differing integer-based types.\n\n### _resolve_output_field Method\n- Found across several files, this method likely plays a critical role in determining the output field type of an expression based on the expressions it contains.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- This method's purpose is to dynamically determine the correct `output_field` to use for an expression, ideally reconciling between different types of integer fields or other field types when necessary.\n- The bug might be tied to this method's handling or mismanagement of type resolution between `AutoField` and `IntegerField` within the `ExpressionWrapper`.\n\n### select_format Method\n- Appearing in multiple files and contexts, this method likely formats expressions for SQL queries based on their defined `output_field`.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- This method's role in converting Django ORM expressions to SQL query components might highlight where the absence or misassignment of an `output_field` causes the query construction process to fail.\n- Given the issue, the failure could occur when attempting to format expressions involving mixed-type operations without a clearly defined `output_field`.\n\n### Intended Behavior\nThe intended behavior, especially considering the contrast between Django 3.0.8 and 3.2 as indicated in the issue, would be for `ExpressionWrapper` to accurately maintain or infer an appropriate `output_field` when combining expressions involving different types of fields, ensuring type consistency without needing explicit definitions in every scenario. This suggests that a regression or change in how output fields are resolved or inferred in Django 3.2 could be at the heart of the issue.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo further diagnose the issue and craft an appropriate patch, analyzing the implementation details of the following would be critical:\n- `_resolve_output_field` in `django/db/models/expressions.py`, to understand how output fields are determined for expressions, especially in mixed-type scenarios.\n- `select_format` in `django/db/models/expressions.py`, to find out how expressions are formatted into SQL given their `output_field` or lack thereof, which might reveal how the system fails when a mixed-type expression lacks an explicit `output_field`.\n\nThis analysis outlines the likely sources of the bug and paths towards constructing a resolution, focusing on type resolution within expressions involving auto-incrementing fields and integers."

This behavior might require enhancing the logic within the `__init__` method or `_resolve_output_field` method (mentioned in search results but not pinpointed to a specific bug location) to better handle mixed types or provide clearer exceptions when necessary. The intended solution should maintain compatibility with expressions that already specify an `output_field` explicitly, only intervening in cases where automatic resolution is necessary to prevent errors.\n\n### Bug Location 2:\n- **File**: `django/db/models/expressions.py`\n- **Method**: `_resolve_output_field`\n\n**Intended Behavior**:\nThis method should include improved logic for resolving `output_field` types when dealing with mixed types between `AutoField` and `IntegerField`. Specifically, it should either default to a compatible type that can handle both field types without loss of precision or provide a more informative error message that guides the developer towards a resolution. This update would involve refining the type inference process to accommodate scenarios where mixed field types are combined, ensuring that operations do not fail due to unresolved or mismatched output types.\n\nThese adjustments would directly address the regression between Django 3.0.8 and 3.2, ensuring that the ORM's expression handling remains robust and flexible across various field type operations."
