Given the objective and the need to raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present or exit with code 0 if fixed, letâ€™s refine the approach in the `reproducer.py` script. To correctly reproduce the issue, we'll ensure the script follows through with the conditions mentioned, handling exceptions appropriately:

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import F, ExpressionWrapper, FloatField, Sum

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Simple Django model setup
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={"default": {"ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3", "NAME": "db.sqlite3"}},
    INSTALLED_APPS=["__main__"],
    TIME_ZONE="UTC",
    USE_TZ=True,
)

django.setup()

class Hindsight(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'

class Mallets(models.Model):
    id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True, blank=True, null=True)
    hindsight = models.ForeignKey(Hindsight, models.DO_NOTHING, blank=True, null=True)
    believer = models.IntegerField(blank=True, null=True)
    issue = models.IntegerField(blank=True, null=True)

    class Meta:
        db_table = 'mallets'
        app_label = '__main__'

try:
    # Create tables for the models
    with django.db.connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:
        # Assuming tables do not exist, Let Django create them
        schema_editor.create_model(Hindsight)
        schema_editor.create_model(Mallets)

    sheer = ExpressionWrapper((F('issue') / F('id')), output_field=FloatField())
    lacquer = ExpressionWrapper(Sum('believer'), output_field=FloatField())

    # Trying the problematic query
    q = Mallets.objects.annotate(sheer=sheer).values('sheer').annotate(lacquer=lacquer).order_by('sheer').first()
    
    # If no exception is thrown by this point, exit with 0 indicating the issue may be fixed
    print("No exception raised. Exiting with code 0.")
    exit(0)
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    # Exit with 1 to indicate execution didn't go as expected due to an error
    exit(1)
```

This script initializes a minimal Django environment, defines two models (including the `Mallets` model from the issue description), and then attempts to execute a query that should exemplify the reported issue. If the problem manifests as described, it will catch the exception and print the stack trace using the `print_stacktrace` function provided.

Please take note:

- This script assumes that the Django environment will be initialized correctly from within the script, which may not match every possible setup exactly.
- Depending on your environment or if you've run similar scripts before, there might be a need to handle existing tables or clean up afterwards.
- The query attempt mirrors the issue description but normalizes it to fit into this scripted approach.

Before running this script, ensure your Python environment is set up with Django installed and is capable of executing Django ORM commands.
