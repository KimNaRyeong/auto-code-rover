Certainly! Below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` which aims to reproduce the issue described. This script will check if the problem occurs in your Django environment and will utilize the `print_stacktrace` function as requested to print the stack trace clearly if the exception is raised.

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import F, ExpressionWrapper, FloatField, Sum, Avg

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Define a simple Django configuration
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={"default": {"ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3", "NAME": "db.sqlite3"}},
    INSTALLED_APPS=["__main__"],
    TIME_ZONE="UTC",
    USE_TZ=True,
)

django.setup()

class Hindsight(models.Model):
    pass

class Mallets(models.Model):
    id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True, blank=True, null=True)
    hindsight = models.ForeignKey(Hindsight, models.DO_NOTHING, blank=True, null=True)
    believer = models.IntegerField(blank=True, null=True)
    damnably = models.IntegerField(blank=True, null=True)
    issue = models.IntegerField(blank=True, null=True)
    glover = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)  # This field type is a guess.
    
    class Meta:
        db_table = 'mallets'

# Django model setup is complete, let's try to reproduce the issue
try:
    # Create tables for the models
    with django.db.connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:
        schema_editor.create_model(Mallets)
        schema_editor.create_model(Hindsight)
    
    # Trying the query that's causing the issue
    sheer = ExpressionWrapper((F('issue') / F('id')), output_field=FloatField())
    # There seems to be a mistake in the original issue description for lacquer
    # Properly defining it just to keep things consistent with the reported issue
    q = Mallets.objects.using('default')
    ret = q.annotate(sheer=sheer).values('sheer').annotate(lacquer=Sum(F('believer'))).order_by('sheer').first()
    assert not ret, "Query did not raise an exception when it should have."
except AssertionError:
    # This means the issue is fixed
    print("The issue is fixed.")
    exit(0)
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)
```

Make sure your Django environment is set up correctly before running this script. This script firstly defines a minimal Django settings configuration and then creates two models that are referenced in the issue description. Following that, it attempts to execute the problematic query. If the query fails due to the described issue, it will print a detailed stack trace. On the other hand, if the script does not raise any exception, it means either Django has been fixed regarding this issue or the environment/setup might not be reproducing the issue as expected.
