This means ensuring that when filtering by month, the calculation of date boundaries (e.g., the first and last day of the month) should consider the user's timezone. Any logic that computes these boundaries must correctly translate dates to avoid including days from the adjacent month due to timezone offsets. Importantly, this fix must preserve existing functionality for users in the UTC timezone or when timezone support is disabled, ensuring backward compatibility."

        "intended_behavior": "Ensure that this utility file's functions, which are likely used across the admin interface for timezone adjustments, accurately handle the conversion of dates to and from the user's timezone in a way that does not inadvertently shift dates across month boundaries. As this file contains timezone utilities used throughout Django, the modifications here should be made cautiously to ensure that changes do not adversely affect other parts of the framework. It should offer a reliable way to perform date boundary calculations that are sensitive to the timezone, perhaps by providing utility functions specifically designed to calculate start and end dates of months within the correct timezone context."
