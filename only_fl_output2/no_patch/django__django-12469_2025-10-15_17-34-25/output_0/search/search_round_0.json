        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue regarding the \"Admin date_hierarchy filter by month displays an extra day at timezone boundary,\" the following API calls would be pertinent:\n\n1. Search the codebase for classes, methods, or snippets that manage or interact with the date hierarchy filter in the admin panel. This feature is likely implemented in a specific part of the Django admin or a similar framework if it's not a vanilla Django project. Let's assume this is a Django project due to the description's phrasing and common issues encountered in Django's admin when handling timezones.\n\n2. The issue specifically mentions that the problem occurs for a user in a non-UTC timezone (e.g., America/Los_Angeles). This implies we may need to look for timezone handling code, particularly where the date hierarchy is calculated or rendered.\n\nGiven these considerations, the following search API calls could help us gather the needed context:\n\n- `search_method(\"get_next_by_date\")`\n- `search_method(\"get_prev_by_date\")`\n- `search_class(\"DateHierarchyListFilter\")`\n- `search_code(\"tzinfo\")`\n- `search_code(\"date_hierarchy\")`\n\nThese searches aim to locate:\n- The mechanism Django admin uses to calculate the next and previous dates in the date hierarchy filter (potentially custom methods like `get_next_by_date` or `get_prev_by_date` if they exist).\n- The class responsible for rendering the date hierarchy filter in the admin interface, which is likely to be `DateHierarchyListFilter` or similarly named within Django's codebase.\n- Any code snippets that explicitly mention timezone information (`tzinfo`) in the context of date handling, since the issue likely arises from timezone-related calculations.\n- Direct references to `date_hierarchy` in the code to see how dates are being processed and rendered in the admin UI, which could lead us to where the bug occurs."
