I understand the request for a corrected approach to manually reproduce the issue and correctly incorporate the information from my previous mistake. Given the context, here's a rewritten standalone Python file named `reproducer.py`. This version aims to accurately reproduce the specified issue, including correctly handling exceptions and using the provided function for printing detailed stack traces. Note that this approach presumes the issue is specifically about a type error with `lambdify` when used with numpy arrays, as described in the initial problem statement.

```python
import numpy as np
from sympy import MatrixSymbol, lambdify

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    X0 = MatrixSymbol('X0', 4, 4)  # Corrected size to match 'xx'
    xx = np.random.rand(4, 4) 
    # xx = np.random.randint(10, size=(4, 4))  # Using floating point matrix as per the original issue
    X0Inv = X0**-1

    try:
        np.linalg.inv(xx)  # Verifying that numpy's inversion doesn't fail
        symInv = lambdify(X0, X0Inv, 'numpy')  # Explicitly mention 'numpy' module
        result = symInv(xx)  # Attempt to perform the inversion using sympy
        assert result is not None, "Failed to invert the matrix using sympy."
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue present: lambdify failed with TypeError.") from e
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e  # Re-raise any other unexpected exceptions

    print("Inversion successful. Issue fixed or not reproducible.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError:
        # Catching AssertionError to indicate the presence of the issue specifically.
        exit(1)
    except Exception:
        # Catch any other exception indicating different problems.
        exit(1)
    else:
        exit(0)  # Exit with 0 to indicate success/no issue.
```

This script should be saved as `reproducer.py` and can be executed in an environment where both numpy and sympy are installed. It first attempts to invert a matrix using numpy to ensure the operation is valid. Then, it tries the same with sympy through `lambdify`. It captures `TypeError` specifically to handle the reported issue and uses the provided `print_stacktrace` function to offer detailed error information in case of failure.
