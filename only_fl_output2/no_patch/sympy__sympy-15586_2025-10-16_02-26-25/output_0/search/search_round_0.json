        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about the use and integration of `numpy`, `sympy`, and specifically the `lambdify` function within our codebase. The `lambdify` function is used to convert SymPy expressions to lambda functions, which can then be evaluated numerically. The error indicates a type issue or a misuse of the `lambdify` function with numpy arrays. Therefore, we should focus our search on how `MatrixSymbol`, `lambdify`, and potentially matrix inversion are handled in our project.\n\nHere are relevant API calls to gather the required context:\n\n1. **Search for `MatrixSymbol` class usage**: Since the issue involves `MatrixSymbol` from `sympy`, understanding its usage within the project might offer insights into potential integration or compatibility issues.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"MatrixSymbol\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for `lambdify` function usage**: Given the issue arises during the use of `lambdify`, we need to examine how this function is employed throughout the project. This can reveal common patterns or specific configurations that avoid the observed error.\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"lambdify\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for matrix inversion code snippets**: The error occurs while attempting to invert a matrix, thus reviewing how matrix inversion is typically performed in the project, especially in conjunction with `sympy` and `numpy`, might uncover related practices or issues.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"np.linalg.inv\")\n   search_code(\"X0**-1\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive overview of how the relevant classes, methods, and operations are implemented across the project, enabling us to pinpoint the source of the error or identify existing patterns that circumvent it."
