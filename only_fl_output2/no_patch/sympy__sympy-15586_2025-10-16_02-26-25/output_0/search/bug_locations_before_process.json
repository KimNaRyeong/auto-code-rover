        "intended_behavior": "The `lambdify` function should efficiently and correctly convert symbolic expressions, specifically those involving matrix inversions, into lambda functions that can handle numerical inputs (like NumPy arrays) without type errors. To resolve the issue, `lambdify` must ensure that the conversion from symbolic matrix operations to numerical computations correctly interprets the matrix inversion in a way that NumPy can execute, especially for floating-point matrices. This might involve additional checks or transformations in the code section that prepares the lambda function, to ensure compatibility with the numerical libraries being used. The adjustment should not impact the general capabilities of `lambdify` for non-matrix expressions or its performance, merely extend its robustness in handling symbolic matrix operations."
