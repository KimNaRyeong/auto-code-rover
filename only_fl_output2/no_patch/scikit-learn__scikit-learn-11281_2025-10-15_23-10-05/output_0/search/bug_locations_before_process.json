This would not change any underlying functionality but might include updating documentation and possibly parameter naming (if a project-wide refactor is deemed appropriate) to reflect this standardized terminology."

The intended behavior here is to facilitate mixture models to not only fit to the data but also return the labels for the data points immediately, mirroring clusterer functionality and making the API more uniform."
