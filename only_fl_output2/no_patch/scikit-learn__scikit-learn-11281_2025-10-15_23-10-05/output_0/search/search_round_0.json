They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers. But they are unlike clusterers in API:\n* they have an `n_components` parameter, with identical purpose to `n_clusters`\n* they do not store the `labels_` of the training data\n* they do not have a `fit_predict` method\nAnd they are almost entirely documented separately.\nShould we make the MMs more like clusterers?\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we should gather information on how mixture models are implemented in the project and how their interface compares to that of clusterers. This includes identifying the relevant classes, methods, and properties that pertain to mixture models and potentially clusterers. Given the specifics mentioned in the issue:\n\n1. Find the classes related to mixture models and clusterers to understand their interface and implementation differences.\n2. Examine the `n_components` parameter in mixture models and compare it with the `n_clusters` parameter in clusterer classes, if that exists.\n3. Check for the existence or definition of the `labels_` attribute and `fit_predict` method in mixture model classes.\n\nLet's perform a series of API calls for this purpose:\n\n1. **Search for mixture model classes**: It's mentioned that mixture models (MMs) are a primary focus. We can start by identifying these classes.\n   - `search_class(\"MixtureModel\")`\n   \n2. **Search for a clusterer class**: Since clusterers are referenced for comparison, understanding a generic or specific clusterer implementation might be useful.\n   - `search_class(\"Clusterer\")`\n   \n3. **Search for the `n_components` parameter within a likely mixture model class**: To see how `n_components` is used and if it parallels `n_clusters` in concept.\n   - `search_code(\"n_components\")`\n   \n4. **Investigate the existence of `labels_` in mixture models**: Since storing `labels_` is common in clusterers but seemingly absent in MMs.\n   - `search_code(\"labels_\")`\n   \n5. **Explore the existence of `fit_predict` method**: This is to understand how mixture models are applied versus how clusterers are, focusing on the inductive approach.\n   - `search_method(\"fit_predict\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point to understand how mixture models differ from clusterers in terms of their API and structural design, which will help in evaluating the feasibility and implications of making them more alike."
