        "intended_behavior": "The `set_output` method within `_SetOutputMixin` should be extended or adjusted to include a mechanism for preserving the original data types (`dtypes`) of input columns when configuring output to be a pandas DataFrame. This might involve introducing a new configurable property or parameter that specifies whether `dtypes` preservation is requested. When this feature is enabled, the method should ensure that the metadata regarding the original `dtypes` is passed along to wherever the actual DataFrame conversion occurs, likely impacting how `_wrap_in_pandas_container` is called or behaves."

        "intended_behavior": "`_wrap_in_pandas_container` needs to be enhanced to optionally accept `dtypes` information of the original input DataFrame. It should use this information to apply the correct `dtypes` to the output DataFrame, after it has been created or when modifying an existing one. This involves inspecting the `dtypes` argument (which could be None, to preserve current functionality) and applying the specified `dtypes` to the DataFrame before returning it. Care should be taken to ensure that this dtype application does not inadvertently cause data or precision loss in cases where the dtype conversion is not lossless. This would directly address the issue by enabling `dtypes` to be preserved across transformations that use the `_SetOutputMixin` to manage their output."
