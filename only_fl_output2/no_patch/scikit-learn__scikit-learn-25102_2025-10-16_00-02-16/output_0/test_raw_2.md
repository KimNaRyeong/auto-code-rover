Here's how you could write a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` to check for the DataFrame output dtypes preservation issue. This script carefully follows the provided format and instructions:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        import numpy as np
        from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
        from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, chi2

        # Load the Iris dataset as a pandas DataFrame
        X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)

        # Change the dtype of two columns and add a categorical column
        X = X.astype({"petal width (cm)": np.float16, "petal length (cm)": np.float16})
        X['species'] = y.astype("category")

        # Initialize and fit the SelectKBest
        selector = SelectKBest(score_func=chi2, k=2)
        X_new = selector.fit_transform(X, y)

        # Task to reproduce the issue: Check if dtypes are preserved
        assert X_new.dtypes['petal length (cm)'] == np.float16, "Dtype for 'petal length (cm)' was not preserved as np.float16."
        assert X_new.dtypes['species'] == 'category', "Dtype for 'species' was not preserved as category."
        
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

    print("No issues detected. Dtypes are preserved as expected.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script is crafted to check specifically for the dtype preservation issue described. It sets up a scenario where the `SelectKBest` transformer from `sklearn` is expected to preserve the dtype of selected features after transformation. The dtypes of interest are `np.float16` for a numerical column and the `category` dtype for a synthesized "species" column based on the Iris dataset labels.

Upon failure to preserve dtypes as asserted, the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace to help identify the problem's origin. Upon success or if any other exception is encountered during execution, appropriate feedback is printed, and the script exits with code 1 to indicate failure, or code 0 for success.
