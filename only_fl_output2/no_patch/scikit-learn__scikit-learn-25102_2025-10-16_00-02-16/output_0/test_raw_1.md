Given the feedback and the constraints, let's try to implement a script that effectively captures the described issue. Since there was a misunderstanding related to the environment setup before, we'll improve clarity and focus on reproducibility with proper error management.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        import numpy as np
        import pandas as pd
        from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
        from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest
        from sklearn.feature_selection import chi2

        # Load the Iris dataset as a pandas DataFrame
        X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)
        
        # Change the dtype of two columns and add a categorical column
        X = X.astype({"petal width (cm)": np.float16, "petal length (cm)": np.float16})
        X['species'] = pd.Categorical(y)

        # Initialize and fit the SelectKBest
        selector = SelectKBest(score_func=chi2, k=2)
        
        # Assuming fit_transform does not preserve dtypes by default
        X_new = selector.fit_transform(X, y)

        # Checking if dtypes are preserved for the selected column
        assert X_new.dtypes['petal length (cm)'] == np.float16, "Dtype for 'petal length (cm)' was not preserved."
        assert X_new.dtypes['species'] == 'category', "Dtype for 'species' was not preserved."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

    print("No issues detected. Dtypes are preserved as expected.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script aims to directly reproduce the issue reported by attempting to assert that data types (`dtypes`) are preserved for certain columns after transformation with `SelectKBest`. The `print_stacktrace` function is integrated to capture and display any exceptions raised explicitly, ensuring that any issues related to the environment setup or execution logic are visibly reported.

Please note, the outcome is designed to raise an `AssertionError` when data types are NOT preserved, which matches the issue's description. If `dtypes` are preserved (indicating a fix or different behavior in the library), the script will exit normally with a message indicating no issues detected.
