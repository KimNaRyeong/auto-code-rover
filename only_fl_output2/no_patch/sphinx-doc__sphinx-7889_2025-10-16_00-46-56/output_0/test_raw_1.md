Given the error output you encountered during the test execution, it's clear that an environment-related issue occurred, specifically a `ModuleNotFoundError`. This indicates that `docutils`, a dependency required by Sphinx, was not installed in the environment in which the test script ran. It is crucial to ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed for the script to function as expected. However, addressing your original request while acknowledging this context, let's revise the script. This version will include error handling for missing modules and expressly communicate such issues.

```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def simulate_docs_generation():
    """
    Simulate the process of generating docs which causes the TypeError in Autodoc
    when encountering a generic-typed class.
    """
    try:
        from sphinx.ext.autodoc.mock import _make_subclass
    except ModuleNotFoundError as e:
        print("Necessary module not found:", e.name)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

    try:
        from typing import TypeVar, Generic
    except ModuleNotFoundError as e:
        print("Necessary module not found:", e.name)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

    T = TypeVar('T')

    class GenericClass(Generic[T]):
        pass

    try:
        # This mimics the behavior that causes the TypeError inside Autodoc
        mock_subclass = _make_subclass(GenericClass, 'MockGenericClass')
        return True
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False
    except Exception as e:
        print("Unexpected error:", e)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

def main():
    if not simulate_docs_generation():
        raise AssertionError("Autodoc fails to handle generically-typed classes.")
    print("Success: Issue is resolved.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    sys.exit(0)
```

This revised `reproducer.py` script isolates the simulation of the doc generation error and adds explicit handling for `ModuleNotFoundError`, which was seen in your test run. If vital modules (`sphinx.ext.autodoc.mock` or `typing`) are missing, it will gracefully print an informative message and the stack trace. Additionally, if the specific `TypeError` is caught during the mocked subclass creation (mimicking the original issue), it will print the stack trace for that error as well, helping to debug the problem. Finally, if the error is not raised, the script considers the issue resolved and exits with code `0`.

Before running this script, ensure that all dependencies are installed in your environment, including Sphinx and its extensions, as well as `docutils`. You might want to set up a virtual environment for this purpose to avoid conflicts with other projects or system-wide packages.
