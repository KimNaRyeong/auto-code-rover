To create a standalone script that reproduces the issue mentioned, we'll simulate the error that occurs within the Autodoc extension when it encounters a generically-typed class. This script, `reproducer.py`, should be placed in the root directory of the project mentioned in the issue (next to `docs`, `screenpy`, and other directories). When run, it should fail with an `AssertionError` when the Autodoc extension cannot handle generically-typed classes correctly, and print a detailed stack trace of the issue.

```python
import sys
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def simulate_docs_generation():
    """
    Simulate the process of generating docs which causes the TypeError in Autodoc
    when encountering a generic-typed class.
    """
    from sphinx.ext.autodoc.mock import _make_subclass
    from typing import TypeVar, Generic

    T = TypeVar('T')

    class GenericClass(Generic[T]):
        pass

    try:
        # This mimics the behavior that causes the TypeError inside autodoc
        mock_subclass = _make_subclass(GenericClass, 'MockGenericClass')
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False
    return True


def main():
    result = simulate_docs_generation()
    assert result, "Autodoc fails to handle generically-typed classes."
    print("Success: Issue is resolved.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.exit(main())
```
This script will:

1. Import necessary modules and define a function to print a stack trace for exceptions.
2. Define a function `simulate_docs_generation()` that tries to mimic the process within Sphinx Autodoc's documentation generation that leads to the `TypeError` when it attempts to handle a generically-typed class. It specifically simulates the failure point by calling `_make_subclass()` method with a generic class.
3. In `main()`, it will call `simulate_docs_generation()` and assert its success. If the generation fails (due to the unhandled `TypeError`), an assertion error will be raised, and a stack trace will be printed.
4. Run `main()` and ensure proper script termination based on the outcome of the `simulate_docs_generation()` result.

Run this script in the root directory of the specified project by executing `python3 reproducer.py`. If the issue is still present, the script will result in an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace. If the issue has been resolved (e.g., by a fix in the Autodoc extension or in how the project declares generically-typed classes), the script will exit with code 0, indicating success.
