See the attached log: [sphinx-err-325ndteh.log](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/files/4842672/sphinx-err-325ndteh.log)\n**To Reproduce**\n```\n$ git https://github.com/perrygoy/screenpy.git\n$ cd screenpy/docs\n$ python -m venv env\n$ source env/bin/activate\n$ pip install sphinx pyhamcrest selenium typing_extensions\n$ make html\n```\nObserve the docs command fails with a TypeError.\n**Expected behavior**\nDocs can still be built when generics are involved.\n**Your project**\nhttps://github.com/perrygoy/screenpy.git\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Mac 10.15.5 (19F101)\n- Python version: 3.7.7\n- Sphinx version: 3.1.1\n- Sphinx extensions:  sphinx.ext.autodoc, sphinx.ext.intersphinx, sphinx.ext.coverage, sphinx.ext.ifconfig, sphinx.ext.napoleon\n**Additional context**\nThis might just be me not knowing how to make Sphinx-friendly generic typing, if that's the case please let me know!\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue regarding the TypeError when Sphinx Autodoc's `mock._make_subclass` interacts with generic-typed classes, we need to narrow down to the relevant parts of both the Sphinx source code and the project described in the issue. Specifically, we need to understand how `mock._make_subclass` is implemented in Sphinx and how generically-typed classes are defined in the `screenpy` project that could cause the TypeError. Here's how we'll proceed:\n\n- We'll search for the implementation of `mock._make_subclass` within the Sphinx source code to understand its behavior and why it might struggle with generically-typed classes.\n- We'll look for examples of generically-typed classes within the `screenpy` project to see how they are defined and used.\n\nHere are the API calls we'll make:\n\n1. `search_method(method_name: \"mock._make_subclass\")` - This will help us understand the implementation details of the method that's failing.\n\n2. `search_code(code_str: \"typing.Generic\")` - Since the issue relates to \"generic-typed classes,\" we'll search for usage of the `Generic` base class from Python's `typing` module across the `screenpy` project. This can give us concrete examples of such classes in the project.\n\nThese steps will provide the necessary context to identify why the TypeError occurs and how it might be resolved."
