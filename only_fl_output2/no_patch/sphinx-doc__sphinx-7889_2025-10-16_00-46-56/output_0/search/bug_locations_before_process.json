        "intended_behavior": "The `_stringify_py36` function should correctly handle all generic types, including those introduced in Python 3.7+ and the use of `TypeVar`. The correct handling involves ensuring that type variables (`TypeVar`) and generics are converted to their string representation without causing a `TypeError` when attempting to concatenate a `str` with a `TypeVar`. This would involve checking the types of the objects it is attempting to concatenate or format into strings and applying the appropriate conversion or handling method. The behavior should allow the Sphinx Autodoc extension to seamlessly generate documentation for classes that utilize Python's typing system, including generically-typed classes, without crashing or throwing errors. This means the function, when encountering an annotation that is an instance of `typing.GenericMeta` or similar, must ensure that each parameter of the generic class (for example, the types specified in `List[int]` or `Dict[str, SomeClass]`) is converted into a readable string format. This also includes handling more complex generic types that might use `TypeVar` in definitions, ensuring these are represented in a way that is both accurate and useful in documentation, without raising TypeErrors. To achieve this, the function might need to be extended or modified to specifically check for and correctly handle `TypeVar` instances, possibly using their `__name__` attribute or another method for safely stringifying these objects. Additionally, ensuring compatibility across different Python versions (especially considering changes in the typing module across Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and onwards) should be a part of the intended behavior, given the specific mention of Python 3.5.2+ compatibility in the snippet provided."
