Here's how we'll proceed:\n\n- We'll search for the implementation of `mock._make_subclass` within the Sphinx source code to understand its behavior and why it might struggle with generically-typed classes.\n- We'll look for examples of generically-typed classes within the `screenpy` project to see how they are defined and used.\n\nHere are the API calls we'll make:\n\n1. `search_method(method_name: \"mock._make_subclass\")` - This will help us understand the implementation details of the method that's failing.\n\n2. `search_code(code_str: \"typing.Generic\")` - Since the issue relates to \"generic-typed classes,\" we'll search for usage of the `Generic` base class from Python's `typing` module across the `screenpy` project.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context gives us some valuable information:\n\n### Analysis of the Search Results\n\n- The `search_method(\"mock._make_subclass\")` did not return any results. This could mean several things:\n  - The method name might have been misspelled in the issue description.\n  - Sphinx might not expose this method directly in its API or it is part of a dependency not scoped in the Sphinx project itself.\n  - The method might be dynamically defined or patched in, making it difficult to find with a simple search.\n\n- The search for `typing.Generic` led us to an interesting snippet in `sphinx/util/typing.py`, specifically in a function called `_stringify_py36`. This function seems to be responsible for converting typing annotations into their string representations, with special handling for generics (as noted by the handling of `typing.GenericMeta`, which is a base class for generic types in Python versions before 3.7).\n\n### Answers to the Analytical Questions\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?** - The `_stringify_py36` function converts type annotations, including those for generic types, into string representations. This is likely part of Sphinx's mechanism for generating documentation from type annotations.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?** - Given that the issue is related to a `TypeError` when documenting generically-typed classes, it's plausible that Sphinx's handling (or mishandling) of these type annotations could be at the root of the problem. Specifically, if Sphinx tries to concatenate a `TypeVar` directly with a string without properly converting it first, that could lead to the observed TypeError.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?** - Ideally, `_stringify_py36` should gracefully handle all generic types, including those involving `TypeVar`, converting them into a readable string representation without raising exceptions. This would allow Sphinx to document generically-typed classes seamlessly.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context\n\nGiven these insights, a useful next step would involve understanding more precisely how Sphinx documents classes and how it interacts with type annotations. Since the initial search for `mock._make_subclass` returned no results, it might be beneficial to explore other parts of Sphinx that deal directly with class documentation or the handling of type annotations. Some possible next steps could include:\n\n- Investigating other functionalities within `sphinx/util/typing.py` or similar files for clues on how Sphinx processes type annotations for documentation purposes.\n- Looking into Sphinx's Autodoc extension source code more directly, focusing on how it inspects classes and their annotations to generate documentation. This might not be directly accessible through a simple method name search but could involve exploring files related to the Autodoc extension.\n\nGiven the analysis, these steps could potentially uncover more about the underlying cause of the issue reported."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

The correct handling involves ensuring that type variables (`TypeVar`) and generics are converted to their string representation without causing a `TypeError` when attempting to concatenate a `str` with a `TypeVar`. This would involve checking the types of the objects it is attempting to concatenate or format into strings and applying the appropriate conversion or handling method. The behavior should allow the Sphinx Autodoc extension to seamlessly generate documentation for classes that utilize Python's typing system, including generically-typed classes, without crashing or throwing errors. \n\n  This means the function, when encountering an annotation that is an instance of `typing.GenericMeta` or similar, must ensure that each parameter of the generic class (for example, the types specified in `List[int]` or `Dict[str, SomeClass]`) is converted into a readable string format. This also includes handling more complex generic types that might use `TypeVar` in definitions, ensuring these are represented in a way that is both accurate and useful in documentation, without raising TypeErrors.\n\n  To achieve this, the function might need to be extended or modified to specifically check for and correctly handle `TypeVar` instances, possibly using their `__name__` attribute or another method for safely stringifying these objects. Additionally, ensuring compatibility across different Python versions (especially considering changes in the typing module across Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and onwards) should be a part of the intended behavior, given the specific mention of Python 3.5.2+ compatibility in the snippet provided."
