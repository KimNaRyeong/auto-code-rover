The same for example goes for e.g. specifying access rights for files (`chmod`)\n**Screenshots**\n![Screenshot 2020-09-30 at 14 32 21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55204/94685496-c777ed00-0329-11eb-9ce1-d6f452d790ad.png)\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Mac OS X 10.14.6\n- Python version: 3.8.5\n- Sphinx version: 3.2.1\n- Sphinx extensions:  None\n- Extra tools: None\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary context to address the reported issue about Sphinx changing number systems for function default arguments in documentation, we need to look into how Sphinx generates documentation for function signatures, especially regarding the rendering of default argument values. Since the issue specifically mentions the default arguments in hexadecimal being incorrectly displayed in decimal, our focus should be on the parts of the Sphinx codebase responsible for parsing and rendering those default arguments.\n\nLet's break down the API calls to focus on:\n\n1. **Search for Sphinx's function signature processing**: Since the issue involves how Sphinx renders function signatures, we should look for methods or classes in Sphinx's codebase responsible for handling and rendering function signatures. Specifically, we want to identify where it parses the default values of arguments.\n\n2. **Search for Sphinx's documentation rendering components**: The bug might be located in the components that convert docstrings or specially formatted comments into HTML. Identifying the classes or methods responsible for this rendering could help us find where the numerical conversion issue occurs.\n\nGiven this, here are the specific API calls we might need:\n\n- `search_method(\"function_signature\")`: This could help us find methods responsible for parsing and handling function signatures.\n\n- `search_method(\"render\")`: Since the issue is related to rendering HTML documentation, methods involved in rendering could be relevant.\n\n- `search_class(\"Signature\")`: There might be a class specifically designed for handling signatures.\n\n- `search_code(\"default argument\")`: This could locate where default arguments are processed or handled in the codebase.\n\nThese searches aim to find relevant segments of the Sphinx project that deal with handling function signatures and rendering them into documentation, which are likely areas where the reported bug might reside."
