The same for example goes for e.g. specifying access rights for files (`chmod`)\n**Screenshots**\n![Screenshot 2020-09-30 at 14 32 21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55204/94685496-c777ed00-0329-11eb-9ce1-d6f452d790ad.png)\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Mac OS X 10.14.6\n- Python version: 3.8.5\n- Sphinx version: 3.2.1\n- Sphinx extensions:  None\n- Extra tools: None\n</issue>"

        "content": "Let's analyze the collected context from the search results in relation to the reported issue with Sphinx treating hexadecimal number system arguments as decimal in generated documentation.\n\n### Analysis of `Signature` Class from `sphinx/util/inspect.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   The `Signature` class seems to represent a function or method signature. It has capabilities to handle the arguments, return values, and annotations of a function. Methods like `format_args` suggest it formats argument lists for display, which might involve converting default values into strings.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   Since the issue is about how default argument values, especially in hexadecimal, are displayed in the documentation, this class could be where the actual formatting or representation of those default values is handled before being converted to HTML. The `format_args` method, which probably includes formatting of default values, is a likely place where the hexadecimal to decimal conversion issue occurs.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   The intended behavior would be to maintain the numeral system of default arguments as they are defined in the code (e.g., keeping hexadecimal values in hexadecimal) when generating documentation. It requires the `format_args` method (or related methods in this class) to intelligently recognize and preserve the numeral system of default arguments.\n\n### Analysis of Code Snippet from `sphinx/domains/python.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   This code snippet seems to be from a method `_pseudo_parse_arglist`, concerned with parsing argument lists for functions. The comment mentions handling \"optional\" annotations and the peculiarity with splitting at commas, even in string literals, which indicates a form of syntactical analysis is performed on argument lists.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   The parsing of argument lists, including how default values are interpreted, could be a step where the numeral system of arguments is initially handled. If the parser incorrectly normalizes hexadecimal values to decimal, or simply captures numerical values in a common format that doesn't respect the original numeral system, this might lead to loss of the numeral system context, which could affect how these values are later rendered in the documentation.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   The intended behavior would be to accurately parse and preserve the original numeral system of default argument values during the parsing stage. This implies that if an argument is specified in hexadecimal, this numeral system information should be retained and made available to later stages of documentation rendering.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the analysis, it seems pertinent to further investigate the methods within the `Signature` class, particularly those related to argument formatting such as `format_args`, to determine how default values are transformed into strings. It's also crucial to explore how parsed arguments, especially their numeral system, are managed throughout the documentation generation process. A more detailed examination of `_pseudo_parse_arglist` in `sphinx/domains/python.py` could reveal how numeral systems of arguments are initially captured and potentially altered.\n\nTo understand how the numeral system is preserved or altered during the documentation rendering process, the following additional API calls could be valuable:\n\n- `get_code_around_line(\"sphinx/util/inspect.py\", [line number of format_args], 10)`: To get more context on how `Signature.format_args` works.\n- `get_code_around_line(\"sphinx/domains/python.py\", 220, 10)`: To dive deeper into the argument parsing logic in `_pseudo_parse_arglist`.\n\nThese calls aim to identify where the conversion from hexadecimal to decimal (if indeed this happens at these stages) occurs, and how these functions could be modified to preserve the numeral system as intended."

Specifically, if a default value is provided in hexadecimal, it should retain its hexadecimal format in the generated documentation. This preserves the readability and intention behind the use of specific numeral systems, such as hexadecimal for color codes or file permissions. To achieve this, the method could include a check for the type of numeral system used in the default value and format it accordingly. This change must maintain the existing functionality for any non-hexadecimal values, ensuring that the method remains compatible with all current use cases.\n\n- **Location 2:** File: `sphinx/domains/python.py`, Method: `_pseudo_parse_arglist`\n  \n  **Intended Behavior:**\n  The parsing logic within this function should be refined to accurately capture and preserve the numeral system of default argument values during parsing. If an argument default is specified in hexadecimal format, this detail should not be lost or converted to decimal in the process. Rather, the parsing process should recognize and tag the numeral system of the value for accurate representation later in the documentation rendering process. This improvement aims to ensure that the documentation accurately reflects the source code's intention, improving clarity for developers. The behavior of parsing and recognizing non-numeral system related aspects should remain unaffected by these changes."
