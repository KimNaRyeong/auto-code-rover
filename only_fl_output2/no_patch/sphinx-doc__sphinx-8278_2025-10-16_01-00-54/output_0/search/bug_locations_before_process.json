        "intended_behavior": "This method should be enhanced to preserve the numeral system of default values when formatting them for documentation. Specifically, if a default value is provided in hexadecimal, it should retain its hexadecimal format in the generated documentation. This preserves the readability and intention behind the use of specific numeral systems, such as hexadecimal for color codes or file permissions. To achieve this, the method could include a check for the type of numeral system used in the default value and format it accordingly. This change must maintain the existing functionality for any non-hexadecimal values, ensuring that the method remains compatible with all current use cases."

        "intended_behavior": "The parsing logic within this function should be refined to accurately capture and preserve the numeral system of default argument values during parsing. If an argument default is specified in hexadecimal format, this detail should not be lost or converted to decimal in the process. Rather, the parsing process should recognize and tag the numeral system of the value for accurate representation later in the documentation rendering process. This improvement aims to ensure that the documentation accurately reflects the source code's intention, improving clarity for developers. The behavior of parsing and recognizing non-numeral system related aspects should remain unaffected by these changes."
