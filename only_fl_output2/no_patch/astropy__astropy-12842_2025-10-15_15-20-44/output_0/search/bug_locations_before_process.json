However, it appears this method may be outright rejecting these datatypes in the user's context, leading to an inability to read files created with previous versions of Astropy. The intended behavior should be adjusted to ensure that `datetime64` and potentially other common datatypes are explicitly accepted and correctly handled, preserving backward compatibility with older files."

        "intended_behavior": "While the `read` method primarily delegates to underlying functionality to parse the input file, adjustments may be necessary to accommodate `datetime64` columns more gracefully. The intended behavior here would involve adding or refining preprocessing steps that check for and adapt `datetime64` columns before they are processed by the core ECSV reading logic. This could involve converting such columns to a recognized format prior to invoking the ECSV reader or implementing a more sophisticated detection mechanism to handle different datatypes."
