        "intended_behavior": "The `_remake_table` method is crucial for schema alterations that SQLite cannot accomplish with simple ALTER TABLE commands. To resolve the issue with quoted table names, this method should ensure that the handling of such names is consistent with SQLite's syntax requirements. Specifically, when generating SQL commands that involve table names (e.g., in the `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT INTO`, and `ALTER TABLE` commands within this method), the method must correctly handle the presence of quotes around table names. If a table name is already quoted (indicating a special character or case-sensitivity requirement), the system should not add additional quotes around it, which could lead to syntax errors. The intended behavior is to either detect and preserve existing quotes or standardize the quoting process so that table names are only quoted as needed by SQLite's syntax, without introducing errors."

        "intended_behavior": "The `add_field` method should ensure that any SQL commands it constructs or invokes (directly or indirectly) correctly account for quoted table names. This includes calls to methods like `_remake_table` or any SQL statement executions that involve constructing `CREATE TABLE` or altering table structures. When quoted table names are involved, special attention is needed to ensure that the quoting is handled in a way that aligns with SQL standards, particularly for SQLite. The method should accurately identify whether a table name is already quoted to avoid duplicating quotes, which could cause syntax errors. The corrections here should maintain all existing functionality, specifically the ability to add fields to a model's schema, including handling many-to-many relationships and auto-created through tables, without malfunctioning because of quotation issues."
