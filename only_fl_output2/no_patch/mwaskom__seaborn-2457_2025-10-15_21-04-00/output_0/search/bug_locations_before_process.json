        "intended_behavior": "Within the `lineplot` function, the handling of the `ci=None` parameter should explicitly trigger a deprecation warning, informing the user that `ci` is deprecated in favor of `errorbar`. This behavior ensures users are aware of the deprecated parameter and encourages migration to the new parameter. The implementation should then correctly interpret `ci=None` as `errorbar=None`, maintaining the functional equivalence while transitioning towards the updated parameter system. This means that inside the function, before any plotting occurs, there needs to be logic that checks if `ci` is explicitly set to `None` and, if so, sets `errorbar` to `None` as well while ensuring that no confidence interval is drawn on the plot. This behavior preserves the existing functionality by ensuring that users can still disable the confidence interval display using the new `errorbar` parameter, aligning with the expected outcome when someone passes `ci=None`. The code segment around lines 617-618, where `_deprecate_ci(errorbar, ci)` is called, is likely where this modification needs to happen. Enhancing the `_deprecate_ci` function or the conditions around its call to include a warning for this specific use case of `ci=None` and correctly setting `errorbar=None` would likely address the issue."
