        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about where and how `lineplot` is defined and used within the codebase. Since `lineplot` might be a function in a larger library (most likely seaborn, as suggested by `sns.lineplot`), we'll first look for the definition or usage of this function. Given the nature of the problem, understanding how `ci` is currently processed within `lineplot` is crucial. Based on this, I'll perform the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"lineplot\")`: To locate the definition or references of `lineplot` method in the codebase.\n2. `search_code(\"ci=None\")`: To find instances where `ci` parameter is being set to `None`, which might give us a broader usage context in different functions or methods, including `lineplot`."
