Revising the approach to create a script that fulfills the specific requirements given, let's design a `reproducer.py` with an emphasis on catching the specific issue described: ensuring seaborn's `lineplot` throws a warning when `ci=None` is passed and internally treats it as if `errorbar=None` was passed.

For this script to effectively reproduce the issue and follow the outlined requirements, it will include mechanisms to:
- Attempt creating a lineplot with `ci=None`
- Fail if this operation does not raise a warning or correctly handles the `ci` argument
- Utilize `warnings` module to capture runtime warnings that should include the expected warning about `ci=None`

```python
# reproducer.py
import seaborn as sns
import warnings
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Catch runtime warnings as an exception
    with warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as w:
        # Ensure all warnings are triggered
        warnings.simplefilter("always")
        # Attempt to create a lineplot with ci=None
        sns.lineplot(x=[1, 1, 2, 2], y=[1, 2, 3, 4], ci=None)
        plt.close('all')  # Prevent display in non-GUI environments

        # No warnings raised as assumed issue present
        if not w:
            raise AssertionError("Expecting a warning when `ci=None`, but no warning was raised.")

        # Assuming that a specific warning text would indicate the correct handling of the issue
        warning_texts = [str(warn.message) for warn in w]
        correct_warning = any("reformatted args to have `errorbar=None`" in message for message in warning_texts)
        if not correct_warning:
            raise AssertionError("Warning does not indicate args were reformatted correctly.")

        # If we reach this point, assume the issue is fixed
        print("The issue appears to be fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Ensure the script exits with nonzero exit code if an exception is raised
        import sys
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        # Exit with code 0 if everything is fine
        sys.exit(0)
```

This revision explicitly checks for a warning, attempting to reflect the described issue more accurately. Note, however, that this script assumes a specific warning text exists, which might not be the case. In reality, the exact warning text should be adjusted to match seaborn's implementation or expected behavior.
