        "content": "To effectively address the reported issue, it is critical to understand how and where the change from underscores to dashes for Python domain IDs (such as function anchors) was implemented. This involves examining the relevant parts of the codebase where domain objects like Python functions are being processed and their anchors generated. Given the description of the issue, we'd likely need to investigate the Sphinx code related to documentation generation for Python functions, as well as any changes made by the mentioned PR #7236. \n\nTo start, we should look for the part of the code that handles the generation of fragment identifiers (anchors) for Python functions in Sphinx documentation. Since this issue specifically pertains to a breaking change affecting Python domain IDs, we can infer that the change might involve methods responsible for formatting or generating these IDs. Let's conduct a few targeted searches:\n\n1. **Search for the method responsible for generating IDs:** Since the change likely affects how IDs are generated or formatted, identifying relevant methods is crucial. However, without an explicit method name, we can start with a more general search based on a code pattern that might be involved in replacing underscores with dashes.\n\n2. **Search for documentation or code comments related to changes in Python domain ID handling:** Understanding the rationale behind the change or seeing examples of the implementation could offer insights on how to approach a fix or provide backward compatibility. This might not be a direct API call but indicates looking for comments or documentation in the found code segments.\n\nGiven the specifics of the issue, let's start with the search:\n\n- `search_code(\"py:function\")`: This call aims to find instances where Python functions are being documented, which might lead us to the logic that handles the generation of fragment identifiers.\n- `search_code(\"example_python_function\")`: Since the bug report mentions this specific example, searching for it might lead us to tests or examples in the code where this identifier is used, potentially illustrating the implementation of the change.\n- `search_code(\"#example_python_function\")` and `search_code(\"#example-python-function\")`: Searching for these fragment identifiers might help us find the implementation or documentation related to this change and understand how the fragment identifiers are being processed or generated now.\n\nThese searches should give us a good starting point to gather the context needed for resolving the issue."
