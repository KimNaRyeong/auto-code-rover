        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue described, we should focus on finding the implementation details of the `ModelState.get_field` method, understand how the `autodetector` operates, particularly the `generate_altered_fields` method, and get insights into the structure and usage of `from_state.models` in the migrations process. Given this, the following API calls are essential:\n\n1. **Search for the class where `get_field` is defined**: Since the issue description mentions a problem with `ModelState.get_field`, we should start by locating the `ModelState` class. This will help us understand how the `get_field` method is implemented and potentially how it can be modified to resolve the issue.\n   - `search_class(\"ModelState\")`\n\n2. **Search for `generate_altered_fields` method in the `autodetector`**: The stack trace provided in the issue shows that the error occurs when the `autodetector`'s `generate_altered_fields` method calls `ModelState.get_field`. Understanding the logic within `generate_altered_fields` could give us insight into how `get_field` is being used and why it is causing an error.\n   - `search_method(\"generate_altered_fields\")`\n\n3. **Locate the implementation of `get_field` within `ModelState`**: With the knowledge of where `ModelState` is defined, we need to look directly at the `get_field` method to see its current implementation and to understand better the issue's description of the problem with handling `_order` fields.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"get_field\", \"ModelState\")`\n\nThese searches will provide a comprehensive overview of the affected parts of the codebase, giving crucial details needed to devise a patch for the bug described in the issue."
