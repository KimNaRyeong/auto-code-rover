        "method": "get_field",
        "intended_behavior": "The `get_field` method should be updated to handle scenarios where a model has a field named `_order` without utilizing the `order_with_respect_to` option in its Meta class. The method should perform an additional check to ensure `order_with_respect_to` exists in `options` before attempting to access it. If `order_with_respect_to` is not present, the method should not attempt to substitute `_order` with the value from `options['order_with_respect_to']`, and instead, it should proceed to return the `_order` field directly as it is defined in the model state. This change will preserve the existing functionality for models properly using `order_with_respect_to` while preventing a `KeyError` for models that include an `_order` field independently of this mechanism."
