Ensure there are no error-category issues - this can be achieved by looking at the exit code\n2. Ensure the overall linting score doesn't deteriorate too much - this can be achieved by using `--fail-under=8`\nHowever if `--fail-under` is used, and the score is above that, then it passes even if there are error-category issues detected. Essentially it's acting as a \"only throw fail (non-zero) codes if under this\", instead of a \"fail if under this, otherwise change nothing\".\nTwo possible solutions I can think of here are:\n1. Have a configuration option to prevent `--fail-under` from consuming other exit statuses. I.e. a way to say \"if score is under N, return error code X, regardless of all else, otherwise change nothing\".\n2. Add a new option like `--fail-on=E,unused-import` which means that if there are any `E*` code (error-category) issues, or any `unused-error` issues, then fail, otherwise change nothing.\n</issue>"

Since the bug report mentions `--fail-under` and the desire for a new option like `--fail-on`, we should look into how the existing command-line options are handled and figure out where the logic for failing based on the linting score is implemented. \n\nLet's make the following API calls:\n1. Search for the method or class that handles argument parsing or command-line option processing. This might involve looking for a common method name or class involved in CLI applications.\n2. Search for the method that calculates the linting score or decides the exit code based on lint results. This is probably where the logic for `--fail-under` is located, and where we would need to integrate `--fail-on`.\n\nGiven these requirements, I will execute the following search API calls:\n- search_method(\"parse_arguments\")\n- search_code(\"--fail-under\")"

        "content": "Since the initial searches did not yield results, we need to refine our approach to gathering context about how pylint processes command-line arguments and handles exit codes based on linting results. Given that specific method names or direct references to command-line options did not provide any leads, we should consider broader searches that target the underlying mechanisms of pylint's functionality.\n\nBased on the issue's description, we're interested in how pylint integrates command-line options for controlling its behavior and determining the conditions under which it exits with error codes. Therefore, let's adjust our search strategy to target these areas:\n\n1. Pylint must have a mechanism for handling command-line arguments in a more general sense, even if it's not explicitly named `parse_arguments`. Many CLI applications use libraries like `argparse`, `click`, or custom solutions to process command-line input.\n\n2. The issue hints at pylint's ability to assess code quality and make decisions based on certain thresholds (like the `--fail-under` option). This implies there's a specific point in pylint's workflow where it summarizes the linting results and decides on the exit code. This could be part of a larger \"run\" or \"execute\" method within pylint's command-line interface or execution logic.\n\nGiven this refined understanding, we should expand our search to include:\n- General mechanisms within pylint for handling command-line inputs.\n- The method or part of the codebase responsible for concluding the linting session and deciding on the exit code.\n\nTo address these points, let's execute the following searches:\n- Search for terms or structures commonly used to define command-line interfaces in Python applications, such as searching for usage of a command-line parsing library or a main entry point where such parsing might occur.\n- Search for methods that are likely involved in the final stages of pylint's execution flow, where the assessment is summarized, and the exit code is determined.\n\nHence, the next set of API calls will be:\n- search_method(\"main\")\n- search_method(\"exit_with_code\")"
