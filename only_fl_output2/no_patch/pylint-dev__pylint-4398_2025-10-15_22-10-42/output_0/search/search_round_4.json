Ensure there are no error-category issues - this can be achieved by looking at the exit code\n2. Ensure the overall linting score doesn't deteriorate too much - this can be achieved by using `--fail-under=8`\nHowever if `--fail-under` is used, and the score is above that, then it passes even if there are error-category issues detected. Essentially it's acting as a \"only throw fail (non-zero) codes if under this\", instead of a \"fail if under this, otherwise change nothing\".\nTwo possible solutions I can think of here are:\n1. Have a configuration option to prevent `--fail-under` from consuming other exit statuses. I.e. a way to say \"if score is under N, return error code X, regardless of all else, otherwise change nothing\".\n2. Add a new option like `--fail-on=E,unused-import` which means that if there are any `E*` code (error-category) issues, or any `unused-error` issues, then fail, otherwise change nothing.\n</issue>"

Given that specific method names or direct references to command-line options did not provide any leads, we should consider broader searches that target the underlying mechanisms of pylint's functionality.\n\nBased on the issue's description, we're interested in how pylint integrates command-line options for controlling its behavior and determining the conditions under which it exits with error codes. Therefore, let's adjust our search strategy to target these areas:\n\n1. Pylint must have a mechanism for handling command-line arguments in a more general sense, even if it's not explicitly named `parse_arguments`. Many CLI applications use libraries like `argparse`, `click`, or custom solutions to process command-line input.\n\n2. The issue hints at pylint's ability to assess code quality and make decisions based on certain thresholds (like the `--fail-under` option). This implies there's a specific point in pylint's workflow where it summarizes the linting results and decides on the exit code. This could be part of a larger \"run\" or \"execute\" method within pylint's command-line interface or execution logic.\n\nGiven this refined understanding, we should expand our search to include:\n- General mechanisms within pylint for handling command-line inputs.\n- The method or part of the codebase responsible for concluding the linting session and deciding on the exit code.\n\nTo address these points, let's execute the following searches:\n- Search for terms or structures commonly used to define command-line interfaces in Python applications, such as searching for usage of a command-line parsing library or a main entry point where such parsing might occur.\n- Search for methods that are likely involved in the final stages of pylint's execution flow, where the assessment is summarized, and the exit code is determined.\n\nHence, the next set of API calls will be:\n- search_method(\"main\")\n- search_method(\"exit_with_code\")"

It parses command-line arguments for file manipulation\u2014specifically targeting a changelog file and potentially other files for modification.\n- It initializes an argument parser, defines expected command-line arguments (like `--changelog` and filenames to be modified), and processes these inputs to conditionally modify files and return an exit code based on whether any modifications were made.\n\n### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n- While this specific `main` function doesn't directly relate to handling pylint's exit codes or evaluating code quality metrics, it demonstrates the broader pattern of argument parsing and conditional exit code determination in python scripts within the same ecosystem.\n- It provides insight into how command-line arguments are typically processed in this codebase and gives an example of how conditional logic based on command-line inputs can influence exit codes.\n\n### Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n- Although this `main` function itself is not where we need to implement the resolution for the reported issue, it illustrates a useful pattern: parsing command-line arguments, processing them, and setting exit codes based on conditions that could be analogous to `--fail-on` logic we need to introduce in pylint.\n- For the reported issue, we would need to implement similar argument parsing for the new option (`--fail-on`) in the relevant part of pylint\u2019s execution or configuration handling code. This should allow users to specify error categories or specific issues that should trigger failure, regardless of other conditions like the `--fail-under` score.\n\nGiven this analysis, we still need to locate the exact part of pylint's codebase that handles pylint's exit codes in relation to linting results and command-line options like `--fail-under`. Since the second API call (`search_method(\"exit_with_code\")`) didn't yield results and wasn't analyzed, and given the context we need, another step would be to directly target the pylint's linting process or its configuration loading.\n\n### Next Steps\nSince we haven't found the direct code paths relating to pylint's lint rules and exit code handling, we might benefit from a broader search for pylint's lint execution or configuration management components. Possible next API calls could include:\n- Search for code or methods related to \"Configuration\" handling in pylint, as command-line options might be processed there.\n- Look into how `pylint` evaluates files and decides on exit codes, possibly with searches like `search_method(\"lint\")` or `search_method(\"evaluate\")`.\n\nHowever, as the user interaction is limited here, I'll conclude with the recommendation that further searches along these lines would be necessary to pinpoint the components that need modification for addressing the reported issue."

        "content": "### Analysis\n\n#### `argparse.ArgumentParser` usage\n\nThe search results for `argparse.ArgumentParser` show us where in the codebase command-line arguments are being processed. The snippets come from `examples/custom.py` and `script/fix_documentation.py`. While the first snippet isn't directly relevant to our issue (it's part of the examples directory and likely serves as a demonstration of implementing custom pylint extensions or similar functionality), the second one from `script/fix_documentation.py`, which we've analyzed previously, reveals a pattern of command-line argument processing that is common in Python applications, using `argparse` for this purpose.\n\n#### `sys.exit` usage\n\nThe presence of `sys.exit` in multiple files, including `pylint/__init__.py`, `pylint/epylint.py`, `pylint/checkers/similar.py`, `pylint/checkers/refactoring/refactoring_checker.py`, `pylint/lint/run.py`, `pylint/pyreverse/main.py`, `pylint/config/option_manager_mixin.py`, `doc/exts/pylint_extensions.py`, and `script/fix_documentation.py` demonstrates various points at which pylint decides to exit. The notably frequent appearances in `pylint/lint/run.py` (18 matches) suggest this file is a primary candidate for further investigation, likely containing the linting execution and exit code logic.\n\n### Relationship to the Bug\n\nThe core of the issue relates to how pylint decides to exit based on the command-line arguments provided and the linting results. Command-line argument processing (`argparse.ArgumentParser`) is how pylint will recognize the new `--fail-on` option. How and where `sys.exit` is used directly relates to the decision-making process regarding when to exit and what exit code to use, especially after linting has been completed.\n\n### Intended Behavior\n\nGiven the issue description and the collected context, the intended behavior for the part of the code processing command-line arguments (`argparse.ArgumentParser` usage) is to recognize, handle, and act upon a new `--fail-on` option. This may involve validating the input to this option (like specific issue codes or categories) and storing those preferences for use later in the linting process.\n\nFor the parts of the code utilizing `sys.exit` (especially within `pylint/lint/run.py`), the intended behavior should include assessing the results of the linting process against the criteria specified by `--fail-on`. For instance, if `--fail-on` is set to fail on any `E` (error) level issues, and such issues are detected, pylint should exit with a non-zero code, even if the `--fail-under` threshold is met.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo address the issue comprehensively, we should focus on:\n- how `--fail-under` and the new `--fail-on` options are processed and considered within the command-line argument parsing mechanism.\n- how the results of the linting process are evaluated against the criteria set by these options to decide on the correct exit code.\n\nTherefore, `pylint/lint/run.py` appears to be the most critical location for introducing our changes, given its significant involvement in running the lint process and deciding on exit codes. Further examination of how `sys.exit` is used in this file will be vital in crafting a patch for the described issue."
