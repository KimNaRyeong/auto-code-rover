        "intended_behavior": "Modify or extend the logic within this file to: - Parse and recognize the `--fail-on` option from the command line, analogous to how `--fail-under` and other options are processed. This involves storing specified issue codes or categories (e.g., 'E' for error-level issues) that should trigger a failure. - After linting analysis, evaluate the detected issues against the criteria specified by `--fail-on`. If any issues matching the criteria specified by `--fail-on` are found, ensure pylint exits with a non-zero exit code, regardless of the score or the presence of other conditions (like the `--fail-under` score being met). - The existing functionality to exit based on `--fail-under` and other conditions should be preserved. The new logic for `--fail-on` needs to integrate seamlessly, such that it does not override or interfere with other functionalities but adds a new layer of condition for failing the linting process as defined by the issue."
