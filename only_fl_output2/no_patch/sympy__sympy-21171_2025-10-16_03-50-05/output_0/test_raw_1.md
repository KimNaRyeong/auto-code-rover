Given the clarification and the need for an accurate reproduction of the issue where the initial attempt seemed to have not triggered the error as expected, let's adjust our approach. Taking into account the details of your request, here is a revised implementation of the `reproducer.py` script designed to specifically reproduce the issue and utilize `print_stacktrace` properly to showcase the error stack trace when the exception occurs.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from sympy import symbols
        from sympy.physics.continuum_mechanics.beam import Beam
        # Define symbols
        E, L, F, B, H = symbols("E L F B H")
        # Moment of inertia
        I = B * H**3 / 12
        # Create beam
        b2 = Beam(L, E, I)
        b2.apply_load(-F, L / 2, -1)
        b2.apply_support(0, "fixed")
        R0, M0 = symbols("R_0, M_0")
        b2.solve_for_reaction_loads(R0, M0)
        # This call should trigger the issue
        b2.shear_force()
        
        print("No issue detected. Exiting with code 0.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue with SingularityFunction handling detected.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script follows your instructions to reproduce the issue within a Python script that can be executed in a standalone manner. The `print_stacktrace` function is employed to display the traceback when an exception occurs, fulfilling the requirement to present a clear stack trace. By raising `AssertionError` upon catching the specific issue, the script adheres to your guideline of signaling an error state aptly, thereby aiding in diagnosing the problem rooted in the handling of `SingularityFunction`. Make sure to run this script in an environment where the necessary modules (`sympy` and specifically its `continuum_mechanics` beam functionality) are properly installed and accessible.
