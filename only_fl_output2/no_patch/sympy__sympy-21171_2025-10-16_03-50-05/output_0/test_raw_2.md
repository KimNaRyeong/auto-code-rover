To closely follow your request for a `reproducer.py` that detects and handles the specified issue while utilizing the `print_stacktrace` function correctly, here is a modified standalone Python script. This script precisely aims to encounter the unexpected keyword argument `exp` issue within a try-except block, utilizing the provided function to print the stack trace in case of an exception.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from sympy import symbols
        from sympy.physics.continuum_mechanics.beam import Beam
        
        # Creating symbols
        E, L, F, B, H = symbols('E, L, F, B, H')
        I = B*H**3/12  # Moment of inertia
        
        # Define a Beam
        b2 = Beam(L, E, I)
        b2.apply_load(-F, L/2, -1)
        b2.apply_support(0, "fixed")
        R0, M0 = symbols("R_0, M_0")
        b2.solve_for_reaction_loads(R0, M0)
        
        # Trigger the error
        b2.shear_force()
        
        # If the previous step did not raise an error, the issue has been resolved
        print("No issue detected. Exiting with code 0.")
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue reproduced successfully.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised version targets the exception specified in your scenario by capturing `TypeError` specifically. It then uses the `print_stacktrace` function to output a detailed traceback, should the `TypeError` be encountered, following your requirements for the output format and behavior closely.

By placing this script at the root of your project and running it with Python 3, you should be able to reproduce the issue if it persists or successfully identify its resolution when the script concludes without detecting the problem, as per your specified behavior.
