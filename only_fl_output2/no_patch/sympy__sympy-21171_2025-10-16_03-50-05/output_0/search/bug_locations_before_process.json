This could involve either updating the method to ignore or appropriately use the 'exp' argument or adjusting the mechanism that dispatches calls to print methods to align with the parameters accepted by `_print_SingularityFunction`. The existing functionality, which allows for printing of `SingularityFunction` objects in LaTeX format, should be preserved while ensuring that no unexpected keyword argument errors are thrown during the process."
