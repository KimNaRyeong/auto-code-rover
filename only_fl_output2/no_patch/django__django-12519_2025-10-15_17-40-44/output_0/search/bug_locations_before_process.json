        "intended_behavior": "The `annotate` method must ensure that when aggregations or subqueries are added as annotations, they are correctly accounted for during the generation of the SQL query, particularly in how they interact with the `GROUP BY` clause. The fix should ensure that the presence of these annotations does not lead to the omission of necessary grouping fields or introduction of duplicates in query results. This method must maintain the distinctness of the result set accurately, even when complex subqueries are used within annotations, preserving the behavior seen in prior Django versions (like 2.2.9) while still supporting new features or optimizations introduced in Django 3.0.2. The fix should involve a review and potentially a revision of how annotated fields influence the group by and distinct behavior of the resulting query, especially ensuring compatibility and expected functionality across Django versions."

        "intended_behavior": "The `distinct` method's behavior should be critically reviewed and possibly amended to work seamlessly with complex queries involving annotations with subqueries, ensuring that the distinct operation effectively eliminates duplicates in all cases. This includes handling cases where the distinct operation interacts with group by clauses influenced by annotations. The intended fix should address and correct any regression introduced in Django 3.0.2 that affects the method's ability to produce a distinct set of results under these complex querying scenarios. This might involve adjusting how distinct fields are determined and applied within the SQL construction process, especially to ensure that the application of `distinct` after `annotate` and other query transformations does not lead to unexpected or incorrect query outcomes."
