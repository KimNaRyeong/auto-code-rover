Given the requirements and the clarification on how the mechanism should work, creating a standalone python script (`reproducer.py`) that simulates the Django environment, runs the migration, and checks for the issue would ideally follow these concepts. However, due to the complexity of accurately reproducing Django app behavior externally, the given script focuses on the approach of running within an expected Django project structure and catching errors related to the migrations.

This revised script assumes the presence of a Django project and that it can simulate the issue by specifically trying to perform migrations and catching the errors that relate to the app name case sensitivity issue as described.

```python
import os
import sys
import django

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_django_environment():
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project.settings')
    try:
        django.setup()
    except Exception as e:
        print("Failed to set up Django environment.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

def run_migrations_and_check():
    from django.core.management import call_command
    from django.core.management.base import CommandError

    try:
        call_command('makemigrations', 'DJ_RegLogin')
    except CommandError as e:
        # If we catch a CommandError, we'll check if it's related to our issue.
        if "app 'dj_reglogin' isn't installed" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("Issue reproduced: Mixed-case app name causes migration crash.")
        else:
            print("An unexpected error occurred during migrations.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected exception was encountered.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    print("No issues detected during migrations. The issue might be fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    setup_django_environment()
    run_migrations_and_check()
```

**Important Notes:**

1. **Project Configuration:** Replace `'your_project.settings'` with the actual settings module of your Django project.
2. **Project Directory:** This script should be placed in the root directory of the Django project where `manage.py` is located to ensure that the Django environment is correctly initialized.
3. **Python and Django Compatibility:** The script uses `django.setup()` to ensure that the Django environment is properly configured for the script. This is vital for operations like `makemigrations` that rely on Django's configuration and app registry.
4. **Error Handling:** This script specifically catches `CommandError` exceptions from Django's command execution, assuming that failures related to `makemigrations` will raise such. It checks the message of the exception to see if it matches the expected error due to the mixed-case app name issue.

Running this script in a correctly configured Django project environment should allow it to either reproduce the issue by raising an `AssertionError` if the problem is present, or exiting with code 0 indicating no issues were detected, based on the specific conditions related to the initially described problem.
