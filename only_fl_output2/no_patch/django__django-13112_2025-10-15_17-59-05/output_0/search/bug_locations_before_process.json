Since Django's app registry might normalize or expect a certain case format (typically all lowercase), ensure that the app's name in the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting matches its declaration and usage throughout the project, including model imports and app configuration. This might involve changing `DJ_RegLogin` to `dj_reglogin` in `INSTALLED_APPS` if this is the normalized name django expects, or vice versa, ensuring the app's folder and `apps.py` configuration match this name exactly."
