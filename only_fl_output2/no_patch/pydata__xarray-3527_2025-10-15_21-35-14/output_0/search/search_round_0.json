        "content": "To address the issue with the `DatasetGroupBy` class not implementing the `quantile` method as described, we need to gather more context. Firstly, we should check the implementation of both the `DataArrayGroupBy` class, since it appears to have the `quantile` method working properly, and the `DatasetGroupBy` class, to see why it lacks the `quantile` method. This comparison may reveal what needs to be added or modified in the `DatasetGroupBy` class.\n\nLet's execute the following search API calls:\n1. `search_class(\"DataArrayGroupBy\")` - This will help us understand how `quantile` is implemented or integrated within the `DataArrayGroupBy` class.\n2. `search_class(\"DatasetGroupBy\")` - This will provide us context about the current state of the `DatasetGroupBy` class and why it might be missing the `quantile` functionality.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"quantile\", \"DataArrayGroupBy\")` - To get the specific implementation details of the `quantile` method within the `DataArrayGroupBy` class, which can potentially be adapted or used as a reference for implementing it in `DatasetGroupBy`."
