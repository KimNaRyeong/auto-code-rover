Based on your instructions, here is an adjusted `reproducer.py` script that specifically tests for the presence of a `quantile` method on a `DatasetGroupBy` object in xarray. If the `quantile` method is missing, implying the presence of the issue, it will raise an `AssertionError`. Conversely, if the method is found, indicating the issue has been resolved, the script will exit with code 0. Additionally, it will use the provided `print_stacktrace` function for any exceptions that are caught.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    import xarray as xr

    # Create a dataset
    ds = xr.Dataset(data_vars={"a": ("x", list("abcd"))}, coords={"x": range(4)})

    # Attempt to access the `quantile` method for grouped dataset
    try:
        ds.groupby(ds.x % 2 == 0).quantile
        print("Issue not present: 'quantile' method is accessible on DatasetGroupBy object.")
        exit(0)
    except AttributeError as e:
        # If AttributeError is raised, the expected issue is present.
        raise AssertionError("DatasetGroupBy object does not implement quantile as expected.") from e

except AssertionError as e:
    print("AssertionError caught:")
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise e
except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected error occurred:")
    print_stacktrace(e)
```

This Python script focuses on reproducing and verifying the specific issue describedâ€”whether the `quantile` method is implemented for `DatasetGroupBy` objects in xarray. If this method raises an `AssertionError`, it indicates the issue remains unresolved. If the script exits with code 0, it suggests the issue has been fixed, as the `quantile` method is successfully accessed.
