Considering the issue's description, it seems pertinent to look at how the final estimator is currently being trained and where the integration of the original dataset could occur. Therefore, the following API calls would be valuable:\n\n1. **Search for the stacking related classes**: Since the mechanism described involves stacking, where a final estimator is trained based on the predictions of other classifiers, we should start by identifying the relevant class or classes that implement this functionality. If the project follows naming conventions similar to widely used machine learning libraries, classes with names like `StackingClassifier` or `StackingCVClassifier` could be of interest.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"StackingClassifier\")\n   search_class(\"StackingCVClassifier\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for methods relevant to training the final estimator**: Within the identified stacking class, there should be a method responsible for training the final estimator, possibly named something akin to `fit`, where modifications to include the original dataset might be made.\n\n   Assuming the class name identified from the first API call is `StackingClassifier`, the next step would be to locate the `fit` method or any method responsible for handling the training process of the final estimator.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"StackingClassifier\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"StackingCVClassifier\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for documentation or code comments**: Often, the implementation details and the architecture of such methods are described in the documentation or code comments. Searching for specific terms related to the functionality can provide insights into where and how to implement the new feature effectively.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code_in_file(\"final_estimator training\", \"<file_path_identified_from_class_search>\")\n   search_code(\"use_features_in_secondary\")\n   search_code(\"final_estimator.fit\")\n   ```\n\nThese actions will help in gathering the necessary context about how the stacking mechanism is currently implemented and where modifications can be introduced to incorporate the original dataset into the training of the final estimator. The `<file_path_identified_from_class_search>` placeholder should be replaced with the actual file path returned from the initial class search API calls."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n### Analysis of `StackingClassifier` in `sklearn/ensemble/_stacking.py`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `StackingClassifier` class in `sklearn/ensemble/_stacking.py` is an implementation of a stacking ensemble, where a final estimator is trained on the predictions made by base estimators. The code snippet provided shows the constructor method `__init__`, the `fit` method, along with other methods like `predict`, `predict_proba`, `decision_function`, and `transform`. The `fit` method's purpose is to train the base estimators followed by the final estimator based on the base estimators' predictions.\n\n#### Relationship with the issue\n\nThe issue discusses adding functionality to optionally include the original dataset features alongside the predictions from the base estimators when training the final estimator. However, from the provided `fit` method snippet, we observe that this functionality is not currently implemented. The method trains the final estimator solely based on the predictions from base estimators, as it strictly follows the stacking ensemble principle without combining base estimators' predictions with the original dataset features.\n\n#### Intended behavior\n\nThe intended behavior, inspired by the `use_features_in_secondary` option from the `mlxtend` library, suggests modifying the `fit` (and potentially other relevant methods) to conditionally include the original dataset features in the training data for the final estimator. This would likely involve altering how the training set is prepared for the final estimator within the `fit` method or elsewhere in the class, to merge the original features with the predictions of base estimators when a specific flag is set to `True`.\n\n### Analysis of `final_estimator.fit` in `sklearn/pipeline.py`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe code snippet from `sklearn/pipeline.py` illustrates the training process of the final estimator in a `Pipeline`. In the context of a pipeline, the final estimator is fitted with the processed input `Xt`, transformed by previous steps in the pipeline, and the target values `y`.\n\n#### Relationship with the issue\n\nWhile this snippet is not directly from the `StackingClassifier`, it shows a similar pattern where a final estimator is trained with transformed input and the target variables. The relationship lies in the parallel of fitting a final estimator, albeit in a different context (`Pipeline` vs. `Stacking` ensemble).\n\n#### Intended behavior\n\nGiven the issue description, this part of the code underscores the common practice of training a final estimator with transformed data. The intended modification for the `StackingClassifier` parallels this by suggesting that, similar to how a pipeline's final estimator is trained with preprocessed inputs, the stacking classifier's final estimator could have the option to be trained with a combination of original dataset features and the base estimators' predictions.\n\n### Next Steps in Analysis\n\nGiven the above context, it seems necessary to further investigate how the base estimators' predictions are currently being combined and fed into the final estimator during the `fit` process. This would involve:\n\n1. Examining the mechanism used to generate predictions from the base estimators within the `StackingClassifier` class.\n2. Identifying where and how these predictions are passed to the final estimator.\n\nTo achieve this, additional API calls could be targeted towards:\n\n- Searching for code that describes the handling and combination of base estimator predictions within the `StackingClassifier` class.\n- Exploring methods like `_validate_final_estimator`, `transform`, or any internal methods that handle the data structure passed to the final estimator.\n\nThis investigation would provide insight into current functionalities and clarifications on where and how to introduce the new feature."

This requires an additional parameter, say `use_features_in_original_data` (following the `mlxtend` nomenclature, it could be named similar to `use_features_in_secondary`), which defaults to `False` to maintain backward compatibility. When set to `True`, the method must concatenate the original dataset features with the predictions of the base estimators before training the final estimator. This modification should ensure that:\n   \n   - The existing functionality is preserved when the new parameter is `False`.\n   - The final estimator can be optionally trained on both the base estimators' predictions and the original dataset features, allowing for potentially richer model training and improved accuracy, as pointed out in the issue description. This approach fits well within the spirit of stacking where the strength of combined models is leveraged for prediction; extending it to include original features introduces another layer of sophistication.\n   \n   Ensuring the implementation incorporates these changes seamlessly with existing arguments (e.g., handling `sample_weight` correctly in the combined dataset) is crucial for maintaining the utility and integrity of the `StackingClassifier` class. \n\nThis enhancement directly addresses the issue submitted, providing users with increased flexibility and potentially more powerful modeling capabilities, motivated by empirical evidence from Kaggle competitions."
