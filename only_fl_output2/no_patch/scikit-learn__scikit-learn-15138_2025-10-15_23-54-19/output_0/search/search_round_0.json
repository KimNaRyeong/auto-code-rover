        "content": "To effectively address the issue at hand, which involves adding an option to utilize the original dataset when training the final estimator in a stacking implementation, we would need to investigate the relevant classes and methods involved in the stacking mechanism. Considering the issue's description, it seems pertinent to look at how the final estimator is currently being trained and where the integration of the original dataset could occur. Therefore, the following API calls would be valuable:\n\n1. **Search for the stacking related classes**: Since the mechanism described involves stacking, where a final estimator is trained based on the predictions of other classifiers, we should start by identifying the relevant class or classes that implement this functionality. If the project follows naming conventions similar to widely used machine learning libraries, classes with names like `StackingClassifier` or `StackingCVClassifier` could be of interest.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"StackingClassifier\")\n   search_class(\"StackingCVClassifier\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for methods relevant to training the final estimator**: Within the identified stacking class, there should be a method responsible for training the final estimator, possibly named something akin to `fit`, where modifications to include the original dataset might be made.\n\n   Assuming the class name identified from the first API call is `StackingClassifier`, the next step would be to locate the `fit` method or any method responsible for handling the training process of the final estimator.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"StackingClassifier\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"StackingCVClassifier\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for documentation or code comments**: Often, the implementation details and the architecture of such methods are described in the documentation or code comments. Searching for specific terms related to the functionality can provide insights into where and how to implement the new feature effectively.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code_in_file(\"final_estimator training\", \"<file_path_identified_from_class_search>\")\n   search_code(\"use_features_in_secondary\")\n   search_code(\"final_estimator.fit\")\n   ```\n\nThese actions will help in gathering the necessary context about how the stacking mechanism is currently implemented and where modifications can be introduced to incorporate the original dataset into the training of the final estimator. The `<file_path_identified_from_class_search>` placeholder should be replaced with the actual file path returned from the initial class search API calls."
