        "intended_behavior": "The `fit` method in the `StackingClassifier` should be enhanced to conditionally include the original dataset features alongside the base estimators' predictions when training the final estimator. This requires an additional parameter, say `use_features_in_original_data` (following the `mlxtend` nomenclature, it could be named similar to `use_features_in_secondary`), which defaults to `False` to maintain backward compatibility. When set to `True`, the method must concatenate the original dataset features with the predictions of the base estimators before training the final estimator. This modification should ensure that:\n\n- The existing functionality is preserved when the new parameter is `False`.\n- The final estimator can be optionally trained on both the base estimators' predictions and the original dataset features, allowing for potentially richer model training and improved accuracy, as pointed out in the issue description. This approach fits well within the spirit of stacking where the strength of combined models is leveraged for prediction; extending it to include original features introduces another layer of sophistication.\n\nEnsuring the implementation incorporates these changes seamlessly with existing arguments (e.g., handling `sample_weight` correctly in the combined dataset) is crucial for maintaining the utility and integrity of the `StackingClassifier` class."
