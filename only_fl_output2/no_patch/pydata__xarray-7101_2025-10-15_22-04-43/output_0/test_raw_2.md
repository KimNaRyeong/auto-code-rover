Based on your request to have a standalone file `reproducer.py` to reproduce a described issue, we'll craft a script that tries to mimic the behavior as closely as possible given the initial bug report context about xarray and multiindex manipulation. 

The corrected script, given the provided code snippets and details, is aimed to explicitly demonstrate the failure point identified in the bug report—if present—and to manage exceptions accordingly. Notably, this script is designed based on the initial test case provided to me, assuming that the library in use and its dependencies are correctly installed and configured in your Python environment.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import xarray as xr

    try:
        ds = xr.DataArray(
            [[[1, 1], [0, 0]], [[2, 2], [1, 1]]],
            dims=("lat", "year", "month"),
            coords={"lat": [-60, 60], "year": [2010, 2020], "month": [3, 6]},
            name="test",
        ).to_dataset()

        stacked = ds.stack(time=("year", "month"))
        new_time_coords = [y + m / 12 for y, m in stacked["time"].values]
        stacked = stacked.assign_coords(time=new_time_coords)

        # This is an expected behavior check based on the issue description
        # Ensuring the length is correctly computed and no negative value error is raised.
        if len(stacked) < 0:
            raise ValueError("__len__() should return >= 0")
        
        print("No issues with the length of the stacked object.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Assertion failed:\n", e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code 1 for assertion failures
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code 1 for any other exceptions

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    # Exit with code 0 when issue is fixed or the script runs successfully without catching the expected issue.
    exit(0)
```

Please run this script in the root directory of your project using `python3 reproducer.py`. The expected behavior of this script is:

- If the issue is present, it should raise an AssertionError or print a detailed stack trace of the issue depending on its nature.
- It will exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed or if the script does not encounter the expected error conditions.

This script uses the constructed `print_stacktrace` function to clearly output the stack trace for any raised exceptions, aiming to provide clear visibility into the issue's location if it persists.
