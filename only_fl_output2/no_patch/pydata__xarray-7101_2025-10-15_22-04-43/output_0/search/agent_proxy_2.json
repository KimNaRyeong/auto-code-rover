After assigning new coordinates, a validation check should ensure that all elements in `_coord_names` accurately represent current available coordinates. If any discrepancies are found, `_coord_names` should be corrected to ensure consistency.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `xarray/core/dataset.py`\n  - **Class:** `Dataset`\n  - **Method:** `set_index` and `reset_index` (because these methods deal with reindexing and could affect coordinates indirectly).\n  - **Intended Behavior:** For both `set_index` and `reset_index`, there should be clear, additional logic to verify and update `_coord_names` appropriately post-operation. It involves adding or removing coordinate names based on how indices are restructured. If a coordinate is promoted to an index or vice versa, `_coord_names` should be updated accordingly to maintain accuracy.\n\n- **Location 3:**\n  - **File:** `xarray/core/dataset.py`\n  - **Class:** `Dataset`\n  - **Method:** `_stack_once`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Given that stacking can significantly alter the dataset's structure by combining multiple coordinates into a single new one, this method should include a final step where `_coord_names` is revisited. Any coordinates that have been combined into a new multiindex should have their names removed from `_coord_names`, and the new coordinate name should be added. This would prevent the inconsistency between the physical structure of the dataset and its coordinate metadata, ensuring operations relying on `_coord_names` (like calculating dataset length) remain accurate.\n\nThese intended behaviors emphasize the need to maintain accurate and synchronized `_coord_names` with the actual coordinates in the dataset at all times. The goal is to ensure that any operations affecting dataset structure or coordinates lead to immediate and correct updates to this metadata, thereby preserving consistency, integrity, and functionality of the dataset object, especially in operations that may not inherently modify `_coord_names` directly but have an impact on it."
