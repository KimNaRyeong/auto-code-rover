After assigning the coordinates, the dataset was in a state where its length was coming out as less than zero, which caused all sorts of issues.\n### What did you expect to happen?\nI think the issue is with the updating of `_coord_names`, perhaps in https://github.com/pydata/xarray/blob/18454c218002e48e1643ce8e25654262e5f592ad/xarray/core/coordinates.py#L389.\nI expected to just be able to assign the coords and then print the array to see the result.\n### Minimal Complete Verifiable Example\n```Python\nimport xarray as xr\nds = xr.DataArray(\n[[[1, 1], [0, 0]], [[2, 2], [1, 1]]],\ndims=(\"lat\", \"year\", \"month\"),\ncoords={\"lat\": [-60, 60], \"year\": [2010, 2020], \"month\": [3, 6]},\nname=\"test\",\n).to_dataset()\nstacked = ds.stack(time=(\"year\", \"month\"))\nstacked = stacked.assign_coords(\n{\"time\": [y + m / 12 for y, m in stacked[\"time\"].values]}\n)\n# Both these fail with ValueError: __len__() should return >= 0\nlen(stacked)\nprint(stacked)\n```\n### MVCE confirmation\n- [X] Minimal example \u2014 the example is as focused as reasonably possible to demonstrate the underlying issue in xarray.\n- [X] Complete example \u2014 the example is self-contained, including all data and the text of any traceback.\n- [x] Verifiable example \u2014 the example copy & pastes into an IPython prompt or [Binder notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pydata/xarray/main?urlpath=lab/tree/doc/examples/blank_template.ipynb), returning the result.\n- [X] New issue \u2014 a search of GitHub Issues suggests this is not a duplicate.\n### Relevant log output\n```Python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"mre.py\", line 17, in <module>\nlen(stacked)\nFile \".../xarray-tests/xarray/core/dataset.py\", line 1364, in __len__\nreturn len(self.data_vars)\nValueError: __len__() should return >= 0\n```\n### Anything else we need to know?\nHere's a test (I put it in `test_dataarray.py` but maybe there is a better spot)\n```python\ndef test_assign_coords_drop_coord_names(self) -> None:\nds = DataArray(\n[[[1, 1], [0, 0]], [[2, 2], [1, 1]]],\ndims=(\"lat\", \"year\", \"month\"),\ncoords={\"lat\": [-60, 60], \"year\": [2010, 2020], \"month\": [3, 6]},\nname=\"test\",\n).to_dataset()\nstacked = ds.stack(time=(\"year\", \"month\"))\nstacked = stacked.assign_coords(\n{\"time\": [y + m / 12 for y, m in stacked[\"time\"].values]}\n)\n# this seems to be handled correctly\nassert set(stacked._variables.keys()) == {\"test\", \"time\", \"lat\"}\n# however, _coord_names doesn't seem to update as expected\n# the below fails\nassert set(stacked._coord_names) == {\"time\", \"lat\"}\n# the incorrect value of _coord_names means that all the below fails too\n# The failure is because the length of a dataset is calculated as (via len(data_vars))\n# len(dataset._variables) - len(dataset._coord_names). For the situation\n# above, where len(dataset._coord_names) is greater than len(dataset._variables),\n# you get a length less than zero which then fails because length must return\n# a value greater than zero\n# Both these fail with ValueError: __len__() should return >= 0\nlen(stacked)\nprint(stacked)\n```\n### Environment\n<details>\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\n------------------\ncommit: e678a1d7884a3c24dba22d41b2eef5d7fe5258e7\npython: 3.8.13 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Mar 25 2022, 06:04:14)\n[Clang 12.0.1 ]\npython-bits: 64\nOS: Darwin\nOS-release: 21.5.0\nmachine: arm64\nprocessor: arm\nbyteorder: little\nLC_ALL: None\nLANG: en_AU.UTF-8\nLOCALE: ('en_AU', 'UTF-8')\nlibhdf5: 1.12.2\nlibnetcdf: 4.8.1\nxarray: 0.1.dev4312+ge678a1d.d20220928\npandas: 1.5.0\nnumpy: 1.22.4\nscipy: 1.9.1\nnetCDF4: 1.6.1\npydap: installed\nh5netcdf: 1.0.2\nh5py: 3.7.0\nNio: None\nzarr: 2.13.2\ncftime: 1.6.2\nnc_time_axis: 1.4.1\nPseudoNetCDF: 3.2.2\nrasterio: 1.3.1\ncfgrib: 0.9.10.1\niris: 3.3.0\nbottleneck: 1.3.5\ndask: 2022.9.1\ndistributed: 2022.9.1\nmatplotlib: 3.6.0\ncartopy: 0.21.0\nseaborn: 0.12.0\nnumbagg: 0.2.1\nfsspec: 2022.8.2\ncupy: None\npint: 0.19.2\nsparse: 0.13.0\nflox: 0.5.9\nnumpy_groupies: 0.9.19\nsetuptools: 65.4.0\npip: 22.2.2\nconda: None\npytest: 7.1.3\nIPython: None\nsphinx: None\n</details>\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the issue description, we need to gather more context around how `assign_coords` works in the context of a `Dataset` or `DataArray` when dealing with a multiindex created by using `stack`. The suspected problem area mentioned is in updating `_coord_names`. To address this, let's perform the following API calls to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. Since we want to explore how `_coord_names` is updated, particularly in relation to `assign_coords`, it would be beneficial to find the `assign_coords` method within the `Dataset` or `DataArray` class. However, we're not strictly told whether this issue occurs in the context of a `Dataset` or `DataArray`, but the example given suggests `Dataset`, as `to_dataset()` is called. Let's search within `Dataset` for now.\n\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"assign_coords\", \"Dataset\")`\n\n2. The traceback provided in the issue points to a problem happening when trying to get the length of a `Dataset` after modifying it. It references a failure in `__len__`, linked to `self.data_vars`, which suggests a deeper look into the `Dataset` class's `__len__` method might provide insight.\n\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"__len__\", \"Dataset\")`\n\n3. The issue description suggests that the bug might lie in the handling of `_coord_names` during or after assigning coordinates. Specifically, it may not get updated correctly, which impacts other functionalities negatively. An understanding of how `_coord_names` are handled or updated in general could provide clues. So, let's search for code snippets where `_coord_names` might be manipulated or checked.\n\n    - `search_code(\"_coord_names\")` \n\nThese API calls should give us a clearer view of how `assign_coords` operates, especially in relation to `_coord_names`, and how `__len__` is affected by such operations."

        "content": "Given the results from the API calls, let's analyze the context and outcomes:\n\n### 1. `assign_coords` in `Dataset`:\nThe search did not find the `assign_coords` method in the `Dataset` class directly, which implies two possibilities:\n- The `assign_coords` functionality is inherited or abstracted in a way that doesn't explicitly define it under `Dataset` but potentially through shared or base classes such as `DataArray` or `DataWithCoords`.\n- We may need to extend our search to a more general scope or reassess where this functionality is implemented within the xarray library. Given the mention of `assign_coords` both in the original issue and its relevance, a logical next step would be to try and locate this method in the `DataArray` class or explore shared base classes that might implement it.\n\n### 2. `__len__` in `Dataset`:\nThe `__len__` implementation for `Dataset` is straightforward: it returns the length of `self.data_vars`, which represents the number of data variables in the dataset. This is vital information because:\n- The issue describes an instance where `len(stacked)` returns a ValueError, suggesting that the result of `self.data_vars` or its length is being affected negatively or unexpectedly after operations involving `assign_coords`.\n- Understanding this part of the code establishes that if there's an inconsistency in managing or updating the indices or coordinates within a dataset (esp. `_coord_names`), that could directly distort the size calculation and yield incorrect results.\n\n### 3. Appearances of `_coord_names`:\nWith `_coord_names` appearing throughout the codebase, especially within `core/dataset.py` (74 matches), it's clear this attribute plays a critical role in managing dataset coordinates. The mention across multiple files further emphasizes its importance in the library's operation regarding coordinate management. Relevant insights and possibilities include:\n- There's a significant chance that the handling or updating of `_coord_names` during coordinate assignment or manipulation tasks could be prone to issues, especially in operations like `stack` combined with `assign_coords`.\n- The issue likely stems from how these `_coord_names` are updated or not updated when dynamic changes to the coordinate system occur, possibly neglecting to reflect new or modified coordinates appropriately and thereby affecting dataset integrity, as observed with operations failing post-coordinate assignment.\n\nGiven these findings, a plausible next step would be to inspect how `_coord_names` are managed during operations that modify them, such as `assign_coords`. Since the direct search for `assign_coords` in `Dataset` did not yield results, it's worthwhile to extend this search to `DataArray` or investigate in `core/dataset.py` where most occurrences of `_coord_names` manipulation seem to happen. Further actions could involve:\n- Searching for the `assign_coords` method or its functionality within `DataArray` or other relevant classes/modules in the codebase.\n- Specific inspection of `_coord_names` management in `core/dataset.py` to understand how coordinate names are updated or maintained during various operations, particularly focusing on methods involved in stacking or assigning coordinates."
