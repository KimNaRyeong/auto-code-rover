It involves adding or removing coordinate names based on how indices are restructured. If a coordinate is promoted to an index or vice versa, '_coord_names' should be updated accordingly to maintain accuracy."

        "intended_behavior": "Given that stacking can significantly alter the dataset's structure by combining multiple coordinates into a single new one, this method should include a final step where '_coord_names' is revisited. Any coordinates that have been combined into a new multiindex should have their names removed from '_coord_names', and the new coordinate name should be added. This would prevent the inconsistency between the physical structure of the dataset and its coordinate metadata, ensuring operations relying on '_coord_names' (like calculating dataset length) remain accurate."
