Given the constraints and the need for a script that properly reflects the initial report of the issue, here is an updated version of the Python script `reproducer.py` which aims to trigger the specified AssertionError or print a detailed stack trace of the encountered issue using the given `print_stacktrace` function. This script is designed based on the reported bug description and the provided test case.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import xarray as xr

    try:
        ds = xr.DataArray(
            [[[1, 1], [0, 0]], [[2, 2], [1, 1]]],
            dims=("lat", "year", "month"),
            coords={"lat": [-60, 60], "year": [2010, 2020], "month": [3, 6]},
            name="test",
        ).to_dataset()

        stacked = ds.stack(time=("year", "month"))
        stacked = stacked.assign_coords(
            {"time": [y + m / 12 for y, m in stacked["time"].values]}
        )

        # Check for variables and coordinates presence as expected
        assert set(stacked._variables.keys()) == {"test", "time", "lat"}, "Variables confirmatory check failed."
        assert set(stacked._coord_names) == {"time", "lat"}, "Coord names confirmatory check failed."

        len(stacked)  # Should pass without error if issue is fixed
        print("No issues detected.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Assertion failed:\n", e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code 1 for assertion failures
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code 1 for unexpected exceptions

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 when issue is fixed or no error is detected
```

Please ensure that:
- `import xarray as xr` is able to run successfully in your environment. You might need to adjust the environment if there's an issue similar to the numpy one mentioned. This script assumes an environment where xarray and its dependencies are properly installed and compatible.
- If the initial error was due to environmental issues (e.g., wrong numpy version as implied by the error message you received), make sure the environment is correctly set up with compatible versions of libraries.
