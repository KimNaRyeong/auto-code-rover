        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `_set_params` method needs to gracefully handle the case when the attribute (such as `_transformers` in `ColumnTransformer`) is empty or does not contain any values to unpack. Before attempting to unpack `names` and another variable using the `zip(*getattr(self, attr))` operation, the method should check if the attribute is not empty. If the attribute is empty, it should bypass any operations that require non-empty attributes, such as step replacement or parameter setting on steps, thus avoiding raising a `ValueError` when there is nothing to unpack.\n\nAn additional if-condition could be introduced to check for the presence of elements in the attribute pointed to by `attr`. If the attribute is found to contain elements, the method proceeds with its current logic of unpacking and manipulating the steps/estimators. If not, it skips directly to applying any global parameters (those not specific to any step/transformer) such as `n_jobs` in the provided example, thereby preserving existing functionality while introducing support for compositions with no steps/estimators defined."
