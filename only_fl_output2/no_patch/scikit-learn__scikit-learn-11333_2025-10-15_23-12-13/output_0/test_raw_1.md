Given the error encountered previously seems to stem from an issue with the scikit-learn installation rather than the code itself, the provided `reproducer.py` script was intended to trigger a specific issue related to `_BaseComposition._set_params` method when there are no estimators defined in a `ColumnTransformer`.

However, the error you encountered suggests there's an import or installation issue with scikit-learn rather than a problem with the `reproducer.py` script as written in my previous response. It's vital to ensure that scikit-learn is installed correctly. If you are running in a clean environment, please make sure to install scikit-learn using `pip install sklearn` or by following the official scikit-learn documentation for installation. After ensuring scikit-learn is installed correctly, you can use the previously provided reproducer script to test the original issue.
