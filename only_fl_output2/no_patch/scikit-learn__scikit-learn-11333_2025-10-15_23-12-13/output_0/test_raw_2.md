Given the clarification and the need to assure the test script exits properly while catching the specific issue with setting parameters on a `ColumnTransformer` with no estimators, let's adjust the `reproducer.py` script accordingly. If the issue arises, it should catch a `ValueError` indicating that there are not enough values to unpack.

Here's an updated version:

```python
# reproducer.py

def main():
    try:
        from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
        # Attempt to set_params on a ColumnTransformer with no estimators
        ColumnTransformer([]).set_params(n_jobs=2)
        # If the ValueError is not raised, it means the issue has been fixed
        print("Issue fixed.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch any exception that is not a ValueError indicating the specific issue
        if isinstance(e, ValueError) and "not enough values to unpack" in str(e):
            pass  # This is the expected error for the issue, so don't assert here.
        else:
            # If any other error or if the error message doesn't match, then it's unexpected.
            print_stacktrace(e)
            assert False, "An unexpected exception occurred."

        # Correctly caught the expected ValueError for the issue
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert "not enough values to unpack" in str(e), "The issue is present."

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script is intended to detect whether a specific bug related to setting parameters on a `ColumnTransformer` with no estimators has been fixed. It does so by trying to reproduce the error condition; if the expected `ValueError` is raised, it prints the stack trace for clarity, and if any other error occurs or if no error occurs (indicating the issue might have been fixed), it handles those cases accordingly.
