It proceeds to classify the given diophantine equation and then attempts to find its solutions using the `diophantine` function. The expected behavior is defined under the assumption that when the issue with different even powers is fixed, the equation is either correctly solved or correctly classified as having no solution due to mismatched powers. The script includes error handling to display a stack trace if an unexpected exception occurs, facilitating debugging. \n\nThis script should be executed in the root directory of a project where the `sympy` library is installed and accessible. As instructed, it will exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed according to the assertions provided."
