        "intended_behavior": "The method needs to include additional logic to ensure it classifies an equation as 'general_sum_of_even_powers' only if all variables are raised to the same even power, besides verifying that the total degree is greater than 3 and even, and all non-constant coefficients are 1. This adjustment involves enhancing the condition at lines 404-407 to check the uniformity of even powers among terms. Specifically, after confirming all terms are of even powers, we should compare these powers to ensure they are identical."
