        "content": "To gather the necessary context for addressing the issue with footnotes rendering as `?` in PDF output, we should focus on the components of Sphinx that handle footnotes and LaTeX (PDF) generation. The issue likely involves the code responsible for parsing reStructuredText (rst) files and the LaTeX writer.\n\nGiven the details of the issue, we should look into how Sphinx parses footnotes in `rst` files and converts them to LaTeX, as this conversion process seems to be where the problem might be occurring. Since the issue mentions that footnotes aren't rendered correctly in PDF output, the LaTeX conversion process is a critical area to explore.\n\nHere are the necessary search API calls to gather context:\n\n1. **Search for code related to parsing footnotes in rst files:**\n   - `search_code(\"footnote\")`\n   This will help identify how footnotes are interpreted from the `rst` source.\n\n2. **Search for code related to LaTeX conversion:**\n   - `search_code(\"latexpdf\")`\n   This call aims to find any direct references to the `latexpdf` make target or related LaTeX generation processes.\n\nThese searches are aimed at identifying relevant portions of the code where the problem might originate. The focus on both parsing footnotes and LaTeX conversion is due to the nature of the issue, which involves correctly interpreting and rendering footnotes in the LaTeX (PDF) output."
