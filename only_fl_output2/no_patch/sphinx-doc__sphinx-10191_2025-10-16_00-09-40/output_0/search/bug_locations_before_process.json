This includes ensuring that repeated references to the same footnote are correctly handled, avoiding the generation of a `?` in the output and instead producing the correct numerical indication and hyperlink to the footnote at the bottom of the page. The code should consistently recognize and replicate footnote references from the `rst` document in LaTeX, preserving hyperlink functionality and correct numbering across multiple references."

        "intended_behavior": "Considering its significant number of matches for footnotes, this file's transformations might be key in the transition of footnotes into LaTeX-friendly formats. The intended behavior here is to ensure that the internal representation of footnotes within Sphinx is correctly processed into LaTeX commands that accurately reflect footnotes, including their numbering and linkage. Specifically, for alternating multiply referred footnotes, the transformation logic needs to verify that references don't break upon conversion, ensuring each reference points correctly to its footnote entry and all hyperlinks within the PDF are maintained effectively. There is a need for a clear and robust handling mechanism that preserves footnote references throughout the document conversion process, particularly for documents with complex footnote structures."
