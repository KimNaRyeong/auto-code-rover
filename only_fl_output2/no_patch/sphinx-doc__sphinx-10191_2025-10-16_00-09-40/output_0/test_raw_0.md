This script assumes the presence of a `make latexpdf` command, typically used in a Sphinx documentation project, to build a PDF from RestructuredText (`.rst`) files. The `check_pdf_output_for_error()` function is intended to represent the step where one would check the PDF for issues with the footnotes rendering, but it's implemented here to always assume an error is found for demonstration purposes.

In a real-world scenario, you should replace the content of `check_pdf_output_for_error()` with logic to programmatically inspect the PDF file, which could involve parsing the PDF content to search for specific misrendered elements or other indicators of the issue described. You might need to use a PDF processing library in Python, like PyPDF2 or PDFMiner, to read and inspect the PDF document's text.
