Based on your guidelines and the requirement for the script to programmatically detect the presence of the bug and properly invoke the `AssertionError` when the bug manifests, below is the adjusted `reproducer.py` script. This version employs the original reproduction steps and integrates the exception handling with an attempt to catch any underlying error related to the `ValueError: Invalid vmin or vmax` directly:

```python
# reproducer.py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.colors import LogNorm
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_setting_norm_with_existing_colorbar():
    try:
        # create some random data to fill a 2d plot
        rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
        img = rng.uniform(1, 5, (25, 25))

        # plot it
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        plot = ax.pcolormesh(img)
        fig.colorbar(plot, ax=ax)

        vmin, vmax = 1, 5

        # Attempt to change norm to LogNorm could trigger issue
        plot.norm = LogNorm(vmin, vmax)
        plot.autoscale()
        fig.canvas.draw_idle()  # Requested to trigger re-draw
        
        # If script reaches this point without error, we assume issue is fixed or not present
        print("No error encountered. Issue might be fixed in this environment.")
    except ValueError as e:
        if str(e) == "Invalid vmin or vmax":
            print_stacktrace(e)
            assert False, "Issue detected: Setting norm with existing colorbar failed due to 'Invalid vmin or vmax'."
        else:
            # Other ValueErrors not related to this specific bug shouldn't be caught here.
            raise
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "Test failed with an unexpected exception."

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_setting_norm_with_existing_colorbar()
```

This script attempts to capture the specific error message that aligns with the reported issue, then uses the `assert` statement to flag the test as failed when the specific error scenario is identified. If no error occurs, or an unexpected error type is caught, the script provides feedback through standard output or raises the exceptions accordingly. This ensures that only the targeted issue will cause the `AssertionError` to be raised, and any environment or version changes that resolve or do not exhibit the issue will allow the script to complete normally.
