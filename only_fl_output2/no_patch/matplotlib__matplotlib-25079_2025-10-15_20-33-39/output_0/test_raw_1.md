Given that the initial reproduction script didn't capture the issue as experienced, let's adjust the approach to manually trigger the scenario described. This adjustment involves directly interacting with the colorbar's updating mechanisms after setting the new norm, an area potentially missed in the previous script.

```python
# reproducer.py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.colors import LogNorm
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_setting_norm_with_existing_colorbar():
    # create some random data to fill a 2d plot
    rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
    img = rng.uniform(1, 5, (25, 25))

    # plot it
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    mesh = ax.pcolormesh(img)
    cbar = fig.colorbar(mesh, ax=ax)

    vmin = 1
    vmax = 5

    plt.ion()
    fig.canvas.draw()
    plt.pause(0.1)

    try:
        # Attempt to update norm and redraw
        mesh.set_norm(LogNorm(vmin, vmax))
        mesh.changed()  # Inform the mappable that the mapping has changed
        fig.canvas.draw_idle()  # Request re-draw at next opportunity
        plt.pause(0.1)
        
        # Verify the issue
        assert mesh.norm.vmin == vmin and mesh.norm.vmax == vmax, "Norm not applied correctly."
        
        # Since mesh.changed() might not raise an exception directly in this script context,
        # Ensure downstream effects can correctly reflect the norm change. This includes redrawing without errors
        # and the colorbar accurately representing the new norm settings.
        
        print("Test passed: Norm updated without error. Please visually inspect colorbar for correct log scaling.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "Test failed with an exception."

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_setting_norm_with_existing_colorbar()
```

Note: This script includes a `plt.pause(0.1)` instead of a longer pause to make it less dependent on user-interaction for script progression. The script now also checks if the `LogNorm` setting operation succeeds by directly setting the norm and using `mesh.changed()` to notify matplotlib of the change. If this does not generate visible or error-related side effects in your environment or if the traceback isn't generated as expected, further investigation into how matplotlib versions >=3.6.3 handle `set_norm` with an associated colorbar may be necessary. Moreover, this script assumes the environment continues to remain non-interactive (`plt.ion()` is used) and manual inspection for the colorbar after running might be useful in verifying the visual correctness apart from just script execution success indication.
