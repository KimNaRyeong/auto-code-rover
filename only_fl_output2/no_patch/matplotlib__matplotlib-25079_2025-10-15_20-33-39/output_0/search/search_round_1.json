        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides valuable insight into the issue at hand, centered around updating the norm of a plot with an associated colorbar to use `LogNorm` after it has been displayed. Here's what we've learned:\n\n### Analyzing `update_scalarmappable` Method\n\nThe method `update_scalarmappable` in `matplotlib/collections.py` is crucial for this issue, as it handles updating the color mapping based on scalar values. The traceback points out that this method is where the exception is raised. The method:\n\n1. **Functionality**: It updates the colors of the collection based on the scalar mappable array (`_A`). This array represents the data values that the collection uses to map to colors. The method checks the dimensionality of `_A`, processes the alpha (transparency) values, if provided, and then uses the `to_rgba` method to generate the actual colors.\n\n2. **Relationship with the Bug**: The error occurs during the color mapping update when trying to apply `LogNorm`. The bug description suggests that setting `plot.norm` to `LogNorm` after the colorbar has been created does not work as expected. The error message \"Invalid vmin or vmax\" implies a failure in the normalization process, possibly during `self.to_rgba(self._A, self._alpha)` call within `update_scalarmappable`. This could mean that either:\n   - The normalization parameters (`vmin` and `vmax`) do not satisfy `LogNorm` requirements at the time of the call.\n   - The adjustment to the `plot.norm` does not properly propagate to this method, potentially due to missing updates to associated attributes or the scalar mappable array itself (`_A`).\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: Upon changing the norm of a plot, especially to `LogNorm`, the expected behavior would involve correctly updating both the plot and the associated colorbar without raising an error. This means successfully re-mapping the data values to the color spectrum based on the new norm, ensuring any parameters (`vmin`, `vmax`) are valid and properly utilized.\n\nGiven these insights and considering the inability to directly find references to the code patterns `plot.norm = LogNorm(vmin, vmax)` and `fig.colorbar(plot, ax=ax)` in the codebase, we need to gather more context on how norms are applied to plots and colorbars in Matplotlib. This includes understanding how norms like `LogNorm` interact with data and visuals when settings are modified post-creation.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context\n\nTo address gaps in our understanding, we can perform additional API calls focused on:\n1. Investigating the usage and application of `LogNorm`. Since `search_class(\"LogNorm\")` returned no results, we could explore related utilities or functions that deal with normalization, possibly looking for `LogNorm` within methods rather than as a standalone class.\n   \n2. Understanding how the colorbar is updated in response to changes in its associated plot, specifically focusing on post-creation norm settings. Exploring methods related to colorbar updates or re-drawing might be informative.\n\n3. Since direct references to the problematic code patterns weren't found, analyzing how other norm settings (like `Normalize` or any norm adjustments) are handled in the context of plots and colorbars could offer analogies.\n\nGiven the current information, a potential follow-up API call might involve:\n- `search_method(\"LogNorm\")`: To see if there are relevant methods that instantiate or handle `LogNorm` indirectly.\n- `search_method(\"Colorbar.update_normal\")`: Assuming such a method exists, it could show how colorbars respond to changes in the normalization of the plot they reference.\n\nThis approach aims to illuminate the underlying cause of the issue by piecing together how Matplotlib handles dynamic updates to plot norms and color mappings, setting the stage for a targeted patch."

It should allow for dynamic updates to the norm of the collection used in a plot with an associated colorbar. \n     - When `plot.norm` is set to a new norm (like `LogNorm`) after initial creation and display, it should trigger a re-evaluation of the collection's scalar mappable properties (`self._A` in this context) based on the new normalization parameters. This might involve ensuring that:\n        - The collection's internal representations of `vmin` and `vmax` are updated to reflect those of the newly applied norm.\n        - Any transformations required by the new norm (e.g., logarithmic scaling by `LogNorm`) are correctly applied to the scalar mappable array.\n        - The method handles re-mapping of color values effectively without error and ensures the colorbar is also updated to reflect changes in the norm.\n     - The correction might include checks or updates to normalization parameters (`vmin` and `vmax`) within this method or prior to its invocation to ensure they are compatible with the applied norm. Additionally, it may require adjustments to the sequence of operations within `update_scalarmappable` or mechanisms to properly propagate norm updates from the plot to the associated colorbar."
