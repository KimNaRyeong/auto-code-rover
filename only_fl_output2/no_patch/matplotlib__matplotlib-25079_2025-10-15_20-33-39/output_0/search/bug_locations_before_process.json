        "intended_behavior": "This method should ensure that when the norm is updated, especially to LogNorm, it properly checks and applies vmin and vmax values to avoid raising an 'Invalid vmin or vmax' error. It should allow for dynamic updates to the norm of the collection used in a plot with an associated colorbar. When plot.norm is set to a new norm (like LogNorm) after initial creation and display, it should trigger a re-evaluation of the collection's scalar mappable properties (self._A in this context) based on the new normalization parameters. This might involve ensuring that: - The collection's internal representations of vmin and vmax are updated to reflect those of the newly applied norm. - Any transformations required by the new norm (e.g., logarithmic scaling by LogNorm) are correctly applied to the scalar mappable array. - The method handles re-mapping of color values effectively without error and ensures the colorbar is also updated to reflect changes in the norm. The correction might include checks or updates to normalization parameters (vmin and vmax) within this method or prior to its invocation to ensure they are compatible with the applied norm. Additionally, it may require adjustments to the sequence of operations within update_scalarmappable or mechanisms to properly propagate norm updates from the plot to the associated colorbar."
