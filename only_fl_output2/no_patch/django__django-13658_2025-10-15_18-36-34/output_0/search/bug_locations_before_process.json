        "intended_behavior": "In the `execute` method, when instantiating the `CommandParser`, the code should pass the `prog=self.prog_name` argument to ensure that the command parser uses the program name determined in the `__init__` method of the `ManagementUtility` class. This change warrants that the program name used throughout the command execution is consistent, especially important in environments where `sys.argv[0]` may not be reliable or is malformed. This modification maintains the existing functionality while ensuring the `prog` name is consistently used as determined by the initial setup of the `ManagementUtility` instance."
