Instead, it should refer to self.prog_name. This can fixed as follows:\nparser = CommandParser(\nprog=self.prog_name,\nusage='%(prog)s subcommand [options] [args]',\nadd_help=False,\nallow_abbrev=False)\nI'm aware that execute_from_command_line is a private API, but it'd be really convenient for me if it worked properly in my weird embedded environment where sys.argv[0] is \u200bincorrectly None. If passing my own argv to execute_from_command_line avoided all the ensuing exceptions, I wouldn't have to modify sys.argv[0] globally as I'm doing in the meantime.\n</issue>"

We need to find where the `ManagementUtility` class is defined to understand its structure and initialization process:\n   - `search_class(\"ManagementUtility\")`\n\n2. The issue mentions the `__init__` method of `ManagementUtility`, so we will search for this method within the `ManagementUtility` class to examine how `argv` and `prog_name` are being handled:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"ManagementUtility\")`\n\n3. Since the issue also involves how `CommandParser` is instantiated, particularly the change needed for the `prog` argument, it would be useful to locate where `CommandParser` is being used within the `ManagementUtility` class. We're specifically looking for the instantiation that neglects to pass `prog=self.prog_name`:  \n   - `search_code_in_class(\"CommandParser(\", \"ManagementUtility\")`\n\n4. Additionally, understanding how `execute_from_command_line` functions, which is hinted to be affected, might provide more insight, especially in the context of handling `argv`. Although it's mentioned as a private API, it's pertinent to see its implementation or usage:\n   - `search_method(\"execute_from_command_line\")`\n\nThese search API calls should retrieve the relevant sections of the codebase necessary to craft a patch addressing the issue described."

Given that the class might be contained within a specific file and knowing the `__init__` method is crucial for understanding how `argv` and `prog_name` are set, we should search broadly for this method in the codebase since I don't have the specific file path yet:\n   - `search_method(\"__init__\")`\n\n3. For details specifically about how `CommandParser` is instantiated including where the mentioned issue occurs, a direct string search for this instantiation will be vital. Given the lack of specific file paths from the initial descriptions, a broad search will be necessary:\n   - `search_code(\"CommandParser(usage='%(prog)s subcommand [options] [args]', add_help=False, allow_abbrev=False)\")`\n   \n4. Lastly, to explore the `execute_from_command_line` method as it is relevant for the issue despite being marked as private:\n    - `search_method(\"execute_from_command_line\")`\n\nThese corrected API calls focus directly on locating the relevant classes, methods, and exact code usage necessary to understand and ultimately address the described issue."
