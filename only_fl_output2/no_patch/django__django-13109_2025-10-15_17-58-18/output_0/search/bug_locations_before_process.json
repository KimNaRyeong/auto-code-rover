        "intended_behavior": "The code within this method currently uses the `_default_manager` to filter and validate if a given foreign key value exists within the associated model. This causes issues when the `_default_manager` applies custom filtering that excludes valid records, such as archived items. To solve the reported issue, the method should be adjusted to use the `_base_manager`. The `_base_manager` does not apply any custom filtering defined in managers, therefore ensuring all records of the associated model are considered during validation, including those that are archived or otherwise filtered out by the `_default_manager`.\n\nThe modification involves changing the line of code from:\n```python\nqs = self.remote_field.model._default_manager.using(using).filter(**{self.remote_field.field_name: value})\n```\nTo:\n```python\nqs = self.remote_field.model._base_manager.using(using).filter(**{self.remote_field.field_name: value})\n```\n\nThis change should be made while ensuring that it does not adversely affect other parts of the Django framework that rely on `ForeignKey.validate()`. It's essential to preserve the existing functionality for scenarios where the `_default_manager` behavior is expected and correct. An in-depth review and testing phase would be necessary to validate that this change does not introduce regressions or unintended behavior changes elsewhere. This approach aims to make the validation process more flexible and accommodating to different usage contexts, such as when forms or other mechanisms need to consider all possible model instances, without being constrained by the filters applied in a model's default manager."
