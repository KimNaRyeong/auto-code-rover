This is because the ForeignKey validation always uses _default_manager instead of _base_manager. The user facing error message is \"article instance with id 123 does not exist.\" (quite confusing to typical users). The code for this validation is here:\n\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/94f63b926fd32d7a7b6e2591ef72aa8f040f25cc/django/db/models/fields/related.py#L917-L919\nThe FavoriteAriclesForm is specifically designed to use a different manager, but the ForeignKey validation makes this difficult.\nIn this example scenario, it is not acceptable to change the model's default manager as the default should avoid archived articles in other typical scenarios.\nSuggested solution: the ForeignKey validation should use the _base_manager instead which does not include the default filters.\n</issue>"

Since the issue is directly related to `ForeignKey.validate()`, we'll need to look at the implementation of this method to understand how it currently uses `_default_manager` and how we can change it to use `_base_manager` instead. The location in the Django GitHub repository was given, but we'll simulate looking it up in our codebase:\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"validate\", \"ForeignKey\")\n```\n\n2. The issue mentions that the validation is problematic when using a custom manager for a model (`ArticleManager`) that excludes certain records (in this case, archived articles). To understand how managers are normally interacted with by the `ForeignKey` field, we may need to look at both the implementation of the custom manager (`ArticleManager`) and how `ForeignKey` fields are resolved. First, let's look for the custom manager:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"ArticleManager\")\n```\n\n3. To better understand how Django's model forms utilize the `ForeignKey` validation, especially in the context of `FavoriteAriclesForm` which tries to override the queryset with `Article._base_manager.all()`, it might help to see any mentions or usages of `Form` and `ModelForm` related to `ForeignKey` fields:\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"forms.ModelForm\")\nsearch_code(\"self.fields['article'].queryset\")\n```\n\nThese searches aim to provide a comprehensive overview of how `ForeignKey.validate()`, custom managers, and model forms work together in Django and shed light on the potential modifications needed to address the issue."

It checks if an instance with the given value as the foreign key exists in the related model by filtering on the foreign key field. If no such instance exists, it raises a `ValidationError`.\n   - **Relationship to the bug**: The issue arises because the method uses `_default_manager` for validation, which may exclude some valid instances due to custom filtering (e.g., excluding archived articles). This results in a situation where valid data (from the perspective of the base dataset) is considered invalid because it's filtered out by the default manager's criteria.\n   - **Intended behavior given the issue description**: The intended behavior would be for the `validate` method to use `_base_manager` instead of `_default_manager`. `_base_manager` accesses all instances of the model without applying the custom filters defined in the default manager. This change would ensure that validation checks all possible instances, including those that might be excluded by a custom manager's filters (such as archived articles).\n\nGiven the results:\n\n- Since the search for `ArticleManager` and `self.fields['article'].queryset` yielded no results, it implies that either these particular implementations are custom/user-defined parts not represented in Django's core codebase, or that the naming and details provided might not have been indexed correctly in our simulated environment. The `ArticleManager` and its exclusion of archived articles are central to understanding the setup that leads to the validation issue. Without direct code examples, we're left to infer based on standard Django ORM behavior and the details provided in the issue description.\n\n- The `forms.ModelForm` snippets indicate its widespread use within Django but do not directly illuminate the bug at hand since our simulated environment did not return the custom form code (`FavoriteAriclesForm`). However, understanding how `ModelForm` works and interacts with model fields, including setting custom `queryset` properties on form fields, is crucial. The standard practice reflects altering form fields\u2019 querysets in `__init__` methods of forms inheriting from `ModelForm`, which the issue description suggests is not being respected by the `ForeignKey.validate` method.\n\nGiven these analyses, we might consider additional API calls to search for usage patterns of `_base_manager` vs. `_default_manager` within field validation across the Django project, or look for documentation/comments within the code that might explain the rationale behind using `_default_manager` in this validation context. However, based on the information we have, we can deduce the core issue and contemplate a fix that involves adjusting the `ForeignKey.validate` method to utilize `_base_manager` to include all instances during validation. This approach would align the validation mechanism with the broader range of instances that might be considered valid within custom forms or other contexts where the full set of model instances needs to be considered."

This causes issues when the `_default_manager` applies custom filtering that excludes valid records, such as archived items. To solve the reported issue, the method should be adjusted to use the `_base_manager`. The `_base_manager` does not apply any custom filtering defined in managers, therefore ensuring all records of the associated model are considered during validation, including those that are archived or otherwise filtered out by the `_default_manager`.\n   \n   The modification involves changing the line of code from:\n   ```python\n   qs = self.remote_field.model._default_manager.using(using).filter(**{self.remote_field.field_name: value})\n   ```\n   To:\n   ```python\n   qs = self.remote_field.model._base_manager.using(using).filter(**{self.remote_field.field_name: value})\n   ```\n   \n   This change should be made while ensuring that it does not adversely affect other parts of the Django framework that rely on `ForeignKey.validate()`. It's essential to preserve the existing functionality for scenarios where the `_default_manager` behavior is expected and correct. An in-depth review and testing phase would be necessary to validate that this change does not introduce regressions or unintended behavior changes elsewhere. This approach aims to make the validation process more flexible and accommodating to different usage contexts, such as when forms or other mechanisms need to consider all possible model instances, without being constrained by the filters applied in a model's default manager."
