To create a standalone Python script `reproducer.py` that reproduces the described issue and adheres strictly to the instructions provided, without needing additional dependencies aside from Sphinx and its dependencies, some adjustments will be necessary. Below is a script designed to simulate the reported behavior. Given the nature of the issue, involving Sphinx's handling of SVG inheritance diagrams, we'll assume you have a typical Sphinx project setup and that `sphinx.ext.inheritance_diagram` has been correctly added to your `conf.py`.

This script will:
1. Generate a simple Sphinx documentation setup with an inheritance diagram.
2. Build the Sphinx documentation.
3. Verify that the generated SVG links are correct relative to their usage location.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys
from xml.etree import ElementTree as ET

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    doc_path = 'docs_source'
    build_path = 'docs_build'
    
    # Step 1: Configure Sphinx setup (simplified for brevity)
    if not os.path.exists(doc_path):
        os.makedirs(doc_path)
    
    with open(os.path.join(doc_path, 'index.rst'), 'w') as f:
        f.write(".. inheritance-diagram:: MyPackage.MyClass1\n")

    with open(os.path.join(doc_path, 'conf.py'), 'w') as f:
        f.write("extensions = ['sphinx.ext.inheritance_diagram']\n")
        f.write("inheritance_graph_attrs = dict(size='\"6.0, 8.0\"', ratio='compress')\n")

    # Step 2: Build Sphinx documentation
    try:
        subprocess.check_call(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', doc_path, build_path])
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    # Step 3: Verify SVG links are correct
    svg_file_path = os.path.join(build_path, 'my_package', 'index.html')  # Correct path as per your structure
    try:
        tree = ET.parse(svg_file_path)
        root = tree.getroot()
        links = root.findall('.//{http://www.w3.org/2000/svg}a')
        for link in links:
            href = link.get('{http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink}href')
            if not href.startswith('my_package/'):
                raise AssertionError(f"Incorrect link found: {href}")

        print("All links are correct.")
    except ET.ParseError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Important Considerations:**

- Make sure Sphinx is installed in your environment. This script assumes Sphinx can be called using `sphinx-build` directly from the command line.
- The actual path for the SVG file (`svg_file_path`) and verification logic inside the `try` block for parsing and checking links might need adjustments based on your specific project structure and requirements.
- This script makes use of Python standard libraries and Sphinx only.
- If `docutils` or any other dependency is missing, please ensure to install them via your package manager (`pip install sphinx docutils`).

Please adjust function bodies, file paths, and Sphinx settings as necessary for your project's structure and requirements.
