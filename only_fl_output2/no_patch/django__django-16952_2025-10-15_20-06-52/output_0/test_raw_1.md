Based on the initial setup and the additional requirement for error handling as described, a revised version of the `reproducer.py` script would look something like this. This script is designed to function within a Django project context and will attempt to accurately reproduce the issue detailed in the description, including creating the necessary models and performing operations that lead to the error scenario.

```python
import os
import sys
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

# Setup minimal Django settings
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
settings.configure(
    BASE_DIR=BASE_DIR,
    DEBUG=True,
    SECRET_KEY='a-very-secret-key',
    DATABASES={
        "default": {
            "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
            "NAME": os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "db.sqlite3"),
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=(
        '__main__',  # This script as an app
    ),
    DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD='django.db.models.BigAutoField',  # Resolve system check warning
)

django.setup()

class Place(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    address = models.CharField(max_length=80)

class Restaurant(Place):
    serves_hot_dogs = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    serves_pizza = models.BooleanField(default=False)

class ItalianRestaurant(Restaurant):
    serves_gnocchi = models.BooleanField(default=False)

class ItalianRestaurantManyParents(ItalianRestaurant, Place):
    pass

# Define a function to print the detailed stack trace when exceptions occur
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Function to reproduce the issue and print a stack trace if it occurs
def reproduce_issue():
    try:
        # Attempt to create an instance that leads to the reported crash
        ItalianRestaurantManyParents.objects.create(
            name="Test Ristorante",
            address="123 Test Ave"
        )
        # Expected failure point
        print("The script did not encounter the expected issue.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Raise assertion error if the specific issue is caught
        assert isinstance(e, AttributeError), "The script encountered an unexpected exception type."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Apply migrations
    execute_from_command_line(['manage.py', 'migrate', '--noinput'])
    
    # Reproduce the issue
    reproduce_issue()
```

Please ensure this script runs within a properly configured Django project environment. The script does the following:

1. Sets up a minimal Django configuration for the script to run as a Django "app."
2. Defines the model structure necessary to reproduce the issue, focusing on multi-table inheritance (MTI).
3. Implements the `print_stacktrace` function to capture detailed stack traces whenever an exception occurs.
4. Attempts to reproduce the described issue by performing operations that should lead to the AttributeError specified in the initial problem description.
5. Calls `execute_from_command_line` to apply necessary Django migrations before attempting to reproduce the issue. This step ensures that the database schema matches the defined models.

After setting up, running this revised script (`python3 reproducerer.py`) within your Django project root should attempt to trigger the reported issue, capture any exceptions, and print a detailed traceback if the issue occurs as described.
