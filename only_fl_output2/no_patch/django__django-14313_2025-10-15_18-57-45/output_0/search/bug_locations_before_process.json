This adjustment should ensure that deletion operations through the admin interface work seamlessly, even when the underlying queryset is complex or involves many-to-many relationships that necessitate the use of `.distinct()`. The existing functionality of the method to allow for bulk deletion of selected records through the admin interface must be preserved, ensuring that it does not throw `TypeError` when `.distinct()` is part of the queryset chain."

        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `delete` method to either intelligently handle querysets with a `.distinct()` chain call or provide a more descriptive error message guiding developers on how to proceed. If possible, adapt the deletion process to work with distinct querysets without raising errors, perhaps by internally reworking the queryset to a state where deletion is permissible. Care should be taken to ensure that this does not inadvertently lead to the deletion of unintended records, preserving the exact semantics of the operation as intended by the developer\u2019s use of `.distinct()`. Both modifications aim to address and prevent the internal server error when attempting to delete records via the admin interface under specific conditions, notably keeping the application's logic and integrity intact while enhancing robustness in handling complex queryset scenarios."
