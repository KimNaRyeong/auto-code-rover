Debian Jessie ships with 3.8.7 and was EOL June 30, 2020.\nSQLite 3.9.0 was released in October 2015.

        "content": "To address the issue of dropping support for SQLite versions lower than 3.9.0, it would be valuable to identify the parts of the codebase that specifically check for SQLite version compatibility. This could include initializations, feature checks, or configurations related to SQLite. Given the description of the issue, it's likely that the project has some mechanisms to determine the version of SQLite being used and conditionally enable or disable features based on that version. Potential starting points for this investigation include:\n\n- Places where the project interacts with SQLite features that are version dependent, such as indexes on expressions and the JSON1 extension mentioned in the issue.\n- Configuration files or environment setup scripts that might specify required SQLite version or check for it.\n- Utility functions or classes that abstract database interactions, possibly encapsulating version checks.\n\nGiven these considerations, the following API calls could help gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for database initialization or configuration code**: This could involve looking for methods that initialize the database connection, possibly checking the SQLite version during this process.\n   - `search_code(\"SQLite version check\")`\n   - `search_code(\"SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1\")`\n\n2. **Investigate specific features** mentioned in the issue to see how they're implemented or conditioned upon SQLite versions:\n   - `search_code(\"indexes on expressions\")`\n\n3. **Utility functions or classes related to database interaction**: These might include checks for feature support based on the SQLite version.\n   - `search_method(\"get_sqlite_version\")`\n   - `search_class(\"DatabaseUtility\")` (assuming a utility class might exist; the exact name will vary based on the project's naming conventions.)\n\nThese selected API calls aim to find code snippets and components directly related to SQLite version handling, feature conditional logic, and overall database setup or utility functions that might be involved in such checks."

Since explicit references to SQLite version checks, the JSON1 extension, and indexes on expressions were not found, we should consider looking for:\n\n1. **General database configuration or setup**: Identification of where and how the database connection is established might lead us to the version check logic, if such logic is not explicitly named or is done in a more indirect manner.\n   \n2. **Feature detection or compatibility layers**: Projects often have utility functions or methods for detecting the availability of certain features, which might not be explicitly named after those features. \n\n3. **Fallback mechanisms or feature flags**: Sometimes, feature support is determined through fallback mechanisms or by setting flags based on the environment or database capabilities.\n\nConsidering these angles, let's attempt a broader set of search queries:\n\n- **Search for general database or SQLite setup and initialization logic**. This might not be directly named for version checks but could be where such checks are performed.\n  - `search_code(\"initialize database\")`\n  - `search_code(\"establish connection\")`\n  \n- **Look into how the project handles external dependencies or capability checks**. This could provide insight into implicit version checking mechanisms.\n  - `search_method(\"is_feature_supported\")`\n  - `search_method(\"check_database_compatibility\")`\n  \n- **Inspect configuration or settings files** that might contain clues about required versions or how the project adjusts based on the database engine.\n  - `search_code(\"DATABASES\")`\n  - `search_code(\"db_config\")`\n  \nThese searches aim to find indirect references to SQLite version handling and feature support within the project. If the project has a consistent way of dealing with external dependencies or feature compatibility, understanding these mechanisms will be crucial for correctly addressing the issue."
