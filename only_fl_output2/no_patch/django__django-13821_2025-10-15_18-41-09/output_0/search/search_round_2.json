This could include initializations, feature checks, or configurations related to SQLite. Given the description of the issue, it's likely that the project has some mechanisms to determine the version of SQLite being used and conditionally enable or disable features based on that version. Potential starting points for this investigation include:\n\n- Places where the project interacts with SQLite features that are version dependent, such as indexes on expressions and the JSON1 extension mentioned in the issue.\n- Configuration files or environment setup scripts that might specify required SQLite version or check for it.\n- Utility functions or classes that abstract database interactions, possibly encapsulating version checks.\n\nGiven these considerations, the following API calls could help gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for database initialization or configuration code**: This could involve looking for methods that initialize the database connection, possibly checking the SQLite version during this process.\n   - `search_code(\"SQLite version check\")`\n   - `search_code(\"SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1\")`\n\n2. **Investigate specific features** mentioned in the issue to see how they're implemented or conditioned upon SQLite versions:\n   - `search_code(\"indexes on expressions\")`\n\n3. **Utility functions or classes related to database interaction**: These might include checks for feature support based on the SQLite version.\n   - `search_method(\"get_sqlite_version\")`\n   - `search_class(\"DatabaseUtility\")` (assuming a utility class might exist; the exact name will vary based on the project's naming conventions.)\n\nThese selected API calls aim to find code snippets and components directly related to SQLite version handling, feature conditional logic, and overall database setup or utility functions that might be involved in such checks."

        "content": "Given the search results, the information we've gathered points us towards files related to database handling in a Django project setting. The mention of several specific files suggests that the issue of dropping support for SQLite versions below 3.9.0 will need to be addressed within the database backend configuration, particularly for the SQLite backend.\n\n### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The files listed (e.g., `django/db/utils.py`, `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py`, etc.) seem to deal with database configuration, connection setup, and backend-specific settings in a Django application. These files likely contain logic for initializing database connections, defining global settings (including database configurations), and specifying backend-specific behaviors.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Since the issue involves dropping support for older versions of SQLite, the relevant code sections might be where the Django project determines which database features to enable based on the SQLite version used. Specifically, `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py` is a likely place where the version of SQLite impacts how the database backend is configured and interacts with SQLite-specific features.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would involve ensuring that the project does not attempt to use SQLite features unavailable in versions before 3.9.0, or alternatively, it refuses to operate with SQLite versions below 3.9.0. This could involve adding explicit version checks before enabling certain features, or documentation/warnings/errors specifying the minimum SQLite version requirement.\n\n### Necessary Locations for Fixes\n\n1. **Location: File: `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py`**\n   - **Intended Behavior**: This file should include a version check during the database connection setup or initialization phase. If the current SQLite version is below 3.9.0, Django should raise a configuration error indicating that the SQLite version is not supported. This preserves the functionality for supported versions while explicitly preventing the use of unsupported versions. Additionally, comments or documentation within the code should be updated to reflect this minimum version requirement.\n\n2. **Global Settings and Backend Creation Files:**\n   - While `django/db/utils.py` and `django/conf/global_settings.py` might not require changes specific to version checking, reviewing these for references to SQLite or database defaults would be wise to ensure consistency with the new version requirement.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Ensure any global defaults or utility functions that relate to databases are compatible with or aware of the new SQLite version requirement. There might not be a specific change needed here unless these files contain version-dependent logic.\n\nBy focusing on these files, especially on establishing a version check within the SQLite backend configuration, the project can effectively drop support for SQLite < 3.9.0, aligning with the issue's requirements. This approach maintains existing functionality for versions above 3.9.0 and provides a clear error message for unsupported versions, guiding users towards compliance with the new requirements."

The code here should be modified to include a check early in the database connection setup process to determine the version of SQLite. If the version is found to be lower than 3.9.0, the connection setup should raise a `ConfigurationError` (or a similarly appropriate exception) that clearly informs the developer that their version of SQLite is not supported and that they should upgrade to at least version 3.9.0. This change ensures that developers or deployers of Django applications are made explicitly aware of the incompatibility, preventing subtle bugs or unsupported feature usage in older versions of SQLite. Additionally, the exception message should guide users on how to resolve the issue (i.e., upgrading SQLite).\n\nFurthermore, ensuring that this change is clearly documented within the release notes and backend documentation is vital for maintaining the transparency of Django's database backend requirements. This documentation should highlight the new SQLite version requirement, its rationale, and potential impacts on developers and deployments."
