Debian Jessie ships with 3.8.7 and was EOL June 30, 2020.\nSQLite 3.9.0 was released in October 2015. SQLite version support seems like a similar situation as GEOS libraries which we generally support about 5 years after released.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue of dropping support for SQLite versions lower than 3.9.0, it would be valuable to identify the parts of the codebase that specifically check for SQLite version compatibility. This could include initializations, feature checks, or configurations related to SQLite. Given the description of the issue, it's likely that the project has some mechanisms to determine the version of SQLite being used and conditionally enable or disable features based on that version. Potential starting points for this investigation include:\n\n- Places where the project interacts with SQLite features that are version dependent, such as indexes on expressions and the JSON1 extension mentioned in the issue.\n- Configuration files or environment setup scripts that might specify required SQLite version or check for it.\n- Utility functions or classes that abstract database interactions, possibly encapsulating version checks.\n\nGiven these considerations, the following API calls could help gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for database initialization or configuration code**: This could involve looking for methods that initialize the database connection, possibly checking the SQLite version during this process.\n   - `search_code(\"SQLite version check\")`\n   - `search_code(\"SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1\")`\n\n2. **Investigate specific features** mentioned in the issue to see how they're implemented or conditioned upon SQLite versions:\n   - `search_code(\"indexes on expressions\")`\n\n3. **Utility functions or classes related to database interaction**: These might include checks for feature support based on the SQLite version.\n   - `search_method(\"get_sqlite_version\")`\n   - `search_class(\"DatabaseUtility\")` (assuming a utility class might exist; the exact name will vary based on the project's naming conventions.)\n\nThese selected API calls aim to find code snippets and components directly related to SQLite version handling, feature conditional logic, and overall database setup or utility functions that might be involved in such checks."
