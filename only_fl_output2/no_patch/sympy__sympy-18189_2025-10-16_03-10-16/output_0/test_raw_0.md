This script checks if the `diophantine` function in `sympy` returns the same set of solutions when the order of the symbols is changed and `permute=True` is set. The expected behavior is that the order of symbols does not affect the outcome when `permute` is `True`, which means all permutations of the symbols should yield the same set of solutions. If the assertion fails, it confirms the issue is present, and it prints the stack trace of the issue. If the issue is fixed, the script will complete without raising an `AssertionError`, indicating no problem with the symbol permutation's effect on the results.
