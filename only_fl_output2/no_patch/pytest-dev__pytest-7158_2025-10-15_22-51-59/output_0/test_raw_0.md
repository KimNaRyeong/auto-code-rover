Here's a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that should help reproduce the issue described:

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys

# Function to print the stack trace of an exception
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_test_environment():
    os.makedirs("my_tests", exist_ok=True)
    with open("my_tests/test1.py", "w") as f:
        f.write("""
import pytest

@pytest.mark.skip(reason="no way of currently testing this")
def test_example():
    assert True
""")

    if not os.path.exists("pytest"):
        os.mkdir("pytest")

def run_pytest_and_check_output():
    # Move to the pytest directory
    os.chdir("pytest")
    # Execute pytest and capture the output
    result = subprocess.run(["pytest", "-rs", "../my_tests/test1.py"], capture_output=True, text=True)
    os.chdir("..")  # Move back to the root directory
    
    # Check if the output contains the correct path
    if "SKIPPED [1] ../my_tests/test1.py:3" not in result.stdout:
        raise AssertionError("Pytest skip report does not show the correct relative path.")

def main():
    try:
        setup_test_environment()
        run_pytest_and_check_output()
        print("The issue is fixed.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script will:
1. Create a test environment with a specified directory structure and a simple test file that will be skipped.
2. Run pytest against the test file located in a directory above the invocation directory (mimicking your original issue statement).
3. Check the pytest output for the correct skip report format that includes the relative path from the invocation directory to the test file.
4. Print a stack trace and exit with code 1 if the expected output is not found (indicating the issue is present).
5. Print a success message and exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed.

Make sure that before running this script:
- `pytest` is installed in your environment.
- You have permissions to create directories and write files in your current working directory.
