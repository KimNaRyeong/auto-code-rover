Certainly, I will create a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that you can run to reproduce the issue you're encountering with printing tables in Astropy when array cells have a length of 0. This script will attempt to create a table with zero-length array cells and will print a stack trace of the issue if the assertion fails, indicating the problem is present. If the issue is fixed, the script should exit with code 0, indicating success.

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from astropy.table import QTable

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    events = [{"A":0,"B":0, "C":np.array([], dtype=np.uint64)},
              {"A":1,"B":0, "C":np.array([], dtype=np.uint64)},
              {"A":2,"B":2, "C":np.array([0,1], dtype=np.uint64)}]
    try:
        table = QTable(rows=events[:2])
        print(table)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue with printing tables having 0-length array cells is present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
    print("The issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0.")
```

When running this script in your environment:
1. Make sure you have the `astropy` and `numpy` packages installed in your Python environment. If not, you can install them using `pip install numpy astropy`.
2. Save the above code to a file named `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project.
3. Execute the script using the command `python3 reproducer.py`.

The script checks if the particular issue with handling tables that contain 0-length array cells in Astropy is present. If an exception is caught, it prints a detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function, helping to pinpoint where the issue occurred. If the issue has been resolved (i.e., no exception is raised), the script will print a success message and exit with code 0.
