        "content": "To start resolving the issue described, we'll need to understand how migrations, especially squashed migrations, are handled and unapplied within the codebase. The key entity involved here is likely the `MigrationExecutor` class, as it's mentioned in the issue description. We're looking to understand how the executor marks migrations as unapplied, and how it specifically deals with squashed migrations and their replaced counterparts. With this in mind, the following API calls will help gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. search_class(\"MigrationExecutor\"): To locate the `MigrationExecutor` class within the codebase and get an overview of which file(s) it resides in.\n2. search_method_in_class(\"unapply_migration\", \"MigrationExecutor\"): Assuming that the process of marking a migration as unapplied would involve a method akin to `unapply_migration` in the `MigrationExecutor` class, this search would help identify the relevant method to investigate.\n3. search_method(\"mark_migration_applied\"): It's plausible that the functionality for marking migrations might be encapsulated within a method named similarly to `mark_migration_applied` or `mark_migration_unapplied`, which might not only exist within the `MigrationExecutor` but also be relevant to the issue.\n4. search_code(\"squashed migration\"): To find code snippets specifically mentioning \"squashed migration\", which could provide additional context on how squashed migrations are treated differently from regular migrations.\n\nThese API calls are crafted to capture a broad spectrum of related code artifacts that are critical for understanding and eventually solving the reported issue."
