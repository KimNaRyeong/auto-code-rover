        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `unapply_migration` method to ensure it adequately handles squashed migrations by marking them as unapplied alongside the individual migrations they replace. After the loop that records each replaced migration as unapplied (`for app_label, name in migration.replaces`), an additional step should be introduced to record the squashed migration itself as unapplied. This ensures the accurate reflection of the migration's status in the system's migration history. The implementation must preserve all existing functionality, specifically the accurate tracking of unapplied migrations, whether they are part of a squashed set or standalone migrations, without altering the flow for other types of migrations. The addition should be a conditional or direct call to `self.recorder.record_unapplied` with the squashed migration's app label and name after all its replaced migrations have been marked as unapplied. This solution addresses the issue's core by recognizing and rectifying the missing logic for squashed migrations' unapplication process, ensuring the database and migration history are in sync."
