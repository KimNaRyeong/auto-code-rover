Let's dissect the information gathered.\n\n### Analysis of `MigrationExecutor` and `unapply_migration`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   The `MigrationExecutor` class is responsible for applying and unapplying migrations within a Django project. The method `unapply_migration` in particular runs a migration backward, essentially undoing the migration. If the migration is not a fake one, it uses a schema editor to revert the migration changes. Moreover, for migrations that replace others (i.e., squashed migrations), it records the unapplied status of each individual migration it replaces.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug**\n   The issue description suggests that when a squashed migration is unapplied, and the original migrations it replaced are still present, only the original migrations are marked as unapplied. However, the squashed migration itself is not marked as unapplied. Given the code snippet from `unapply_migration`, we see it does consider \"replacement migrations\" and records unapplied status for each migration it replaces. Nonetheless, this part of the code doesn't explicitly differentiate or handle the case of the squashed migration itself being marked as unapplied alongside its replaced migrations.\n\n3. **Intended behavior**\n   Ideally, when a squashed migration is unapplied, both the squashed migration and the individual migrations it replaces should be marked as unapplied. This ensures that the system accurately reflects the current state of the database schema and the migrations that have been applied to it. \n\n### Additional Analysis Needed\n\nGiven that `mark_migration_applied` was not found in the codebase, it's possible that this functionality is encapsulated in another method or that the method name provided does not match the actual code. The `record_unapplied` method invoked within `unapply_migration`, however, seems to be directly involved in marking migrations as unapplied. It might be worthwhile to investigate the `record_unapplied` method and the `MigrationRecorder` class that likely contains this method. These components are essential for understanding how migrations' applied and unapplied statuses are tracked.\n\n- **Potential Additional Search**: \n   - search_method_in_class(\"record_unapplied\", \"MigrationRecorder\"): This could provide insights into how migrations are marked as unapplied in the records, which is crucial for resolving the issue.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe code within `MigrationExecutor`'s `unapply_migration` method suggests that while there is a mechanism to handle the unapplying of replaced migrations (as seen with squashed migrations), the methodology for also marking the squashed migration itself as unapplied might be incomplete or not functioning as intended based on the issue description. Further investigation into how migrations are recorded (particularly squashed migrations) could illuminate potential fixes. Specifically, understanding the recording process could help identify why the squashed migration isn't marked as unapplied and lead to a solution that ensures the state of both squashed and individual migrations is accurately tracked."

This would directly address the issue by modifying the behavior within the existing conditional block that checks for `migration.replaces`. After marking each replaced migration as unapplied, the code should also include a step to mark the squashed migration as unapplied. This ensures the migration system accurately represents the state of both the squashed migration and its constituent migrations. The modification should preserve the function's current logic for handling migrations, including fake migrations and handling migrations that do not replace others. The addition should ideally be a few lines of code that check if the migration being unapplied is indeed a squashed migration and, if so, correctly update its status in the migration history to reflect it has been unapplied.\n\nPreserving the existing functionality while introducing this change is crucial. The solution must ensure that all other types of migrations (non-squashed, non-replacing) continue to be unapplied as before, without introducing any side effects or regressions in handling them."

It achieves this by ensuring the migration schema is in place (`self.ensure_schema()`) and then deleting the specified migration (using its `app` label and `name`) from the migrations tracking database. This action effectively marks the migration as unapplied by removing its record.\n   \n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - This method directly relates to the issue at hand, which involves accurately marking both squashed migrations and the migrations they replace as unapplied. The method `record_unapplied` is called within `MigrationExecutor`'s `unapply_migration` method for each of the migrations that a squashed migration replaces. However, there is no explicit call for the squashed migration itself to be similarly marked as unapplied when it is reversed. This omission is the crux of the reported issue.\n   \n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior of the `MigrationRecorder` and its method `record_unapplied` remains technically correct in its current form for the scope of its responsibility. The issue is more about when and how it's invoked rather than the internal workings of the method itself. However, to resolve the issue, the intended behavior in the broader context would be to ensure that `record_unapplied` is called not only for the individual migrations replaced by a squashed migration but also for the squashed migration itself whenever it is unapplied.\n   \n   - This suggests a modification or extension of the logic in the `MigrationExecutor`'s `unapply_migration` method (rather than changing the `record_unapplied` method itself) to include a call that marks the squashed migration as unapplied. Thus, after successfully marking all replaced migrations as unapplied, an additional check and corresponding action should ensure the squashed migration is also recorded as unapplied in the migrations history.\n\n### Summary\n\n- The scrutiny indicates that the `record_unapplied` method does precisely what it's designed to do: mark a specified migration as unapplied by deleting its record from the migrations history. The fault lies not within this method but in the logic that invokes it within the `MigrationExecutor` class. \n- To resolve the reported issue adequately, the `unapply_migration` method in the `MigrationExecutor` should be updated to ensure that it also considers the squashed migration itself for marking as unapplied, along with the migrations it replaces. This resolves the issue by correctly reflecting the state of all related migrations (squashed and replaced) in the migrations history after a squashed migration is unapplied."

After the loop that records each replaced migration as unapplied (`for app_label, name in migration.replaces`), an additional step should be introduced to record the squashed migration itself as unapplied. This ensures the accurate reflection of the migration's status in the system's migration history. The implementation must preserve all existing functionality, specifically the accurate tracking of unapplied migrations, whether they are part of a squashed set or standalone migrations, without altering the flow for other types of migrations. The addition should be a conditional or direct call to `self.recorder.record_unapplied` with the squashed migration's app label and name after all its replaced migrations have been marked as unapplied. This solution addresses the issue's core by recognizing and rectifying the missing logic for squashed migrations' unapplication process, ensuring the database and migration history are in sync."
