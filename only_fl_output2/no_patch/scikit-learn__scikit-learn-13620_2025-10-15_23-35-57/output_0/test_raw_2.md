Given the clarification and the need to integrate the correct stack trace function while ensuring the script raises an AssertionError under the specific conditions provided (i.e., feature importances not summing to 1 or feature importance of any individual tree dropping to 0 after a certain number of estimators), I've updated the script as follows:

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_feature_importances():
    boston = datasets.load_boston()
    X, Y = (boston.data, boston.target)

    n_estimators = 720
    params = {'n_estimators': n_estimators, 'max_depth': 6, 'learning_rate': 0.1, 'random_state': 42}
    clf = GradientBoostingRegressor(**params)
    clf.fit(X, Y)

    feature_importance_sum = np.sum(clf.feature_importances_)
    assert feature_importance_sum <= 1, "Feature importances sum exceed 1"

    all_feature_importances_sum_to_one = True
    for estimator in clf.estimators_:
        if not np.isclose(np.sum(estimator[0].feature_importances_), 1, atol=1e-7):
            all_feature_importances_sum_to_one = False
            break

    # Raise if any tree's feature importances do not sum to 1
    assert all_feature_importances_sum_to_one, "At least one estimator's feature importances do not sum to 1"

try:
    check_feature_importances()
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exiting with non-zero code because the issue is present

sys.exit(0)  # Exiting with zero because the issue has been fixed or is not found
```

A couple of things to note in this updated script:

- **Consistent random state**: A `random_state` parameter is added to ensure the reproducibility of the results. Though the original issue didn't mention randomness affecting the outcome, including `random_state` helps ensure that running this script multiple times yields consistent outcomes.

- **Assertion for feature_importances_sum <= 1**: Given the nature of the issue, I've assumed the condition that the feature importances should not sum to more than 1. The original complaint was about not summing to 1, where feature importances dropping to zero would lead to a sum below 1.

The script closely follows the requirement provided, including checking feature importance sums across all trees within the `GradientBoostingRegressor`. If the conditions for the issue are met (feature importance sums not close to 1), the script will raise an `AssertionError`, print the error stack trace for better debugging, and exit with status code `1`. If the conditions are not met (meaning the issue is either fixed or not replicable with the given parameters), the script exits cleanly with `0`.
