        "content": "<issue>Bug in Gradient Boosting: Feature Importances do not sum to 1\n#### Description\nI found conditions when Feature Importance values do not add up to 1 in ensemble tree methods, like Gradient Boosting Trees or AdaBoost Trees.\nThis error occurs once the ensemble reaches a large number of estimators.  The exact conditions depend variously.  For example, the error shows up sooner with a smaller amount of training samples.  Or, if the depth of the tree is large.\nWhen this error appears, the predicted value seems to have converged.  But it\u2019s unclear if the error is causing the predicted value not to change with more estimators.  In fact, the feature importance sum goes lower and lower with more estimators thereafter.\nConsequently, it's questionable if the tree ensemble code is functioning as expected.\nHere's sample code to reproduce this:\n``` python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import datasets\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor\nboston = datasets.load_boston()\nX, Y = (boston.data, boston.target)\nn_estimators = 720\n# Note: From 712 onwards, the feature importance sum is less than 1\nparams = {'n_estimators': n_estimators, 'max_depth': 6, 'learning_rate': 0.1}\nclf = GradientBoostingRegressor(**params)\nclf.fit(X, Y)\nfeature_importance_sum = np.sum(clf.feature_importances_)\nprint(\"At n_estimators = %i, feature importance sum = %f\" % (n_estimators , feature_importance_sum))\n```\n_Output:_\n```\nAt n_estimators = 720, feature importance sum = 0.987500\n```\nIn fact, if we examine the tree at each staged prediction, we'll see that the feature importance goes to 0 after we hit a certain number of estimators.  (For the code above, it's 712.)\nHere's code to describe what I mean:\n``` python\nfor i, tree in enumerate(clf.estimators_):\nfeature_importance_sum = np.sum(tree[0].feature_importances_)\nprint(\"At n_estimators = %i, feature importance sum = %f\" % (i , feature_importance_sum))\n```\n_Output:_\n```\n...\nAt n_estimators = 707, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 708, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 709, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 710, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 711, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 712, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 713, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 714, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 715, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 716, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 717, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 718, feature importance sum = 0.000000\n...\n```\nI wonder if we\u2019re hitting some floating point calculation error.\nBTW, I've posted this issue on the mailing list [Link](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/scikit-learn/2016-September/000508.html).  There aren't a lot of discussion, but others seem to think there's a bug here too.\nHope we can get this fixed or clarified.\nThank you!\n-Doug\n#### Versions\nWindows-7;'Python', '2.7.9 ;'NumPy', '1.9.2';'SciPy', '0.15.1';'Scikit-Learn', '0.16.1'\n</issue>"

Investigate the main class for Gradient Boosting to understand its structure and relevant methods:\n   - `search_class(\"GradientBoostingRegressor\")`\n\n2. Since the issue could be related to how feature importances are computed, we need to find out more about the implementation of the feature importance calculation:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"feature_importances_\", \"GradientBoostingRegressor\")`\n\n3. The issue mentions ensemble tree methods in general, so it's also important to look at the AdaBoost implementation:\n   - `search_class(\"AdaBoostRegressor\")`\n\n4. Just like with Gradient Boosting, we want to see how AdaBoost computes feature importances:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"feature_importances_\", \"AdaBoostRegressor\")`\n\n5. Since the problem becomes apparent at a high number of estimators, we should investigate how these estimators are stored and accessed:\n   - `search_code(\"estimators_\")`\n\n6. Finally, to understand how the sum of feature importances is being calculated and potentially track down the anomaly at a large number of estimators, it's worth inspecting the actual loop or method responsible for aggregating these importances:\n   - `search_code(\"np.sum(clf.feature_importances_)\")`\n\nThese API calls are aimed at gathering sufficient code context related to the implementation of Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost regressors, the computation of feature importances, and the handling of a large number of estimators. This will help in diagnosing the issue and moving towards a solution."

        "content": "Based on the information collected, let's analyze each piece of context and consider our next steps.\n\n### `GradientBoostingRegressor` Class\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**  \n   The `GradientBoostingRegressor` class is an implementation of gradient boosting for regression. It includes several parameters like `loss`, `learning_rate`, etc., that influence its behavior and performance.   \n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**  \n   The issue mentioned involves `GradientBoostingRegressor`, specifically when a large number of estimators are used. This class is directly related to the bug as it is the implementation of the algorithm where the issue is observed.  \n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**  \n   The intended behavior would be that the feature importance scores computed from the ensemble of trees (estimators) should sum to 1, regardless of the number of estimators involved.\n\nSince we couldn't find the `feature_importances_` attribute directly in the `GradientBoostingRegressor` class, it's probable that it's inherited or dynamically created. The implementation detail of how `feature_importances_` is calculated for this regressor needs further investigation. We should search for how parent classes or mixins define `feature_importances_`.\n\n### `AdaBoostRegressor` Class\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**  \n   The `AdaBoostRegressor` class is an implementation of AdaBoost for regression. Similar to `GradientBoostingRegressor`, it has parameters that configure its learning process.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**  \n   Although the initial issue specifically mentions Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost is another ensemble method where this issue could potentially occur. Understanding its implementation might offer insights into the broader problem with feature importance calculations across different ensemble methods.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**  \n   As with Gradient Boosting, the sum of feature importance scores from AdaBoost's ensemble should ideally sum to 1, regardless of the number of estimators.\n\nGiven the absence of `feature_importances_` information in `AdaBoostRegressor`, we would likely need to explore similar avenues as with `GradientBoostingRegressor` to understand how feature importances are handled.\n\n### `estimators_` attribute\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**  \n   The `estimators_` attribute is mentioned across various files and classes, typically referring to the collection of individual models (trees) in an ensemble method.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**  \n   The issue described appears after a certain number of estimators (trees) have been added to the model. The handling, storage, and interaction with these estimators are crucial to understanding why the sum of feature importances deviates from 1.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**  \n   Properly managing the `estimators_` attribute would involve accurately computing feature importances across all trees and ensuring their sum remains consistent.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the above analysis, the next steps to take would include:\n- Investigating how `feature_importances_` are computed for ensemble methods, possibly by looking into superclasses or utility functions shared by these regressors. Since direct lookups were not successful, inspecting related classes or mixins that might implement this property could be helpful.\n- Specifically examining the handling of the `estimators_` attribute in `GradientBoostingRegressor` could offer insights. The issue could lie in how individual trees' importances are aggregated.\n- Considering the absence of direct references to `np.sum(clf.feature_importances_)`, it might be beneficial to search for related methods or properties that calculate total feature importance, or alternatively, investigate the classes or modules that process or aggregate feature importances across estimators.\n\nTo proceed, I would recommend:\n- Searching for where and how `feature_importances_` are actually defined or calculated in the ensemble methods. This might require looking into base classes or utility functions.\n- Performing a detailed examination of the `estimators_` usage in `sklearn/ensemble/gradient_boosting.py` and `sklearn/ensemble/weight_boosting.py` to understand the logic behind feature importance calculation and aggregation."

This involves revisiting the logic that aggregates feature importances across the ensemble to account for numerical stability and precision, especially as the number of estimators grows large. Ensuring that the sum of feature importances remains 1 across all numbers of estimators is critical. This might involve revising the aggregation method or applying corrections post-calculation to adjust for floating-point arithmetic errors.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**:  \n    - **File**: `sklearn/ensemble/weight_boosting.py`  \n    - **Class**: `AdaBoostRegressor`  \n    - **Description of Intended Behavior**:  \n      Although the `AdaBoostRegressor` wasn't directly implicated in the reported issue, given its similarity to `GradientBoostingRegressor` in terms of being an ensemble method, a preemptive review and potential revision of its `feature_importances_` calculation could be necessary. This would ensure consistency and reliability in how feature importances sum up to 1 across ensemble methods in `scikit-learn`. The review would focus on ensuring that as the number of estimators increases, the integrity of feature importance calculation is maintained. This might not directly address a current bug in `AdaBoostRegressor` but would be a measure to ensure uniformity and prevent potential issues."
