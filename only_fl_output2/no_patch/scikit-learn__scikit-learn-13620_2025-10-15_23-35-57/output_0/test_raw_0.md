This script `reproducer.py` should be executed in the root directory of a project with `python3 reproducer.py`. It raises an `AssertionError` when the condition described in the original issue is observedâ€”a scenario where feature importances of Gradient Boosting Regressor estimators are unexpectedly less than 1.

It utilizes an `assert` statement to enforce that the sum of feature importances should be exactly 1 (with a tiny bit of room for floating-point errors, hence the range `[0.99, 1.01]`). Furthermore, it iterates through all the estimators to identify if at any point any tree's feature importances sum to 0, which should not be the case. If either of these assertions fails, it will catch the exception, print a stack trace detailing the issue, and exit with code 1. If everything performs as expected (i.e., the issue is fixed or does not occur), the script will exit with code 0.
