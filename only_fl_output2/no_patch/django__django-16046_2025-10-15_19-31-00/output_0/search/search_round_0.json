Thus, searching for this line within the codebase can help us find the file and the exact location where the fix is needed.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"if str_number[0] == \\\"-\\\"\")\n```\n\n2. **Gather more context around the found issue's location**: Once the file and the line number where the issue occurs are known, it would be beneficial to see the surrounding code. This will help in understanding the context in which the issue is happening, including variable declarations and any preceding conditional checks.\n\nI'll wait for the results from the first search before making the second call, as the exact arguments for the `get_code_around_line` call depend on the outcome of the `search_code` invocation."
