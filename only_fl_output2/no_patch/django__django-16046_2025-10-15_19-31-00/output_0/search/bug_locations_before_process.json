        "intended_behavior": "Before attempting to access str_number[0], the code should check if str_number is not None and is not an empty string. This would involve adding a preliminary condition to ensure that there is at least one character to inspect, effectively guarding against IndexError when number is null or an empty string. The intended behavior should therefore involve returning an empty string, or a default representation of a null/empty value without attempting to format it as a numeric value. This modification should preserve the existing functionality of handling and formatting numeric values correctly while also avoiding errors when encountering empty or null values."
