        "intended_behavior": "The `__new__` method's handling of the `range` parameter, especially when it is provided as a tuple, must be corrected to explicitly enforce integer bounds. Specifically, the logic around lines 660-663 should be tightened to not only check if `bound.is_integer` is False but also to verify that symbols assumed to be real numbers are explicitly confirmed as integers when constructing `Idx` instances. This means ensuring that both the upper and lower bounds provided as a tuple are indeed integers or designated infinities. An adjustment or additional check is required to reject real symbols that are not explicitly marked as integer bounds, thus preventing the misuse of non-integer bounds for indexing. This modification should not disrupt the current functionality for cases where the bounds are already integers or (negative) infinity. Instead, it should extend the robustness of the constructor to align with the documented or expected behavior: only accepting integer dimension bounds, thereby rectifying the issue reported."
