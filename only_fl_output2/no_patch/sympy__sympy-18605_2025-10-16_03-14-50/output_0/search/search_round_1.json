        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the `Idx` class and its `__new__` method in `sympy/tensor/indexed.py`, let's address the questions:\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `__new__` method in the `Idx` class creates a new instance of `Idx`, which represents an indexed object in symbolic mathematics within SymPy. It accepts a `label` and an optional `range`, among other keyword arguments. The `range` can be either a tuple specifying the lower and upper bounds, an expression representing the upper bound (with the lower bound assumed to be 0), or other types that must raise a TypeError.\n\n- If `range` is a sequence (i.e., a tuple with two elements), the method checks if each bound is an integer or (negative) infinity. If so, it creates an `Idx` object with those bounds.\n- If `range` is a single `Expr`, it checks if it's an integer or infinity. If so, it treats it as the upper limit, with 0 as the default lower limit, and creates an `Idx` object.\n- If `range` does not match these conditions, an appropriate TypeError is raised.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue reports that the constructor allows `range` to be a tuple containing non-integer bounds without raising an error. According to the submitted issue, when passing symbols defined as real (but not explicitly integers), the check on line 661-663 does not trigger the expected `TypeError`, allowing non-integer bounds to be used without objection.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior would be to ensure that both elements of the `range` tuple are explicitly integers (or (negative) infinity), raising a TypeError if not. This enforce that the bounds are suitable for indexing operations, which inherently require integer values.\n\nBased on the analysis, the current implementation fails to prevent non-integer symbols, which are not explicitly marked as integers, from being used as bounds for the `Idx` object. The check `(bound.is_integer is False and bound is not S.Infinity and bound is not S.NegativeInfinity)` should implicitly ensure the bounds are strictly integers, but it appears to allow real-valued symbols through, despite not being integer-specific. The intended correction would involve tightening this logic to ensure real-valued symbols not explicitly marked as integers are correctly caught and rejected.\n\nThe solution might necessitate an additional or modified check on the bounds within the tuple to explicitly ensure they are integers, not merely real or symbolic expressions that could represent a broader range of numbers, including non-integer reals. This improvement would align the behavior with the explicit integer requirement articulated in the issue and help maintain the `Idx` object's semantic integrity as representing an integer-indexable dimension in symbolic mathematical expressions."

Specifically, the logic around lines 660-663 should be tightened to not only check if `bound.is_integer` is False but also to verify that symbols assumed to be real numbers are explicitly confirmed as integers when constructing `Idx` instances. This means ensuring that both the upper and lower bounds provided as a tuple are indeed integers or designated infinities.\n   \n   An adjustment or additional check is required to reject real symbols that are not explicitly marked as integer bounds, thus preventing the misuse of non-integer bounds for indexing. This modification should not disrupt the current functionality for cases where the bounds are already integers or (negative) infinity. Instead, it should extend the robustness of the constructor to align with the documented or expected behavior: only accepting integer dimension bounds, thereby rectifying the issue reported."
