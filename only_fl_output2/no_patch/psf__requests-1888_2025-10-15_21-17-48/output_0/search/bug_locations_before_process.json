        "intended_behavior": "During the redirection process, when a new URL is prepared for the follow-up request, the method should ensure that the URL is encoded as a byte string before it is passed to lower-level operations that require byte strings (such as those performed by pyOpenSSL). This preservation should specifically address the issue where Unicode strings are causing TypeError in OpenSSL.SSL.Connection's sendall method. The intended fix must ensure that all string to byte conversions are compatible with Python's str and bytes types, bearing in mind Python 2 and Python 3 compatibilities, as well as the needs of underlying libraries like pyOpenSSL."
