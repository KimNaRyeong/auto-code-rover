I see that after the redirect is received the returned URL is [decoded to a Unicode string](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/requests/adapters.py#L181). Then requests passes the response to `resolve_redirects` which uses the url to make a new request. This leads to a Unicode string being passed to urllib3 and eventually pyopenssl.

    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, we have several points to consider regarding how they relate to the bug described in the issue:\n\n### 1. `resolve_redirects` Method in `requests/sessions.py`\n\n- **What it does**: This method handles HTTP redirections. It checks if the response indicates a redirect (`location` header present and status code indicating a redirect) and constructs a new request to follow the redirect. It pays special attention to maintaining the method according to the type of redirect, managing cookies, and limiting the maximum number of redirects to prevent infinite loops.\n  \n- **Relationship to the bug**: The method plays a central role in processing redirects, and it eventually leads to the failing scenario described in the issue. The `url` is updated from the `location` header and is meant to be used in a new request. It seems that this process does not ensure the `url` is in the correct byte format expected by `pyOpenSSL`. The issue indicates that the `url` is somehow ending up as a Unicode string, which is not compatible with `pyOpenSSL`'s expectations.\n\n- **Intended behavior**: Upon receiving a redirect, `resolve_redirects` should correctly handle the new URL, ensuring it is properly encoded to meet the expected byte format for subsequent requests. This suggests that either `resolve_redirects` or a related part of the code (possibly where the request is sent) should ensure the URL is encoded correctly.\n\n### 2. `requests.get` Method\n\nWithout specific content from the `get` method, we can still infer its general purpose and relevance:\n\n- **General purpose**: `requests.get` is a high-level method to send a GET request. It's supposed to ease the making of HTTP requests for the users by abstracting away the details of preparing and sending the actual HTTP request.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug**: The issue occurs when using this method to perform a request that results in a `301` redirect. Hence, the method's handling (either in itself or through its calls) of URLs, especially regarding their byte or string type through the redirection process, is critical. The bug might reveal a missed conversion or incorrect handling of URLs as byte strings for secure connections, particularly when SNI and pyOpenSSL are involved.\n\n### 3. Lack of result for `OpenSSL.SSL.Connection`'s `sendall` Method\n\nAlthough the search for the `sendall` method in `OpenSSL.SSL.Connection` did not yield results, we know it expects byte strings (`bytes` in Python 3, `str` in Python 2) based on the error message. This method is likely the final step in the chain where the request data is actually sent over the network.\n\n- **Intended behavior**: Upon sending data, all parts of the request, especially the URL, must be in byte format. This confirms that somewhere along the handling of the redirect, the URL must be converted to bytes if it isn't already.\n\nGiven this analysis, the issue lies in how URLs are handled and passed through the request flow, particularly in their conversion to the appropriate string or byte format expected by the underlying libraries (`urllib3` and `pyOpenSSL`). To resolve the bug, it might be necessary to ensure that all URLs are properly encoded to bytes before being sent, possibly in or around the `resolve_redirects` process or immediately before the request is handed off to `urllib3` or `pyOpenSSL`.\n\nGiven the missing information on the actual conversion or handling of the URL in byte format, it might be beneficial to examine closer the `requests.get` and the direct sending mechanism in `requests` that eventually calls `sendall`. This could involve another search for the implementation of `requests.get` in `requests/api.py` or the send mechanism in `requests/sessions.py`:\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"get\", \"requests/api.py\")\n```\n\n```python\nsearch_code_in_file(\"self.send(\", \"requests/sessions.py\")\n```\n\nThese calls aim to find how `requests.get` prepares the URL and how the `send` method handles it, hoping to pinpoint where the conversion to bytes should occur."

This preservation should specifically address the issue where Unicode strings are causing `TypeError` in `OpenSSL.SSL.Connection`'s `sendall` method. The intended fix must ensure that all string to byte conversions are compatible with Python's `str` and `bytes` types, bearing in mind Python 2 and Python 3 compatibilities, as well as the needs of underlying libraries like `pyOpenSSL`.\n\nSince we couldn't find the `OpenSSL.SSL.Connection`'s `sendall` method directly, the focus was placed on the `requests` library's handling of URLs during redirects, assuming the encoding to bytes might need to happen higher up in the stack before it reaches OpenSSL. This would ensure that by the time the URL or any part of the request reaches `sendall`, it's already in the correct format, thus preventing the `TypeError`."
