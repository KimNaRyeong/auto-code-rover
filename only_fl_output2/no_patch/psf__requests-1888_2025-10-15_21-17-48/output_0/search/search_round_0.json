I see that after the redirect is received the returned URL is [decoded to a Unicode string](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/requests/adapters.py#L181). Then requests passes the response to `resolve_redirects` which uses the url to make a new request. This leads to a Unicode string being passed to urllib3 and eventually pyopenssl. And because in pyopenssl they now check that the data is of type bytes, an exception is thrown.\nI Wrote this test:\n```\ndef test_pyopenssl_redirect(self):\nrequests.get('https://httpbin.org/status/301')\n```\nand this is the result of py.test:\n```\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nself = <OpenSSL.SSL.Connection object at 0x000000000345CC50>\nbuf = u'GET /redirect/1 HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: httpbin.org\\r\\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, defl...cept: */*\\r\\nUser-Agent: python-r\nequests/2.2.1 CPython/2.7.6 Windows/8\\r\\n\\r\\n'\nflags = 0\ndef sendall(self, buf, flags=0):\n\"\"\"\nSend \"all\" data on the connection.

        "content": "To address the issue efficiently, I will make the following API calls based on the details provided in the issue:\n\n1. **Search for the code snippet where the URL is decoded to a Unicode string**: Since the issue description points out that the URL is decoded to a Unicode string at a specific point in the requests library, finding this exact code could provide valuable insight. The given URL to the code segment won't directly help in an API call but gives a hint that it is in the `requests/adapters.py`:\n\n```python\nsearch_code_in_file(\"url = urlparse(response.url).geturl()\", \"requests/adapters.py\")\n```\n\n2. **Search for the `resolve_redirects` method to understand how it uses the URL**: The description mentions that `resolve_redirects` uses the URL to make a new request, which leads to the Unicode string being passed down the chain. Understanding its implementation will be crucial:\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"resolve_redirects\")\n```\n\n3. **Examine how `requests.get` is implemented**: Since the test case uses `requests.get`, fetching its implementation might provide insights into how requests prepares and sends HTTP requests, which could include how it handles redirects:\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"get\")\n```\n\n4. **Search for the definition of the `sendall` method in pyOpenSSL**: Since the traceback ends with a TypeError raised in `OpenSSL.SSL.Connection`'s `sendall` method, understanding its expectations might offer clues on what needs to be fixed:\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"sendall\", \"OpenSSL.SSL.Connection\")\n```\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the code flow leading up to the error, and how data types are managed across the involved methods."
