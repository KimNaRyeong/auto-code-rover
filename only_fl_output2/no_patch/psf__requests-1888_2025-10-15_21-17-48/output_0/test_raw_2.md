Given the context and the intention to strictly adhere to the request for having a standalone script detecting the specific issue related to pyOpenSSL and handling of 301 redirects, as well as your requirements for handling exceptions and exit codes. Please note that for a precise reproduction of the issue discussed, the versions of the involved libraries are crucial and need to match those known to exhibit the issue. Here is an updated template for `reproducer.py` that more accurately tries to follow these guidelines:

```python
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_redirect_with_pyopenssl():
    try:
        response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/redirect/1', timeout=5)
        if response.history and response.url == "https://httpbin.org/get":
            print("Redirect success. No issue detected.")
            sys.exit(0)
        else:
            raise AssertionError("No redirect happened or incorrect final URL")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Raising the AssertionError to indicate explicit test failure due to the issue being present.
        raise AssertionError("The issue with pyOpenSSL handling HTTPS redirects is present.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_redirect_with_pyopenssl()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        sys.exit(1)
```

This script attempts to precisely follow the flow that leads to an encounter with the described issue:
- Makes a `GET` request to a URL known to respond with a `301` redirect.
- Utilizes the `print_stacktrace` function for detailed traceback printing in case of exceptions.
- The script concludes with an `AssertionError` if the specific issue regarding pyOpenSSL and 301 redirects is detected, otherwise exits normally indicating no issue.

Please note that actual testing outcomes will depend on the specific environment setup, including installed package versions and their compatibility.
