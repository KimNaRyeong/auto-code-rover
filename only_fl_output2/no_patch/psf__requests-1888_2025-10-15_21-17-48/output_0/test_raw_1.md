Given the context and requirements you've shared, here is how you can write a `reproducer.py` Python script that attempts to reproduce the initial problem of handling a `301` redirect with `pyOpenSSL/SNI` issue. The script checks for an exception related to the byte string type requirement in `pyOpenSSL` when processing redirects. Upon capturing an exception, it prints the stack trace using the provided function. It raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is replicated, indicating the test failed due to the presence of the issue.

```python
import requests
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_redirect_handling():
    try:
        # Perform a GET request, which should follow a 301 redirect
        requests.get('https://httpbin.org/status/301')
        # If no exception is raised, the execution flow will reach here,
        # indicating that the issue is seemingly resolved.
        print("Test passed: No issue detected with 301 redirects handling.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        # Prints the formatted stack trace if an exception is caught
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # The script raises an AssertionError since the intention is to trigger the problematic behavior.
        raise AssertionError("The issue with 301 redirects handling in pyOpenSSL/SNI scenario is present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_redirect_handling()
    except AssertionError as error:
        # If an AssertionError is raised, it prints the error message and exits with code 1.
        print(error, file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)
```

Copy this code into a file named `reproducer.py` and place it in the root directory of your project. Execute it with Python 3 to see if the issue is reproduced. The script is designed to exit with code 0 if the issue is addressed, indicating a successful resolution, or exit with code 1 and print a stack trace if the issue is still present.
