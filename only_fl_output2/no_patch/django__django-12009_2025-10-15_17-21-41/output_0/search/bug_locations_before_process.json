This involves removing or updating the directive that causes `django-admin.py` to be installed alongside `django-admin`. The setup should preserve the functionality provided by `execute_from_command_line`, ensuring that the remaining `django-admin` script can still serve all necessary command-line functionalities within Django environments."
