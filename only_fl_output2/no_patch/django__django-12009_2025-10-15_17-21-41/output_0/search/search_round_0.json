        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue described, we need to focus on how Django's setup process installs the `django-admin` and `django-admin.py` scripts, and also how `execute_from_command_line` function is linked to these scripts. I'll perform several searches related to these components:\n\n1. **Search for the `execute_from_command_line` function in the whole codebase:** This will help us understand how this function is defined and potentially any documentation/comments around its intended use and any specific reasons for the dual installation approach.\n\n2. **Search for the setup process in Django, especially focusing on `setup.py`:** Since the issue mentions that both scripts are installed due to configurations in `setup.py`, it would be beneficial to see the current setup configuration and any comments or documentation surrounding the decision to include both scripts.\n\n3. **Search for any code related to the installation of command-line scripts in Django's codebase:** This could include the actual scripts' content or references to them, providing insight into their purposes and differences, if any.\n\nBased on these considerations, the following API calls will be made:\n\n- `search_method(\"execute_from_command_line\")`: to find definitions or usages of `execute_from_command_line`.\n- `search_code(\"scripts=['django/bin/django-admin.py']\")`: to locate where in `setup.py` or elsewhere these scripts are specified for installation.\n- `search_code(\"entry_points={'console_scripts': ['django-admin = django.core.management:execute_from_command_line',]}\")`: to find the specific part of code that handles the `entry_points` configuration for the console script."
