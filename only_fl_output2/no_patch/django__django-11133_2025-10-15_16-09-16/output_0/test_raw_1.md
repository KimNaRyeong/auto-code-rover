Given the feedback and the requirement for a revised solution, let's rewrite the `reproducer.py` script with a focus on directly addressing the reported issue in a more isolated manner. This version will avoid dependencies on specific Django project settings, assuming a minimal setup just to test the behavior in question:

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_memoryview_response():
    # Minimal Django environment setup
    from django.conf import settings
    settings.configure()
    from django.http import HttpResponse

    # Simulate the issue
    try:
        memory_view_content = memoryview(b"My Content")
        response = HttpResponse(memory_view_content)
        actual_content = response.getvalue()  # Using getvalue to extract the buffer content

        # Check if the issue is reproduced
        assert actual_content == b"My Content", "HttpResponse does not handle memoryview objects correctly."

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code to signal failure

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_memoryview_response()
    print("Issue not present or resolved.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with success code
```

This version avoids assuming a specific Django project configuration, substituting it with `settings.configure()` for the necessary minimal configuration required to create a `HttpResponse`. It uses `getvalue()` method from the `HttpResponse` object to directly compare the buffer content, bypassing any intermediate representation issues that may differ based on Django versions or configurations.

Please note, for consistency and universal behavior across different Django versions and configurations, the method of extracting content directly from `HttpResponse` may need adjustment, such as directly accessing `response.content` if `getvalue()` is not supported. This script assumes a conventional and uncomplicated Django setup for demonstration purposes.
