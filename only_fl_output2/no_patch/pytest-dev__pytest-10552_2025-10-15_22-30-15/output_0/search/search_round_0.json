Here's an example:\n```python\nimport pytest\nclass TestFoo:\n# passes:\n@staticmethod\ndef test_staticmethod() -> None:\nfoo = 0\nassert foo < 3\n# warning: cannot collect 'test_staticmethod_inner' because it is not a function.\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [1, 2])\n@staticmethod\ndef test_staticmethod_inner(foo: int) -> None:\nassert foo < 3\n# passes:\n@staticmethod\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [1, 2])\ndef test_staticmethod_outer(foo: int) -> None:\nassert foo < 3\n# silently fails to run\n@classmethod\ndef test_classmethod(cls) -> None:\nfoo = 0\nassert foo < 3\n# warning: cannot collect 'test_classmethod_inner' because it is not a function.\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [1, 2])\n@classmethod\ndef test_classmethod_inner(cls, foo: int) -> None:\nassert foo < 3\n# silently fails to run\n@classmethod\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [1, 2])\ndef test_classmethod_outer(cls, foo: int) -> None:\nassert foo < 3\n```\nThe most worrysome cases are `test_classmethod` and `test_classmethod_outer`, which are not discovered by pytest. I think that there should at least be a warning or error to alert the user that their test code cannot be run.\n<details>\n<summary> Here's the full output from running `pytest -v`:\n</summary>\n```text\n$ pytest tmp.py -v\n======================== test session starts =========================\nplatform linux -- Python 3.9.15, pytest-7.2.0, pluggy-1.0.0 -- /home/homestar/tmp2/tmp_venv/bin/python3\ncachedir: .pytest_cache\nrootdir: /home/homestar/tmp2\ncollected 3 items\ntmp.py::TestFoo::test_staticmethod PASSED                      [ 33%]\ntmp.py::TestFoo::test_staticmethod_outer[1] PASSED             [ 66%]\ntmp.py::TestFoo::test_staticmethod_outer[2] PASSED             [100%]\n========================== warnings summary ==========================\ntmp_venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/_pytest/mark/structures.py:347\n/home/homestar/tmp2/tmp_venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/_pytest/mark/structures.py:347: PytestCollectionWarning: cannot collect 'test_staticmethod_inner' because it is not a function.\ndef __call__(self, *args: object, **kwargs: object):\ntmp_venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/_pytest/mark/structures.py:347\n/home/homestar/tmp2/tmp_venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/_pytest/mark/structures.py:347: PytestCollectionWarning: cannot collect 'test_classmethod_inner' because it is not a function.\ndef __call__(self, *args: object, **kwargs: object):\n-- Docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/capture-warnings.html\n=================== 3 passed, 2 warnings in 0.00s ====================\n```\n</details>\npython v3.9.15, pytest v7.2.0, ubuntu 20.04\n<details>\n<summary> Output of `pip list`:\n</summary>\n```text\n$ pip list\nPackage        Version\n-------------- -------\nattrs          22.1.0\nexceptiongroup 1.0.4\niniconfig      1.1.1\npackaging      21.3\npip            22.0.4\npluggy         1.0.0\npyparsing      3.0.9\npytest         7.2.0\nsetuptools     58.1.0\ntomli          2.0.1\n```\n</details>\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for the issue described, the following API calls would be beneficial:\n\n1. Search for the class `TestFoo` to ensure we're looking at the correct context and possibly other methods that might have similar issues or how they're structured overall.\n\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"TestFoo\")\n    ```\n\n2. Since the issue specifically mentions several methods (`test_staticmethod`, `test_staticmethod_inner`, `test_staticmethod_outer`, `test_classmethod`, `test_classmethod_inner`, `test_classmethod_outer`), it would be useful to search for these methods within the `TestFoo` class to understand their current implementation and any potential annotations or decorators that could be influencing their discovery and execution by pytest.\n\n    ```python\n    search_method_in_class(\"test_staticmethod\", \"TestFoo\")\n    search_method_in_class(\"test_staticmethod_inner\", \"TestFoo\")\n    search_method_in_class(\"test_staticmethod_outer\", \"TestFoo\")\n    search_method_in_class(\"test_classmethod\", \"TestFoo\")\n    search_method_in_class(\"test_classmethod_inner\", \"TestFoo\")\n    search_method_in_class(\"test_classmethod_outer\", \"TestFoo\")\n    ```\n\n3. The issue mentions pytest discovery and parametrization, and it seems like the usage order of `@staticmethod/@classmethod` and `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorators affects test discovery. It would be useful to search the codebase for similar patterns or usage of these decorators to see if there are cases where it works correctly or if there are workaround patterns used elsewhere in the project.\n\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"@staticmethod\\n@pytest.mark.parametrize\")\n    search_code(\"@classmethod\\n@pytest.mark.parametrize\")\n    search_code(\"@pytest.mark.parametrize\\n@staticmethod\")\n    search_code(\"@pytest.mark.parametrize\\n@classmethod\")\n    ```\n\nThese API calls would provide a comprehensive view of how tests are structured in the context of the `TestFoo` class and potentially uncover patterns or practices within the codebase that either alleviate or exacerbate the issue mentioned."
