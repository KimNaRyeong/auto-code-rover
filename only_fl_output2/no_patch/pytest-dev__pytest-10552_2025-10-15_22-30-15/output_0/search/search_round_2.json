However, we can theorize the general location of the issues and describe the intended behavior based on the issue description provided. Since the `TestFoo` class and its methods were not found, it indicates there might not be specific locations in the actual codebase as provided in the example. Hence, addressing the issue relies on understanding pytest\u2019s test discovery mechanism and the specific use case of decorators.\n\n### Where are bug locations\n\n#### Not Directly Applicable due to Lack of Specific File or Class Location\n\nWithout specific files or classes, we cannot accurately define bug locations. However, the issue revolves around pytest's handling or mishandling of `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` methods, especially when used with `@pytest.mark.parametrize`.\n\n### Intended Behavior to Resolve the Issue\n\nTo resolve this issue, the intended behavior adjustments would not be about changing specific lines of code but rather about adopting best practices or modifying the test discovery setup. Given pytest's current limitations or behaviors concerning static and class methods, particularly when parameterization is involved, the intended behaviors for working around this issue while preserving existing functionality are:\n\n1. **Clarification or Documentation Update:** If pytest inherently has limitations or specific requirements for discovering tests within `@staticmethod` or `@classmethod`, this should be clearly documented within the project's testing guidelines. Explicit guidance should be provided on how to structure tests to ensure compatibility with pytest's discovery mechanism.\n\n2. **Refactoring Tests:** If static and class methods must be utilized for testing purposes, consider wrapping these tests within regular instance methods that call the static or class methods. This approach can ensure compatibility with pytest's discovery while preserving the logical structure and intent of using static and class methods.\n\n3. **Update Test Configuration:** Investigation into whether pytest\u2019s configuration (e.g., through `pytest.ini` or `conftest.py`) could be altered or extended with plugins to better support discovery of tests defined via `@staticmethod` or `@classmethod`. This could involve specifying custom test patterns or hooks that assist in recognizing and properly handling such methods as tests.\n\n4. **Pytest Enhancement Request:** If the issue stems from inherent limitations or oversights within pytest itself, contributing a feature request or enhancement to pytest could be a long-term resolution. This would benefit not only the current project but also the broader pytest and Python testing community.\n\nIn summary, without direct access to specific classes or methods that need patching within the provided codebase, the resolution involves adopting best practices for test structure, considering potential refactoring, and possibly seeking enhancements or clarifications from the pytest framework itself."

The report pertains to pytest's behavior with respect to discovering and running tests defined with `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`, especially when used in combination with `@pytest.mark.parametrize`.\n\n### Theoretical Bug Locations and Intended Behavior\n\nWithout specific class or method references from the search API, we address the issue in a generalized form:\n\n#### Location 1: Documentation/Testing Guidelines\n\n- **Intended Behavior:** Update project documentation to highlight the current limitation with pytest regarding the discovery of static and class method tests, especially when parameterized. Provide alternative approaches, such as wrapping these methods inside regular instance methods for testing purposes.\n\n#### Location 2: Test Configuration and Setup\n\n- **Intended Behavior:** Investigate and potentially enhance the pytest configuration (e.g., in `pytest.ini` or `conftest.py`) to explore workarounds for better support of `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` test methods. This could include using hooks or plugins that aid in the test discovery process, ensuring that tests not natively recognized by pytest due to their decorators can still be executed.\n\nThese suggested locations and intended behaviors aim to mitigate the described issue by either working within the current capabilities of pytest or proposing documentation and configuration practices that circumvent the limitations. Since this does not involve direct modification to code but rather to configurations and guidelines, it addresses the described behavior in a generalized manner, respecting the original functionality intentions."
