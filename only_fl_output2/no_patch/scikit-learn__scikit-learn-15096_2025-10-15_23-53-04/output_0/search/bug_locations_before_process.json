        "intended_behavior": "The `fit` method should ensure that when estimator parameters are cloned and fitted for each set of parameters in the grid, the original parameters used for cloning are not altered. The `cv_results_['params']` should only contain the original parameters (or specifications) of the estimators before fitting, ensuring that no fitted estimators are stored. This preservation of the original, unfitted parameters is crucial for minimizing memory usage and avoiding confusion about what `cv_results_['params']` represents. During the cloning process (already implemented with clone(base_estimator)), it's essential to verify that this cloning operation properly duplicates the estimator's configuration without any of its trained state. The results aggregation part (`_format_results` method called at the end of fit) should be reviewed to make sure it handles the results of cloned and fitted estimators correctly, only storing their parameter configurations and not the estimators themselves."

        "method": "clone",
        "intended_behavior": "While the `clone` function itself (implemented in `sklearn/base.py`) might not be buggy, its usage within `GridSearchCV` and `BaseSearchCV` fitting process should ensure that cloned estimators do not retain any fitted attributes when they are stored in or influence `cv_results_`. If necessary, additional safeguards or checks might be introduced after cloning to ensure the estimator's state is reset or remains unchanged from its pre-fit conditions before being passed into the grid search process. This might involve verifying the clone operation's efficacy in preventing any state leakage between the original and the cloned estimator, especially when the estimator's parameters are complex objects."
