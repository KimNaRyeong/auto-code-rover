I set the param grid by inputing transformers or estimators at different steps of the pipeline, following the Pipeline documentation:\n> A step\u2019s estimator may be replaced entirely by setting the parameter with its name to another estimator, or a transformer removed by setting to None.\nI couldn't figure why dumping cv_results_ would take so much memory on disk. It happens that cv_results_['params'] and all cv_results_['param_*'] objects contains fitted estimators, as much as there are points on my grid.\nThis bug should happen only when n_jobs = 1 (which is my usecase).\nI don't think this is intended (else the arguments and attributes _refit_ and _best_\\__estimator_ wouldn't be used).\nMy guess is that during the grid search, those estimator's aren't cloned before use (which could be a problem if using the same grid search several times, because estimators passed in the next grid would be fitted...).\n#### Version: 0.19.0\n</issue>"

Given the details in the issue description, the following API calls would provide valuable insights:\n\n1. Search for the GridSearchCV class to understand its structure and where it might handle the estimator parameters.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"GridSearchCV\")\n```\n\n2. Since the issue describes behavior that is likely involved with the execution of grid search, particularly how parameters are handled, we should look at methods that deal with parameter setting and the execution of the search itself.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"GridSearchCV\")\n```\n3. The issue mentions the possibility of estimators not being cloned correctly. Looking for clone usage within GridSearchCV might help.\n\n```python\nsearch_code_in_file(\"clone\", \"GridSearchCV\")\n```\n\n4. The issue appears when `n_jobs=1`. It would be useful to see how the `n_jobs` parameter is used within the `GridSearchCV` to check if it affects the handling of parameters or the cloning of estimators.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"n_jobs=1\")\n```\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how `GridSearchCV` is implemented regarding estimator parameters handling and help pinpoint where the mentioned bug might originate."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides some insights and also indicates the need for further investigation due to some unsuccessful searches. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Context from `search_class(\"GridSearchCV\")`\n- **File identified:** `sklearn/model_selection/_search.py`\n- **Code snippet provided:** The class definition of `GridSearchCV` includes the constructor but doesn't directly show how the parameters are managed or how estimators are cloned. The `_run_search` method might handle part of the grid search execution where the issue could manifest.\n\n#### Analysis:\n- **What does this part of the code do?** It defines the `GridSearchCV` class, including its initialization and hints at a method responsible for running the search.\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?** This class is central to the issue since it performs grid searches using provided estimator parameters, where the bug regarding storing fitted estimators is observed.\n- **Intended behavior:** Ideally, `GridSearchCV` should handle parameter and estimator cloning properly to avoid large memory usage and redundant storage of fitted models in `cv_results_`.\n\n### Context from Unsuccessful Searches\n\n1. **Searching for `fit` method in `GridSearchCV`:** Not finding the `fit` method directly in `GridSearchCV` suggests it might inherit it from a base class. The `fit` method is key to understanding how estimators are fitted across different grid points and potentially cloned.\n2. **Searching for `clone` usage in file:** The failure to find any mention directly in a file named like the class itself (or misinterpretation of the file structure) suggests either an incorrect search input or that cloning happens elsewhere, potentially in utility methods or base classes.\n\n### Additional Investigations Needed\n\nGiven the initial search results and their limitations, further API calls should aim to:\n\n1. **Locate the `fit` method within the `GridSearchCV`'s hierarchy:** Since the direct search was unsuccessful, exploring the base class (`BaseSearchCV`) might reveal where and how the `fit` function is implemented.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"BaseSearchCV\")\nsearch_method_in_file(\"fit\", \"sklearn/model_selection/_search.py\")\n```\n\n2. **Identify cloning process:** Since the direct search for cloning within a non-identified file was unsuccessful, we need to find where cloning of estimators might occur during the setup or execution of the grid search. It's likely happening in a utility function.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"clone\")\n```\n\n3. **Examine how `n_jobs` parameter is handled:** Although we found instances of `n_jobs=1` usage across various examples and benchmarks, it's essential to understand its role specifically in the context of `GridSearchCV`. This could explain if and how the parallel job execution or lack thereof influences the duplication of estimators.\n\n```python\nsearch_code_in_file(\"n_jobs\", \"sklearn/model_selection/_search.py\")\n```\n\nThese steps are crucial for constructing a complete view of the mechanisms at play in the issue described, especially how estimators are handled, potentially leading to the observed bug."
