The `cv_results_['params']` should only contain the original parameters (or specifications) of the estimators before fitting, ensuring that no fitted estimators are stored. This preservation of the original, unfitted parameters is crucial for minimizing memory usage and avoiding confusion about what `cv_results_['params']` represents.\n\nDuring the cloning process (already implemented with clone(base_estimator)), it's essential to verify that this cloning operation properly duplicates the estimator's configuration without any of its trained state. The results aggregation part (`_format_results` method called at the end of fit) should be reviewed to make sure it handles the results of cloned and fitted estimators correctly, only storing their parameter configurations and not the estimators themselves.\n\n### Bug Location 2\n- **File:** `sklearn/model_selection/_search.py`\n- **Method:** `clone` (Usage within the context of GridSearchCV)\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nWhile the `clone` function itself (implemented in `sklearn/base.py`) might not be buggy, its usage within `GridSearchCV` and `BaseSearchCV` fitting process should ensure that cloned estimators do not retain any fitted attributes when they are stored in or influence `cv_results_`. If necessary, additional safeguards or checks might be introduced after cloning to ensure the estimator's state is reset or remains unchanged from its pre-fit conditions before being passed into the grid search process.
