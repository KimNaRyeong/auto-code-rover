        "content": "<issue>GridSearchCV saves all fitted estimator in cv_results['params'] when params are estimators\n#### Description\nI use GridSearchCV to optimize the hyperparameters of a pipeline. I set the param grid by inputing transformers or estimators at different steps of the pipeline, following the Pipeline documentation:\n> A step\u2019s estimator may be replaced entirely by setting the parameter with its name to another estimator, or a transformer removed by setting to None.\nI couldn't figure why dumping cv_results_ would take so much memory on disk. It happens that cv_results_['params'] and all cv_results_['param_*'] objects contains fitted estimators, as much as there are points on my grid.\nThis bug should happen only when n_jobs = 1 (which is my usecase).\nI don't think this is intended (else the arguments and attributes _refit_ and _best_\\__estimator_ wouldn't be used).\nMy guess is that during the grid search, those estimator's aren't cloned before use (which could be a problem if using the same grid search several times, because estimators passed in the next grid would be fitted...).\n#### Version: 0.19.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to GridSearchCV saving all fitted estimators in `cv_results_['params']` when the parameters are estimators themselves, we need to focus on the implementation details of `GridSearchCV` and potentially the cloning of estimators if that's where the issue stems from. Given the details in the issue description, the following API calls would provide valuable insights:\n\n1. Search for the GridSearchCV class to understand its structure and where it might handle the estimator parameters.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"GridSearchCV\")\n```\n\n2. Since the issue describes behavior that is likely involved with the execution of grid search, particularly how parameters are handled, we should look at methods that deal with parameter setting and the execution of the search itself.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"GridSearchCV\")\n```\n3. The issue mentions the possibility of estimators not being cloned correctly. Looking for clone usage within GridSearchCV might help.\n\n```python\nsearch_code_in_file(\"clone\", \"GridSearchCV\")\n```\n\n4. The issue appears when `n_jobs=1`. It would be useful to see how the `n_jobs` parameter is used within the `GridSearchCV` to check if it affects the handling of parameters or the cloning of estimators.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"n_jobs=1\")\n```\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how `GridSearchCV` is implemented regarding estimator parameters handling and help pinpoint where the mentioned bug might originate."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides some insights and also indicates the need for further investigation due to some unsuccessful searches. Here's the analysis:\n\n### Context from `search_class(\"GridSearchCV\")`\n- **File identified:** `sklearn/model_selection/_search.py`\n- **Code snippet provided:** The class definition of `GridSearchCV` includes the constructor but doesn't directly show how the parameters are managed or how estimators are cloned. The `_run_search` method might handle part of the grid search execution where the issue could manifest.\n\n#### Analysis:\n- **What does this part of the code do?** It defines the `GridSearchCV` class, including its initialization and hints at a method responsible for running the search.\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?** This class is central to the issue since it performs grid searches using provided estimator parameters, where the bug regarding storing fitted estimators is observed.\n- **Intended behavior:** Ideally, `GridSearchCV` should handle parameter and estimator cloning properly to avoid large memory usage and redundant storage of fitted models in `cv_results_`.\n\n### Context from Unsuccessful Searches\n\n1. **Searching for `fit` method in `GridSearchCV`:** Not finding the `fit` method directly in `GridSearchCV` suggests it might inherit it from a base class. The `fit` method is key to understanding how estimators are fitted across different grid points and potentially cloned.\n2. **Searching for `clone` usage in file:** The failure to find any mention directly in a file named like the class itself (or misinterpretation of the file structure) suggests either an incorrect search input or that cloning happens elsewhere, potentially in utility methods or base classes.\n\n### Additional Investigations Needed\n\nGiven the initial search results and their limitations, further API calls should aim to:\n\n1. **Locate the `fit` method within the `GridSearchCV`'s hierarchy:** Since the direct search was unsuccessful, exploring the base class (`BaseSearchCV`) might reveal where and how the `fit` function is implemented.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"BaseSearchCV\")\nsearch_method_in_file(\"fit\", \"sklearn/model_selection/_search.py\")\n```\n\n2. **Identify cloning process:** Since the direct search for cloning within a non-identified file was unsuccessful, we need to find where cloning of estimators might occur during the setup or execution of the grid search. It's likely happening in a utility function.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"clone\")\n```\n\n3. **Examine how `n_jobs` parameter is handled:** Although we found instances of `n_jobs=1` usage across various examples and benchmarks, it's essential to understand its role specifically in the context of `GridSearchCV`. This could explain if and how the parallel job execution or lack thereof influences the duplication of estimators.\n\n```python\nsearch_code_in_file(\"n_jobs\", \"sklearn/model_selection/_search.py\")\n```\n\nThese steps are crucial for constructing a complete view of the mechanisms at play in the issue described, especially how estimators are handled, potentially leading to the observed bug."

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### `BaseSearchCV` and `fit` Method Context\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `fit` method in `BaseSearchCV` (which `GridSearchCV` inherits from) is responsible for running the fit process with all sets of parameters defined in the grid. This involves cloning the base estimator for each parameter combination, performing the fit on the train set, and scoring it on the test set. It organizes the results, including calculating and storing the best score, the best parameters, and optionally the best estimator if `refit` is True.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  The issue description mentioned that `cv_results_['params']` contains fitted estimators, which should not be the case. The cloning operation in the `fit` method is crucial for ensuring that the parameters grid contains only unfitted estimator copies. This cloning process should prevent the anomaly of storing fitted estimators in `cv_results_`.\n\n- **Intended behavior in regard to the issue description:**\n  When cloning estimators for each parameter set, the process should ensure that only the parameter definitions (or unfitted estimator instances) make it into the `cv_results_`. The `fit` method and associated cloning operations should guarantee that no fitted instances (or their state) leak into `cv_results_`, ensuring minimal memory usage and avoiding redundant storage of fitted models. The intended behavior here is to confirm that fitting does not mutate the parameter objects provided in the grid directly and thus does not affect the content of `cv_results_['params']`.\n\n#### `clone` Method Context\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `clone` function is designed to create a deep copy of the estimator without copying attached data. It should return a new estimator that has the same parameters as the original but has not been fitted to any data. \n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  Since the `clone` function is involved in the copying of estimators during the grid search process, ensuring it correctly duplicates the estimator without its fitted state is key to addressing the bug. The issue may imply that despite the cloning, some state of the original estimator affects the results storage, perhaps through improper cloning or handling post-cloning.\n\n- **Intended behavior in regard to the issue description:**\n  The `clone` function's intended behavior is to ensure that any estimator passed through it remains unfitted in its cloned form. To resolve the issue, it must be confirmed that cloning happens before fitting within the grid search process and no links exist between the cloned estimator and its post-fit state in the parameters stored in `cv_results_`.\n\n#### Handling of `n_jobs` in `fit` Method Context\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The occurrences of `n_jobs` relate to how parallel computing is managed during the grid search process. It controls the number of jobs to run in parallel, affecting the execution of `_fit_and_score` calls.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  According to the issue description, the problem seems to occur when `n_jobs=1`, which might hint at a specific branch of logic or a handling difference when running grid search sequentially vs. in parallel. \n\n- **Intended behavior in regard to the issue description:**\n  The intended behavior with any setting of `n_jobs` is that the `params` in `cv_results_` should contain only the parameter sets used, without incorporating the fitted state of estimators. Sequential (single-threaded) fitting vs. parallel fitting should not affect the integrity or content of `cv_results_['params']`, suggesting a need to review how cloning and result aggregation are managed across different `n_jobs` settings. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis indicates a potential disconnect between the cloning process and its intended effect on isolating the grid search's iterative fitting processes from the parameter grid definitions. The next steps towards a fix should involve ensuring that the cloning process effectively prevents any fitted estimator states from affecting the search's output, particularly how parameters are stored and represented in `cv_results_`."

Given the analysis and the context provided:\n\n### Bug Location 1\n- **File:** `sklearn/model_selection/_search.py`\n- **Class:** `BaseSearchCV`\n- **Method:** `fit`\n  \n#### Intended Behavior\nThe `fit` method should ensure that when estimator parameters are cloned and fitted for each set of parameters in the grid, the original parameters used for cloning are not altered. The `cv_results_['params']` should only contain the original parameters (or specifications) of the estimators before fitting, ensuring that no fitted estimators are stored. This preservation of the original, unfitted parameters is crucial for minimizing memory usage and avoiding confusion about what `cv_results_['params']` represents.\n\nDuring the cloning process (already implemented with clone(base_estimator)), it's essential to verify that this cloning operation properly duplicates the estimator's configuration without any of its trained state. The results aggregation part (`_format_results` method called at the end of fit) should be reviewed to make sure it handles the results of cloned and fitted estimators correctly, only storing their parameter configurations and not the estimators themselves.\n\n### Bug Location 2\n- **File:** `sklearn/model_selection/_search.py`\n- **Method:** `clone` (Usage within the context of GridSearchCV)\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nWhile the `clone` function itself (implemented in `sklearn/base.py`) might not be buggy, its usage within `GridSearchCV` and `BaseSearchCV` fitting process should ensure that cloned estimators do not retain any fitted attributes when they are stored in or influence `cv_results_`. If necessary, additional safeguards or checks might be introduced after cloning to ensure the estimator's state is reset or remains unchanged from its pre-fit conditions before being passed into the grid search process. This might involve verifying the clone operation's efficacy in preventing any state leakage between the original and the cloned estimator, especially when the estimator's parameters are complex objects."
