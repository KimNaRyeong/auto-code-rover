I set the param grid by inputing transformers or estimators at different steps of the pipeline, following the Pipeline documentation:\n> A step\u2019s estimator may be replaced entirely by setting the parameter with its name to another estimator, or a transformer removed by setting to None.\nI couldn't figure why dumping cv_results_ would take so much memory on disk. It happens that cv_results_['params'] and all cv_results_['param_*'] objects contains fitted estimators, as much as there are points on my grid.\nThis bug should happen only when n_jobs = 1 (which is my usecase).\nI don't think this is intended (else the arguments and attributes _refit_ and _best_\\__estimator_ wouldn't be used).\nMy guess is that during the grid search, those estimator's aren't cloned before use (which could be a problem if using the same grid search several times, because estimators passed in the next grid would be fitted...).\n#### Version: 0.19.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to GridSearchCV saving all fitted estimators in `cv_results_['params']` when the parameters are estimators themselves, we need to focus on the implementation details of `GridSearchCV` and potentially the cloning of estimators if that's where the issue stems from. Given the details in the issue description, the following API calls would provide valuable insights:\n\n1. Search for the GridSearchCV class to understand its structure and where it might handle the estimator parameters.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"GridSearchCV\")\n```\n\n2. Since the issue describes behavior that is likely involved with the execution of grid search, particularly how parameters are handled, we should look at methods that deal with parameter setting and the execution of the search itself.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"GridSearchCV\")\n```\n3. The issue mentions the possibility of estimators not being cloned correctly. Looking for clone usage within GridSearchCV might help.\n\n```python\nsearch_code_in_file(\"clone\", \"GridSearchCV\")\n```\n\n4. The issue appears when `n_jobs=1`. It would be useful to see how the `n_jobs` parameter is used within the `GridSearchCV` to check if it affects the handling of parameters or the cloning of estimators.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"n_jobs=1\")\n```\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how `GridSearchCV` is implemented regarding estimator parameters handling and help pinpoint where the mentioned bug might originate."
