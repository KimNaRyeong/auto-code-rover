        "intended_behavior": "The `floatformat` method's purpose is to convert a number into a string representation, formatted to a specified number of decimal places. To resolve the issue while preserving its existing functionality, the method should be modified to specifically handle `Decimal` objects without converting them into a float, thus avoiding the precision loss. Specifically, the handling of `Decimal` inputs should ensure:\n\n- Direct use of `Decimal` methods to maintain precision throughout the rounding and formatting process. The conversion process (lines 154-160), where `Decimal` might inadvertently be converted to a float, should be refined to avoid any such conversion. If the input is already a `Decimal`, it should maintain its type and precision without unnecessary transformations.\n\n- Enhancement of the logic that calculates and applies the specified number of decimal places to ensure it does not lead to precision loss or unnecessary rounding when applied to `Decimal` values. This includes revisiting how rounding (line 190) and final string formatting (lines 191-206) are performed on `Decimal` values.\n\nThis approach will allow `floatformat` to accurately represent `Decimal` numbers in templates, matching the user's expectations for precision and formatting without unintended truncation or rounding."
