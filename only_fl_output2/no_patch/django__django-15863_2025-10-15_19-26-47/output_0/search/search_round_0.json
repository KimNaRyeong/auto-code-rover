Decimal numbers are converted to float instead.\nPull request is prepared \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/15863\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue adequately, we first need to identify where the `floatformat` filter is implemented within the Django codebase. This will involve searching for either the class or method that handles this functionality. Since the issue explicitly mentions \"the floatformat implementation\", let's start by identifying the relevant method that might contain the bug. Once we have located the method, we can inspect the implementation details, focusing on how Decimal numbers are converted and handled.\n\nAs such, I will proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"floatformat\")` - This will help identify the `floatformat` method or function in the entire codebase, which is supposedly responsible for the behavior described in the issue.\n\n2. `search_code(\"Decimal('42.12345678901234567890')\")` - Since the issue description includes a specific usage of the Decimal class, searching for this code snippet might directly point us to test cases, examples, or further usage of Decimals within the context of template rendering or float formatting.\n\nThese searches will give us a good starting pointing for understanding the implementation of `floatformat` filter and its interaction with Decimal numbers, which is central to the reported issue."
