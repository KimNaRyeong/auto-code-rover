To accurately reproduce the reported issue in a standalone Python file, it's important to set up Django application within the script, then emulate the model creation and adjustment process as described. It seems the setup and the precise replication steps require close attention. Let's revise and aim for a concise reproduction that captures the essence of the described bug, ensuring we configure Django settings correctly before any operations requiring the ORM are done.

Please note that directly modifying existing models from `ManyToManyField` pointing to another model to pointing to `'self'` within a script is tricky, as Django migrations are designed to track changes over time through files. However, I'll simulate this scenario by creating the conditions described, then performing operations that should trigger the error if the issue is present. This script assumes Django is installed in your environment.

```python
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models, OperationalError, connections, DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS
from django.core.management.color import no_style

os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = '__main__'
settings.configure(
    DEBUG=True,
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=['__main__'],
)

django.setup()

class Bar(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'

class Foo(models.Model):
    bar = models.ManyToManyField('Bar', blank=True)

    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'

django.db.models.signals.post_migrate.disconnect(
    sender=django.contrib.auth.management.create_permissions,
    dispatch_uid="django.contrib.auth.management.create_permissions"
)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    # Perform initial migration
    from django.core.management import call_command
    call_command('makemigrations', '__main__', interactive=False, verbosity=0)
    call_command('migrate', verbosity=0)

    # Change ManyToManyField to refer to 'self' and simulate migration
    Foo._meta.local_many_to_many = [models.ManyToManyField('Foo', blank=True)]
    connection = connections[DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS]
    tables = connection.introspection.table_names()
    seen_models = connection.introspection.installed_models(tables)
    connection.creation.create_model(Foo, seen_models=seen_models, keep_existing=True, style=no_style())

    # Try to access the ManyToManyField to trigger the error
    foo_instance = Foo.objects.create()
    foo_instance.bar.add(foo_instance)
    foo_instance.save()

    print("Issue is fixed or could not be reproduced.")
except OperationalError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise AssertionError("Issue is present.")
```

This script dynamically updates the `Foo` model to simulate the field type change and directly interacts with Django's lower-level database and migration APIs to apply this change without requiring a new migration file. This unusual approach is taken for the sake of reproducing the described issue in a singular, standalone execution context. Remember, this kind of manipulation is not typically recommended for standard Django development practices and is crafted here specifically for the purpose of issue reproduction.
