This means ensuring that any MathJax-related configuration or initialization code within mathjax.py is compatible with the new version. Changes may involve updating the way MathJax scripts are included in the Sphinx documentation, modifying configuration options to align with MathJax 3.0's API, and potentially altering how MathJax is initialized in the Sphinx project. These updates should preserve the ability of Sphinx to render mathematical notation in documentation while enhancing load times and performance thanks to the improvements introduced in MathJax 3.0."
