It would be great to get this into the Sphinx MathJax extension.\nThe [MathJax upgrading docs](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/v2.html#upgrading-from-v2-to-v3) suggest that it will not be trivial to upgrade, but it may be worth it given the performance and modularity improvements.

Specifically, we want to understand how MathJax is loaded and used within the Sphinx codebase, including any customization or configurations that are directly tied to MathJax version 2.x, as these areas will likely need modifications for the upgrade. The MathJax loading mechanism, initialization, and configuration are crucial pieces of information.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls would be relevant to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the Sphinx MathJax extension class or file**: Since we need to find where MathJax is integrated into Sphinx, we should start by looking for a likely class or file related to the MathJax extension. There might be a class or file explicitly named after MathJax or related to rendering equations in Sphinx.\n\n   - `search_class(\"MathJax\")`\n   - `search_code(\"MathJax\")` - This broad search might help us find initialization or configuration code snippets.\n\n2. **Search for methods related to configuring or initializing MathJax**: Assuming there's a method or methods responsible for setting up MathJax, we want to find these to understand the current integration and what needs to change for version 3.0.\n\n   - `search_method(\"init_mathjax\")` - Looking for a method that might be initializing MathJax.\n   - `search_method(\"config_mathjax\")` - A method that might be involved in configuring MathJax.\n\nThese API calls are aimed at understanding the current setup for MathJax within the Sphinx project and will help identify which parts of the codebase need modifications to support MathJax 3.0."

Let's analyze the gathered context based on the API call results and consider our next steps.\n\n### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n1. **`search_class(\"MathJax\")` and `search_method` calls resulted in no finds**: This suggests that the integration of MathJax within Sphinx may not be encapsulated within a dedicated class or method with a straightforward naming convention such as \"MathJax,\" \"init_mathjax,\" or \"config_mathjax.\" It implies that MathJax's integration might be more directly handled through configuration settings or initialization code within specific files rather than through a single, well-defined API or class method.\n\n2. **`search_code(\"MathJax\")` found 4 snippets in `sphinx/cmd/quickstart.py` and `sphinx/ext/mathjax.py`**: \n   - **`sphinx/cmd/quickstart.py`**: This file likely handles project setup or initialization aspects. The occurrence of \"MathJax\" in this file could be related to default settings or initial configuration options offered to users when starting a new Sphinx project.\n   - **`sphinx/ext/mathjax.py`**: The presence of three matches in this file strongly indicates that it is central to the MathJax integration. Given the extension naming convention (`ext`), this is probably where MathJax is configured and loaded within Sphinx projects. It\u2019s reasonable to assume that any necessary changes or upgrades to MathJax integration will require modifications in this file.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nTo further understand the integration and prepare for upgrading MathJax to version 3.0, we should focus on examining the content of `sphinx/ext/mathjax.py`, as it likely contains the crucial integration code including configuration and loading mechanisms.\n\nConsider the issue description highlighting the need for an upgrade due to significant performance improvements and the expected challenge in migrating from MathJax 2.x to 3.0. We need to examine:\n\n- How MathJax is currently integrated and initialized.\n- The current configuration settings for MathJax.\n- How MathJax's scripts are loaded into Sphinx projects.\n\nGiven this direction, the following specific API calls will help us gather the necessary context from the identified files:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"MathJax\", \"sphinx/ext/mathjax.py\")` - To get specific snippets where MathJax is mentioned, helping us understand its configuration and usage in this extension.\n- `get_code_around_line(\"sphinx/ext/mathjax.py\", line_number, window_size)` - This call might be useful once we know the exact line numbers from the previous call, to get more surrounding context. For now, we don't have specific line numbers, so this is a placeholder for a potential future action.\n\nThis approach will help us understand the specifics of MathJax's current integration, which is pivotal for planning the upgrade to version 3.0."

The intended behavior includes adapting the code to load MathJax 3.0 efficiently, taking advantage of its performance and modularity improvements as compared to the previously supported version. This means ensuring that any MathJax-related configuration or initialization code within `mathjax.py` is compatible with the new version. Changes may involve updating the way MathJax scripts are included in the Sphinx documentation, modifying configuration options to align with MathJax 3.0's API, and potentially altering how MathJax is initialized in the Sphinx project. These updates should preserve the ability of Sphinx to render mathematical notation in documentation while enhancing load times and performance thanks to the improvements introduced in MathJax 3.0."
