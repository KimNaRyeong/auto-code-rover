            "content": "To address the issue of upgrading MathJax to version 3.0 in the Sphinx MathJax extension, we need to gather more context about how MathJax is currently integrated within the Sphinx project. Specifically, we want to understand how MathJax is loaded and used within the Sphinx codebase, including any customization or configurations that are directly tied to MathJax version 2.x, as these areas will likely need modifications for the upgrade. The MathJax loading mechanism, initialization, and configuration are crucial pieces of information.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls would be relevant to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the Sphinx MathJax extension class or file**: Since we need to find where MathJax is integrated into Sphinx, we should start by looking for a likely class or file related to the MathJax extension. There might be a class or file explicitly named after MathJax or related to rendering equations in Sphinx.\n\n   - `search_class(\"MathJax\")`\n   - `search_code(\"MathJax\")` - This broad search might help us find initialization or configuration code snippets.\n\n2. **Search for methods related to configuring or initializing MathJax**: Assuming there's a method or methods responsible for setting up MathJax, we want to find these to understand the current integration and what needs to change for version 3.0.\n\n   - `search_method(\"init_mathjax\")` - Looking for a method that might be initializing MathJax.\n   - `search_method(\"config_mathjax\")` - A method that might be involved in configuring MathJax.\n\nThese API calls are aimed at understanding the current setup for MathJax within the Sphinx project and will help identify which parts of the codebase need modifications to support MathJax 3.0."
