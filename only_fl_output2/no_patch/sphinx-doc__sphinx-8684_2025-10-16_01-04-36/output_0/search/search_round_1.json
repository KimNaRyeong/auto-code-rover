This file likely contains the classes or methods responsible for processing these directives, although a direct reference to `:dedent:` was not found.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n   The code snippet from `sphinx/directives/code.py` registers several directives related to code highlighting and inclusion within Sphinx documentation, specifically including `code-block` and `literalinclude`. These are crucial for embedding code examples or including external code files directly into the documentation.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   Since the issue mentions extending `:dedent:` for `code-block` and `literalinclude`, the file `sphinx/directives/code.py` is likely where such functionality would be implemented or modified. The absence of direct references to `:dedent:` implies either it's handled elsewhere or under a different mechanism not directly searchable by the provided keywords.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   The intended behavior would involve modifying how `:dedent:` is handled within these directives to mimic the behavior of Python's `textwrap.dedent`, where if no dedent value is provided, a full dedent (removing common leading whitespace) is performed. Such functionality would make embedding code with consistent indentation easier and more intuitive for documentation authors.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nGiven these insights, the next reasonable step would involve a more detailed examination of the `LiteralInclude` and `CodeBlock` classes or methods within the `sphinx/directives/code.py` file. Specifically, searching for these classes can help identify where and how `:dedent:` could be modified or extended.\n\n```python\nsearch_class_in_file(\"CodeBlock\", \"sphinx/directives/code.py\")\nsearch_class_in_file(\"LiteralInclude\", \"sphinx/directives/code.py\")\n```"

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

Specifically, if no explicit dedent value is provided by the user, the directive should interpret this as an instruction to remove all common leading whitespace from the code being included. This enhancement should preserve any explicit dedent usage (where a specific dedent value is provided) to maintain backward compatibility.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `sphinx/directives/code.py`\n  - **Class:** `LiteralInclude`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Extend the `LiteralInclude` class to similarly process the `:dedent:` option as detailed for the `CodeBlock` class. This includes automatically dedenting included code to the least common whitespace level when no specific dedent value is provided, thereby facilitating more intuitive inclusion of external code files into the Sphinx documentation. This adjustment should equally ensure that explicit dedent values function as currently expected, to avoid disrupting existing documentation projects."
