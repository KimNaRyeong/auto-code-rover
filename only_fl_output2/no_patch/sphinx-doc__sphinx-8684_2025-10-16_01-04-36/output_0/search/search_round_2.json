This file likely contains the classes or methods responsible for processing these directives, although a direct reference to `:dedent:` was not found.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n   The code snippet from `sphinx/directives/code.py` registers several directives related to code highlighting and inclusion within Sphinx documentation, specifically including `code-block` and `literalinclude`. These are crucial for embedding code examples or including external code files directly into the documentation.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   Since the issue mentions extending `:dedent:` for `code-block` and `literalinclude`, the file `sphinx/directives/code.py` is likely where such functionality would be implemented or modified. The absence of direct references to `:dedent:` implies either it's handled elsewhere or under a different mechanism not directly searchable by the provided keywords.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   The intended behavior would involve modifying how `:dedent:` is handled within these directives to mimic the behavior of Python's `textwrap.dedent`, where if no dedent value is provided, a full dedent (removing common leading whitespace) is performed. Such functionality would make embedding code with consistent indentation easier and more intuitive for documentation authors.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nGiven these insights, the next reasonable step would involve a more detailed examination of the `LiteralInclude` and `CodeBlock` classes or methods within the `sphinx/directives/code.py` file. Specifically, searching for these classes can help identify where and how `:dedent:` could be modified or extended.\n\n```python\nsearch_class_in_file(\"CodeBlock\", \"sphinx/directives/code.py\")\nsearch_class_in_file(\"LiteralInclude\", \"sphinx/directives/code.py\")\n```"

Specifically, if no explicit dedent value is provided by the user, the directive should interpret this as an instruction to remove all common leading whitespace from the code being included. This enhancement should preserve any explicit dedent usage (where a specific dedent value is provided) to maintain backward compatibility.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `sphinx/directives/code.py`\n  - **Class:** `LiteralInclude`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Extend the `LiteralInclude` class to similarly process the `:dedent:` option as detailed for the `CodeBlock` class. This includes automatically dedenting included code to the least common whitespace level when no specific dedent value is provided, thereby facilitating more intuitive inclusion of external code files into the Sphinx documentation. This adjustment should equally ensure that explicit dedent values function as currently expected, to avoid disrupting existing documentation projects."

        "content": "### Analysis of CodeBlock and LiteralInclude Classes\n\n#### CodeBlock Class:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n   The `CodeBlock` class handles the `.. code-block::` directive in Sphinx documentation. It takes various options such as `linenos`, `emphasize-lines`, and `dedent`, allowing for customization of how code blocks are displayed. The `run` method combines these options to render a code block within documentation.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   The issue mentions extending the `:dedent:` behavior to mimic Python's `textwrap.dedent` when no explicit dedent value is provided. Currently, the `dedent` option requires an integer, specifying how many spaces to remove from the beginning of each line. There's no behavior for automatic dedentation based on the least common whitespace as in `textwrap.dedent`.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   Ideally, when the `:dedent:` option is used without specifying an integer value, the code should automatically detect the minimum indentation level across all lines of the code block and remove it, thus aligning the left edge of the code with the left edge of the documentation content. This would likely involve modifying how the `dedent` option is processed within the `run` method to consider this case.\n\n#### LiteralInclude Class:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n   The `LiteralInclude` class handles the `.. literalinclude::` directive, which includes content from external files into the documentation. Similar to `CodeBlock`, it supports a variety of options for controlling the presentation, including `dedent`, `linenos`, and line highlighting, among others.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   As with `CodeBlock`, the issue likely relates to the handling of the `dedent` option within `LiteralInclude`. There\u2019s no current support for automatically dedenting content based on the minimum whitespace present, which would be especially useful for included content where the author desires consistency in documentation appearance without manually adjusting external files.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   For `LiteralInclude`, when the `:dedent:` option is provided without a value, it should perform an automatic dedent operation similar to that described for `CodeBlock`. This would involve analyzing the included content to determine the smallest indentation level and removing that amount from the beginning of each line. Handling this within the `run` method may also involve adjusting how options are parsed and adding logic for this auto-dedent feature.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth classes currently lack auto-dedentation logic when the `:dedent:` option is provided without a value. The intended behavior is to modify both classes to add this feature, ensuring backward compatibility with existing functionality by only altering behavior when `:dedent:` lacks an explicit value."

This mirrors Python's `textwrap.dedent` behavior and would necessitate parsing and adjusting the current handling of the `dedent` option. This functionality should be added in such a way that it does not interfere with the existing ability to specify a fixed number of spaces to dedent.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `sphinx/directives/code.py`\n  - **Class:** `LiteralInclude`\n  - **Method:** `run`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The `LiteralInclude` class\u2019s `run` method should similarly be modified to handle auto-dedentation when the `dedent` option is provided without a specific value. The method should automatically calculate the minimum indentation of the included file and remove this amount of leading whitespace. This would be particularly useful for ensuring that included code matches the indentation style of the documentation without manual adjustment. Care should be taken to ensure this automatic deduction only occurs when explicitly requested (to preserve backwards compatibility and explicit control when needed).\n\nBoth modifications aim to introduce a flexible dedentation feature that simplifies the process of integrating code examples and external source files into Sphinx documentation, making it more readable and consistent, while maintaining backward compatibility and the explicit control provided by existing functionalities."
