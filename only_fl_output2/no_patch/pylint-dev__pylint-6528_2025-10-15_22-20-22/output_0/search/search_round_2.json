However, the centralized handling might be necessary to enforce these ignore rules universally, including recursive file selection.\n\n### Missing Results (`--recursive`, `--ignore-paths`, `--ignore-patterns`)\n- **Analysis**:\n  - The lack of direct results for `--recursive=y`, `--ignore-paths`, and `--ignore-patterns` implies that these options might be handled in a more generic or not straightforwardly named way within the codebase or their implementation is missing or not linked correctly with the argument parsing and file-filtering logic.\n\n### Next Steps in Analysis\nTo bridge the gap in understanding, especially around the missing links for recursion and certain ignore options, consider:\n- Further exploring how `arguments_manager.py` and `option_manager_mixin.py` handle the setup and passing of recursive and ignore options to the rest of the Pylint workflow.\n- Investigating if there's a common point where both recursive file selection and ignore rules are applied or should be applied.\n- Searching for specific functions related to file or directory traversal in recursive mode, as these functions would be key areas where ignore rules need to be applied.\n\n### Additional API Calls\nGiven the above analysis, additional API calls might include:\n- `search_code_in_file(\"recursive\", \"pylint/config/arguments_manager.py\")`: To see if recursive handling is explicitly mentioned.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"--ignore\", \"pylint/config/option_manager_mixin.py\")` and `search_code_in_file(\"--ignore\", \"pylint/config/arguments_manager.py\")`: To get a deeper understanding of how ignore options are integrated.\n- `search_method_in_file(\"parse_args\", \"pylint/config/arguments_manager.py\")`: A more targeted search to understand argument processing.\n\nBy following these steps, we can aim to pinpoint where the ignore logic fails in recursive mode, guiding us toward developing an appropriate patch."

However, we can hypothesize likely locations and describe the intended behavior based on common practices in argument parsing and file filtering in large Python projects like Pylint.\n\n- **Location 1:**\n  - **File**: `pylint/config/arguments_manager.py`\n  - **Description**: This file possibly contains functions or methods responsible for parsing command-line arguments, including `--recursive`, `--ignore`, `--ignore-paths`, and `--ignore-patterns`. The bug might lie in how these parsed values are utilized or not appropriately utilized in the context of recursive file analysis.\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Ensure the command-line arguments for ignores (`--ignore`, `--ignore-paths`, and `--ignore-patterns`) are accurately translated into filtering rules that are applied during the recursive analysis of directories and files. This includes correctly interpreting the patterns and respecting them in the file selection process before initiating lint checks.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File**: `pylint/checkers/similar.py`\n  - **Description**: While this file might not be directly responsible for the recursive analysis misbehavior, it indicates that `--ignore` rules are being considered at some point in the Pylint process. However, their implementation here might suggest a segmented or checker-specific approach to ignoring files.\n  - **Intended Behavior**: If the handling of `--ignore` in this file is indicative of a piecemeal approach to applying ignore rules, the intended behavior would be to centralize or unify the approach to ignoring files based on the command-line arguments. This would ensure that all parts of Pylint, including recursive file analysis, respect the specified rules uniformly.\n\nWithout specific insights from additional context, these locations and intended behaviors serve as a preliminary hypothesis. They draw on the principle that for Pylint to respect ignore rules in recursive mode, these rules must be uniformly integrated into both the command-line argument parsing stage and the file-filtering stages that precede lint checks."

These findings (or lack thereof) suggest a few possibilities about how Pylint's codebase might be structured regarding these functionalities:\n\n1. **Command-line arguments processing and recursive analysis logic might be abstracted away or handled differently than initially assumed,** indicating that the approach to locating the relevant code needs adjustment. Without direct references to recursive handling or ignore options in the expected files, these functionalities might be indirectly managed or triggered by a higher-level mechanism or through a combination of configuration settings.\n   \n2. **Misleading or incorrect filenames or method names were assumed in the search criteria,** implying that Pylint may use a different terminology or code organization strategy than what was anticipated. This could lead to missing the actual implementation details of the features in question.\n\nGiven these insights, let's consider what other approaches we could employ to better understand where and how Pylint manages recursive file analysis and applies ignore rules.\n\n### Rethinking Our Approach\nSince direct searches for `recursive`, `--ignore`, and related terms in expected locations did not yield results, we might need to broaden our exploration and consider alternate terms or mechanisms that could achieve similar functionality. Here are some alternative strategies:\n\n1. **Explore How Pylint Manages File Collections:** Since our core issue revolves around file selection and ignoring certain paths or patterns, focusing on how Pylint gathers and filters its set of files for analysis might offer clues. This could involve looking for more general file handling or traversal functionalities.\n   \n2. **Configuration Loading and Application:** It's possible that ignore rules and recursive analysis flags are managed through Pylint's configuration loading processes, which then influence how files are collected and analyzed. Investigating how Pylint loads and applies its configuration settings might lead to relevant code areas.\n   \n3. **High-Level Command Execution Logic:** Another angle is to examine the high-level logic that Pylint uses to interpret command-line arguments and translate them into actions. This could involve looking for the bootstrap or entry-point logic that sets up the linting session, including file selection.\n\n### Potential Follow-up API Calls\nGiven these considerations, alternative API calls could include:\n\n- **Exploration of File Handling:**\n  - `search_code(\"file collection\")`: To identify how Pylint collects files for analysis.\n  - `search_code(\"file traversal\")`: To uncover mechanisms of directory and file traversal, which might include recursive functionality.\n\n- **Configuration Loading and Application:**\n  - `search_code(\"load configuration\")`: Aiming to find how configuration files and command-line arguments are parsed and applied.\n\n- **Bootstrap or Entry-point Logic:**\n  - `search_code(\"linting session\")`: To potentially locate the initial setup phase where command-line arguments are processed and actions determined.\n\nThese approaches emphasize the need to look beyond specific argument processing and directly referenced recursive or ignore functionalities. They pivot towards understanding the broader system within which these features operate, potentially uncovering the mechanisms indirectly responsible for the described issue."
