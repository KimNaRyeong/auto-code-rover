        "intended_behavior": "The code should accurately parse `--ignore`, `--ignore-patterns`, and `--ignore-paths` arguments from the command line, ensuring they are stored for intended application. It should ensure that ignore rules are applied to exclude specified files or directories from analysis during recursive mode. This involves making sure any file paths matching the ignore criteria are skipped in the file selection process before linting."
