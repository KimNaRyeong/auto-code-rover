This standalone Python script `reproducer.py` is designed to be executed in the root directory of a project, specifically tested with the `astropy` library environment as described in the issue. The script checks for the misleading exception when removing a required column from a `TimeSeries` object and uses a customized `print_stacktrace` function to clearly output any exceptions' stack traces, adhering to the requirement to show line numbers of the statements that lead to the exception.

Upon running this script with `python3 reproducer.py`, it should raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, clearly printing the stack trace of the issue, which would help in identifying the exact location and nature of the problem in the code. When the issue is fixed, it is expected that the script exits with code 0, indicating no issues were found.
