        "intended_behavior": "The `expand_trig` function is currently able to expand trigonometric expressions involving `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `csc`, `sec`, etc., into their expanded forms. However, it lacks the capability to expand hyperbolic trigonometric functions `csch` and `sech`. The intended behavior here is to extend the existing functionality of `expand_trig` to include the expansion of `csch(x + y)` and `sech(x + y)` using their respective trigonometric expansion identities. This enhancement should be done by adding the necessary logic within the `expand_trig` method to handle these specific cases. The expansion should preserve the mathematical integrity of the expressions and perform in a manner similar to how `csc` and `sec` are currently being expanded. This would likely involve implementing additional checks for `csch` and `sech` within the method and applying the appropriate expansion formulas for hyperbolic functions."
