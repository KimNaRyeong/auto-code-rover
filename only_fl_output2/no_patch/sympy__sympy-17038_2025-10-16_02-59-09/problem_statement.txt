isqrt gives incorrect results
The `isqrt` function in `sympy.core.power` gives incorrect results for some inputs. For example:

```
>>> from sympy.core.power import isqrt
>>> n = 4503599761588224
>>> s = isqrt(n)
>>> s  # correct result is 67108864
67108865
>>> s**2 <= n  # expect True
False
```

or

```
>>> isqrt(9999999999999999)  # should be 99999999
100000000
```

## Analysis

For small values of `n`, the [current implementation](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/3febfc43ca0aa23d916ef06057e8c6d396a955e7/sympy/core/power.py#L23-L27) uses `math.sqrt` (aliased to `_sqrt`):

```
    if n < 17984395633462800708566937239552:
        return int(_sqrt(n))
```

The main problem is that the bound used for `n` here is much too large, at almost `2**104`.

*If* (and it's quite a big if) we can assume that Python floats are IEEE 754 binary64 format _and_ that `math.sqrt` supplies a correctly-rounded (using round-ties-to-even) square root function, then the largest bound that can safely be used here is `4503599761588224`, or `2**52 + 2**27`.

If we can assume IEEE 754 binary64 `float`s but can't assume a correctly-rounded `math.sqrt`, then `int(_sqrt(n + 0.5))` is still safe for smallish `n`, where the definition of "smallish" depends on how accurate `math.sqrt` is. For example, if `_sqrt(n)` is known to be accurate to within 2 ulps, then it's possible to show that `int(_sqrt(n + 0.5))` is safe for `n < 2**50`. (The `+0.5` is necessary here: `int(_sqrt(n))` wouldn't be safe even for tiny `n`, since e.g. if the result of `_sqrt(25)` is off by a single ulp downwards, `int(_sqrt(25))` would produce `4` instead of `5`.)

Whether `math.sqrt` is correctly rounded or not will depend on the platform: Python's `math.sqrt` just wraps the `sqrt` function from C's math library. On modern x64 hardware, one would expect and hope that C's `sqrt` gets mapped to the appropriate SSE2 instruction, in which case it'll be correctly rounded. But on ARM there may well not be a hardware sqrt instruction to map to, and a hand-implemented libm sqrt could easily be incorrectly rounded for some inputs.

In the unlikely (but possible) case of non-IEEE 754 binary64 `float`s, it's probably safer to avoid using `math.sqrt` at all. But this case is likely to be exceedingly rare, and doesn't seem worth worrying about in practice.

I guess one option for fixing this while retaining performance for small `n` would be to continue to use the `int(_sqrt(n))` code, but then to check the result is correct before returning it, falling back to the slow integer-only path if that check doesn't pass.
