        "intended_behavior": "The `isqrt` function should accurately compute the integer square root for all input values `n`, ensuring that the result is the largest integer `m` where `m^2 <= n`. The threshold for deciding between using the direct floating-point square root calculation (`int(_sqrt(n))`) and the more accurate integer-only calculation (`integer_nthroot(int(n), 2)[0]`) needs adjustment. Considering precision limitations of floating-point arithmetic, particularly the IEEE 754 binary64 format, the threshold should be lowered to `4503599761588224` (`2**52 + 2**27`), as suggested in the issue. Additionally, introduce a post-calculation check to confirm the accuracy of the returned value when using the floating-point approach, reverting to the integer-only method if the check fails. This ensures that the method's behavior remains consistent across a wider range of inputs, preserving the existing functionality while correcting the inaccuracies identified."
