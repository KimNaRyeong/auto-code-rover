        "content": "<issue>isqrt gives incorrect results\nThe `isqrt` function in `sympy.core.power` gives incorrect results for some inputs. For example:\n```\n>>> from sympy.core.power import isqrt\n>>> n = 4503599761588224\n>>> s = isqrt(n)\n>>> s  # correct result is 67108864\n67108865\n>>> s**2 <= n  # expect True\nFalse\n```\nor\n```\n>>> isqrt(9999999999999999)  # should be 99999999\n100000000\n```\nVersions: Python 3.7.3, SymPy 1.4, macOS 10.14.5\n## Analysis\nFor small values of `n`, the [current implementation](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/3febfc43ca0aa23d916ef06057e8c6d396a955e7/sympy/core/power.py#L23-L27) uses `math.sqrt` (aliased to `_sqrt`):\n```\nif n < 17984395633462800708566937239552:\nreturn int(_sqrt(n))\n```\nThe main problem is that the bound used for `n` here is much too large, at almost `2**104`.\n*If* (and it's quite a big if) we can assume that Python floats are IEEE 754 binary64 format _and_ that `math.sqrt` supplies a correctly-rounded (using round-ties-to-even) square root function, then the largest bound that can safely be used here is `4503599761588224`, or `2**52 + 2**27`.\nIf we can assume IEEE 754 binary64 `float`s but can't assume a correctly-rounded `math.sqrt`, then `int(_sqrt(n + 0.5))` is still safe for smallish `n`, where the definition of \"smallish\" depends on how accurate `math.sqrt` is. For example, if `_sqrt(n)` is known to be accurate to within 2 ulps, then it's possible to show that `int(_sqrt(n + 0.5))` is safe for `n < 2**50`. (The `+0.5` is necessary here: `int(_sqrt(n))` wouldn't be safe even for tiny `n`, since e.g. if the result of `_sqrt(25)` is off by a single ulp downwards, `int(_sqrt(25))` would produce `4` instead of `5`.)\nWhether `math.sqrt` is correctly rounded or not will depend on the platform: Python's `math.sqrt` just wraps the `sqrt` function from C's math library. On modern x64 hardware, one would expect and hope that C's `sqrt` gets mapped to the appropriate SSE2 instruction, in which case it'll be correctly rounded. But on ARM there may well not be a hardware sqrt instruction to map to, and a hand-implemented libm sqrt could easily be incorrectly rounded for some inputs.\nIn the unlikely (but possible) case of non-IEEE 754 binary64 `float`s, it's probably safer to avoid using `math.sqrt` at all. But this case is likely to be exceedingly rare, and doesn't seem worth worrying about in practice.\nI guess one option for fixing this while retaining performance for small `n` would be to continue to use the `int(_sqrt(n))` code, but then to check the result is correct before returning it, falling back to the slow integer-only path if that check doesn't pass.\n</issue>"

        "content": "The collected context from the `isqrt` function within `sympy/core/power.py` reveals the following insights:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   The `isqrt` method computes the integer square root of a given number `n`. This means it finds the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `n`. The method does so by directly returning `int(_sqrt(n))` for `n` less than a specific bound (`17984395633462800708566937239552`). Beyond this bound, it falls back on an \"integer nth root\" method `integer_nthroot(int(n), 2)[0]` to compute the square root, likely to handle large numbers accurately without relying on floating-point approximations.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   The issue lies with the conditional check for determining when to use `int(_sqrt(n))`. The reported bug indicates that `int(_sqrt(n))` returns incorrect results for some inputs. This matches the section `if n < 17984395633462800708566937239552: return int(_sqrt(n))`, suggesting that the chosen threshold for switching between `int(_sqrt(n))` and using `integer_nthroot` is too high. Due to the precision limits of floating-point arithmetic (`_sqrt(n)` likely represents `math.sqrt(n)`), numbers close to or beyond the floating-point precision limit are rounded incorrectly when converting to an integer.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   The intended behavior should ensure that `isqrt(n)` always returns the largest integer `m` such that `m^2 <= n`, for all non-negative integers `n`. The current implementation fails to do this correctly for certain large numbers due to the limitations of floating-point arithmetic used in `_sqrt(n)`. The issue suggests refining the threshold for when to apply floating-point square root calculations, grounded in the understanding of floating-point precision limits, specifically the IEEE 754 binary64 format used by Python floats.\n\nGiven this analysis and the fact search for `math.sqrt` in the file returned no results, which indicates `_sqrt(n)` is a placeholder or an alias for `math.sqrt(n)`, we should explore further:\n\n- Since `math.sqrt` was not found explicitly and assuming `_sqrt` behaves identally, further search might not be directly fruitful without understanding `_sqrt`'s definition. A potential area of improvement is revising the threshold for using `int(_sqrt(n))` based on the issue description or introducing a post-calculation check that validates the squared result against the original input, as suggested by the issue reporter.\n- It's also crucial to verify how `_sqrt` is defined or aliased within the codebase, ensuring our assumptions of its behavior match its actual implementation. However, without explicit mentions in the returned context or direct reference to `math.sqrt`, our actions will primarily focus on adjusting the implementation logic of `isqrt`.\n\nThe proposed actions based on the bug report and our analyses could involve revising the logic in `isqrt` to reduce the threshold for utilizing `int(_sqrt(n))` or incorporating a verification step post-calculation to correct any inaccuracies introduced by floating-point operations."

The threshold for deciding between using the direct floating-point square root calculation (`int(_sqrt(n))`) and the more accurate integer-only calculation (`integer_nthroot(int(n), 2)[0]`) needs adjustment. Considering precision limitations of floating-point arithmetic, particularly the IEEE 754 binary64 format, the threshold should be lowered to `4503599761588224` (`2**52 + 2**27`), as suggested in the issue. Additionally, introduce a post-calculation check to confirm the accuracy of the returned value when using the floating-point approach, reverting to the integer-only method if the check fails. This ensures that the method's behavior remains consistent across a wider range of inputs, preserving the existing functionality while correcting the inaccuracies identified.\n"
