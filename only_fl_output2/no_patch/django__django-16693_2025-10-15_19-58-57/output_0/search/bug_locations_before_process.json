        "intended_behavior": "The `bind_template` method should include error handling to check the return type of each context processor. If a context processor returns `None` or any type that is not a dictionary, the method should raise a clear and descriptive error message. This message could resemble the helpful pattern used when views do not return an `HttpResponse` object, such as: \"The context processor [processor_name] did not return a dict object. It returned None instead.\"\n\nThis enhancement will not alter the primary functionality of the method; instead, it adds a layer of validation to ensure that context processors adhere to the expected return type, thus improving developer experience by providing clearer guidance when errors occur. The error handling should catch incorrect return types before attempting to update the context, preventing the generic `TypeError` and making debugging more straightforward for developers."
