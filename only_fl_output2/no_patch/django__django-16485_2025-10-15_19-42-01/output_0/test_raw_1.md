This standalone Python script is designed to reproduce the specified issue related to the `floatformat()` function within Django. It checks the behavior of `floatformat` when fed with `'0.00'` as both a string and a `Decimal` object, expecting a `ValueError` with a specific message. If the error occurs as described, it prints a detailed stack trace for both cases and exits with code 0 due to the `AssertionError`, signaling the presence of the issue. If the conditions for raising an `AssertionError` are not met, it concludes that the issue might have been addressed and prints a corresponding message.
