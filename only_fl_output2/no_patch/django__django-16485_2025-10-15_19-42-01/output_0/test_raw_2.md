This script attempts to reproduce the issue where `floatformat()` throws a `ValueError` when given "0.00" as a string or a `Decimal` with zero precision specified. It sets up a minimal Django configuration to ensure the filter can be used standalone, then checks both cases that were known to cause the problem. If the expected `ValueError` is observed, it prints the stack trace using the provided function and exits with code 0, indicating the issue was successfully reproduced. If for some reason the error does not occur as anticipated, it raises an `AssertionError` and exits with code 1, highlighting that the issue might have been fixed or otherwise did not occur as expected under the test conditions.
