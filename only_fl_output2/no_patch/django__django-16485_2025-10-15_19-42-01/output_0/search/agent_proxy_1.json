This adjustment ensures that when `0` is provided as the argument for precision, the method formats the number to the nearest whole integer without decimal places, without throwing a `ValueError`.\n\n  The specific behavior adjustments needed are:\n  \n  - Directly before attempting to quantify the decimal (around lines 180-206), insert a condition to check if the precision argument (`p`) is `0`. If it is, we want to directly format the number to an integer without any decimal places. This might involve skipping the quantize step and directly formatting the integer part of the `Decimal` object, ensuring it still respects the `force_grouping` and `use_l10n` settings if applicable.\n  \n  - Ensure that this adjustment accounts for both positive and negative zeros, as the behavior should be consistent regardless of the sign of the zero. This check is especially important as it might impact how the number is rounded or presented.\n\n  - Finally, testing is required to ensure this change does not inadvertently affect other use cases of `floatformat`, particularly those with non-zero precision specifications or those relying on default behavior. It's critical to confirm that behavior for formatting with other precisions, including negative precisions and the default behavior, remains unchanged.\n\n  This change addresses the reported issue by allowing `floatformat` to gracefully handle `0` precision without raising exceptions, aligning with the intuitive expectation that specifying `0` precision should result in an integer representation of the floating-point number."
