Specifically, I'll need to look at how `floatformat` handles its inputs and where the `ValueError` might be originating from when processing a value like '0.00'. Therefore, the following API calls would be appropriate to get the necessary context:\n\n- `search_method(\"floatformat\")`: This will help locate the implementation of `floatformat` in the Django codebase.\n- `search_code(\"ValueError: valid range for prec\")`: This will help find where the error message about the valid range for precision is defined or raised, which might lead us directly to the point where the issue occurs."
