```

This script first attempts to reproduce the issue by calling `floatformat()` with the problematic inputs. If an exception is caught, it checks whether the error message matches the expected one ("valid range for prec is [1, MAX_PREC]"), confirming the bug. If the message differs, it raises an `AssertionError` with "Unexpected ValueError message" to indicate the bug might have changed.

The script uses the provided `print_stacktrace()` function to clearly output the stack trace when the exception occurs, helping to pinpoint where the issue arises in the code. If the `ValueError` isn't thrown, implying the issue is fixed, it prints a message stating as much. 

For the sake of demonstration, an `AssertionError` is raised if the specific bug is encountered, triggering the `print_stacktrace()` call. The script is designed to be executed in an environment where Django is installed and configured, as it directly utilizes the Django `floatformat` filter, which is not a standalone Python feature but part of Django's template default filters.
