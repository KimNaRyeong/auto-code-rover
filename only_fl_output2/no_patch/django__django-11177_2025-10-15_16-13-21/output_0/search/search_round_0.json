It seems to work consistently once on a file, but multiple changes to the same file will not necessarily trigger a reload. It's definitely a change in the behavior to previous versions of Django (up to 2.1.7)\nI'm not using watchman.\nI'm running runserver in a python 3.7 slim docker container like ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001\nAs a workaround I have tried to add an edit a different .py -- that doesn't seem to help consistently. I've also noticed that the problem seems to sometimes go away by itself -- perhaps there is some change to the timing of the autoreloader which is not clear? For example and ignore interval of a certain duration.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described with the Django 2.2 autoreloader failing intermittently, we should focus on gathering information related to the autoreloader feature. Django's autoreloader mechanism is primarily responsible for detecting changes in the project files during development and reloading the server to reflect those changes. Since the issue does not seem tied to a specific custom implementation but rather to Django's internal handling of autoreload in a Docker environment, it is logical to look into the Django source code related to autoreloading.\n\nGiven that the issue mentions upgrading to Django 2.2 and observing a difference in autoreloader behavior compared to previous versions, and considering that Watchman is not being used, the areas of interest could be the core autoreload mechanism and any configuration or method that Django uses to track file changes for the autoreload feature in a Docker environment.\n\nHere are the API calls that would be appropriate to gather context for resolving the issue:\n\n1. **Search for the Autoreloader Class or Functionality in Django's Codebase**: Since the autoreloader's behavior has changed, it's critical to understand the implementation details of the autoreloader in Django 2.2. \n   - `search_class(\"Autoreloader\")`\n   - This will help us locate the class responsible for handling the autoreloading functionality if it is encapsulated within a class with a straightforward name or similar. If Django does not use a class specifically named \"Autoreloader\" or if the search is too broad, we might need to refine the search or look for methods directly related to autoreloading.\n\n2. **Search for Methods Related to File Change Detection**: Since the problem involves the autoreloader not detecting changes to `.py` files consistently, understanding how Django identifies file changes could be key.\n   - `search_method(\"file_changed\")`\n   - `search_method(\"code_changed\")`\n   - These methods (or similarly named ones) could be involved in the process of detecting file changes and triggering the reload process.\n\n3. **Search for Configuration or Parameters Related to Timing or Polling Intervals**: The issue hints at a possible timing-related cause, such as ignore intervals that might not be clear. It would be beneficial to look for any configuration options or hardcoded values that determine how often Django checks for file changes.\n   - `search_code(\"ignore interval\")`\n   - `search_code(\"polling interval\")`\n   - This search aims to uncover any settings or hardcoded values that could influence the frequency of file change checks, which, if too infrequent, could miss rapid successive changes to files.\n\nThese API calls are selected with the aim of identifying the components involved in the autoreload process, how they detect file changes, and any parameters that might influence the timing or behavior of these detections. Based on the results from these calls, we could narrow down the potential areas in the Django codebase that might need adjustments or further investigation."
