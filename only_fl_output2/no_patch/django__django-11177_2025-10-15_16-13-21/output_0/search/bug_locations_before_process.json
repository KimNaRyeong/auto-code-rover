This could involve refining the criteria or mechanisms used to detect file changes, possibly incorporating additional checks or fallbacks that mitigate the issue of intermittent detection. Specifically, it should ensure that successive changes to the same file reliably trigger the autoreloader, potentially by adjusting detection logic to account for nuances in filesystem event propagation within Docker."
