        "intended_behavior": "The `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` must be modified or extended to ensure compatibility with asynchronous file serving requirements. This entails adapting synchronous file iterators into an asynchronous format before they are consumed by `StreamingHttpResponse`, bypassing the warning and aligning with async serving mechanisms in Django. A potential solution could involve implementing a wrapper around the synchronous iterator to asynchronously yield file content when `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` serves static files. This adjustment ensures `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` properly interfaces with `StreamingHttpResponse` under Django's asynchronous serving model, preserving the existing functionality of serving static files efficiently while adhering to Django\u2019s async capabilities."
