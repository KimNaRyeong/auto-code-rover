Use an asynchronous iterator instead.\nThis is because FileResponse is not async compatible (nor is that likely, since neither is open()).\nA new project with:\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n\"daphne\",\n...\n]\nASGI_APPLICATION = \"project.asgi.application\"\nrunserver, and then visit any page serving static files such as /admin/.\nThe fix is to have ASGIStaticFilesHandler adapt the iterator in the same way StreamingHttpResponse does.\n</issue>"
