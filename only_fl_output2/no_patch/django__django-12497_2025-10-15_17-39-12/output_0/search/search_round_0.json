And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary context to address the issue regarding the incorrect hint about recursive relationships in Django involving ForeignKey and ManyToManyField usage, I plan to perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. Search for the code snippet where the incorrect hint is generated. The hint is very specific, so searching for part of the error message should help locate where the issue originates from. The hint contains the text about a recursive relationship, which is unique enough to locate the problematic code:\n\n```\nsearch_code('use ForeignKey(\"%s\", symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\")')\n```\n\n2. Since the error involves Django model fields, specifically handling of ForeignKey and ManyToManyField in an intermediary model, it's likely that this code might be part of methods related to model validation or model field handling. Therefore, I will also search for methods that could logically contain this logic. While the exact method names are not provided, common patterns in Django include methods like `validate`, `check`, or names related to relationship fields:\n\n```\nsearch_method('validate')\nsearch_method('check')\n```\n\nThese API calls are designed to locate the incorrect hint within the Django framework and to identify relevant validation or checking methods that may deal with this kind of relationship error handling. This context should be sufficient to start drafting a correction."
