        "intended_behavior": "The method `_check_relationship_model` is intended to validate ManyToMany relationships, specifically when an intermediary model is involved. The current incorrect hint suggests using ForeignKey attributes for a ManyToManyField setup, which is misleading. The correction involves updating the hint within this method to accurately provide guidance on setting up recursive relationships with ManyToManyField. The hint should use correct ManyToManyField arguments and remove the outdated `symmetrical=False` suggestion. The corrected hint needs to instruct developers correctly on setting up such relationships without implying the use of ForeignKey parameters that do not apply to ManyToManyField. This way, the functionality for checking and guiding the correct configuration of ManyToMany relationships is preserved and made more accurate with current Django API standards."
