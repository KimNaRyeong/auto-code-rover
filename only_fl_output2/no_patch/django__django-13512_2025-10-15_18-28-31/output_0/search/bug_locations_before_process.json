This modification should preserve all existing functionalities related to data validation, storage, and retrieval while ensuring the display and editing of Unicode characters in Django admin are handled correctly. The serialization method (if present) in this class should be updated or a customization option should be implemented to support non-ASCII characters seamlessly in the admin interface."

Specifically, this involves ensuring that forms rendering `JSONField` inputs correctly handle and display Unicode characters. If a serialization or deserialization method is involved in preparing `JSONField` data for the admin interface, it should respect Unicode characters by ensuring it does not default to escape sequences. This might require overriding default form field behavior or serialization logic specifically for the admin interface."
