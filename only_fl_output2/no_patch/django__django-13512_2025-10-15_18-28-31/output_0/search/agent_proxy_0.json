            "content": "To effectively address the issue related to the improper display of unicode characters in JSONFields within the Django admin interface, it appears necessary to gain a comprehensive understanding of code interactions particularly in areas where JSON serialization happens, and how it integrates with the Django admin for JSONFields. Given the information in the issue, we will focus on the json.dumps utility as it's central to the problem mentioned, and also investigate any Django admin customization or JSONField handling to ensure compatibility with unicode characters.\n\nTo begin with, let's conduct a series of API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Since the issue mentions issues with `json.dumps` when serializing Chinese characters, and an attempt to handle this in the `django-mysql` project, it's relevant to look into how JSON fields are defined or serialized in that context. However, directly searching for `json.dumps` might yield too broad results because it is a common Python method. So, we should focus on finding customization related to this in the Django project or the `django-mysql` extension. Let\u2019s look for any class that might be responsible for handling JSONFields in Django or the `django-mysql` extension.\n\n2. The issue also describes an editing scenario in the Django admin interface which suggests customization of the admin interface for `JsonField`. Let's search for Django admin customization related to JSONField which could be in forms or admin widgets.\n\nGiven these considerations, I propose the following specific API calls for effective gathering of code context:\n\n- `search_class(\"JSONField\")`: To find the declaration or customization of `JSONField` classes which might be handling serialization.\n- `search_method(\"dumps\")`: Given the centrality of `json.dumps` in the issue, searching for its usage can highlight custom serialization mechanisms or hooks.\n- `search_code(\"admin.site.register\")`: Since customization or special handling in the Django admin often involves registering models or custom forms/widgets, searching for registration calls can lead to discovering how JSONFields are administered in the admin interface.\n- `search_code(\"forms.ModelForm\")`: To find any custom model form that might customize the serialization or presentation of JSONFields in the admin.\n  \nThese calls are aimed to cover both the serialization behavior that leads to the encoding issue and the Django admin customization that might interact with this serialization."
