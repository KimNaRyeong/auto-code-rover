The merge function within this file currently processes combine_attrs to decide how to combine attributes from different Dataset objects being merged. The intended behavior is to extend this logic to support a new option, \"drop_conflicts\", which will combine attributes from all objects like the existing \"no_conflicts\" option but will drop any attribute where conflicting values are found instead of raising an error. This behavior will offer a more flexible approach to handling attributes during merges, fitting scenarios where users prefer to avoid errors over attribute conflicts. This adjustment should preserve all existing functionality and only extend additional behavior for managing attrs."

        "intended_behavior": "Assuming the merge() method in this file calls into the core merge logic and handles dataset-level merging specifics, it might need to be updated to correctly pass through the new combine_attrs option and to handle the expected behavior of dropping conflicting attributes when combine_attrs=\"drop_conflicts\" is specified. This ensures that dataset-level merge operations respect the new option, seamlessly integrating it into higher-level APIs. The existing functionality for handling other combine_attrs options must remain unaffected."
