We might call this `combine_attrs=\"drop_conflicts\"` or `combine_attrs=\"matching\"`.\nThis is similar to how xarray currently handles conflicting values for `DataArray.name` and would be more suitable to consider for the default behavior of `merge` and other functions/methods that merge coordinates (e.g., apply_ufunc, concat, where, binary arithmetic).\ncc @keewis\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively and gather sufficient context for crafting a patch, the following API calls would be necessary based on the descriptions provided in the issue:\n\n1. The issue mentions a problem with the `merge()` function related to the handling of `attrs`. Given this information, it's critical to locate the `merge()` function within the codebase. Since the issue does not specify a class name for `merge()`, the assumption is that it's either a standalone function or part of a class that wasn't identified in the issue submission. Therefore, a broad search is needed:\n   ```\n   search_method(\"merge\")\n   ```\n\n2. The issue description suggests a modification or extension of behavior for the `combine_attrs` parameter in the `merge()` function. To understand the current implementation and determine where to introduce the `combine_attrs=\"drop_conflicts\"` or `combine_attrs=\"matching\"` option, we need to find the portion of the code where `combine_attrs` is processed. This requires finding code snippets that include `combine_attrs`:\n   ```\n   search_code(\"combine_attrs\")\n   ```\n\nGiven the information from the issue, these API calls are aimed at locating the `merge()` method or function and understanding how the `combine_attrs` parameter is currently handled within the codebase."
