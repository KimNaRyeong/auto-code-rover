Modify the format string to \"%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s\". This change aims to incorporate the module name into the logging format, enhancing the descriptiveness of log messages without altering the existing structure or functionality of the logging configuration. This modification will apply to both console and file logging configurations in pytest that use the default logging format."

However, the effect of changing `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` will be observed here since the default logging format for both `--log-format` and `--log-file-format` options will now include module names. The intended behavior is to ensure that when the default values are used, the log output is more informative, aiding in debugging by providing clarity on where the log messages originate from."
