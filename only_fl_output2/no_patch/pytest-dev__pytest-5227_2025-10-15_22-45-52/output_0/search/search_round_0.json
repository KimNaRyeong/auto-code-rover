Given the nature of the issue, which revolves around logging configuration, it is imperative to first locate the definition of `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` and then ascertain its references throughout the codebase. This will provide a comprehensive view of its application and potential areas that might be impacted by modifying the logging format.\n\nAccordingly, the following API calls are necessary to gather the required context:\n\n1. `search_code(\"DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT = \\\"%(filename)-25s %(lineno)4d %(levelname)-8s %(message)s\\\"\")`: This call will help to locate the exact file and line number where the default log format is defined.\n2. `search_code(\"DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT\")`: After identifying where `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` is defined, this call will surface all references to it throughout the project, allowing us to understand the scope of its usage."
