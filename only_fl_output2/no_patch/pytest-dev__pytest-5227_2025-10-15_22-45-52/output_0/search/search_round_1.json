        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, we can derive the following insights related to the logging format issue:\n\n### 1. Definition of `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT`:\nThe definition of `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` occurs in `src/_pytest/logging.py`:\n```python\n18 DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT = \"%(filename)-25s %(lineno)4d %(levelname)-8s %(message)s\"\n```\n- **What it does**: This line defines the default logging format used throughout the pytest framework unless overridden.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: This format string specifies the appearance of log messages, which currently includes the filename, line number, log level, and the message itself. The issue described suggests modifying this format to include the module name (`%(name)s`) for more descriptive logging.\n- **Intended behavior**: The logging format should be improved by incorporating the module name and possibly the module's relative path into the log message for enhanced clarity and debuggability.\n\n### 2. Usage in `pytest_addoption` for `--log-format`:\nIn `src/_pytest/logging.py`, within the `pytest_addoption` function, `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` is the default value for `--log-format`:\n```python\n111         default=DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT,\n```\n- **What it does**: This function defines CLI options for pytest, allowing users to customize the log format via command line options.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: Changing the default format as suggested would mean this CLI option automatically benefits from the improved logging detail without requiring users to manually specify a custom format that includes the module name.\n- **Intended behavior**: Providing a sensible default that includes both filename and module name, improving over the base filename for contexts where different modules might have similarly named files.\n\n### 3. Usage in `pytest_addoption` for `--log-file-format`:\nSimilarly, `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` is used as the default value for `--log-file-format`:\n```python\n156         default=DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT,\n```\n- **What it does**: Similar to `--log-format`, but specifically for formatting logs that are directed to a file.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: Altering the default log format will enhance log files' utility by ensuring they contain detailed module information alongside other data. This is especially useful for debugging purposes when logs are reviewed post-execution.\n- **Intended behavior**: Enhance log files with detailed logging information making it easier to trace back issues to specific modules, especially when filenames alone might not provide sufficient context.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe proposed modification to include `%(name)s` in the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` would impact both console and file logging as configured through pytest's options. This change aims to provide more expressive and detailed logging out-of-the-box by adding module name information to the log messages. Given this context, the next steps would include preparing a patch that modifies the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` string accordingly and validating that the change doesn't introduce unintended consequences for existing logging configurations."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

Modify the format string to `\"%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s\"`. This change aims to incorporate the module name into the logging format, enhancing the descriptiveness of log messages without altering the existing structure or functionality of the logging configuration. This modification will apply to both console and file logging configurations in pytest that use the default logging format.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `src/_pytest/logging.py`\n  - **Method:** `pytest_addoption`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** No changes are necessary in the implementation of these methods. However, the effect of changing `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` will be observed here since the default logging format for both `--log-format` and `--log-file-format` options will now include module names. The intended behavior is to ensure that when the default values are used, the log output is more informative, aiding in debugging by providing clarity on where the log messages originate from.\n\nBy modifying the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` as described, we ensure that the default behavior of pytest's logging becomes more useful for developers by including module names in log messages, thus directly addressing the issue presented. This change enriches the information available in log entries without requiring users to customize their logging format for common debugging needs."
