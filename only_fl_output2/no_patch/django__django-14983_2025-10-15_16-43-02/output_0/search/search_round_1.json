        "content": "Based on the search results we have received, let's analyze the context for each and consider the next steps towards constructing a resolution for the reported issue.\n\n### Analysis of `MigrationAutodetector`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `MigrationAutodetector` class is likely responsible for detecting changes in models that require new migrations. It includes methods for generating various types of migrations, such as created models, deleted models, added fields, altered fields, and more. It also has capabilities related to handling model and field renames.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug:**\n  This class is central to the functionality of detecting changes that necessitate new migrations. Given the issue with incorrectly numbered migration files, the methods related to arranging migrations (`arrange_for_graph`), determining dependencies (`_get_dependencies_for_foreign_key`, `check_dependency`), and possibly `parse_number` could be directly involved. These methods might play a role in how new migration files are named, especially in the presence of squashed migrations.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n  The intended behavior would be to correctly number new migration files considering both squashed and non-squashed existing migrations. When squashed migrations are present, new migrations should logically follow the highest existing migration number to avoid confusion and conflicts.\n\n### Analysis of `squashed` code snippets\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  While we don't have the specific contents of the snippets containing `squashed`, their presence across files like `django/db/migrations/loader.py`, `graph.py`, and particularly `django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py` indicates these snippets are involved in loading, handling, and creating squashed migrations.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug:**\n  The reference to `squashed` across these files suggests they include logic for handling squashed migrations. The loader and the squashing command are particularly suspect in potentially contributing to the misnumbering of new migration files since these components would be aware of the presence of squashed migrations and their interaction with regular migration files.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n  The code involving squashed migrations should ensure that the naming and ordering of new migrations take into account the presence of squashed migrations to generate correctly numbered migration files.\n\n### Next Steps to Collect More Context\n\nSince the bug revolves around the incorrect numbering of new migration files when squashed migrations exist, and given the lack of direct hits on methods related to determining next migration numbers, focusing on the specific mechanisms by which migrations are named and numbered seems essential. Specifically, we should look into the classes and methods managing the migration files directly.\n\n1. **Further explore `MigrationLoader` and related methods:** Since the `MigrationLoader` was mentioned but not found in initial searches, it would be beneficial to explore it in more detail, given its likely role in loading existing migrations which is crucial for numbering new ones.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"MigrationLoader\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Examine migration naming mechanism:** It seems the method or logic directly responsible for naming new migrations (migration numbering logic) wasn't directly caught in the initial round of searches. Investigating the migration creation process could reveal how names are decided.\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"generate_migration_name\", \"MigrationAutodetector\")\n   search_code(\"MigrationAutodetector\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Look into squashed migrations handling:** To understand how squashed migrations might affect migration numbering, it would be beneficial to examine the specific handling of squashed migrations more closely.\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_file(\"squashed\", \"django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py\")\n   search_method_in_file(\"apply_migration\", \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\")\n   ```\n\nBy exploring these areas, we can form a better understanding of where the issue might reside in the migration generation and numbering process and how squashed migrations currently interact with new migrations. This will build a solid basis for proposing a patch to fix the issue."

Do we need more context?\n\nGiven the scope of the issue and the information at hand, additional context seems unnecessary for identifying the probable locations requiring fixes. The provided data from the search API calls and the analysis of the issue provide sufficient groundwork to hypothesize where the bug might reside and how it should be addressed. Therefore, this section is intentionally left empty as we move on to specify the potential bug locations and the intended behavior changes needed to resolve the issue.\n\n### 2. Where are bug locations?\n\n**Bug Location 1:**\n- **File:** `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`\n- **Class:** `MigrationAutodetector`\n- **Method:** Likely involved methods include `changes`, `arrange_for_graph`, or another method within this class responsible for determining migration file naming, though specific method names for handling migration numbering were not identified. The exact method handling the increment or decision of next migration number needs attention.\n\n**Intended Behavior:** \nThe methods in `MigrationAutodetector` related to naming or numbering migrations should be adjusted to properly consider squashed migrations when determining the next migration number. Specifically, when calculating the next migration number, the logic should be enhanced to:\n- Identify the highest existing migration number across both standard and squashed migration files within a particular Django app.\n- Increment this number to define the next migration file's name, ensuring no collisions occur with existing migrations, including both squashed and non-squashed ones.\n- Preserve functionality where, if only squashed migrations are present (with no subsequent migrations), new migrations correctly follow this numbering scheme.\n\n**Bug Location 2:**\n- **File:** `django/db/migrations/loader.py`\n- **Class:** Not explicitly mentioned, but likely `MigrationLoader` or similar.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\nAssuming `MigrationLoader` (or its equivalent in handling the loading of migration files) is confirmed as located in this file, its logic for recognizing and sorting migration files must account for squashed migrations accurately. This involves an adjustment to:\n- Properly enumerate all types of migration files (standard, squashed, etc.) and use this enumeration to inform the migration numbering process.\n- Ensure the presence of squashed migrations does not erroneously influence the numbering of newly created migrations, allowing the numbering to continue sequentially from the highest existing number.\n\nThese targeted adjustments aim to resolve the reported issue while maintaining the integrity and expected functionality of Django's migration system, specifically catering to scenarios where squashed migrations are involved."
