It does make sense though when only 0001_squashed_0002_auto_20141202_1234 is left.\nAlthough the latter case eventually hits every project, I'd prefer the former.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To effectively gather the necessary context to address the reported issue concerning the generation of incorrectly numbered migration files when squashed migrations are in place, let's strategically employ the available search APIs:\n\n1. **Identify the main components involved in migration file generation:** The issue revolves around the generation of migration files and how their numbering is determined in the presence of squashed migrations. A logical starting point would be to look into classes and methods responsible for migration file generation and numbering.\n\n2. **Locate where migrations are generated:** Knowing the typical structure of Django (assuming the context from the description of `makemigrations`), we're likely dealing with the Django migrations framework, specifically parts involving the creation and naming of migration files.\n\nGiven these points, here are the targeted API calls that can be made to collect the relevant code context:\n\n- **Search for the class that generates migrations:** Since `makemigrations` is a management command in Django, it's reasonable to assume there's a specific class handling this command.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"MigrationAutodetector\")\n   ```\n\n- **Search for methods involved in creating new migration files:** To understand how new migration files are named, especially post-squash.\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"makemigrations\")\n   search_method(\"MakemigrationsCommand\")\n   ```\n\n- **Look into how the numbering is decided for new migrations:** This would involve understanding how the existing migrations are accounted for when generating a new file name.\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"MigrationLoader\")\n   search_method(\"DetermineNextMigrationNumber\")\n   ```\n\n- **Understand the treatment of squashed migrations:** Given that squashed migrations are central to the issue, understanding how they're treated in the context of generating new migrations is crucial.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"squashed\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls are chosen to pinpoint the mechanisms by which Django's `makemigrations` command assesses existing migration files, decides on the numbering of new migration files, and how it handles squashed and non-squashed migrations. This pinpointed information will be crucial in crafting a resolution for the described issue."
