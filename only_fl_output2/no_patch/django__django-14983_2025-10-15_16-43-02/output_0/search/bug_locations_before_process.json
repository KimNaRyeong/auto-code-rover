        "intended_behavior": "The methods in MigrationAutodetector related to naming or numbering migrations should be adjusted to properly consider squashed migrations when determining the next migration number. Specifically, when calculating the next migration number, the logic should be enhanced to: Identify the highest existing migration number across both standard and squashed migration files within a particular Django app. Increment this number to define the next migration file's name, ensuring no collisions occur with existing migrations, including both squashed and non-squashed ones. Preserve functionality where, if only squashed migrations are present (with no subsequent migrations), new migrations correctly follow this numbering scheme."

        "intended_behavior": "Assuming MigrationLoader (or its equivalent in handling the loading of migration files) is confirmed as located in this file, its logic for recognizing and sorting migration files must account for squashed migrations accurately. This involves an adjustment to: Properly enumerate all types of migration files (standard, squashed, etc.) and use this enumeration to inform the migration numbering process. Ensure the presence of squashed migrations does not erroneously influence the numbering of newly created migrations, allowing the numbering to continue sequentially from the highest existing number."
