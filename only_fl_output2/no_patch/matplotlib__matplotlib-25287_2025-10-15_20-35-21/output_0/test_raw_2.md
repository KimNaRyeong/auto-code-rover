Given the revised instructions to ensure the script can effectively reproduce the issue and handle it as specified, we'll craft a Python file named `reproducer.py`. This version will properly execute the intended functionality to reproduce the described bug, register whether it has been effectively fixed, and utilize the supplied function to print stack traces for errors and assertion failures.

```python
# reproducer.py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_offset_text_color():
    plt.rcParams.update({'ytick.labelcolor': 'red'})
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot([1.01e9, 1.02e9, 1.03e9])

    # Drawing the figure to ensure everything is rendered
    fig.canvas.draw()

    # Extract the color of the offsetText to check if it matches with ytick.labelcolor
    offset_text_color = ax.yaxis.get_offset_text().get_color()
    expected_color = plt.rcParams['ytick.labelcolor']

    # This assertion checks if the issue is present. If the offset text color does not match
    # the ytick.labelcolor, it means the bug is present, hence raising an AssertionError.
    assert offset_text_color == expected_color, f"Offset text is '{offset_text_color}', expected '{expected_color}'"

def main():
    try:
        check_offset_text_color()
    except AssertionError as err:
        print_stacktrace(err)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with an error code indicating the issue is present
    except Exception as err:
        print_stacktrace(err)
        sys.exit(1)  # Handle any other unexpected exceptions

    print("The issue is not present or has been fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 when the issue is not present

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Explanation of Adjustments:
- The function `check_offset_text_color` specifically tests for the described bug by comparing the color of the offset text against the expected `ytick.labelcolor` set in `rcParams`.
- The main block executes this function within a try-except block, effectively catching assertion errors that signal the issue's presence.
- When an `AssertionError` is caught, it signifies the bug is indeed present, and the provided `print_stacktrace` function illustrates where in the script the discrepancy was detected.
- If the assertion passes without issues, it signifies that the bug is either not present or has been fixed, leading to a normal script exit with code 0.
- The script now also gracefully handles unexpected exceptions, offering a complete traceback for any unforeseen errors encountered during execution.
