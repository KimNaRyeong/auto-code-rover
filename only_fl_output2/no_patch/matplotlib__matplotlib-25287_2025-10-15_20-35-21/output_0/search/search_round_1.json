It will be colored based on xtick.color / ytick.color.\n### Code for reproduction\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.rcParams.update({'ytick.labelcolor': 'red'})\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)\nax.plot([1.01e9,1.02e9,1.03e9])\n```\n### Actual outcome\n![wrong_color](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50588526/217083612-dddf85ba-ebfa-4bf0-8ae0-3dce36c17198.png)\n### Expected outcome\n![correct_color](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50588526/217083512-34b3b32f-5d3a-4242-8742-2269bb09c20c.png)\n### Additional information\nThe following patch seems to fix it for my simple usecases:\n```\ndiff --git a/axis.py b/axis.py\n--- a/axis.py\n+++ b/axis.py\t(date 1675716341305)\n@@ -2203,7 +2203,7 @@\ntransform=mtransforms.blended_transform_factory(\nself.axes.transAxes, mtransforms.IdentityTransform()),\nfontsize=mpl.rcParams['xtick.labelsize'],\n-            color=mpl.rcParams['xtick.color'],\n+            color=mpl.rcParams['xtick.color'] if mpl.rcParams['xtick.labelcolor']=='inherit' else mpl.rcParams['xtick.labelcolor'],\n)\nself.offset_text_position = 'bottom'\n@@ -2456,7 +2456,7 @@\ntransform=mtransforms.blended_transform_factory(\nself.axes.transAxes, mtransforms.IdentityTransform()),\nfontsize=mpl.rcParams['ytick.labelsize'],\n-            color=mpl.rcParams['ytick.color'],\n+            color=mpl.rcParams['ytick.color'] if mpl.rcParams['ytick.labelcolor']=='inherit' else mpl.rcParams['ytick.labelcolor'],\n)\nself.offset_text_position = 'left'\n```\n### Operating system\n_No response_\n### Matplotlib Version\n3.6.3\n### Matplotlib Backend\n_No response_\n### Python version\n_No response_\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\nNone\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search API results provides key insights into the area of the codebase relevant to the bug report:\n\n### 1. Analysis of the `lib/matplotlib/axis.py` File\n\n#### XAxis Initialization Code Context\nIn the `XAxis` class's `_init` method, an `offsetText` is initialized with its color property set directly from `mpl.rcParams['xtick.color']`. This snippet is crucial because it directly controls the color of the X-axis tick labels, including the exponent part which is not behaving as expected per the bug report.\n\n#### YAxis Initialization Code Context\nSimilarly, within the `YAxis` class's `_init` method, the `offsetText` is initialized with the color also being directly set from `mpl.rcParams['ytick.color']`, affecting the Y-axis tick labels in the same manner as the X-axis.\n\n### 2. Relationship with the Bug\n\nThe bug report mentions that the exponent label's color does not change according to `ytick.labelcolor` / `xtick.labelcolor` rcParams settings but instead uses the `ytick.color` / `xtick.color` settings. Given the search results, it's clear why this issue occurs: the code explicitly uses the tick color (`xtick.color` or `ytick.color`) for the `offsetText` without checking if a label-specific color (`xtick.labelcolor` or `ytick.labelcolor`) has been specified. Therefore, any modification in `labelcolor` does not impact the `offsetText` as it should.\n\n### 3. Intended Behavior and Necessary Modifications\n\nIdeally, the `offsetText` color should also respect the `.labelcolor` preference set via `rcParams`. If a specific color is set for `labelcolor`, that color should be used for the exponent label to ensure consistency in labeling across the axis. The patch suggested in the issue report aims to introduce this behavior by adding a conditional check: use `labelcolor` if it's different from 'inherit'; otherwise, default to `color`.\n\nGiven this analysis, the intended patch makes sense and appears to address the issue directly by adjusting the `_init` methods of both `XAxis` and `YAxis` classes to conditionally use `labelcolor` for the `offsetText` color. This fix would align the exponent label color with the user-specified label colors, leading to a consistent and expected visualization outcome."

Otherwise, it should fall back to using `mpl.rcParams['xtick.color']`.

If `ytick.labelcolor` is not specified or set to 'inherit', then it should default to `mpl.rcParams['ytick.color']`. This modification ensures that the exponent label color aligns with the user's color preference for axis tick labels, improving the consistency between the exponent label and the tick labels.\n\nThese modifications aim to preserve the existing functionality of axis label rendering while ensuring that the color of the exponent labels can be controlled separately through `rcParams`, addressing the reported inconsistency."
