I can convert the array to a larger precision but when working with a larger dataset the memory saved by using float16 on smaller numbers kind of matter. The error is mostly on numpy. Adding the dtype on the mean/std calculation does it but I'm not sure if that how people here would like to do it.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nsample = np.full([10_000_000, 1], 10.0, dtype=np.float16)\nStandardScaler().fit_transform(sample)\n```\n#### Expected Results\nThe normalized array\n#### Actual Results\n```\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/_methods.py:36: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in reduce\nreturn umr_sum(a, axis, dtype, out, keepdims, initial)\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/fromnumeric.py:86: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in reduce\nreturn ufunc.reduce(obj, axis, dtype, out, **passkwargs)\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/_methods.py:36: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in reduce\nreturn umr_sum(a, axis, dtype, out, keepdims, initial)\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/preprocessing/data.py:765: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in true_divide\nX /= self.scale_\narray([[nan],\n[nan],\n[nan],\n...,\n[nan],\n[nan],\n[nan]], dtype=float16)\n```\n#### Versions\n```\nSystem:\npython: 3.6.6 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Oct  9 2018, 12:34:16)  [GCC 7.3.0]\nexecutable: /opt/conda/bin/python\nmachine: Linux-4.9.0-5-amd64-x86_64-with-debian-9.4\nBLAS:\nmacros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\nlib_dirs: /opt/conda/lib\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\nPython deps:\npip: 18.1\nsetuptools: 39.1.0\nsklearn: 0.20.2\nnumpy: 1.16.0\nscipy: 1.1.0\nCython: 0.29.2\npandas: 0.23.4\n```\n</issue>"

Look for the `StandardScaler` class to understand how it is implemented and to identify potential places for modifications to support `float16` calculations without overflow.\n2. Look for the `fit` method within the `StandardScaler` class to get a direct insight into the implementation details, particularly how mean and std are computed.\n3. Since the issue mentions that the problem lies mostly with numpy and mentions mean/std calculation, it would also be beneficial to look for code snippets where numpy's mean and std are directly called, as these are likely spots needing adjustments regarding dtype.\n\nAPI calls to execute:\n- search_class(\"StandardScaler\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"StandardScaler\")\n- search_code(\"np.mean\")\n- search_code(\"np.std\")"
