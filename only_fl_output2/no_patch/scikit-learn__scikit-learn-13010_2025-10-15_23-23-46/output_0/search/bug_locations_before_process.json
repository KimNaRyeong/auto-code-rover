        "intended_behavior": "The `fit` method should include a mechanism to handle `float16` array inputs more gracefully to prevent overflow when calculating mean and standard deviation. One approach could involve temporarily upcasting inputs to `float32` (or another suitable precision level) during these calculations and then downcasting, if necessary, after computations are complete. This change should preserve all existing functionality, including handling of types other than `float16`. It's essential that this temporary type adjustment is transparent to the user, ensuring that the output of `fit` (and subsequent `transform` or `inverse_transform` calls) remains consistent with the current behavior for all other input data types."

        "method": "partial_fit",
        "intended_behavior": "Similar to the `fit` method, `partial_fit` should also be adjusted to account for `float16` overflow issues by implementing a temporary upcasting strategy for the input data during mean and std computations. This modification ensures that `partial_fit`, which directly computes these statistics, does not cause overflow when dealing with `float16` data. The strategy for handling the data type should be consistent with the proposed changes in the `fit` method, ensuring a unified approach across both methods."
