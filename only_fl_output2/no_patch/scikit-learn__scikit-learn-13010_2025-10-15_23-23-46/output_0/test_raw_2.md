Given the revised requirements and the issue surrounding the `StandardScaler` with `float16` data leading to overflows, here's an updated approach for a standalone Python script (`reproducer.py`). This script asserts if the issue is present and provides detailed error output using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. It accommodates the test setup as specified, ensuring a clear demarcation of failure or success depending upon the presence or resolution of the reported bug.

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def fit_standard_scaler():
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    sample = np.full([10_000_000, 1], 10.0, dtype=np.float16)
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    try:
        transformed_data = scaler.fit_transform(sample)
        # Assert if the result contains NaN values, indicating overflow.
        assert not np.isnan(transformed_data).any(), "Overflow resulted in NaN values."
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue encountered during fit_transform.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        fit_standard_scaler()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero code to indicate failure
    print("No issues detected, exiting with code 0.")
    exit(0)
```

This script includes:
- A `print_stacktrace` function as provided for detailed error output.
- A `fit_standard_scaler` function that performs the core action which is suspected to trigger the issue: fitting a `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn on a large `float16` numpy array. It includes an assertion to explicitly check for NaNs in the output, which are indicative of the overflow issue.
- A main execution block that runs `fit_standard_scaler` and handles any `AssertionError` by printing it and exiting with code 1 to signal test failure due to the presence of the issue.

This script offers an automate-able way to detect the presence of the mentioned bug and conforms to the specified behavior for signaling success (exit code 0) or failure (exit code 1 with detailed error output).
