        "content": "To address the issue adequately, we need to gather information on the essential components mentioned in the issue description. Specifically, we should focus on the `PyLinter` class to understand how it currently categorizes checkers and reporters, explore any existing interfaces that checkers and reporters implement to get a sense of what changing these interfaces to use `ABCMeta` would entail, and identify the use of `__implements__` for context on what needs to be retained for backward compatibility.\n\nGiven this, I would start with the following API calls:\n\n1. **search_class(\"PyLinter\")**: To locate the `PyLinter` class within the codebase and understand its current implementation, especially how it categorizes checkers and reporters.\n\n2. **search_code(\"__implements__\")**: To find instances where the `__implements__` class attribute is being used, which will help in understanding its current usage across checkers and reporters.\n\n3. **search_code(\"ABCMeta\")**: Although this might not return many (or any) results if `ABCMeta` is not yet widely used in the project, it's valuable to check if there are already any abstract base classes defined that could serve as a precedent or template for implementing the proposed changes.\n\nThese searches will help gather the necessary context to begin addressing the issue."
