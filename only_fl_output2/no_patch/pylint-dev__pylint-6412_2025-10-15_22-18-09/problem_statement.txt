Support isinstance checks through ABCMeta for checkers and reporters
Currently the PyLinter categorizes checkers through the `__implements__` class attribute. This is not very standard, and is one more barrier for others to write plugins.

I propose

* Changing the interfaces to have a `ABCMeta` metaclass
* Change PyLinter to do isinstance checks to categorize checkers/reporters in addition to keeping the old `__implements__` checks
