        "intended_behavior": "The method should be enhanced to support string dependent variables (DVs) effectively in multioutput scenarios. This can be achieved through internal label encoding that transparently converts string labels to numeric identifiers for the prediction process and then maps these identifiers back to the original string labels for the output. The solution should ensure that this process: \n- Does not affect the existing functionality for numeric labels.\n- Is applied only when the output labels are non-numeric (i.e., strings).\n- Handles both single-output and multi-output cases correctly, ensuring that string labels in multi-output scenarios are correctly preserved in the predictions returned by the method."
