It seems there was confusion regarding the output shared in your request. The output error mentioned is related to a module import issue (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sklearn.__check_build._check_build'`) caused during sklearn setup and not directly connected to the issue described concerning multioutput ensemble models with non-numeric dependent variables.

To address the issue you're facing with `predict` failing for multioutput ensemble models with non-numeric DVs (Dependent Variables), we will craft a new standalone Python script aiming to showcase this specific behavior without incorporating earlier setup errors. This script should be executed in an environment where sklearn is correctly installed and setup. Here is a revised attempt:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from numpy.testing import assert_array_equal
import traceback
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def check_multioutput_string():
    X_train = np.array([[-2, -1], [-1, -1], [-1, -2], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1], [-2, 1], [-1, 1], [-1, 2], [2, -1], [1, -1], [1, -2]])
    y_train = np.array([["red", "blue"], ["red", "blue"], ["red", "blue"], ["green", "green"], ["green", "green"], ["green", "green"], ["red", "purple"], ["red", "purple"], ["red", "purple"], ["green", "yellow"], ["green", "yellow"], ["green", "yellow"]])
    
    X_test = np.array([[-1, -1], [1, 1], [-1, 1], [1, -1]])
    y_test = np.array([["red", "blue"], ["green", "green"], ["red", "purple"], ["green", "yellow"]])
    
    try:
        # For simplicity, we're using RandomForestClassifier which is suitable for handling categorical outputs through integer/label encoding.
        # However, the original issue arises from the direct use of strings as DVs without such encoding.
        model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0)
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

        # If successful, the assertion below should not trigger the exception printing
        assert_array_equal(y_pred, y_test)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Exit with non-zero code to indicate failure
        sys.exit(1)

    print("Test passed successfully, no issue found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_multioutput_string()
```

This script aims to replicate the described issue by employing a multi-output classification scenario with `RandomForestClassifier`, which operates on the premise that DVs are handled as numeric labels internally. Given the initial description, the problem stems from categorical (string) outputs not being managed appropriately. It's worth noting that the current script may not directly trigger the `ValueError: could not convert string to float:` exception because it employs a classifier designed to handle categorical labels implicitly through encoding, differing from direct string-to-float conversion scenarios.
