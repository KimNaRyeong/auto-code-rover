        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, let's examine each piece of information:\n\n### 1. `MemcachedCache` class\nThe `MemcachedCache` class is defined in `django/core/cache/backends/memcached.py` and includes methods such as `__init__`, `get`, and `delete`. This is the direct target for deprecation based on the issue description since it leverages `python-memcached`, which is no longer maintained.\n\n#### Analysis:\n- **Purpose**: This class provides an implementation for Django's caching framework that interfaces with Memcached using the `python-memcached` library.\n- **Relation to the Issue**: It is the exact class mentioned in the issue to be deprecated in favor of a `pymemcache`-based backend.\n- **Intended Behavior Post-Issue Resolution**: Post-deprecation, this class either should not be used or should warn users of its deprecation when it is utilized, directing them towards the newer pymemcache-based backend.\n\n### 2. References to `pymemcache`\nThe search for `pymemcache` yielded 4 matches in the same file as `MemcachedCache`, suggesting that the alternative implementation using `pymemcache` might already exist within this file or related configuration options are present here.\n\n#### Analysis:\n- **Purpose**: Indicative of either the presence of the recommended alternative backend within the same module or code intimating towards the transition or configuration for the `pymemcache` usage.\n- **Relation to the Issue**: This confirms part of the transition solution by providing the alternative that users are encouraged to adopt.\n- **Intended Behavior Post-Issue Resolution**: Ensures users have a clear, maintained path for using Memcached in Django.\n\n### 3. Usage of `DeprecationWarning`\nThe findings highlight two types of warnings, `RemovedInDjango40Warning` and `RemovedInDjango41Warning`, which are subclasses of `DeprecationWarning` and `PendingDeprecationWarning`, respectively, located in `django/utils/deprecation.py`.\n\n#### Analysis:\n- **Purpose**: These are specialized warning classes used within Django to denote features that are slated for removal in future versions. They are tailored to the versioning timeline of Django.\n- **Relation to the Issue**: Given the issue's intention to deprecate `MemcachedCache` by Django 3.2 and remove it by Django 4.1, utilization of these warnings are integral for informing developers of the deprecation timeline.\n- **Intended Behavior Post-Issue Resolution**: Warnings should be implemented in a way that informs users of the impending deprecation in Django 3.2 and the subsequent removal in Django 4.1, aligning with the described issue goals.\n\nTo proceed effectively, it\u2019s clear that additional context around how `pymemcache` is integrated within `django/core/cache/backends/memcached.py` is necessary, especially to differentiate between the deprecated and recommended cache backend implementations. Moreover, a look into the implementation of deprecation warnings within the `MemcachedCache` class or its initialization could clarify how to proceed with marking it as deprecated. Given the analysis, further API calls should aim at:\n\n- Exploring how `pymemcache` is integrated or referenced within `memcached.py` to understand the structure and recommendations provided to users.\n- Identifying existing usages of deprecation warnings within the Django codebase possibly within the cache backend to model the new deprecation warning after.\n"

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

However, the action involves modifying or adding to the class to signal its deprecation.\n   \n   - **Intended Behavior:** The intended behavior here is to introduce a deprecation warning within the initialization of the `MemcachedCache` class. This warning should inform users that `MemcachedCache` is deprecated as of Django 3.2 and will be removed in Django 4.1. The message should also guide users towards adopting the `pymemcache`-based backend as the alternative. Existing functionality of the `MemcachedCache` class should remain intact to ensure backward compatibility until its removal.\n\nThe modification should aim at safely alerting users about the deprecated status when the class is instantiated (possibly in the `__init__` method) without breaking or altering the expected caching behavior. This will help in a smooth transition to the recommended `pymemcache` backend."
