This warning should inform users that `MemcachedCache` is deprecated as of Django 3.2 and will be removed in Django 4.1. The message should also guide users towards adopting the `pymemcache`-based backend as the alternative. Existing functionality of the `MemcachedCache` class should remain intact to ensure backward compatibility until its removal."
