Moreover we added a cache backend for pymemcache (#29887) so we have a good builtin alternative.\nI think it's time to deprecate the django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache backend in Django 3.2 and remove it in Django 4.1.\n</issue>"

This includes finding where `MemcachedCache` is defined, any documentation related to its deprecation policy, and understanding how `pymemcache` has been integrated as its alternative.\n\n1. Search for the `MemcachedCache` class to understand its implementation and where it's used:\n   - `search_class(\"MemcachedCache\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that `pymemcache` has been introduced as a replacement:\n   - `search_code(\"pymemcache\")`\n   \n3. It's also important to understand how the deprecation warning is typically implemented in Django:\n   - `search_code(\"DeprecationWarning\")`\n\nThese calls will help gather the necessary information on where and how to effectively mark `MemcachedCache` as deprecated, ensuring that relevant deprecation warnings are added, and confirming the availability and use of `pymemcache` as an alternative."
