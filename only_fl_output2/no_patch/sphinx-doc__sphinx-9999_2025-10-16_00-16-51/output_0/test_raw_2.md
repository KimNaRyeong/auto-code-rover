To create a standalone Python file (`reproducer.py`) that aims to reproduce the issue detailed above—where LaTeX output does not correctly separate terms by a new line in a specific context—we will simulate a Sphinx documentation project environment. This script will programmatically generate a minimal Sphinx project with a single `.rst` document containing the provided reStructuredText snippet. Then, it will invoke the Sphinx build process to generate LaTeX output and inspect the resulting LaTeX file for the issue.

This example assumes you have Sphinx installed in your environment. If Sphinx is not installed, you will encounter an error stating that the `sphinx-build` command was not found.

    for frame in tb:

        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

This script implements the following steps:
1. Sets up a temporary directory to work as the Sphinx project root.
2. Creates a minimal `conf.py` and an `index.rst` with the provided content.
3. Runs `sphinx-build` to generate LaTeX output in another temporary directory.
4. Tries to locate the generated `.tex` file to confirm it was generated.

In a real scenario, after confirming the `.tex` file is generated, you would add logic to inspect the contents of this LaTeX file to verify if the newline issue with terms is present or not. This could involve reading the file contents into Python and using string matching or regular expressions to check how terms are separated.

Note: The actual parsing and validation of the LaTeX file content to look specifically for the newline separation issue as described requires detailed knowledge of the expected LaTeX markup for correct vs. incorrect output, which is not provided here. Adjust the placeholder message "LaTeX file generated, inspecting for issues..." with your specific validation logic.
