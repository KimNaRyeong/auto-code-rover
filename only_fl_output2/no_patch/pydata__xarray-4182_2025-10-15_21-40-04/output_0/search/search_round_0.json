        "content": "To address the issue effectively, it's essential to understand the context around the HTML representation (repr) mechanism for DataArray and Variable objects in the xarray library. Based on the issue description, we should look for the classes and methods responsible for generating the HTML repr for these objects. Specifically, we'd want to explore how the current representation is structured and how the expansion of data and attributes sections is managed. We'll start by looking for the relevant classes and methods that might be involved in rendering the HTML representation.\n\nFirst, let's search for the classes that relate to `DataArray` and `Variable` to understand their structure and how they might be handling their HTML representation.\n\n- `search_class(\"DataArray\")`\n- `search_class(\"Variable\")` \n\nNext, we want to find where the HTML representation is being generated or modified for these classes. This likely involves methods that are specifically used for generating HTML, possibly something along the lines of `_repr_html_` which is a special method used in IPython environments to display HTML representations of objects.\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_repr_html_\", \"DataArray\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_repr_html_\", \"Variable\")`\n\nLastly, since the issue also mentions a \"really nice repr for nested dask arrays,\" it suggests there might be some specific handling or customization for dask arrays within the HTML repr logic. Thus, it would be useful to search for mentions of dask within the code related to HTML representation.\n\n- `search_code(\"dask array repr\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a solid foundation for understanding how the HTML representation is currently generated and where modifications could be made to expand the data and attributes sections by default."
