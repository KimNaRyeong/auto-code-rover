Particularly, we're interested in how `relplot` handles `set_titles` and how the axes are managed, especially with respect to tick label formatting and the `facet_kws` argument. Here are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. Search for the class or function definition of `relplot`, as it's a high-level API function in seaborn.\n   - `search_method(\"relplot\")`\n\n2. Find the method that handles setting titles in the plotting objects, which appears to be a part of `FacetGrid` or similar classes based on the pattern of seaborn's design.\n   - `search_method(\"set_titles\")`\n\n3. Investigate methods related to formatting axis tick labels, since the method `ticklabel_format` is applied in the given code snippet. This will help understand how seaborn applies these formats and if something changed with the new version.\n   - `search_code(\"ticklabel_format\")`\n\nBy focusing on these areas, we can gather enough context to understand the cause of the issue and how to potentially resolve it."
