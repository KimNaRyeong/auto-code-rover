        "intended_behavior": "The `set_titles` method should include enhanced logic for handling long titles in a way that prevents them from overlapping with the axis labels or other subplot titles. This enhancement might involve automatically adjusting the font size, incorporating text wrapping, or dynamically adjusting subplot margins based on title length. The behavior should ensure that when setting titles (especially in scenarios where `col_wrap` leads to tightly packed subplots), the method checks for potential overlaps with axis labels and adjusts accordingly. All these adjustments must preserve the general aesthetics and spacing of the plot, without negatively impacting the readability of titles and labels."

        "method": "relplot",
        "intended_behavior": "Given that `relplot` is the entry point that manages the creation of relational plots using a `FacetGrid`, any adjustments to how subplot dimensions are determined or how label formats are applied (especially for scientific notation which can increase label size) might need a review. While there were no direct findings related to `ticklabel_format`, ensuring that `relplot` (in coordination with `FacetGrid` settings, including `facet_kws` that affect sharing of axes) properly accounts for the potential for label overlap in its layout calculations would be ideal. This might involve providing smarter defaults or additional parameters that control spacing or label orientations more effectively when creating the plot. The behavior should maintain the flexibility and configurability of `relplot` while improving the default handling of complex labeling scenarios to prevent overlap."
