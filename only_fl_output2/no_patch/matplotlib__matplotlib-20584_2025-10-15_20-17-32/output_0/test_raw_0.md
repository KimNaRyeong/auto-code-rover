This script is designed to check if the manipulation of segments via `get_segments` and `set_segments` alters them in any way, as this was not expected behavior according to the reported issue. If the segments are modified by this procedure, it will `raise AssertionError` and print the stack trace. The script will exit with code 0 if no issue is detected, meaning the segments remain unchanged after get-set operations, which would be the expected outcome for fixing the reported issue.
