        "intended_behavior": "Within the `get_group_by` method, the intended behavior is to exempt expressions related to the `Random` function from influencing the GROUP BY clause construction. This modification should allow the method to handle random ordering (`order_by('?')`) without breaking the logic of queryset aggregation. The method should continue to assemble GROUP BY clauses based on fields involved in aggregate functions and specified in the `order_by` clauses, except when the ordering is random. This preserves the existing functionality for grouping and ordering while fixing the undesired behavior when ordering randomly. The patch described in the issue submission suggests a feasible approach, ensuring that instances of the `Random` class (identified via `not isinstance(exp, Random)`) are not included in the expressions that extend the GROUP BY clause. This approach should maintain all other aspects of grouping logic, ensuring compatibility with different types of queries, including those involving annotations, aggregations, and specific field orderings."
