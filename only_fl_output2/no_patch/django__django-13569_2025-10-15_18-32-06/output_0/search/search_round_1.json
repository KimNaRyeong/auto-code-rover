The aggregation with Count produces a GROUP BY clause on related.id.\n>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('rc').values('id', 'rc')\n<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 2}]>\nThis also works as expected (at least to me). Although there is an aggregation, ordering by related means that the grouping will be broken down.\n>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('related').values('id', 'rc')\n<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 1}, {'id': 1, 'rc': 1}]>\nBut the following seems wrong to me.\n>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc')\n<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 1}, {'id': 1, 'rc': 1}]>\nThe random function call has nothing to do with the aggregation, and I see no reason it should break it. Dumping the query seems that indeed the random call breaks the group by call: (I simpilfied the table names a little)\n>>> print(Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc').query)\nSELECT \"thing\".\"id\", COUNT(\"related\".\"id\") AS \"rc\" FROM \"thing\" LEFT OUTER JOIN \"related\" ON (\"thing\".\"id\" = \"related\".\"thing_id\") GROUP BY \"thing\".\"id\", RANDOM() ORDER BY RANDOM() ASC\nI dug into the SQL compiler, and it seems to me the problem is inside django.db.models.sql.compiler.get_group_by, where the compiler combines all non-aggregate, non-ref order_by expressions into group_by. I patched it like this\nfor expr, (sql, params, is_ref) in order_by:\nif expr.contains_aggregate:\ncontinue\nif is_ref:\ncontinue\nexpressions.extend([\nexp for exp in expr.get_source_expressions()\nif not isinstance(exp, Random)\n])\nand things seem to work correctly. No failed tests against SQLite3 with default settings.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n### SQLCompiler Class (django/db/models/sql/compiler.py)\n\n1. **Purpose**: The `SQLCompiler` class plays a critical role in building SQL queries in Django's ORM. It compiles Django ORM query expressions into SQL queries that can be executed by the database backend. The `get_group_by` method, specifically, constructs the GROUP BY part of an SQL query.\n\n2. **Relation to the Bug**: The issue description pinpointed a problem with the `order_by('?')` causing an unexpected breaking of queryset aggregation. The given patch suggests modifications within the `get_group_by` method to handle random ordering (`RANDOM()`) without breaking aggregation.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: Ideally, using `order_by('?')` should not alter the logic of grouping in aggregation, meaning it should retain the correct aggregation (GROUP BY behavior) while only affecting the order in which the aggregated results are presented. The intended behavior within `get_group_by` is to construct a GROUP BY clause that accurately reflects the developer's intent as expressed by the queryset API calls, even when random ordering is applied.\n\n### Random Class (django/db/models/functions/math.py)\n\n1. **Purpose**: The `Random` class defines a database function that generates a random order for the rows in the result set. This class ensures the `RANDOM()` SQL function is correctly translated across different database backends.\n\n2. **Relation to the Bug**: This class is directly implicated in the bug since ordering by `Random` (i.e., `order_by('?')`) is what triggers the unexpected behavior in aggregation grouping. The class's implementation across different databases doesn't inherently account for how its use in ORDER BY clauses impacts GROUP BY behavior, leading to the issue described.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: The `Random` function should allow for random sorting of query results without impacting the logic of how results are grouped and aggregated. This implies there needs to be a clear separation in how the ORM handles orderings that do not conceptually belong to the aggregation logic itself.\n\n### get_group_by Method Analysis\n\n1. **Intended Behavior Inside `get_group_by`**: The provided patch suggests the method should specifically discriminate against expressions related to the `Random` function when constructing GROUP BY clauses. This implies that while most expressions in `order_by` are included in GROUP BY to maintain SQL correctness, `Random` should be an exception because its purpose is purely for ordering results, not for defining how they are grouped or aggregated.\n\n### Given the issue and the provided patch:\n\n- The patch adds a check to exclude `Random` expressions from influencing the group by clause generation. This approach aims to keep the aggregation logic intact while still allowing for randomness in the result order.\n\n- The `contains_aggregate` and `get_source_expressions` methods play roles in determining whether an expression should be considered part of the aggregation logic or not. From the issue description, it seems the existing logic does not correctly filter out effects of the `Random` function on aggregation.\n\n### Next Steps in Context Collection:\n\nBased on the analysis, the relationship between the `Random` class and `get_group_by` method in the SQLCompiler class is a key focus of the patch. To further refine our understanding and approach to resolving this issue, we might consider:\n- Investigating how `contains_aggregate` and `get_source_expressions` are implemented and used within the `get_group_by` method. This could provide insight into how expressions are evaluated and included in the GROUP BY clause and how the `Random` expression might evade such checks in the current implementation. However, given the direct references in the collected contexts, a deep dive into these methods may not be strictly necessary for creating a patch, but they offer background understanding.\n- Further analysis or patches would also benefit from tests specifically targeting this behavior across different database backends, given that `Random`'s implementation varies by database. This step extends beyond the current scope of context collection but is critical for validating the solution."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

Bug Location 1: File: django/db/models/sql/compiler.py, Class: SQLCompiler, Method: get_group_by.\n   - Intended Behavior: Within the `get_group_by` method, the intended behavior is to exempt expressions related to the `Random` function from influencing the GROUP BY clause construction. This modification should allow the method to handle random ordering (`order_by('?')`) without breaking the logic of queryset aggregation. The method should continue to assemble GROUP BY clauses based on fields involved in aggregate functions and specified in the `order_by` clauses, except when the ordering is random. This preserves the existing functionality for grouping and ordering while fixing the undesired behavior when ordering randomly. The patch described in the issue submission suggests a feasible approach, ensuring that instances of the `Random` class (identified via `not isinstance(exp, Random)`) are not included in the expressions that extend the GROUP BY clause. This approach should maintain all other aspects of grouping logic, ensuring compatibility with different types of queries, including those involving annotations, aggregations, and specific field orderings."
