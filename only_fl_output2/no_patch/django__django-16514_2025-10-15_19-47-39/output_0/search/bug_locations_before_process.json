This will likely involve extending the queryset to check if the `content_type` of each `LogEntry` record matches any of the models registered with the admin site. It's important that this is done in a way that doesn't disrupt the current functionality for non-`LogEntry` models being handled by admin views, implying that the filtering should be conditionally applied only when dealing with `LogEntry` instances."
