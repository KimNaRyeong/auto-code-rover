It is confusing for users to access a specific site and see log entries for models they can't access.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue of filtering `LogEntry` by registered models in admin sites, we need to find the relevant classes and methods that handle the logging and display of `LogEntry` in Django's admin. Given the description of the issue, I believe we need to look at:\n\n1. **The `LogEntry` model:** This model logs additions, changes, and deletions of objects via the Django admin. Understanding its structure and relationships can help us figure out how to filter these entries based on the admin site.\n2. **The admin site registration process:** This process involves classes and methods that manage the registration of models to admin sites. We need to understand how models are associated with specific admin sites.\n3. **The mechanism by which `LogEntry` is displayed in admin sites:** Specifically, we want to identify where in the Django admin codebase the `LogEntry` objects are fetched and displayed, so we can modify that process to filter by registered models.\n\nBased on these requirements, here are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"LogEntry\")`: This will help us find the definition of the `LogEntry` model.\n2. `search_method(\"register\")`: Registration of models to admin sites is likely handled by a method named like this. Understanding its parameters and usage can provide insights into how models are linked to specific admin sites.\n3. `search_class(\"AdminSite\")`: Since we're interested in how `LogEntry`s are associated with `AdminSite` instances, looking directly at the `AdminSite` class may reveal methods or properties related to this issue.\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"get_queryset\", \"ModelAdmin\")`: Considering `LogEntry` entries are displayed in some kind of list or change list view in the admin, the `get_queryset` method of `ModelAdmin` or a related class might be overridden or extended to filter `LogEntry` objects based on the admin site they are associated with.\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point to understand the code structure and logic surrounding this issue."
