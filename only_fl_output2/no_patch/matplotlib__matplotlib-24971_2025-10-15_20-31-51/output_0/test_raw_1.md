Given the guidelines and requirements specified, let's write a corrected `reproducer.py` that fully adheres to the instructions provided. This script will attempt to replicate the issue of the compressed layout setting being forgotten on the second save, and raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is encountered, along with printing a detailed stack trace. This approach assumes that the presence of the issue is indicated by an observable difference in output between the two saved images which should not occur if the compressed layout setting is consistently applied.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_images_similarity(img_path_1, img_path_2):
    from skimage.metrics import structural_similarity as ssim
    import matplotlib.image as mpimg

    img1 = mpimg.imread(img_path_1)
    img2 = mpimg.imread(img_path_2)

    # Convert to grayscale to simplify the SSIM computation
    if img1.shape[-1] == 4:  # For PNG images with transparency channel
        img1 = img1[..., :3]
    if img2.shape[-1] == 4:
        img2 = img2[..., :3]

    img1_gray = np.dot(img1[..., :3], [0.2989, 0.5870, 0.1140])
    img2_gray = np.dot(img2[..., :3], [0.2989, 0.5870, 0.1140])

    sim, diff = ssim(img1_gray, img2_gray, full=True)
    return sim, diff

def main():
    matplotlib.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use'] = True

    arr = np.arange(100).reshape((10, 10))
    fig, ax_dict = plt.subplot_mosaic('AB;AC', figsize=(6, 9), width_ratios=[3, 2],
                                      layout='compressed')

    for key in ["B", "C"]:
        ax_dict[key].imshow(arr)
    
    fig.savefig("test1.png", bbox_inches="tight")
    fig.savefig("test2.png", bbox_inches="tight")

    similarity, _ = check_images_similarity("test1.png", "test2.png")

    if similarity < 1.0:
        raise AssertionError(f"The saved images are not identical. Similarity: {similarity}")

    # Cleanup created images after successful test
    os.remove("test1.png")
    os.remove("test2.png")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    print("Issue not present, exited with code 0.")
    exit(0)
```

This script integrates image comparison using the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), a method to measure the similarity between two images. Please note, for the SSIM comparison to work, the `scikit-image` package needs to be installed in your environment. You can install `scikit-image` using pip (`pip install scikit-image`) or conda (`conda install scikit-image`), depending on your Python setup. This approach was chosen for its ability to quantitatively assess the equality of the saved figures, which is crucial for detecting if the layout setting is not being correctly applied on subsequent saves.
