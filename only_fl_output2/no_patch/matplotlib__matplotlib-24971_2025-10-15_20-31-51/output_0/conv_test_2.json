Under some specific circumstances (see below) compressed layout is not applied the second time a figure is saved.\r\n\r\n### Code for reproduction\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport matplotlib\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\narr = np.arange(100).reshape((10, 10))\r\n\r\nmatplotlib.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use'] = True\r\n\r\nfig, ax_dict = plt.subplot_mosaic('AB;AC', figsize=(6, 9), width_ratios=[3, 2],\r\n                                  layout='compressed')\r\n\r\nfor key in [\"B\", \"C\"]:\r\n    ax_dict[key].imshow(arr)\r\n    \r\nfig.savefig(\"test1.png\", bbox_inches=\"tight\")\r\nfig.savefig(\"test2.png\", bbox_inches=\"tight\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual outcome\r\n\r\ntest1.png\r\n![test1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10599679/212073531-4841d847-29a5-45a4-aaa1-1d3b81277ddc.png)\r\n\r\ntest2.png\r\n![test2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10599679/212073574-f6286243-690d-4199-b6f4-4033e5d14635.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected outcome\r\n\r\nBoth images should look like the first.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nIf I do not set the `rcParams`, all is well.  If I do not set `bbox_inches=\"tight\"` in my calls to `savefig`, the images are identical (but I have too much white space top and bottom).  Maybe there is a better option than `bbox_inches=\"tight\"` when using compressed layout?\r\n\r\nFor context, my real example is a script that makes several figures.  For most of them I want constrained layout, so I set that once in the `rcParams` for convenience.  Only one figure needs \"compressed\", and I am saving twice because I want both a png and a pdf.  Fixed it in my current example by just reverting the `rcParams` setting for the one figure.\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nRHEL7\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Version\r\n\r\n3.6.2 and main\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Backend\r\n\r\nQtAgg\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\n3.9 and 3.11\r\n\r\n### Jupyter version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nconda\n"

Please note, for the SSIM comparison to work, the `scikit-image` package needs to be installed in your environment. You can install `scikit-image` using pip (`pip install scikit-image`) or conda (`conda install scikit-image`), depending on your Python setup. This approach was chosen for its ability to quantitatively assess the equality of the saved figures, which is crucial for detecting if the layout setting is not being correctly applied on subsequent saves."
