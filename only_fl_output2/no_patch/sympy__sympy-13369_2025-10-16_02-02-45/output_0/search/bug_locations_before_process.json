        "intended_behavior": "The `roots` method should be capable of handling symbolic polynomials more robustly, especially those that are derivatives of characteristic polynomials from symbolic matrices. The method should ensure comprehensive simplification and rationalization processes to manage symbolic expressions adequately. When encountering symbolic polynomials that are challenging to solve directly, `roots` should employ alternate strategies (such as numerical approximations or heuristic algorithms) that can provide solutions where feasible. Additionally, it should offer clear error messages or warnings when absolute resolution is mathematically impossible or beyond current algorithmic support, guiding users towards manual solutions or numerical approximations where appropriate. This fix would maintain `roots` capability for numerical and simpler symbolic cases, while extending its applicability to more complex symbolic matrices."
