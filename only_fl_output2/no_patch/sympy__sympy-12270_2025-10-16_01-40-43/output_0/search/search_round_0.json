        "content": "To get more context and ideally locate the code that needs to be patched, we'll need to focus on a few key areas mentioned in the issue description:\n\n1. **Exploration of `core/expr.py`**: The issue points towards a behavior in `core/expr.py`, possibly within an implementation related to expressions, specifically how multiplication is handled or how the `.primitive()` method works. \n\n2. **Investigation of the `Mul` class**: Since the issue involves the treatment of expressions with `Mul` (which is likely a class responsible for multiplication operations), we should look into this class for insight on how `-2` cannot be multiplicatively extracted when `evaluate=False` is set.\n\n3. **The `.extract_multiplicatively()` method**: Both its implementation and how it interacts with the objects in question are critical. There's a chance this functionality is part of the `Expr` class or similar, given that it operates on mathematical expressions.\n\n4. **The `.primitive()` method's behavior and usage**: Since the issue description shows that `.primitive()` returns something that then doesn't work as expected with `Mul(..., evaluate=False)`, it's clear that an understanding of both `.primitive()` and `Mul` instantiation with `evaluate=False` is necessary.\n\nBased on these areas, the following API calls would be necessary:\n\n- **To explore implementations involved in handling multiplication and extraction**:\n  - `search_class(\"Mul\")`: To find the definition of the `Mul` class and any relevant comments or method definitions.\n  - `search_method(\"extract_multiplicatively\")`: To find where and how the `extract_multiplicatively` method is implemented across the project.\n  - `search_method(\"primitive\")`: To understand how the `primitive` method works, and which class it belongs to, likely providing context on how it's supposed to interact with `Mul`.\n\n- **To examine the specific file and usage mentioned**:\n  - `search_code_in_file(\"Mul(2, -x, evaluate=False).extract_multiplicatively(-2)\", \"core/expr.py\")`: Although this specific line of code is hypothetical in demonstrating the issue, searching it might not yield direct results. Still, it closely represents the problem and might help locate similar usages or the implementation logic leading to the issue.\n\n- **Given the discussion around a commit**:\n  - Although directly accessing a commit or its details might not be possible through the provided APIs, understanding the context around the methods and classes involved will likely bring us closer to the area of the codebase that might have been affected by the mentioned commit.\n\nThis strategy aims to cover both the specific and broader context of the issue, enabling a focused yet comprehensive approach to understanding and eventually resolving the problem."
