It appears that when a negative factor that matches the negative content of an expression is to be extracted, the method fails to return the correct factored expression. The intended behavior would involve checking if the expression can be divided by the given factor c in a way that maintains the integrity and properties of the original expression, even when evaluate=False has led to a non-standard representation of the expression. This can include better handling or normalization of expressions involving negative factors or ensuring that the Mul objects with evaluate=False are correctly interpreted and simplified if possible before attempting to extract multiplicatively."

        "intended_behavior": "Though not directly implicated by a specific method in the bug report, the way Mul objects are created with evaluate=False and their interaction with methods like extract_multiplicatively suggests that there might be an underlying issue in either how Mul objects represent their arguments or in a helper method that extract_multiplicatively relies on (such as primitive or another method called within extract_multiplicatively). An analysis should be conducted on methods within Mul that are involved in the creation and simplification of these expressions to ensure they correctly handle negative values and expressions in non-evaluated form. This might involve ensuring that the primitive method (when called on results of Mul with evaluate=False) returns a form that is correctly interpreted by extract_multiplicatively, or adjusting how these Mul objects represent their arguments in a way that simplifies correctly when division is attempted."
