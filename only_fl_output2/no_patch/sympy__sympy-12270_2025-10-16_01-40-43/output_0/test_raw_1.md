Based on the initial instructions and the subsequent steps to ensure a successful reproduction of the reported issue, below is an updated version of the `reproducer.py` Python script. This version includes the correct validations and the additional use of `print_stacktrace` to clearly report assertion failures that demonstrate the issue. It attempts a reproduction of the problematic behavior with the `extract_multiplicatively` method, as explained earlier.

```python
from sympy import I, Mul, symbols

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_extract_multiplicatively():
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    
    # Test cases for complex numbers
    assert (2+4*I).extract_multiplicatively(2) == 1 + 2*I, "Failure on complex number with positive divisor"
    assert (-2-4*I).extract_multiplicatively(-1) == 2 + 4*I, "Failure on complex number with -1 divisor"
    try:
        result = (-2-4*I).extract_multiplicatively(-2)
        assert result is not None, "Failed to extract (-2) from (-2-4*I)"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    
    # Test cases for algebraic expressions
    assert (2*x + 4*y + 8).extract_multiplicatively(2) == x + 2*y + 4, "Failure on algebraic expression with positive divisor"
    assert (-2*x - 4*y - 8).extract_multiplicatively(2) == -x - 2*y - 4, "Failure on algebraic expression with positive divisor and negative terms"
    assert (-2*x - 4*y - 8).extract_multiplicatively(-1) == 2*x + 4*y + 8, "Failure on algebraic expression with -1 divisor"
    try:
        result = (-2*x - 4*y - 8).extract_multiplicatively(-2)
        assert result is not None, "Failed to extract (-2) from (-2*x - 4*y - 8)"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_extract_multiplicatively()
```

In this script, assertions are made to check the behavior of `extract_multiplicatively`. Specifically, it checks if the function fails to extract `-2` correctly from both a complex number and an algebraic expression, which are expected behaviors based on the documented issue. `AssertionError` is raised with a clear message when the expected outcome does not match the actual result, and `print_stacktrace` is called to show where the error occurred in detail. This script should help in accurately identifying whether the problem persists and assist developers in debugging and resolving the issue effectively.
