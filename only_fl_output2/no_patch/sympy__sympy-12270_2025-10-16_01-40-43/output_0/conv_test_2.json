This version includes the correct validations and the additional use of `print_stacktrace` to clearly report assertion failures that demonstrate the issue. It attempts a reproduction of the problematic behavior with the `extract_multiplicatively` method, as explained earlier.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import I, Mul, symbols\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef check_extract_multiplicatively():\n    x, y = symbols('x y')\n    \n    # Test cases for complex numbers\n    assert (2+4*I).extract_multiplicatively(2) == 1 + 2*I, \"Failure on complex number with positive divisor\"\n    assert (-2-4*I).extract_multiplicatively(-1) == 2 + 4*I, \"Failure on complex number with -1 divisor\"\n    try:\n        result = (-2-4*I).extract_multiplicatively(-2)\n        assert result is not None, \"Failed to extract (-2) from (-2-4*I)\"\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n    \n    # Test cases for algebraic expressions\n    assert (2*x + 4*y + 8).extract_multiplicatively(2) == x + 2*y + 4, \"Failure on algebraic expression with positive divisor\"\n    assert (-2*x - 4*y - 8).extract_multiplicatively(2) == -x - 2*y - 4, \"Failure on algebraic expression with positive divisor and negative terms\"\n    assert (-2*x - 4*y - 8).extract_multiplicatively(-1) == 2*x + 4*y + 8, \"Failure on algebraic expression with -1 divisor\"\n    try:\n        result = (-2*x - 4*y - 8).extract_multiplicatively(-2)\n        assert result is not None, \"Failed to extract (-2) from (-2*x - 4*y - 8)\"\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    check_extract_multiplicatively()\n```\n\nIn this script, assertions are made to check the behavior of `extract_multiplicatively`. Specifically, it checks if the function fails to extract `-2` correctly from both a complex number and an algebraic expression, which are expected behaviors based on the documented issue. `AssertionError` is raised with a clear message when the expected outcome does not match the actual result, and `print_stacktrace` is called to show where the error occurred in detail. This script should help in accurately identifying whether the problem persists and assist developers in debugging and resolving the issue effectively."
