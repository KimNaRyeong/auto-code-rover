Apologies for the confusion in the initial attempt. Given the importance of accurately reproducing the issue described, below is a revised standalone Python script designed to be executed within the context of a Django application. This script focuses on demonstrating the problem with pickling a `QuerySet` that includes a `Subquery` or `Exists` annotation and how it improperly triggers evaluation due to how the QuerySet's state is managed during pickling.

Please ensure you have a Django environment set up with the models `Group` and `Event` already defined within one of your apps. This script assumes the models are accessible and part of a Django application. Adjust the model import paths as necessary according to your project's structure.

```python
import pickle
from django.db import models
from django.conf import settings
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
import os
import django
from django.db.models import Exists, OuterRef

# Define a print_stacktrace function to handle exceptions
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Setup minimal Django settings if needed for the script to run standalone
if not settings.configured:
    settings.configure(
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': 'db.sqlite3',
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=[
            'django.contrib.auth',
            'django.contrib.contenttypes',
            '__main__',  # This script is its own Django app in standalone execution.
        ],
        USE_TZ=True,
    )

django.setup()

# Your existing Group and Event models should be imported here instead
class Group(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Event(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    group = models.ForeignKey(Group, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

# Dynamically create tables for models in this standalone script
execute_from_command_line(['manage.py', 'migrate'])

# Reproducing the described issue
try:
    # Assuming Group and Event models are defined and part of your Django project
    groups = Group.objects.annotate(
        has_event=Exists(Event.objects.filter(group_id=OuterRef('id')))
    )
    with django.db.connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute('SELECT 1')  # Force connection
    initial_query_count = len(django.db.connection.queries)

    # Pickle without evaluation
    pickled_groups_query = pickle.dumps(groups.query)

    final_query_count = len(django.db.connection.queries)
    if initial_query_count != final_query_count:
        raise AssertionError('QuerySet was evaluated during pickle operation.')

    # Test unpickling
    unpickled_query = pickle.loads(pickled_groups_query)

    print("Issue not present or test did not trigger the issue.")

except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(2)

sys.exit(0)
```

**Important Notes:**
- Replace the `Group` and `Event` model definitions with imports from your actual models if you're running this in a real project.
- Ensure this script is run in an environment where Django is fully configured and ready to execute ORM commands.
- This script dynamically sets up Django settings and performs migrations, which is intended for demonstration purposes. Adjust any configurations as necessary to fit the structure of your project.
- The script determines if the issue is present based on whether pickling the queryset leads to unexpected query execution.
