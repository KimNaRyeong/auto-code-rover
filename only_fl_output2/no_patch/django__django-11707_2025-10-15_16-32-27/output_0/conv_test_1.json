So in theory it shouldn't be pickling the QuerySet.\nHowever, the QuerySet is still stored on the instance within the _constructor_args attribute added by the @deconstructible decorator on the BaseExpression base class. So when the inner query object gets pickled, so does the QuerySet, which attempts to evaluate it. In this case, it gets the error \"ValueError: This queryset contains a reference to an outer query and may only be used in a subquery.\" since the inner queryset is being evaluated independently when called from pickle: it calls QuerySet.__getstate__().\nI'm not sure what the best solution is here. I made a patch that adds the following override to __getstate__ to the SubQuery class, which fixes the problem and passes all other Django tests on my machine. I'll submit a PR shortly, but welcome any better approaches since I'm not sure what else that may effect.\nclass Subquery(Expression):\n\t...\n\tdef __getstate__(self):\n\t\tobj_dict = super().__getstate__()\n\t\tobj_dict.pop('_constructor_args', None)\n\t\treturn obj_dict\n"
