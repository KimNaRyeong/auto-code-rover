        "intended_behavior": "Implement a `__getstate__` method within the `Subquery` class. This method's purpose would be to ensure that when a `Subquery` instance gets pickled, the queryset does not get evaluated. This can be achieved by modifying the object's dictionary before pickling, specifically by excluding the `_constructor_args` attribute from the serialized object state, or ensuring it's handled in a way that stops the evaluation of the queryset. This preserves the functionality of the `Subquery` class for its primary use while preventing the undesired side effect encountered during pickling."
