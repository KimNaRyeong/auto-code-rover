So in theory it shouldn't be pickling the QuerySet.\nHowever, the QuerySet is still stored on the instance within the _constructor_args attribute added by the @deconstructible decorator on the BaseExpression base class. So when the inner query object gets pickled, so does the QuerySet, which attempts to evaluate it. In this case, it gets the error \"ValueError: This queryset contains a reference to an outer query and may only be used in a subquery.\" since the inner queryset is being evaluated independently when called from pickle: it calls QuerySet.__getstate__().\nI'm not sure what the best solution is here. I made a patch that adds the following override to __getstate__ to the SubQuery class, which fixes the problem and passes all other Django tests on my machine. I'll submit a PR shortly, but welcome any better approaches since I'm not sure what else that may effect.\nclass Subquery(Expression):\n...\ndef __getstate__(self):\nobj_dict = super().__getstate__()\nobj_dict.pop('_constructor_args', None)\nreturn obj_dict\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results provides insights into the components involved in the described issue and their potential relationships to the bug. Let's break down the information received from each result:\n\n1. **Subquery Class in expressions.py**:\n   - **What it does**: The `Subquery` class, derived from `Expression`, represents a SQL subquery. This class is equipped with methods for initializing the subquery, generating SQL, and providing additional functionalities necessary for executing and working with subqueries within the Django ORM.\n   - **Relationship to the bug**: The issue description implicates the `Subquery` class as central to the bug, specifically pointing out that pickling a `QuerySet` that includes a `Subquery` inadvertently causes the queryset to be evaluated due to how the pickling process interacts with the `_constructor_args` attribute. Since `__getstate__` wasn't found in the `Subquery` class, it suggests that pickling behavior for `Subquery` instances relies on the default serialization methods, which might not account for the unique serialization needs of querysets used in subqueries.\n   - **Intended behavior**: Given the bug, the intended behavior for `Subquery` during pickling is to serialize the instance without evaluating the queryset. The suggested workaround involves implementing a `__getstate__` method that explicitly removes `_constructor_args` from the serialized state to prevent evaluation.\n\n2. **@deconstructible Decorator**:\n   - **What it does**: The `@deconstructible` decorator is used to mark classes as deconstructible for Django's migration framework. It allows complex classes and expressions to be serialized/deserialized so that they can be used in migrations safely.\n   - **Relationship to the bug**: The decorator's use is evidently widespread, including in the `expressions.py` file that defines `Subquery`. It's likely responsible for adding the `_constructor_args` attribute to instances of classes it decorates, including `Subquery`. This attribute, while useful for migrations, inadvertently contributes to the bug by causing unwanted queryset evaluation during pickling.\n   - **Intended behavior**: For the issue at hand, the decorator's mechanism should either be bypassed or accounted for when serializing `Subquery` instances to avoid triggering queryset evaluation. Altering or conditioning the behavior of the `@deconstructible` decorator or its effects on specific instances (like `Subquery`) during serialization could be the key.\n\n3. **test_pickle_subquery_queryset_not_evaluated**:\n   - **What it does**: Ideally, this test would verify that pickling a queryset containing a `Subquery` does not evaluate the queryset. The lack of finding this test could mean it's either not implemented or named differently than expected.\n   - **Relationship to the bug**: The test is directly related to the issue as it aims to reproduce and assert the correct behavior regarding the bug \u2013 ensuring that querysets aren't evaluated when instances of `Subquery` are pickled.\n   - **Intended behavior**: The test should confirm that the proposed solution or any other workaround effectively prevents queryset evaluation during the pickling process. Since the test wasn't found, a correct approach might involve creating or identifying the right test method to validate the bug fix.\n\nGiven this analysis, further steps could include:\n- Implementing the `__getstate__` method in the `Subquery` class as suggested in the issue, ensuring it properly excludes `_constructor_args` or handles them in a way that prevents queryset evaluation.\n- Creating or identifying the correct test function, possibly correcting the name if needed, to validate the fix accurately. It might require additional API calls to locate this test or to check if it's placed under a different filename or test class not directly inferred from the initial search.\n\nGiven the unfruitful search for the test method, a more detailed look into the testing files related to serialization or the queryset module may be necessary. Additionally, reviewing the implementation and usage of `@deconstructible` in related classes could provide further understanding of how to mitigate its side effects in serialization scenarios."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This method's purpose would be to ensure that when a `Subquery` instance gets pickled, the queryset does not get evaluated. This can be achieved by modifying the object's dictionary before pickling, specifically by excluding the `_constructor_args` attribute from the serialized object state, or ensuring it's handled in a way that stops the evaluation of the queryset. This preserves the functionality of the `Subquery` class for its primary use while preventing the undesired side effect encountered during pickling. The method could look something similar to:\n     ```python\n     def __getstate__(self):\n         obj_dict = super().__getstate__()\n         obj_dict.pop('_constructor_args', None)\n         return obj_dict\n     ```\n   This method allows for the rest of the `Subquery` attributes to be pickled without evaluating the queryset, aligning with the intended use of pickling for serialization and caching purposes without side effects."
