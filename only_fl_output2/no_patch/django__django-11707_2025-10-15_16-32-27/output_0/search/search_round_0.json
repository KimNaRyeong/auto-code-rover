So in theory it shouldn't be pickling the QuerySet.\nHowever, the QuerySet is still stored on the instance within the _constructor_args attribute added by the @deconstructible decorator on the BaseExpression base class. So when the inner query object gets pickled, so does the QuerySet, which attempts to evaluate it. In this case, it gets the error \"ValueError: This queryset contains a reference to an outer query and may only be used in a subquery.\" since the inner queryset is being evaluated independently when called from pickle: it calls QuerySet.__getstate__().\nI'm not sure what the best solution is here. I made a patch that adds the following override to __getstate__ to the SubQuery class, which fixes the problem and passes all other Django tests on my machine. I'll submit a PR shortly, but welcome any better approaches since I'm not sure what else that may effect.\nclass Subquery(Expression):\n...\ndef __getstate__(self):\nobj_dict = super().__getstate__()\nobj_dict.pop('_constructor_args', None)\nreturn obj_dict\n</issue>"

The class `Subquery` and its method `__getstate__` to see if there are existing implementations and behavior that we need to be aware of or if the proposed solution is already in place.\n2. The class `Group` and the `Event` model to understand how they are being used in the `annotate` call, although the issue seems not to be directly related to their implementation but rather how they interact with `Subquery`.\n3. The `@deconstructible` decorator to understand how it adds `_constructor_args` to a class and its impact on pickling.\n4. The `test_pickle_subquery_queryset_not_evaluated` method to get the test case context that triggers the issue.\n\nHere are the API calls to gather this information:\n\n- `search_class(\"Subquery\")`: This will give us the file location and context of the `Subquery` class to observe its current implementation.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__getstate__\", \"Subquery\")`: This will help us find if there's an existing `__getstate__` method in the `Subquery` class and its current behavior.\n- `search_code(\"@deconstructible\")`: To find where and how the `@deconstructible` decorator is defined or used, giving us insights into its purpose and implementation details.\n- `search_method(\"test_pickle_subquery_queryset_not_evaluated\")`: This will locate the test method that reproduces the issue, providing insight into how the bug manifests during testing.\n\nThese searches should yield enough context to understand the problem and validate the proposed fix or suggest an alternative one."
