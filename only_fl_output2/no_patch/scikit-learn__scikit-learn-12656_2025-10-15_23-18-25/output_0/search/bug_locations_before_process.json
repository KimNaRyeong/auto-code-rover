        "intended_behavior": "The `labels` parameter should be removed from the function signature of `hamming_loss`. All instances within the method where `labels` is used need to be revised. Specifically, for multilabel classification, where `len(labels)` was previously used to compute the average Hamming loss, it should now rely on `y_true.shape[1]` to obtain the number of labels directly from the shape of `y_true`. The logic used to handle cases when `labels` is not provided (`if labels is None: labels = unique_labels(y_true, y_pred)`) should be removed since `labels` will no longer be part of the function signature or its computation. Ensure that the functionality for calculating the Hamming loss remains correctly implemented for both multiclass and multilabel classification, without an explicit `labels` parameter, by using the shapes of the `y_true` and `y_pred` inputs to infer necessary information for calculations. In the documentation of the function, remove references to the `labels` parameter and update the example and explanation parts to reflect this change. Update any part of the documentation within the function that mentions the `labels` parameter, ensuring it aligns with the new method signature and logic. This change aims to simplify the `hamming_loss` function's interface by assuming the labels set directly from `y_true` and `y_pred`, making the function more intuitive and slightly modifying its internal logic to work without explicitly provided labels."
