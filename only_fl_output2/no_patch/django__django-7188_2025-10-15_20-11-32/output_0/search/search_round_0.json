        "content": "To address the issue, we need to find where the authentication machinery is implemented in the Django project, specifically focusing on the middleware and context processors mentioned. The goal is to understand how these components depend on the `django.contrib.auth` app being in `INSTALLED_APPS` and identify changes that could decouple them. This will require looking into both the `AuthenticationMiddleware` and `auth` context processor implementation as well as any dependent settings or utility methods.\n\nThese are the API calls we should make to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"AuthenticationMiddleware\")`: This will help us locate the `AuthenticationMiddleware` class to understand its current dependency on `django.contrib.auth` being installed.\n\n2. `search_code(\"context_processors.auth\")`: Since context processors are not classes or methods but settings, searching for the code snippet where `context_processors.auth` is mentioned will help identify how it's set up and its dependencies.\n\n3. `search_method(\"get_user\")`: It's likely that both the middleware and context processor use some common methods to fetch or validate the user, `get_user` being a common name for such a method in Django's auth system. This call will help us understand how users are loaded and whether this process inherently requires `django.contrib.auth` to be in `INSTALLED_APPS`.\n\nThese API calls will provide a starting point for understanding the components involved and their dependencies, laying the groundwork for proposing a solution that removes the need to have `django.contrib.auth` in `INSTALLED_APPS` for their usage."
