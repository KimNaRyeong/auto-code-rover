        "intended_behavior": "The `AuthenticationMiddleware` should be designed such that it does not inherently require `django.contrib.auth` to be present in `INSTALLED_APPS`. Its functionality of attaching a user to every request can be maintained by abstracting or decoupling any direct dependencies on the `auth` app's models or settings. Ensuring that the middleware can perform its user-attachment logic without directly relying on the `auth` app being installed would resolve the issue. This could involve using more generalized methods of accessing user models or handling situations where the auth app is not installed more gracefully."

        "intended_behavior": "For the `check_dependencies` function, the intended change is to allow the Django admin to perform its dependency checks in a way that does not rigidly require `django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth` if the authentication machinery is being used without the auth app. This might involve adding logic to the checks that validate the presence of necessary authentication components without assuming the `auth` app's presence in `INSTALLED_APPS`. This modification ensures that the admin app's dependency check does not falsely flag a missing `auth` app context processor when it's possible to use the auth machinery independently."
