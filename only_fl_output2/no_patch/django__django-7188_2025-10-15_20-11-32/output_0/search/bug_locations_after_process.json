Its functionality of attaching a user to every request can be maintained by abstracting or decoupling any direct dependencies on the `auth` app's models or settings. Ensuring that the middleware can perform its user-attachment logic without directly relying on the `auth` app being installed would resolve the issue. This could involve using more generalized methods of accessing user models or handling situations where the auth app is not installed more gracefully."

This modification ensures that the admin app's dependency check does not falsely flag a missing `auth` app context processor when it's possible to use the auth machinery independently."
