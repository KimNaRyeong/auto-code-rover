        "content": "To reproduce the issue and adhere to your request for the `reproducer.py` script, I've crafted a simple Python script that attempts to replicate the described behavior. This script mimics the original issue described using `pytest`, but note, to run it directly as a standalone Python file (as requested), it bypasses the typical `pytest` test case definitions and runs the scenario directly.\n\nEven though running it with `python3` should not in principle trigger the issue (since Python 3 by default supports Unicode without such issues and handles exceptions differently), the script below is prepared to simulate the context and catch the exception.\n\nHere is the `reproducer.py`:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef my_test():\n    # This simulates the assert statement in a pytest context\n    try:\n        assert False, u\"\\u2603\"\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        raise e\n\ndef run_test():\n    try:\n        my_test()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with 0 to indicate successful reproduction of the issue\n\n# Entry point of the script\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    run_test()\n```\n\nThis script, when executed with `python3`, should not raise the `UnicodeEncodeError` due to the improved Unicode support in Python 3. However, it's structured to catch and print a stack trace for any exception that would match the original environment's issue when run under those conditions.\n\nKeep in mind, the actual issue described is inherently related to Python 2's handling of Unicode and the specific usage of `pytest` to capture exceptions along with Unicode message matching. This direct script execution is meant more as an exercise in reproducing conditions and handling exceptions rather than a one-to-one replication of the `pytest` behavior under Python 2 environments."
