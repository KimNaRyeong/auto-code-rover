        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the API calls, let's address the questions one by one for each piece of the search results.\n\n### Analysis of `search_method(\"raises\")` Results\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThe snippet from `src/_pytest/python_api.py` defines the `raises` function, which is used as a context manager or in a legacy form to assert that a block of code raises a specific exception. It accepts an `expected_exception`, optional positional and keyword arguments, including a `match` keyword, for asserting a regex match against the exception's string representation.\n\n**What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\nThe reported bug occurs when using `pytest.raises` with a Unicode match assertion in Python 2, leading to a `UnicodeEncodeError`. The `raises` function directly handles the `match` parameter (lines 561-565), where it describes how the `match` should be processed and tested against the exception using `re.search`. The issue likely arises from how Unicode strings (especially with non-ASCII characters) are handled or not properly handled in this context, which is crucial for understanding the source of the bug.\n\n**Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\nThe intended behavior would be for `pytest.raises` to accurately and without error evaluate whether the exception message matches the Unicode pattern provided in the `match` parameter. This means it should be able to handle Unicode strings correctly, encoding them as necessary to perform the match operation without raising a `UnicodeEncodeError`.\n\n### Analysis of `search_code(\"with pytest.raises\")` Results\n\nThe widespread use of `with pytest.raises` across various test files indicates a common pattern for testing expected failures. This context doesn't directly relate to the bug but underscores the importance of the `raises` function working correctly with all types of input, including Unicode strings, to support the wide variety of test cases across the codebase.\n\n### Analysis of `search_code(\"\\u2603\")` Results\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThis code snippet is from a test function named `test_syntax_error_with_non_ascii_chars` in `testing/python/collect.py`, which seems to involve syntax testing with non-ASCII characters (specifically the Unicode snowman character `\u2603`).\n\n**What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\nThis snippet shows that the codebase does include tests involving Unicode characters, suggesting that there's an awareness and accommodation for Unicode in the testing suite. It illustrates a practical case where Unicode characters are involved but does not directly relate to the `UnicodeEncodeError` issue within the `raises` context manager.\n\n**Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\nWhile this part doesn't directly relate to the bug, it implies that tests involving Unicode characters should pass without encoding issues. It suggests that the codebase is intended to support Unicode and that similar support should extend to the use of Unicode strings with the `match` argument in the `raises` function.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nUnderstanding that `raises` is meant to handle Unicode matches but fails in the reported scenario, the next step involves examining how `raises` handles the `match` keyword, particularly with regards to encoding. Since the issue occurs in Python 2, which has distinct behaviors for Unicode vs. ASCII strings, it's possible that the root cause involves a missing or improper handling of Unicode encoding. \n\nGiven this analysis, a direct lookup or adjustment in the `raises` function to ensure it correctly handles Unicode regex patterns without causing a `UnicodeEncodeError` would likely be the path forward to resolve the issue."

When the `match` keyword is used with a Unicode regular expression pattern, the function should ensure that both the error message from the raised exception and the provided `match` pattern are appropriately encoded or decoded to avoid encoding incompatibilities. This correction must not alter the function's ability to handle ASCII or Unicode matches in either Python 2 or Python 3. The implementation should include checking the Python version and performing the necessary encoding/decoding operations only when required (i.e., under Python 2), ensuring that the functionality is preserved across different versions."
