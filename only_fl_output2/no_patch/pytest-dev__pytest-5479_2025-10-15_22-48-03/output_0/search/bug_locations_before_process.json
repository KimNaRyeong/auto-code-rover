        "intended_behavior": "The function `raises` should properly handle Unicode character comparisons in Python 2 without triggering a `UnicodeEncodeError`. When the `match` keyword is used with a Unicode regular expression pattern, the function should ensure that both the error message from the raised exception and the provided `match` pattern are appropriately encoded or decoded to avoid encoding incompatibilities. This correction must not alter the function's ability to handle ASCII or Unicode matches in either Python 2 or Python 3. The implementation should include checking the Python version and performing the necessary encoding/decoding operations only when required (i.e., under Python 2), ensuring that the functionality is preserved across different versions."
