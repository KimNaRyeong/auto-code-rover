        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to Unicode match assertions with pytest.raises in Python 2, I need to invoke the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"raises\")`: This call will help identify where and how the `raises` function is implemented within the pytest framework or the project codebase. It's essential to understand the handling of arguments passed to `raises`, especially how the `match` parameter is processed.\n\n2. `search_code(\"with pytest.raises\")`: To get an understanding of how `pytest.raises` is typically used across the project, which might give insights into common patterns or possibly related issues that have been resolved.\n\n3. `search_code(u\"\\u2603\")`: This will help identify if there are other instances in the codebase where Unicode characters might be causing similar issues, or how Unicode strings are generally handled.\n\nThese API calls will provide a broad yet relevant overview of the handling of Unicode assertions and the usage of `pytest.raises`, which is crucial for crafting a solution to the reported issue."
