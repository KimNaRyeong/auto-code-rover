Since the initial attempt did not accurately reproduce the issue as described due to the execution environment being Python 3 where Unicode is handled differently compared to Python 2, and recognizing the requirements for Python 2 style exception handling in a Python 3 script might not directly reproduce the issue related to Unicode exceptions, here is an adjusted approach.

Given the constraints, it's critical to understand this adjusted script still may not exhibit the `UnicodeEncodeError` as it's a Python 2 specific issue, but it will try to replicate the conditions as closely as possible under Python 3.

Here's the revised `reproducer.py`:

```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def simulate_pytest_behavior():
    # Mimic the behavior of matching Unicode assertion error in pytest.raises
    try:
        with raises(AssertionError, match=u"\u2603"):
            assert False, u"\u2603"
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Exit with 0 to simulate that the issue is "fixed" or not present in this context
        sys.exit(0)

class raises:
    """
    A simplified context manager to mimic pytest.raises functionality for demonstration.
    This will not capture exceptions as pytest.raises does but will raise any exceptions encountered.
    """
    def __init__(self, expected_exception, match=None):
        self.expected_exception = expected_exception
        self.match = match

    def __enter__(self):
        pass

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        if exc_type is not None:
            if issubclass(exc_type, self.expected_exception):
                if self.match is not None and self.match in str(exc_val):
                    return True  # Exception handled
        # Re-raise the exception if not handled
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    simulate_pytest_behavior()
```

Again, this adapted script aims to replicate the exception handling logic within the constraints of Python 3, offering a structure for simulating the issue. However, the core issue— `UnicodeEncodeError` due to ASCII encoding in Python 2—cannot be directly reproduced in Python 3, as Python 3's string handling does not suffer from this limitation.

Please use this script for educational purposes or to adapt the testing scenario under conditions that might better reflect the original Python 2 environment or behavior.
