Given the requirement to create a Python script that aims to reproduce the originally described issue with Django's ORM – specifically, the inclusion of constant expressions within the `GROUP BY` clause when using `ExpressionWrapper` – the following example attempts to directly address this scenario. This implementation assumes that you have a Django project setup and that the script is placed in the root directory of this project. It also presumes the existence of a Django model named `Model` with fields `column_a` and `column_b`.

```python
"""
reproducer.py
"""

import os
import django
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import ExpressionWrapper, Value, IntegerField, Sum
from django.db.utils import ProgrammingError

os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project.settings')
django.setup()

# Assuming `Model` is an existing model in your Django project
from your_app.models import Model 

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def execQuery(expr):
    try:
        expr = ExpressionWrapper(expr, output_field=IntegerField())
        return Model.objects.annotate(expr_res=expr).values('expr_res', 'column_a').annotate(sum=Sum('column_b'))
    except ProgrammingError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.") from e

def main():
    # Simulate the issue with a constant expression passed to execQuery
    try:
        expr = Value(3)
        query = execQuery(expr)
        print("Executing query...")
        list(query)  # Force query execution to potentially catch the ProgrammingError
    except AssertionError:
        # Exit with a non-zero code to signal failure in reproducing the issue
        sys.exit(1)
    
    print('No issues detected. If this message appears, the issue with ExpressionWrapper has been fixed.')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Ensure to replace `'your_project.settings'` with the correct path to your Django project settings and `'your_app.models.Model'` with the full path to the appropriate Django model in your application. This script uses Django’s ORM to construct and attempt to execute a query that will trigger the described issue, catching and handling `ProgrammingError` if it arises. Note that this script assumes an appropriate Django environment is already set up and configured, including database connections that would allow for actual query execution against your Postgres database.
