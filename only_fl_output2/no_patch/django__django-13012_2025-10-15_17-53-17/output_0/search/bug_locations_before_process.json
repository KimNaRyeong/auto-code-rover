Since adding a constant value directly into the `GROUP BY` clause is not valid in PostgreSQL in this context, the method might need to flag or distinguish these constant expressions so that when the Django ORM constructs the SQL query, it omits them from the `GROUP BY` clause."

        "intended_behavior": "This method's handling of annotations that include constant expressions needs to be refined. Specifically, it should ensure that when an `ExpressionWrapper` wrapping a constant expression is annotated, this annotation does not lead to an invalid `GROUP BY` clause. The logic might involve better introspection of the `ExpressionWrapper` object or a more nuanced handling of the group by construction logic within this method or downstream in the query construction process. The end goal is to allow constant expressions to be part of the selection without improperly influencing grouping."
