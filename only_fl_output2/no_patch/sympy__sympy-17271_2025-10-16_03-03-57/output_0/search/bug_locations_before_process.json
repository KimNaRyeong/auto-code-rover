        "intended_behavior": "For the specific case of `S.ComplexInfinity` (`zoo`), the current behavior returns `None`, which is inconsistent with the handling required for a mathematical function that expects a numeric return value or a well-defined symbolic representation. The intended behavior should probably involve returning a result that appropriately signifies the indeterminate nature of the fraction part of a complex infinite quantity, potentially `S.NaN` (not a number), or raising a more informative exception that clearly indicates why `frac(zoo)` is an invalid operation. This change would preserve the existing functionality for all defined inputs while providing a meaningful response for the special case of `ComplexInfinity`. Rather than simply returning `None`, modifying the method to return `S.NaN` for `arg is S.ComplexInfinity` would align with mathematical expectations (since the fractional part of infinity is not defined) and would avoid the TypeError caused by attempting to use `None` in subsequent operations. This would address the immediate issue raised and make the behavior of `frac` with `zoo` consistent with the broader expectations for handling undefined or indeterminate expressions within SymPy."
