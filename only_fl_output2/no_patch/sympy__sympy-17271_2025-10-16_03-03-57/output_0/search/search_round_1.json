        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. Code Snippet from `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py` around Line 311\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\nThis part of the `frac` function's `eval` method deals with handling different types of numeric arguments. It specifically checks if the argument is infinity or negative infinity, an integer, a NaN, ComplexInfinity, or another type of number (presumably a real or complex number) and returns appropriate values based on these checks.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\nThe bug occurs because when `frac` is called with `zoo` (`S.ComplexInfinity`), the method returns `None` (line 312), which subsequently leads to a `TypeError` due to the addition operation (`NoneType` and `Zero`). This indicates that the handling of `ComplexInfinity` (`zoo`) is not properly integrated into the rest of the `frac` function's logic, which seems to expect numeric types or symbols that can be involved in arithmetic operations.\n\n- **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\nGiven that `frac(zoo)` should not result in a `TypeError`, the code might be expected to either return a symbolic representation indicating that the fraction part of `ComplexInfinity` is undefined or unrepresentable, or it could be corrected to return a value that is consistent with the theoretical behavior of `frac` over complex infinities. This could involve defining a more appropriate return value when `frac` is called with `zoo`.\n\n#### 2. Class `Infinity` in `sympy/core/numbers.py`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\nThe `Infinity` class represents positive infinity in SymPy. It includes methods for arithmetic operations, comparisons, and specific methods related to mathematical behavior of infinity in various contexts.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\nWhile this class provides detailed behaviors for positive infinity, the issue originates from handling `ComplexInfinity` (`zoo`). The absence of an `eval` method in the `Infinity` class information acquired and the lack of direct relevance of this class to the handling of `ComplexInfinity` suggest that the main problem lies elsewhere, but understanding how infinity is treated can provide insights into potential ways to handle complex infinities.\n\n#### 3. Lack of `eval` Method in `Infinity` and `frac` Function Context\n\n- **What additional context do we need?**\nGiven that `zoo` is specifically `ComplexInfinity`, which is distinct from the positive `Infinity` handled by the `Infinity` class, a closer look at how `ComplexInfinity` is implemented and managed within SymPy could be useful. This could involve searching for the class or method implementations specifically related to `ComplexInfinity` and how operations involving it are supposed to be evaluated.\n  \n- **Further Actions:**\n  - Investigate how `ComplexInfinity` (`S.ComplexInfinity` or `zoo`) is defined and handled in SymPy. This could help in understanding what the intended behavior should be when it is passed as an argument to functions like `frac`.\n  - Explore whether other numerical functions within SymPy have special handling for `ComplexInfinity` that could inform a consistent approach for `frac`.\n\nTo proceed, we might need to adjust our search to focus specifically on the handling of `ComplexInfinity` within the SymPy codebase."

The intended behavior should probably involve returning a result that appropriately signifies the indeterminate nature of the fraction part of a complex infinite quantity, potentially `S.NaN` (not a number), or raising a more informative exception that clearly indicates why `frac(zoo)` is an invalid operation. This change would preserve the existing functionality for all defined inputs while providing a meaningful response for the special case of `ComplexInfinity`.\n  \n  Rather than simply returning `None`, modifying the method to return `S.NaN` for `arg is S.ComplexInfinity` would align with mathematical expectations (since the fractional part of infinity is not defined) and would avoid the TypeError caused by attempting to use `None` in subsequent operations. This would address the immediate issue raised and make the behavior of `frac` with `zoo` consistent with the broader expectations for handling undefined or indeterminate expressions within SymPy."
