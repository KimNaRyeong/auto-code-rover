        "content": "To effectively gather context and assist in resolving the issue related to `frac(zoo)` giving a `TypeError`, I will invoke the following API calls:\n\n1. Get context around the line in `integers.py` where the issue is reported to understand the implementation of `frac` method:\n\n- `get_code_around_line(\"sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py\", 311, 10)`\n\n2. Since the error message mentions a problem with operand types involving `NoneType` and `Zero`, and the issue mentions trying to cover specific lines in a test, understanding how `frac` is supposed to handle inputs like `zoo` (which is a mathematical representation for infinity in SymPy) is critical. To this end, it is helpful to understand the implementation and handling of `zoo` in SymPy:\n\n- `search_class(\"Infinity\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"eval\", \"Infinity\")`\n\n3. Furthermore, to ensure a complete understanding of the problem, it would be beneficial to review how the `frac` function is designed to work with various types of arguments. This requires looking at the `frac` function definition and any documentation/comments within the code that explain its intended behavior:\n\n- `search_method(\"frac\")`\n\nThese API calls will provide a comprehensive view of the implementation of `frac`, how it interacts with various types of inputs including special cases like `zoo`, and any related handling of `Infinity` within the SymPy library. This information will be crucial for drafting a patch that addresses the issue without introducing regressions."
