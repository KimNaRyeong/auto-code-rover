        "intended_behavior": "The `get_latest_lastmod` method should handle the case when `self.items()` returns an empty sequence to avoid raising `ValueError`. This can be accomplished by adding `ValueError` to the list of exceptions caught by the `try`...`except` block or by explicitly checking if `self.items()` is empty before attempting to find the maximum value. The adjusted method should preserve its functionality of finding the latest `lastmod` date for non-empty sequences while returning `None` for empty sequences or when `lastmod` cannot be computed, ensuring sitemap generation does not fail due to this issue."
