To get the overall structure and methods of the `Sitemap` class involved in the traceback, we should look into the class definition:\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Sitemap\")\n```\n\n2. We need to identify and analyze the `get_latest_lastmod` method implementation detail within the `Sitemap` class:\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"get_latest_lastmod\", \"Sitemap\")\n```\n\n3. Since the issue description points towards a specific exception behavior inside a method, searching directly for the exception handling part of the code as described in the issue could prove useful. We look for the current implementation to understand how exceptions are currently handled:\n```python\nsearch_code(\"return max([self.lastmod(item) for item in self.items()])\")\n```\n\nThese API calls should provide a broad enough context about the `Sitemap` class, the `get_latest_lastmod` method, and how exceptions are handled in the numerical processing (specifically the `max` function call) within the Django framework's sitemaps feature."
