The existing functionality of listing items for the sitemap in a neutral or default language (if any) should be preserved."

        "intended_behavior": "This method should be adjusted to respect language-specific item availability. When generating URLs for the sitemap, it should check if the item is available in the requested language and either include or exclude it based on this condition. The method should seamlessly continue to handle other aspects of URL generation (e.g., applying the correct protocol and domain) as it currently does. This adjustment would likely involve leveraging more nuanced logic in conjunction with the 'items' method and potentially the 'i18n' property to ensure that only appropriately available items are listed for each language in the sitemap."
