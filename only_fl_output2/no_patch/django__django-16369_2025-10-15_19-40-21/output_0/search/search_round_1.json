        "content": "To address this issue effectively, we need to understand how the Sitemap is currently being generated, especially in relation to i18n (internationalization) functions or configurations. The mention of a \"cartesian product between some items and some languages\" suggests that the code handling the Sitemap generation might be iterating over items and languages together, without discrimination based on item-language compatibility. \n\nFirst, it's important to identify the main class or method responsible for Sitemap generation, especially within the context of internationalization. Since the issue doesn't specify any particular class or method names, I would start with a broad search to find relevant parts of the codebase.\n\n1. **Search for Sitemap Generation Class/Methods:**\n    - Since Sitemaps are typically generated by a specific part of the code dedicated to SEO (Search Engine Optimization) or website navigation, starting with a search for a class or method containing \"Sitemap\" would be logical. Additionally, identifying anything named with \"i18n\" might help narrow down how internationalization is handled.\n   \n    ```python\n    search_class(\"Sitemap\")\n    search_method(\"generate_sitemap\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Search for i18n Configuration or Usage:**\n    - Given that i18n plays a crucial role in this issue, finding out how i18n configurations are being utilized within the project can provide insights into how languages are managed and can offer clues on where the implementation can be adjusted to account for language-specific item visibility.\n   \n    ```python\n    search_code(\"i18n\")\n    ```\n\nThese initial searches should provide a starting point to understand how Sitemaps are generally managed within the project and how i18n configurations are integrated. Following this, the next steps can be determined based on the findings from these searches."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context gives us some insights into where and how to potentially address the submitted issue. The issue at hand involves selectively displaying items in the Sitemap based on the language, especially in cases where items may not be translated into all supported languages.\n\n### Analysis of `Sitemap` class in `django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `Sitemap` class appears to be a Django sitemap generation tool that supports various functionalities like setting a limit to the number of URLs, toggling internationalization (i18n) support, specifying the protocol (http or https), and more. It includes methods to list items to be included in the sitemap, resolve their locations (URLs), and paginate the sitemap entries.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The `i18n` property within the `Sitemap` class is directly related to the bug. The current implementation, as described in the issue, indiscriminately applies a cartesian product of items and languages, which could be happening in methods like `items` or the way `get_urls` method handles internationalization.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would involve modifying how the `Sitemap` class handles i18n to allow specifying which items should be displayed for each language, thereby avoiding the current behavior of displaying all items for all languages regardless of translation availability. This might involve adding logic to filter items based on language within `items`, `get_urls`, or another related method.\n\n### Analysis of i18n Code Snippets\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The i18n code snippets scattered across various Django components likely involve locale detection, URL handling for language prefixes, template rendering with localized content, and more. These are parts of the Django framework that enable applications to support multiple languages.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The mechanism for locale detection and URL handling with prefixes in files such as `django/middleware/locale.py` or `django/urls/conf.py` might be linked to how URLs are generated for the Sitemap items. Specifically, the existence or handling of URLs depending on the language (and the underlying issue of items not being suitable for all languages) might be managed by these components.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - From an i18n perspective, the intended behavior would involve efficiently detecting the available translations for each item and constructing URLs accordingly, ensuring that only URLs for appropriately translated content are included in the Sitemap for each language. This may imply improvements or changes in how language-specific URLs are generated or selected.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nBased on this analysis, the next steps should involve:\n- Detailed inspection of how the `i18n` property in `Sitemap` influences the generation of URLs, specifically through methods like `__init__`, `items`, `get_urls`, and potentially `_urls`.\n- Investigation into the mechanisms of `django/middleware/locale.py` and similar files for insights on how language-specific URL rendering and item filtration based on translation availability could be improved.\n\nTo further this investigation, I would consider the following API calls:\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_get\", \"Sitemap\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"get_urls\", \"Sitemap\")`\n- `search_code_in_file(\"i18n\", \"django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py\")`\n\nThese searches would aim to uncover how i18n configurations are utilized in sitemap generation and potentially pinpoint areas where enhancements could be introduced to address the reported issue."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Currently, it likely lists all items regardless of their language availability. It should be enhanced to filter items based on their translation status for each language supported by the website. The existing functionality of listing items for the sitemap in a neutral or default language (if any) should be preserved.\n\n- **Location 2**: \n  - **File**: `django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py`\n  - **Class**: `Sitemap`\n  - **Method**: `get_urls`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: This method should be adjusted to respect language-specific item availability. When generating URLs for the sitemap, it should check if the item is available in the requested language and either include or exclude it based on this condition. The method should seamlessly continue to handle other aspects of URL generation (e.g., applying the correct protocol and domain) as it currently does. This adjustment would likely involve leveraging more nuanced logic in conjunction with the `items` method and potentially the `i18n` property to ensure that only appropriately available items are listed for each language in the sitemap.\n\n**Description**: The modifications aim to provide a solution allowing selective item display per language in the sitemap, thus directly addressing the issue raised. This involves enhancing the `items` and `get_urls` methods within the `Sitemap` class to incorporate logic for filtering and displaying items based on their translation status for each language. This solution should maintain compatibility with the current functionality for cases where i18n is not a concern, ensuring a broad applicability of the `Sitemap` class across various configurations."
