        "content": "To address this issue effectively, we need to understand how the Sitemap is currently being generated, especially in relation to i18n (internationalization) functions or configurations. The mention of a \"cartesian product between some items and some languages\" suggests that the code handling the Sitemap generation might be iterating over items and languages together, without discrimination based on item-language compatibility. \n\nFirst, it's important to identify the main class or method responsible for Sitemap generation, especially within the context of internationalization. Since the issue doesn't specify any particular class or method names, I would start with a broad search to find relevant parts of the codebase.\n\n1. **Search for Sitemap Generation Class/Methods:**\n    - Since Sitemaps are typically generated by a specific part of the code dedicated to SEO (Search Engine Optimization) or website navigation, starting with a search for a class or method containing \"Sitemap\" would be logical. Additionally, identifying anything named with \"i18n\" might help narrow down how internationalization is handled.\n   \n    ```python\n    search_class(\"Sitemap\")\n    search_method(\"generate_sitemap\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Search for i18n Configuration or Usage:**\n    - Given that i18n plays a crucial role in this issue, finding out how i18n configurations are being utilized within the project can provide insights into how languages are managed and can offer clues on where the implementation can be adjusted to account for language-specific item visibility.\n   \n    ```python\n    search_code(\"i18n\")\n    ```\n\nThese initial searches should provide a starting point to understand how Sitemaps are generally managed within the project and how i18n configurations are integrated. Following this, the next steps can be determined based on the findings from these searches."
