        "content": "To address the previous issue where `sphinx-quickstart` could not be found, it suggests that Sphinx may not have been installed correctly or the environment path might not include the installation location of Sphinx. To ensure the script works as expected, you should first verify that Sphinx is indeed installed and accessible from the command line. If necessary, adjust your PATH environment variable or explicitly specify the path to the Sphinx commands within the script. The Python script below attempts to address this by programmatically verifying the presence of required commands before execution. However, it does not dynamically adjust the path for Sphinx commands; this adjustment must be done prior to running the script or by modifying the script to include the correct paths.\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef command_exists(cmd):\n    \"\"\"Check whether `cmd` is on PATH and marked as executable.\"\"\"\n    from shutil import which\n    return which(cmd) is not None\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        # Verify sphinx-build and sphinx-quickstart are in PATH\n        if not command_exists('sphinx-build') or not command_exists('sphinx-quickstart'):\n            raise FileNotFoundError('Required Sphinx commands are not available.')\n\n        # Step 1: Create a Sphinx project using sphinx-quickstart\n        subprocess.run([\n            'sphinx-quickstart', '--quiet', '--project', 'proj',\n            '--author', 'me', '--release', '1.0', '--language', 'en', '--sep',\n            '-p', 'proj', '-a', 'me', '-v', '1.0', '-r', '1.0', '-l', 'en',\n            '--makefile', '--batchfile'], check=True)\n\n        # Step 2: Create a document with a broken link\n        with open('source/index.rst', 'a') as f:\n            f.write('\\n`foo <https://google.com/test.txt#test>`_')\n\n        # Step 3: Run linkcheck \n        result = subprocess.run(['make', 'linkcheck'], capture_output=True, text=True)\n\n        # Analyzing the output\n        expected_output_not_found = \"(line    6) broken    https://google.com/test.txt#test - 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://google.com/test.txt\"\n        actual_output = result.stdout + result.stderr  # Ensure to check both output streams\n\n        if expected_output_not_found in actual_output:\n            print(\"Issue is fixed\")\n            sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating success\n        else:\n            raise AssertionError(\"Issue is still present.

It should help to ensure that the necessary Sphinx components are installed and accessible. If the script finds that Sphinx commands are not available, it raises a `FileNotFoundError`, providing a hint to investigate the Sphinx installation and the environment setup."
