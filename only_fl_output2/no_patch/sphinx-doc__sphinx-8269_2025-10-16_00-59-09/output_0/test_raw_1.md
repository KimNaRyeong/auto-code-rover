To address the previous issue where `sphinx-quickstart` could not be found, it suggests that Sphinx may not have been installed correctly or the environment path might not include the installation location of Sphinx. To ensure the script works as expected, you should first verify that Sphinx is indeed installed and accessible from the command line. If necessary, adjust your PATH environment variable or explicitly specify the path to the Sphinx commands within the script. The Python script below attempts to address this by programmatically verifying the presence of required commands before execution. However, it does not dynamically adjust the path for Sphinx commands; this adjustment must be done prior to running the script or by modifying the script to include the correct paths.

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def command_exists(cmd):
    """Check whether `cmd` is on PATH and marked as executable."""
    from shutil import which
    return which(cmd) is not None

def main():
    try:
        # Verify sphinx-build and sphinx-quickstart are in PATH
        if not command_exists('sphinx-build') or not command_exists('sphinx-quickstart'):
            raise FileNotFoundError('Required Sphinx commands are not available.')

        # Step 1: Create a Sphinx project using sphinx-quickstart
        subprocess.run([
            'sphinx-quickstart', '--quiet', '--project', 'proj',
            '--author', 'me', '--release', '1.0', '--language', 'en', '--sep',
            '-p', 'proj', '-a', 'me', '-v', '1.0', '-r', '1.0', '-l', 'en',
            '--makefile', '--batchfile'], check=True)

        # Step 2: Create a document with a broken link
        with open('source/index.rst', 'a') as f:
            f.write('\n`foo <https://google.com/test.txt#test>`_')

        # Step 3: Run linkcheck 
        result = subprocess.run(['make', 'linkcheck'], capture_output=True, text=True)

        # Analyzing the output
        expected_output_not_found = "(line    6) broken    https://google.com/test.txt#test - 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://google.com/test.txt"
        actual_output = result.stdout + result.stderr  # Ensure to check both output streams

        if expected_output_not_found in actual_output:
            print("Issue is fixed")
            sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating success
        else:
            raise AssertionError("Issue is still present. Found output:\n" + actual_output)

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code if there is an exception

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script now includes a simple check to verify that the `sphinx-build` and `sphinx-quickstart` commands are available before proceeding with the creation of a Sphinx project and executing the problematic command. It should help to ensure that the necessary Sphinx components are installed and accessible. If the script finds that Sphinx commands are not available, it raises a `FileNotFoundError`, providing a hint to investigate the Sphinx installation and the environment setup.
