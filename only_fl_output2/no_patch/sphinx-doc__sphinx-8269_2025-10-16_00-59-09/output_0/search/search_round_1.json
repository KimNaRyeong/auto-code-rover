This involves looking into the implementation details for functions or classes related to link checking, error reporting, and configuration handling. The description indicates that changing the configuration option `linkcheck_anchors` alters the behavior of error reporting, which suggests that the logic distinguishing between an anchor not found versus a 404 error might be flawed or not considering HTTP error statuses adequately.\n\nBased on the issue's description, here are the needed actions:\n\n1. Find where the `linkcheck` command is implemented to understand its workflow.\n2. Identify how Sphinx handles the `linkcheck_anchors` configuration to see how it affects the link checking process.\n3. Locate where Sphinx reports link checking results to see where the incorrect error message is generated.\n\nGiven these points, we will start with the following search API calls:\n\n- Search for classes or methods related to the `linkcheck` command to understand its implementation.\n- Search for how the configuration option `linkcheck_anchors` is used within the code.\n- Search for the error reporting part of the `linkcheck` process to see how it decides what message to output.\n\nHere are the specific API calls that align with our investigation plan:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_method(\"linkcheck\")\nsearch_code(\"linkcheck_anchors\")\nsearch_code(\"broken    https://\")\n``` \n\nThese calls should help us gather the necessary context around how `linkcheck` functions, how it interprets the `linkcheck_anchors` configuration, and how it constructs the error messages for broken links."

This file is likely where the logic for deciding when to check for anchors is present, as well as how to handle different outcomes of link checking (such as successful fetches, HTTP errors, and anchor not found scenarios).\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n- It likely parses and applies the `linkcheck_anchors` configuration option to determine whether to check for anchors in URLs during link checks.\n- It may also include logic that defines how to report errors found during link checking, including differentiating between HTTP errors and anchor issues.\n\n**Relationship with the bug**\n- The bug is directly related to this code since it involves incorrect error reporting when `linkcheck_anchors` is enabled. The logic that interprets link check outcomes and decides what error message to report seems to be not taking HTTP error statuses properly into account when `linkcheck_anchors` is `True`.\n\n**Intended behavior of this part of the code**\n- When an HTTP error occurs, regardless of whether `linkcheck_anchors` is set to `True` or `False`, the error reported should be about the HTTP status code (e.g., 404, 500) rather than incorrectly stating that an anchor was not found.\n- Correctly identifying and reporting the nature of the error (HTTP error vs. anchor not found) based on the server's response rather than only on the presence of an anchor in the URL.\n\n### Next Steps for Investigation\n\nGiven the insights from the analysis:\n\n1. **Examine `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` more closely**:\n   - Focus on how `linkcheck_anchors` is checked and processed in the code.\n   - Look for the function(s) that generate error messages based on link check results to see where the logic might be failing to distinguish between different types of errors.\n\nThus, appropriate next API calls might involve:\n- Inspecting areas around the matches for `linkcheck_anchors` within `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` to understand how it is implemented.\n- Searching for specific functions in `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` that handle error reporting.\n\nSpecific API calls could be:\n```plaintext\nsearch_code_in_file(\"linkcheck_anchors\", \"sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py\")\nsearch_method_in_file(\"report_error\", \"sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py\")\n```\n\nThese focused calls should reveal how the configuration affect link checks and where the error reporting mechanism might be failing to account for HTTP errors correctly."

However, the logic handling error reporting based on link check results, especially considering the `linkcheck_anchors` configuration, is where the fix is needed. The bug is located in the parts of the code responsible for:\n     - Interpreting the HTTP response and determining the nature of the error (HTTP status code error vs. anchor not found).\n     - Reporting the error to the user.\n\n   **Intended Behavior:**\n   - The code should differentiate between an HTTP error (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) and an anchor not found error. When an HTTP error occurs, the message should clearly state the HTTP error status code and message, such as \"404 Client Error: Not Found for URL: https://example.com/test.txt\", even when `linkcheck_anchors` is set to `True`.\n   - When `linkcheck_anchors` is `True` and the HTTP request successfully retrieves content, but the specified anchor is not found within the content, only then should it report \"Anchor 'test' not found\".\n   - This differentiation requires adjusting the error handling logic to:\n     - First, check the HTTP response status code. If it indicates an error (e.g., any status code other than 200 OK), report this as the primary issue.\n     - If the HTTP response is successful, then proceed to check for the anchor's existence in the response content (if `linkcheck_anchors` is `True`). If the anchor is missing, report \"Anchor 'test' not found\".\n   - This approach ensures that the error reporting accurately reflects the nature of the problem encountered during link checking, improving the utility of the linkcheck feature for Sphinx users by providing more accurate troubleshooting information."
