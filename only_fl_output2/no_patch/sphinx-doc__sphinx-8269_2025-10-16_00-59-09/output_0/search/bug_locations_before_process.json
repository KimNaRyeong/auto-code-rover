        "intended_behavior": "The code should differentiate between an HTTP error (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) and an anchor not found error. When an HTTP error occurs, the message should clearly state the HTTP error status code and message, such as \"404 Client Error: Not Found for URL: https://example.com/test.txt\", even when `linkcheck_anchors` is set to `True`. When `linkcheck_anchors` is `True` and the HTTP request successfully retrieves content, but the specified anchor is not found within the content, only then should it report \"Anchor 'test' not found\". This differentiation requires adjusting the error handling logic to: First, check the HTTP response status code. If it indicates an error (e.g., any status code other than 200 OK), report this as the primary issue. If the HTTP response is successful, then proceed to check for the anchor's existence in the response content (if `linkcheck_anchors` is `True`). If the anchor is missing, report \"Anchor 'test' not found\". This approach ensures that the error reporting accurately reflects the nature of the problem encountered during link checking, improving the utility of the linkcheck feature for Sphinx users by providing more accurate troubleshooting information."
