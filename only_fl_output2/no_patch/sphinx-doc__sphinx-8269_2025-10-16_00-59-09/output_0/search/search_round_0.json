        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the `linkcheck` command is implemented in Sphinx, specifically how it handles checking links with anchors and reporting errors. This involves looking into the implementation details for functions or classes related to link checking, error reporting, and configuration handling. The description indicates that changing the configuration option `linkcheck_anchors` alters the behavior of error reporting, which suggests that the logic distinguishing between an anchor not found versus a 404 error might be flawed or not considering HTTP error statuses adequately.\n\nBased on the issue's description, here are the needed actions:\n\n1. Find where the `linkcheck` command is implemented to understand its workflow.\n2. Identify how Sphinx handles the `linkcheck_anchors` configuration to see how it affects the link checking process.\n3. Locate where Sphinx reports link checking results to see where the incorrect error message is generated.\n\nGiven these points, we will start with the following search API calls:\n\n- Search for classes or methods related to the `linkcheck` command to understand its implementation.\n- Search for how the configuration option `linkcheck_anchors` is used within the code.\n- Search for the error reporting part of the `linkcheck` process to see how it decides what message to output.\n\nHere are the specific API calls that align with our investigation plan:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_method(\"linkcheck\")\nsearch_code(\"linkcheck_anchors\")\nsearch_code(\"broken    https://\")\n``` \n\nThese calls should help us gather the necessary context around how `linkcheck` functions, how it interprets the `linkcheck_anchors` configuration, and how it constructs the error messages for broken links."
