What I can so far do is retrieve the time it takes to fit and score each model:\n```\nimport sklearn.datasets\nimport sklearn.model_selection\nimport sklearn.ensemble\nX, y = sklearn.datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True)\nrs = sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV(\nestimator=sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier(),\nparam_grid={'n_estimators': [2, 3, 4, 5]}\n)\nrs.fit(X, y)\nprint(rs.cv_results_['mean_fit_time'])\nprint(rs.cv_results_['mean_score_time'])\n```\nIn case I run this on a single core, I could time the whole search procedure and subtract the time it took to fit the single folds during hyperparameter optimization. Nevertheless, this isn't possible any more when setting `n_jobs != 1`.\nThus, it would be great to have an attribute `refit_time_` which is simply the time it took to refit the best model.\nUsecase: for [OpenML.org](https://openml.org) we want to support uploading the results of hyperparameter optimization, including the time it takes to do the hyperparameter optimization.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather enough context for resolving the issue mentioned regarding adding a feature to track refit time in scikit-learn's `BaseSearchCV`, I need to first find where the `BaseSearchCV` class and its relevant methods, especially those related to the fitting and refitting process, are defined. Then, we need to see how and where the fitting process, including hyperparameter search and the refit procedure, is handled. The logical starting points for these searches would be:\n\n1. Locate the `BaseSearchCV` class to understand its structure and identify the fitting procedure.\n2. Investigate the `fit` method within `BaseSearchCV` or a related file to see how fitting and refitting are currently implemented.\n\nBased on this, the appropriate API calls to make are:\n\n1. `search_class(\"BaseSearchCV\")` to find in which file the `BaseSearchCV` class is defined.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"BaseSearchCV\")` to locate the `fit` method within the `BaseSearchCV` class to understand how it handles the fitting process and potentially, the refitting step."
