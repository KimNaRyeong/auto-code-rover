        "intended_behavior": "The `post_process` method, when `max_post_process_passes` is set to 0 in a derived class (e.g., `MyManifestStaticFilesStorage`), should interpret this configuration as an instruction to bypass any file adjustments or post-processing activities entirely. This preservation of existing functionality outside the scope of the set condition means:\n\n- Prior to attempting any processing, checks are needed to ascertain the value of `max_post_process_passes`. If it is set to 0, the method should yield control without proceeding with the processing logic, effectively preventing the `UnboundLocalError`.\n  \n- Variables like `hashed_files` and `processed_adjustable_paths`, which are used within the logic of this method, need to be initialized or treated in a manner that their use is consistent with a scenario where no processing occurs. Therefore, if `max_post_process_passes` is 0, initializing them or ensuring they\u2019re not accessed in a way that can lead to errors is crucial.\n\n- The handling of these variables and any loop or condition that requires modification should explicitly account for the scenario of `max_post_process_passes` being 0, implementing a graceful bypass or early exit from the method.\n\n- This change needs to ensure that the absence of processing when `max_post_process_passes` is 0 doesn't lead to side effects affecting the integrity and availability of static files served by Django, preserving the exact behavior of static files serving when `max_post_process_passes` is greater than 0, minus the post-processing.\n\nBy handling `max_post_process_passes` in the specified manner, the method would accommodate the use case intended by setting this parameter to 0, which is to disable post-processing, without causing runtime errors."
