        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the code snippets and considering the issue with `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` crashing when `max_post_process_passes` is set to 0, we can make some assessments and plan a fix.\n\n### Analysis of `ManifestStaticFilesStorage`\nThe search result for `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` indicates that this class inherits from `ManifestFilesMixin` and `StaticFilesStorage`. This inheritance is crucial because it means any method implementation or behavior affecting file storage and post-processing might not be directly within `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` but potentially in one of its parent classes.\n\n### Issue with `post_process` Method\nThe search for the `post_process` method in `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` did not yield a result, which implies that the method is not overridden in `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` but exists in one of its parents or mixins. This leads to the conclusion that the `post_process` method in either `ManifestFilesMixin` or `StaticFilesStorage` and their interaction with `max_post_process_passes` needs to be analyzed to fix the bug.\n\n### Analysis of the Code Snippet from `get_code_around_line` Call\nThe provided code snippet is from the `HashedFilesMixin` class, specifically within the `post_process` method. This method is processing static files, making decisions based on whether files match certain patterns (`_patterns`) and handling them accordingly. The primary operation here involves post-processing files, categorizing them into adjustable and non-adjustable paths, and then processing the adjustable paths. \n\nGiven the issue description:\n- **Intended Behavior**: The intended behavior when `max_post_process_passes` is set to 0 would likely be to bypass any post-processing of files to prevent altering file content (e.g., making urls in CSS files absolute), as mentioned in the linked Django ticket in the issue description. This would involve either skipping the loop entirely or ensuring no post-processing actions are taken on the files.\n- **Actual Behavior**: The crash occurs due to the `substitutions` variable (or a similar construct that was expected in the issue description but might be represented differently in the actual implementation, as seen with variables like `hashed_files` and `processed_adjustable_paths`) being referenced before it's properly initialized or handled when no processing passes are made (due to `max_post_process_passes = 0`).\n\n### Relationship with the Bug\nThe error `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'substitutions' referenced before assignment` suggests that within the post-processing logic, certain variables are not correctly initialized or checked before being accessed, which is a problem when no processing passes (post-processing loops) occurs. This insight should guide us in implementing a fix: ensuring that any variables involved in post-processing are initialized or conditionally accessed in a manner that accounts for the case where `max_post_process_passes` is set to 0.\n\n### Next Steps for Resolution\n1. **Verify Implementation Details**: As the search for `post_process` in `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` did not return a result, exploring the parent classes or mixins for the implementation of `post_process` and its interaction with post-processing passes is necessary. Specifically, we should look into `ManifestFilesMixin` and `StaticFilesStorage` for this implementation.\n   \n2. **Refine Search**: Conducting a search for the `post_process` method in the parent classes (`ManifestFilesMixin` and `StaticFilesStorage`) or continuing to assess the handling of variables like `hashed_files` and `processed_adjustable_paths` to see how they\u2019re initialized and accessed in relation to `max_post_process_passes`.\n\nThese analyses and next steps guide towards implementing a safeguard against `max_post_process_passes = 0` that causes the crash, by ensuring all relevant variables are initialized and conditionally used only when processing passes are to be made."

This preservation of existing functionality outside the scope of the set condition means:\n\n- Prior to attempting any processing, checks are needed to ascertain the value of `max_post_process_passes`. If it is set to 0, the method should yield control without proceeding with the processing logic, effectively preventing the `UnboundLocalError`.\n  \n- Variables like `hashed_files` and `processed_adjustable_paths`, which are used within the logic of this method, need to be initialized or treated in a manner that their use is consistent with a scenario where no processing occurs. Therefore, if `max_post_process_passes` is 0, initializing them or ensuring they\u2019re not accessed in a way that can lead to errors is crucial.\n\n- The handling of these variables and any loop or condition that requires modification should explicitly account for the scenario of `max_post_process_passes` being 0, implementing a graceful bypass or early exit from the method.\n\n- This change needs to ensure that the absence of processing when `max_post_process_passes` is 0 doesn't lead to side effects affecting the integrity and availability of static files served by Django, preserving the exact behavior of static files serving when `max_post_process_passes` is greater than 0, minus the post-processing.\n\nBy handling `max_post_process_passes` in the specified manner, the method would accommodate the use case intended by setting this parameter to 0, which is to disable post-processing, without causing runtime errors."
