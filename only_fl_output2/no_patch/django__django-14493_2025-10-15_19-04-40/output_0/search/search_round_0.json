        "content": "To effectively address the issue described, where setting `max_post_process_passes` to 0 in a custom `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` class results in a crash during `collectstatic`, we need a comprehensive understanding of the implementation and interactions of the `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` class, particularly its `post_process` method. Here are the search API invocations that will help gather the required context:\n\n1. **Search for the `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` class**: This call is intended to get an overview or definition of the class to understand any inheritances or important class variables/methods that could be affecting the issue. \n    - `search_class(\"ManifestStaticFilesStorage\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `post_process` method within the `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` class**: Since the error trace points to this method, we need a detailed look at its implementation to pinpoint where `substitutions` is referenced before assignment.\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"post_process\", \"ManifestStaticFilesStorage\")`\n\n3. **Get the code around the problematic line**: The error message and the issue description indicate that there is a problem with how the `substitutions` variable is handled within a specific code block. Fetching the code segment around the line mentioned in the GitHub link (assuming the line number from the URL `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py#L251` is indicative of the area we\u2019re interested in) will give more context on the local implementation details.\n    - `get_code_around_line(\"django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py\", 251, 10)`\n\nThese API calls will provide a detailed view of the class definition, method implementations, and the specific code structure that leads to the `UnboundLocalError`, all of which are crucial for developing a fix."
