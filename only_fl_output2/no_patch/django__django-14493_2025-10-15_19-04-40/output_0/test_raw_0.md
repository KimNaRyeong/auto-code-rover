Here's a standalone script named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the described issue within a Django environment. To ensure this script runs correctly, ensure your Django project is set up properly and adjust the script as necessary to fit into your project's directory structure if required.

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import sys
from django.core.management import call_command
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand
from django.conf import settings

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class Command(BaseCommand):
    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        try:
            call_command('collectstatic', interactive=False, verbosity=0, clear=True)
            print("Issue not present.")
        except Exception as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            assert isinstance(e, UnboundLocalError), "The script did not raise the correct exception type."
            sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project.settings')
    sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))

    try:
        from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
    except ImportError as exc:
        raise ImportError(
            "Couldn't import Django. Are you sure it's installed and "
            "available on your PYTHONPATH environment variable? Did you "
            "forget to activate a virtual environment?"
        ) from exc

    # Setting up Django
    import django
    django.setup()

    # Dynamically adding the Custom Storage setting
    from django.contrib.staticfiles.storage import ManifestStaticFilesStorage

    class MyManifestStaticFilesStorage(ManifestStaticFilesStorage):
        max_post_process_passes = 0  # Set to 0 to reproduce the issue.

    settings.STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'reproducer.MyManifestStaticFilesStorage'  # Adjust the import path as needed

    # Initiating the command to reproduce the issue
    command = Command()
    command.handle()

```

This python script functions as follows:

1. **Setup**: It imports necessary Django modules and sets up the environment to run Django commands.
2. **Custom Command**: A custom `Command` class is created with a `handle` method that attempts to run `collectstatic` with the `MyManifestStaticFilesStorage` class, where `max_post_process_passes = 0`.
3. **Error Handling**: If the script encounters the described `UnboundLocalError`, it prints the stack trace and exits successfully (since the script's goal is to confirm the error under these conditions).
4. **Adjustments**: Ensure you replace `'your_project.settings'` with the correct path to your Django project's settings.

Before running this script, ensure that:

- Your Django project is correctly set up and configured.
- You have replaced `'your_project.settings'` with the actual path to your project's settings module.
- You have included this `reproducer.py` script in the appropriate location in your Django project so that the Django environment can be correctly initialized and the settings can be effectively overridden.

To run the script, execute `python3 reproducer.py` from your terminal. Remember, this script will execute the `collectstatic` command, which might modify or overwrite static files in your project's designated static files directory.
