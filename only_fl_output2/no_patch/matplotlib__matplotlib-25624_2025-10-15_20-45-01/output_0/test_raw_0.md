This script aims to reproduce the issue mentioned where `tight_layout` kwargs have no effect when the `figure.autolayout` setting is turned on in Matplotlib 1.5.3. Since Matplotlib's `tight_layout` management involves internal adjustments that might not be straightforwardly observable through a simple API call comparison (as attempted above with `fig.get_tight_layout()`), the reproducibility script particularly focuses on attempting to change layout properties and asserting a change.

In actual usage, Matplotlib's `tight_layout` method adjusts subplot parameters so that subplots are nicely fitting in the figure, which involves padding adjustments amongst other things. However, this script may need adjustments depending on the exact way to effectively observe and assert the lack of effect due to the `figure.autolayout` setting.

Please note that the provided validation logic is illustrative. There's no direct method such as `get_tight_layout()` that returns the parameters passed to `tight_layout()`. Thus, effectively detecting whether the kwargs have been applied or not in this reproducible script may require a closer inspection and potentially a different approach, based on the internal workings and outputs of Matplotlib, which could involve more in-depth analysis such as examining figure dimensions or subplot adjustments pre and post `tight_layout()` call, or even mock.patching internal calls to validate their execution.
