Since \"autodoc_docstring_signature\" likely pertains to a feature or method that handles docstrings for documentation purposes, and considering the nature of the issue revolves around overloaded methods in SWIG-wrapped C++ classes for Python, we should focus on related areas. Here are the next steps in our approach:\n\n1. **Search for Related Autodoc or Documentation Handling Features**: Since `autodoc_docstring_signature` was not found, it's possible that the actual implementation might be under a slightly different name, or part of a larger module responsible for autodocumentation.\n   \n2. **Search for SWIG Integration**: Given SWIG's role in wrapping C++ for Python, identifying how the project integrates or utilizes SWIG might reveal how overloaded methods are documented or intended to be.\n\n3. **Examine How Docstrings are Parsed or Handled**: Since the issue is related to docstrings, locating the part of the project that parses or handles docstrings might provide insight. This could be in the vicinity of where documentation is generated from source code comments.\n\nBased on the revised strategy, let's proceed with the following API calls to get more context:\n\n1. `search_code(\"autodoc\")`: Since the direct search for `autodoc_docstring_signature` returned no results, searching for \"autodoc\" might help us find relevant modules or methods related to automatic documentation generation.\n\n2. `search_code(\"SWIG\")`: This will help us understand how SWIG is used within the project, which could be closely related to how overloaded methods are documented or supposed to be.\n\n3. `search_code(\"docstring\")`: This broader search is to find how docstrings are generally handled in the project, which could lead us to the subsystem responsible for parsing and utilizing them, especially in the context of documentation."

The absence of direct references to SWIG suggests that specific integration points for SWIG with this documentation process might not be explicitly named or handled differently than initially presumed.\n\n### Analyzing the Context\n\n#### 1. Autodoc-Related Files:\n\n- **sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py** (100 matches): Likely a central part of the autodoc functionality, containing core logic for automatic documentation generation. Here, we would expect to find implementations responsible for parsing and interpreting docstrings, including handling of method signatures.\n  \n- **sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py** and **sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py**: These files are part of the Sphinx Napoleon extension, which supports Google and NumPy style docstrings. Given the high number of matches, it's possible they also include mechanisms for handling overloaded method signatures in these specific docstring styles.\n\n- **sphinx/util/docstrings.py**: Given the name, this utility file is likely key to parsing, cleaning, or interpreting docstrings across the documentation process.\n\n#### 2. Relationship with the Bug:\n\nThe issue describes a limitation in documenting overloaded methods\u2014specifically, that only the first method signature in a docstring is picked up by the autodoc system. From the identified files, `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` and `sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py` seem like critical points where enhancements can be made to capture all overloaded method signatures within documented docstrings.\n\n#### 3. Intended Behavior:\n\n- **sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py**: This file should be enhanced to iteratively parse each method signature in a docstring, rather than stopping at the first encounter. The intended behavior would involve collecting all signatures corresponding to overloaded methods and ensuring they are correctly reflected in the generated documentation.\n\n- **sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py**: If the handling of overloaded methods' signatures is also influenced by docstring style parsing (like Google or NumPy styles), adjustments may be needed here to accommodate the comprehensive documenting of overloaded methods within such styles.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo address the issue, the focus should be on modifying the autodoc and possibly Napoleon subsystems to support recognizing and documenting all overloaded method signatures found in a single docstring. This involves examining how these systems currently parse docstrings for method signatures and extending their logic to handle multiple signatures without disregarding or overwriting the documentation for overloaded methods.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nTo move forward effectively, diving into the codes of `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` and `sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py` specifically would be prudent, looking at the docstring parsing and handling processes to identify where enhancements can be made to support the full documentation of overloaded methods."

The modified code should ensure that each overloaded method signature is identified, parsed, and included in the generated documentation, rather than only recognizing the first signature. This enhancement should preserve the existing functionality of handling single-method docstrings while extending support for overloaded method signatures.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py\n  - **Intended Behavior:** If this file contributes to the handling of specific docstring styles (e.g., Google or NumPy), the parsing logic here may require adjustments to similarly accommodate and correctly interpret multiple overloaded method signatures within a single docstring. The adjustment would ensure that the Napoleon extension does not overlook additional signatures after the first, aligning with the enhanced behavior in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` to support a comprehensive documentation process for overloaded methods."
