Since \"autodoc_docstring_signature\" likely pertains to a feature or method that handles docstrings for documentation purposes, and considering the nature of the issue revolves around overloaded methods in SWIG-wrapped C++ classes for Python, we should focus on related areas. Here are the next steps in our approach:\n\n1. **Search for Related Autodoc or Documentation Handling Features**: Since `autodoc_docstring_signature` was not found, it's possible that the actual implementation might be under a slightly different name, or part of a larger module responsible for autodocumentation.\n   \n2. **Search for SWIG Integration**: Given SWIG's role in wrapping C++ for Python, identifying how the project integrates or utilizes SWIG might reveal how overloaded methods are documented or intended to be.\n\n3. **Examine How Docstrings are Parsed or Handled**: Since the issue is related to docstrings, locating the part of the project that parses or handles docstrings might provide insight. This could be in the vicinity of where documentation is generated from source code comments.\n\nBased on the revised strategy, let's proceed with the following API calls to get more context:\n\n1. `search_code(\"autodoc\")`: Since the direct search for `autodoc_docstring_signature` returned no results, searching for \"autodoc\" might help us find relevant modules or methods related to automatic documentation generation.\n\n2. `search_code(\"SWIG\")`: This will help us understand how SWIG is used within the project, which could be closely related to how overloaded methods are documented or supposed to be.\n\n3. `search_code(\"docstring\")`: This broader search is to find how docstrings are generally handled in the project, which could lead us to the subsystem responsible for parsing and utilizing them, especially in the context of documentation."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.
