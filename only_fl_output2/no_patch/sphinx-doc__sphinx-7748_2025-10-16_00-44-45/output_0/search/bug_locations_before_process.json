The modified code should ensure that each overloaded method signature is identified, parsed, and included in the generated documentation, rather than only recognizing the first signature. This enhancement should preserve the existing functionality of handling single-method docstrings while extending support for overloaded method signatures."

The adjustment would ensure that the Napoleon extension does not overlook additional signatures after the first, aligning with the enhanced behavior in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` to support a comprehensive documentation process for overloaded methods."
