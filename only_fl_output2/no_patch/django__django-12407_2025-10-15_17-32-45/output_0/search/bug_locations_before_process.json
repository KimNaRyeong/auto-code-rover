        "intended_behavior": "This method should be modified to utilize `select_template` when the variable resolved from the context is an iterable of template names. This modification should preserve the existing functionality when a single template name (string) is provided. However, when provided an iterable of template names, it should attempt to render the first successfully loaded template, thus implementing the fallback logic described in the issue. The specific change involves checking if the resolved `template` variable is an iterable and, if so, using `select_template` instead of `get_template`. Care should be taken to ensure that other aspects of the `render` method, such as caching and handling of the isolated context, remain intact and operate correctly under this new logic."
