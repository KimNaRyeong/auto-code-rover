        "content": "To begin addressing the issue of deprecating `Model.Meta.index_together` in favor of `Model.Meta.indexes`, we need to collect as much information and context about where and how `index_together` and `indexes` are currently being used within the codebase. This will involve looking into model definitions where these configurations are specified, and any code that might specifically handle or interpret these Meta options.\n\nGiven the described APIs, here are the actions we will take:\n\n1. **Search for any model class definitions that use `index_together`**: Since `index_together` is defined within a model's `Meta` class, we first need to find any models that make use of `index_together`. We can do this by searching the entire codebase for the string `\"index_together\"` within model definitions.\n\n2. **Search for any model class definitions that use `indexes`**: Similarly, we will look for any instances of `\"indexes\"` within model `Meta` classes to see how the `indexes` option is currently being used. This will help us understand the transition needed.\n\n3. **Look for documentation or comments about `index_together` or `indexes`**: It could be helpful to find any developer documentation or comments within the code that discuss the use of `index_together` or `indexes`. This might give us insight into the usage patterns and any potential caveats of moving from one to the other.\n\n4. **Search for methods that specifically handle `index_together`**: There may be methods in the codebase designed to interpret or deal with `index_together` settings. Identifying these will be key to understanding the scope of changes needed.\n\n5. **Search for methods that specifically handle `indexes`**: Similarly, finding methods that handle `indexes` will show us the existing mechanisms for dealing with indexes and what might need to be adapted or extended for full transition.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are the specific API calls I'd like to make:\n\n- `search_code(\"index_together =\")`: to find models that use `index_together`.\n- `search_code(\"indexes =\")`: to locate models that implement `indexes`.\n- `search_code(\"class Meta:\")`: to get a broad view of what's happening in model Meta classes, which might indirectly show us how `index_together` and `indexes` are being documented or discussed.\n- `search_method(\"index_together\")`: Given that `index_together` is a property/attribute, not a method, this might not return results, but if any custom method or utility function is named after this attribute for handling it, this could find it.\n- `search_method(\"indexes\")`: Again, since `indexes` are part of the model's Meta class definition and not a method, this call is speculative but aims to catch any utility methods related to indexes.\n\nThese calls will provide a foundational understanding of the current state of `index_together` and `indexes` within the codebase, and identify key areas that will be impacted by the deprecation and migration process."
