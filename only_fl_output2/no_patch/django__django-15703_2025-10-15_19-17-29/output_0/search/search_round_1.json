This will involve looking into model definitions where these configurations are specified, and any code that might specifically handle or interpret these Meta options.\n\nGiven the described APIs, here are the actions we will take:\n\n1. **Search for any model class definitions that use `index_together`**: Since `index_together` is defined within a model's `Meta` class, we first need to find any models that make use of `index_together`. We can do this by searching the entire codebase for the string `\"index_together\"` within model definitions.\n\n2. **Search for any model class definitions that use `indexes`**: Similarly, we will look for any instances of `\"indexes\"` within model `Meta` classes to see how the `indexes` option is currently being used. This will help us understand the transition needed.\n\n3. **Look for documentation or comments about `index_together` or `indexes`**: It could be helpful to find any developer documentation or comments within the code that discuss the use of `index_together` or `indexes`. This might give us insight into the usage patterns and any potential caveats of moving from one to the other.\n\n4. **Search for methods that specifically handle `index_together`**: There may be methods in the codebase designed to interpret or deal with `index_together` settings. Identifying these will be key to understanding the scope of changes needed.\n\n5. **Search for methods that specifically handle `indexes`**: Similarly, finding methods that handle `indexes` will show us the existing mechanisms for dealing with indexes and what might need to be adapted or extended for full transition.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are the specific API calls I'd like to make:\n\n- `search_code(\"index_together =\")`: to find models that use `index_together`.\n- `search_code(\"indexes =\")`: to locate models that implement `indexes`.\n- `search_code(\"class Meta:\")`: to get a broad view of what's happening in model Meta classes, which might indirectly show us how `index_together` and `indexes` are being documented or discussed.\n- `search_method(\"index_together\")`: Given that `index_together` is a property/attribute, not a method, this might not return results, but if any custom method or utility function is named after this attribute for handling it, this could find it.\n- `search_method(\"indexes\")`: Again, since `indexes` are part of the model's Meta class definition and not a method, this call is speculative but aims to catch any utility methods related to indexes.\n\nThese calls will provide a foundational understanding of the current state of `index_together` and `indexes` within the codebase, and identify key areas that will be impacted by the deprecation and migration process."

        "content": "With the information gathered from the search results, let's analyze the context regarding the use of `index_together` and `indexes` in the Django codebase, as well as where the `Meta` class definitions are being utilized. This analysis will help us understand the current implementation and the steps needed to deprecate `index_together` in favor of `indexes`.\n\n### Analysis of `index_together` Usage\n- **Found in**: `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py`, `django/db/models/options.py`.\n- **Purpose & Relationship with the Issue**: These locations suggest that `index_together` is handled during database schema creation and migration processes. Specifically, it's used to detect changes in models (in migrations) and to apply those changes to the SQLite3 backend. The `django/db/models/options.py` appearance likely relates to the internal API Django uses to parse and represent model options, including indexing.\n- **Intended Behavior Post-issue**: The presence of `index_together` in these files points to areas of the Django ORM (Object Relational Mapping) that need modifications to either interpret `indexes` in the same way `index_together` is currently used or to fully replace and deprecate the `index_together` functionality. This means altering the way Django handles automatic index creation based on model Meta options, ensuring that any function currently relying on `index_together` is adapted to work with `indexes` moving forward.\n\n### Analysis of `indexes` Usage\n- **Found in**: Multiple files across different backends (`django/db/backends/*`), migrations (`django/db/migrations/*`), and more.\n- **Purpose & Relationship with the Issue**: The widespread use of `indexes` across different database backends and the migration system indicates that Django already has a robust system for handling explicit index creation and management through the `indexes` option. This is directly relevant to the issue, as it demonstrates the areas of the codebase that already support or could be expanded to fully adopt `indexes` as the preferred method for index definition, moving away from `index_together`.\n- **Intended Behavior Post-issue**: The locations and contexts where `indexes` is used should become the primary (or sole) method of defining indexes in model Meta classes, handling everything `index_together` did but with more explicitly defined Index objects which offer greater flexibility and functionality.\n\n### Meta Class Usages\n- **Found in**: Various models across Django contrib apps and core components.\n- **Purpose & Relationship with the Issue**: The `Meta` class in Django models is where `index_together` and `indexes` are defined among other options. The presence of `Meta` class across a wide range of models in the contrib and core apps shows just how commonly these indexing configurations may be used throughout a Django project.\n- **Intended Behavior Post-issue**: These model definitions give context to where changes might need to be made in documentation, example code, or migrations to encourage or enforce the migration from `index_together` to `indexes`. Each instance of a `Meta` class could potentially be a place to update code examples or documentation to reflect the preferred use of `indexes`.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\nConsidering the analysis given above, additional steps in our investigation should include:\n1. **Detailed examination of how `index_together` and `indexes` are implemented and used**: This could involve looking into the specific code blocks within `django/db/models/options.py`, `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, and backends to understand precisely how `index_together` settings are processed and how `indexes` might be leveraged to achieve the same or improved outcomes.\n2. **Reviewing usage examples and documentation comments**: Since our method searches for `index_together` and `indexes` returned no results, but we have identified files that likely contain relevant code, more targeted searches or direct file review may be necessary to understand specific implementations or to find implementation comments and documentation.\n3. **Examining migration patterns**: Given the presence of `index_together` and `indexes` in migration-related code, reviewing how Django transitions model index definitions during migrations might shed light on how to streamline the deprecation process of `index_together`.\n\nIn short, the immediate next steps involve a more granular review of the identified files and sections, particularly focusing on migration mechanics and the schema generation process to outline a clear path to deprecating `index_together`."

        "content": "1. \n\n2. **Bug Locations and Intended Behavior**\n\n- **Bug Location 1**\n  - **File**: `django/db/models/options.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: This file is where Django models\u2019 options are parsed and processed. The intended adjustment here is to either extend the current handling of `index_together` to ensure deprecation warnings are presented when it is used, signaling to developers to use `indexes` instead, or to transform `index_together` configurations into `indexes` within the Django ORM framework automatically. It should preserve the ability for Django to interpret model indexes for database schema creation and migrations without losing any existing functionalities or performance benefits.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**\n  - **File**: `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: The automatic migration detection for model changes related to indexing should fully support `indexes` as the primary method for specifying indexes going forward. The intended behavior here is to deprecate the use of `index_together` in the migration autodetector logic by either warning users about its deprecation or automatically converting `index_together` definitions into `indexes`. The autodetection of index changes should continue to function seamlessly, detecting when indexes are added, removed, or altered and generating the appropriate migration files without manual intervention.\n\n- **Bug Location 3**\n  - **File**: `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: The SQLite backend's schema modification and creation logic need to be adjusted to prioritize `indexes` over `index_together`, ensuring that any SQL generated for index management is done through the explicit index objects provided via `indexes`. It should continue to allow Django to manage SQLite3 database schemas effectively, translating model index configurations into the correct SQL statements for index creation, deletion, and alteration, accommodating all features supported by the `indexes` option (such as expressions, conditionals, and name specification).\n\n**Summary for Resolution**: Each identified bug location points to a part of the Django framework that must adapt to the changed preference from `index_together` to `indexes`. The resolution involves ensuring these parts of Django can deprecate `index_together` gracefully while fully supporting and leveraging the more powerful and flexible `indexes` for all model indexing needs. This transition must be seamless for the end-users, preserving backward compatibility where necessary through deprecation warnings, and leading to cleaner, more explicit index definitions in Django models."
