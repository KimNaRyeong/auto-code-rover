The intended adjustment here is to either extend the current handling of `index_together` to ensure deprecation warnings are presented when it is used, signaling to developers to use `indexes` instead, or to transform `index_together` configurations into `indexes` within the Django ORM framework automatically. It should preserve the ability for Django to interpret model indexes for database schema creation and migrations without losing any existing functionalities or performance benefits."

The intended behavior here is to deprecate the use of `index_together` in the migration autodetector logic by either warning users about its deprecation or automatically converting `index_together` definitions into `indexes`. The autodetection of index changes should continue to function seamlessly, detecting when indexes are added, removed, or altered and generating the appropriate migration files without manual intervention."

It should continue to allow Django to manage SQLite3 database schemas effectively, translating model index configurations into the correct SQL statements for index creation, deletion, and alteration, accommodating all features supported by the `indexes` option (such as expressions, conditionals, and name specification)."
