        "intended_behavior": "The implementation of 'tripcolor' should ensure that the 'clim' argument, composed of 'vmin' and 'vmax', directly influences the normalization of color mapping as intended by the caller. This means when 'vmin' and 'vmax' are provided, these parameters should be used to set the limits of the color scale effectively, ensuring that the color mapping reflects the range specified by the user. The existing functionality to automatically handle normalization based on 'vmin', 'vmax', and 'norm' should be preserved, but with added assurance that 'vmin' and 'vmax' do not get ignored. This could involve verifying the correct passage of these parameters to '_scale_norm' and ensuring their values are accurately reflected in the final plot. The objective here is to correct the handling so that if 'vmin' and 'vmax' are provided (either directly or through 'clim'), the color range of the plot accurately represents this specified range."

        "intended_behavior": "While '_scale_norm' correctly identifies the precedence of 'norm' over 'vmin' and 'vmax', the method must ensure when 'vmin' and 'vmax' are provided (without specifying 'norm'), these parameters effectively constrain the color limits as intended. The method already aims to set color limits based on 'vmin' and 'vmax' or adjust according to 'norm'. However, the presence of the bug indicates a possible flaw in this logic or its integration with 'tripcolor'. The intended behavior here is to tightly integrate '_scale_norm' functionality with 'tripcolor', making sure that color limiting (scaling) respects 'vmin' and 'vmax' boundaries directly specified by the user, thereby addressing the issue where 'clim' appears to be disregarded."
