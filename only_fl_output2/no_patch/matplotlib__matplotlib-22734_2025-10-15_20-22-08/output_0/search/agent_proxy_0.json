The user has pointed out that handling of keyword arguments (`kwargs`) should occur further down in the implementation of `tripcolor`, specifically just before calling `_scale_norm`. Based on this, we need to:\n\n1. Locate the implementation of the `tripcolor` function to understand its current handling of the `clim` argument and other `kwargs`.\n2. Identify where `_scale_norm` is called within `tripcolor` or related processing to understand how `clim` should be integrated with this part of the code.\n\nWe will use the search APIs to find this information:\n\n- Use `search_method(\"tripcolor\")` to find where the `tripcolor` method is implemented.\n- Since the user suggests the interaction with `_scale_norm` is important, we should also find where this method is defined or used with `search_method(\"_scale_norm\")`.\n\nLet's proceed with these search API calls:\n\n- search_method(\"tripcolor\")\n- search_method(\"_scale_norm\")"
