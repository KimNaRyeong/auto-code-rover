Acknowledging the need to accurately reproduce the issue while correcting the mistake identified in the previous attempt, I present a revised version of `reproducer.py`. This script is intended to address the reported bug effectively by cross-verifying whether the color limits are indeed ignored by `tripcolor` and using the correct approach to assess the color limits from the plot. 

The corrected script now properly retrieves the color limits not from the `Colorbar` object directly (which doesn't have a `get_clim` method, leading to an `AttributeError`), but rather from the `ScalarMappable` object that the colorbar is associated with (i.e., the object returned by `tripcolor`), which correctly supports querying the color limits.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_color_limits(tripcolor_obj, expected_min, expected_max):
    """
    Checks if the color limits of the tripcolor plot match the expected values.
    """
    vmin, vmax = tripcolor_obj.get_clim()
    if vmin < expected_min or vmax > expected_max:
        raise AssertionError(f"Color limits are incorrect. Expected limits between {expected_min} and {expected_max}, got {vmin} to {vmax}.")

def main():
    try:
        x = np.random.rand(100)
        y = np.random.rand(100)
        z = np.random.rand(100)
        tripcolor_obj = plt.tripcolor(x, y, z, clim=(0, 0.5))
        plt.colorbar()
        check_color_limits(tripcolor_obj, 0, 0.5)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate an error if the issue is present
    else:
        print("No issue detected, exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

With this corrected approach, the script will raise an `AssertionError` if the color limits defined by `clim` within the `plt.tripcolor` call are not respected, aimed at accurately reflecting whether the color limits are correctly applied or ignored. If the issue is present, an error will occur, and its detailed stack trace will be printed as before. Otherwise, the script will confirm the absence of an issue and exit gracefully with code 0.
