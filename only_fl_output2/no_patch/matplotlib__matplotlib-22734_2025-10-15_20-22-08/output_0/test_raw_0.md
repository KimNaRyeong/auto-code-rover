Below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue described. If the issue exists (i.e., `tripcolor` is ignoring `clim`), the script will raise an `AssertionError` showcasing that the color mapping does not adhere to the expected range of 0 to 0.5. This is asserted by checking the limits of the colorbar attached to the plot. If the issue is fixed, the script will exit with code 0 and not raise an error.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_color_limits(cbar, expected_min, expected_max):
    """
    Checks if the color limits of the colorbar match the expected values.
    """
    vmin, vmax = cbar.get_clim()
    if not (expected_min <= vmin <= expected_max) or not (expected_min <= vmax <= expected_max):
        raise AssertionError(f"Color limits are incorrect. Expected limits between {expected_min} and {expected_max}, got {vmin} to {vmax}.")

def main():
    try:
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        c = plt.tripcolor(np.random.rand(100), np.random.rand(100), np.random.rand(100), clim=(0, 0.5))
        cbar = plt.colorbar(c)
        check_color_limits(cbar, 0, 0.5)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate an error if the issue is present
    else:
        print("No issue detected, exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please execute this script in the root directory of your project by running `python3 reproducer.py`. The script utilizes the provided function `print_stacktrace` to display the stack trace clearly if an exception is thrown. It ensures that error visibility aligns with the expectations for debugging and verifying the presence of the issue.
