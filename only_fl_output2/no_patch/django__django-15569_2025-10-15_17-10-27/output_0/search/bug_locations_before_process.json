        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, this method should not only remove the lookup from `class_lookups` but also ensure that any cache associated with the lookups is cleared to maintain state consistency across the application. Specifically, after successfully removing a lookup (as done in line 219), the method `_clear_cached_lookups()` should be called, mirroring the behavior in `register_lookup`. This change ensures that when a lookup is unregistered, all cached instances of the lookups are invalidated, thereby preserving the integrity and consistency of lookup operations within Django models."
