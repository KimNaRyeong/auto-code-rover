Corresponding to this change, minor changes need to be brought in the schema.tests.SchemaTests.test_func_unique_constraint_lookups test.\nThe PR generated is \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/15569\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather adequate context for resolving the issue related to the `_unregister_lookup()` method and its impact on the caching mechanism and tests, the following search API calls are necessary:\n\n1. Retrieve the specific implementation details of the `_unregister_lookup()` method within the file mentioned in the issue:\n   ```\n   search_method_in_file(\"_unregister_lookup\", \"django/db/models/query_utils.py\")\n   ```\n\n2. Obtain the implementation details of the `register_lookup()` method to understand the existing caching logic to compare and potentially replicate for unregistration:\n   ```\n   search_method_in_file(\"register_lookup\", \"django/db/models/query_utils.py\")\n   ```\n\n3. Retrieve the code context around the `cache_clear()` call within the `register_lookup()` to understand how cache is currently being cleared:\n   ```\n   search_code_in_file(\"cache_clear()\", \"django/db/models/query_utils.py\")\n   ```\n\n4. Find the implementation details of the test `test_func_unique_constraint_lookups` to determine what changes might be needed in response to modifying the `_unregister_lookup()` method:\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"test_func_unique_constraint_lookups\", \"SchemaTests\")\n   ```\n\n5. To understand how `SchemaTests` is structured and to make sure we're modifying the right test case, search for the `SchemaTests` class within its test file:\n   ```\n   search_class_in_file(\"SchemaTests\", \"tests/schema/tests.py\")\n   ```\n\nThese calls will provide comprehensive insights into the related codebase, ensuring we have all the necessary context to effectively address the reported issue with the `_unregister_lookup` method and its associated test case modifications."
