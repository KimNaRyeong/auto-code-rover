Given the previous feedback and clarification on the desired outcome, let's focus on constructing a `reproducer.py` that specifically addresses the assertion failures based on the mentioned scenarios. This new version incorporates more explicit checks and uses the provided mechanism for printing stack trace effectively.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import symbols, polylog, log, pi, Rational, expand_func, diff, nsimplify, exp_polar

    # Issue 1: Evaluation for polylog
    try:
        result = polylog(2, Rational(1, 2)).expand(func=True)
        expected = -log(2)**2 / 2 + pi**2 / 12
        # Simplifying the expected result for direct comparison, introducing nsimplify for pi and log.
        assert nsimplify(result - expected) == 0, "Polylog(2, 1/2) expansion or simplification incorrect."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

    # Issue 2: expansion of polylog(1, z) with exp_polar
    z = symbols('z')
    try:
        expanded_expression = expand_func(polylog(1, z))
        # Verify if exp_polar(...) appears unexpectedly.
        assert not expanded_expression.has(exp_polar), "Unexpected exp_polar in the expansion of polylog(1, z)."

        # Verifying the differentiation aspect as mentioned.
        diff_check = diff(polylog(1, z) - expanded_expression, z)
        # Simplifying the difference to ensure no unexpected term remains.
        assert diff_check.simplify() == 0, "Derivative changes upon expanding polylog(1, z), indicating an inconsistence."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This updated script focuses on:
1. Evaluating the polylogarithm function for a specific case and comparing its result with the expected value.
2. Examining the output of `expand_func` on `polylog(1, z)` for the presence of `exp_polar` and assessing if the operation affects the derivative in an unexpected manner.

The script is designed to highlight issues by raising an `AssertionError` and printing a stack trace for easier debugging and verification of fixes.
