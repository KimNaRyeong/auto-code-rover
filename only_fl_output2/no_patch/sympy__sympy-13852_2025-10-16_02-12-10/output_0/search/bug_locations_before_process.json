        "intended_behavior": "This method should handle the expansion of `polylog(s, z)` expressions in a way that respects mathematical identities without introducing unnecessary complexity. Specifically, when `s == 1`, the method currently returns `-log(1 + exp_polar(-I*pi)*z)`, which leads to the issue reported. The intended behavior is to simplify this expression directly to `-log(1-z)` for `s == 1`, eliminating the redundant `exp_polar(-I*pi)` term. This change should be applied keeping in mind the preservation of mathematical correctness across different regions of the complex plane, ensuring that the simplification does not affect the function's behavior near its branch cuts or in cases where complex analysis specifics are crucial. Adjusting this behavior will address the reported issue by providing a simplified and expected outcome for `expand_func(polylog(1, z))`, directly aligning with the mathematical identity `polylog(1, z) = -log(1-z)` for applicable domains of `z`."
