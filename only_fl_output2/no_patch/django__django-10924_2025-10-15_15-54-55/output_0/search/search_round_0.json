Seeing as the place where these files are stored is different on different machines I have the following:\nimport os\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nclass LocalFiles(models.Model):\nname = models.CharField(max_length=255)\nfile = models.FilePathField(path=os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir'))\nNow when running manage.py makemigrations it will resolve the path based on the machine it is being run on. Eg: /home/<username>/server_files/example_dir\nI had to manually change the migration to include the os.path.join() part to not break this when running the migration on production/other machine.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue of allowing the `FilePathField` path to accept a callable, we can perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the `FilePathField` class definition:** Since the issue involves modifying the behavior of `FilePathField` to accept a callable for its `path` attribute, we need to first locate this class within the Django framework to understand its current implementation and constraints.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"FilePathField\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the method that handles the assignment to the `path` attribute in `FilePathField`:** To understand how the `path` attribute of `FilePathField` is currently processed and to find the ideal place to introduce the capability to handle a callable, we need to look at the methods within the `FilePathField` class. However, without knowing the exact method names, we might start by looking for any setter or initializer methods that deal with the attributes.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"init\", \"FilePathField\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"__set__\", \"FilePathField\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for any relevant code snippets using `FilePathField` with a static path:** Understanding how `FilePathField` is currently used with static paths in models can provide insight into how developers expect to use it with dynamic or callable paths. This could help in designing an intuitive API.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"models.FilePathField(path=\")\n   ```\n\nThese calls will provide a foundational understanding of how `FilePathField` is implemented and how its `path` attribute is currently being handled. With this information, we can proceed to design a modification that allows the path to accept a callable, taking into account backward compatibility and Django's design principles."
