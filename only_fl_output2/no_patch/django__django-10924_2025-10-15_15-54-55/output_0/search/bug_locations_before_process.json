If a callable is provided, it should be executed to obtain the path string whenever the field's path is accessed, instead of storing it as a static value. This change must ensure that if a callable is provided, it is called at the right time (e.g., right before generating forms or making migrations) to fetch the dynamic path. The implementation should maintain backward compatibility with existing usage where a string is passed."

        "intended_behavior": "Implement or modify methods beyond `__init__` within `FilePathField` to check if `self.path` is a callable before using it. This might involve creating a new method, such as `get_path(self)`, which would encapsulate the logic to check whether `self.path` is a callable or a string and return the appropriate value. This method would be used internally wherever `self.path` is accessed. This ensures that `self.path` can dynamically adapt based on the environment without breaking existing functionality."
