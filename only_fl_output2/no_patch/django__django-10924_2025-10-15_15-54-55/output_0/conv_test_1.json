Seeing as the place where these files are stored is different on different machines I have the following:\nimport os\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nclass LocalFiles(models.Model):\n\tname = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n\tfile = models.FilePathField(path=os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir'))\nNow when running manage.py makemigrations it will resolve the path based on the machine it is being run on. Eg: /home/<username>/server_files/example_dir\nI had to manually change the migration to include the os.path.join() part to not break this when running the migration on production/other machine.\n"

In `tests_app/models.py`, it creates a model `LocalFiles` including a `FilePathField` where the `path` argument is generated using `os.path.join()`, simulating the issue's scenario.\n3. It attempts to run the Django `makemigrations` command in a dry-run mode specifically for `tests_app` to see if the `FilePathField`'s path resolution causes any problems.\n4. If an error occurs (indicating the issue is present), it will print the stack trace using the `print_stacktrace` function to clearly show where the problem happened.\n5. The script exits with code 0 if the issue is fixed (i.e., if no exception is caught) and raises an `AssertionError` if the problem persists, indicating that the issue is present.\n\nRemember, this script assumes a Linux-like environment with Python and Django installed. Before running it, you would need to have Django installed and potentially adjust paths or setup specifics based on your actual Django project layout or environment."
