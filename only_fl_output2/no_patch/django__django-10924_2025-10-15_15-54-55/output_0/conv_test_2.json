Seeing as the place where these files are stored is different on different machines I have the following:\nimport os\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nclass LocalFiles(models.Model):\n\tname = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n\tfile = models.FilePathField(path=os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir'))\nNow when running manage.py makemigrations it will resolve the path based on the machine it is being run on. Eg: /home/<username>/server_files/example_dir\nI had to manually change the migration to include the os.path.join() part to not break this when running the migration on production/other machine.\n"

Additionally, it employs a corrected flow for setting up Django, including importing and setting up Django settings correctly, which should allow the script to reproduce the issue or confirm its resolution accurately.\n\nThe script attempts to create a Django model `LocalFiles` that uses a `FilePathField` with a dynamic path, set by combining a base directory from Django settings and a subdirectory. This matches the use case described in your issue, attempting to dynamically set file paths per-development or deployment environment. The expectation is for this construct to potentially expose the issue with `makemigrations` regarding resolvable or callable paths for file storage.\n\nEnsure Django is installed in your environment (`pip install Django`) and run the script from the root of a suitably structured Django project. If not within a Django project or if the Django installation is missing, this script will not run as intended."
