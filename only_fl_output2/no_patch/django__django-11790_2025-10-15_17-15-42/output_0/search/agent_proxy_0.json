To track down where the issue stems from, it's crucial to examine the `AuthenticationForm` class where the issue is reported. For that, we should look for the class definition and any recent changes related to the username field's rendering behavior.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"AuthenticationForm\")\n   ```\n\n2. Given the specific nature of the regression surrounding an HTML attribute, investigating any method within `AuthenticationForm` that deals with rendering fields or setting attributes would be prudent. This search might help identify methods where the `maxlength` attribute should be set.\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"render\", \"AuthenticationForm\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"AuthenticationForm\")\n   ```\n\n3. Since the regression was identified in a specific commit (`5ceaf14686ce626404afb6a5fbd3d8286410bf13`), locating any mentions of `maxlength` in code changes could highlight exactly what was altered concerning the username field in that timeframe.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"maxlength\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls will provide a robust starting point for diagnosing the issue with the `AuthenticationForm`'s username field and understanding the regression's nature to devise a fix."
