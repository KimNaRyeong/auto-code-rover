        "intended_behavior": "The `predict` method should ensure that its class predictions are consistent with the outcomes derived from the highest scores of the `decision_function`, specifically when `decision_function_shape=\"ovr\"` is used. This would likely involve implementing or utilizing a tie-breaking mechanism within `predict` itself or ensuring that it correctly interprets the outcomes of `decision_function` in a way that respects this method's tie-breaking logic. The existing functionality of accurately predicting classes based on the learned models should be preserved, but enhanced to ensure that in the event of score ties, the `predict` method's output remains consistent with the argmax of `decision_function`."

        "intended_behavior": "While `decision_function` might already include tie-breaking logic as suggested by its nature and the mention of ties in related contexts, it is important to review and ensure this method's implementation (or its description/documentation) clearly aligns with how ties are handled. If tie-breaking is indeed part of `decision_function`'s responsibility, it should be documented transparently, and its logic should be as straightforward as possible to predict or line up with how `predict` interprets its outputs. The method should continue to provide decision scores for each class in multi-class scenarios, doing so in a manner that transparently supports or allows for consistent tie-breaking in `predict`."
