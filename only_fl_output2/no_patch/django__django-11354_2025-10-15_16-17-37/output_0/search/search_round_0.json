Query.get_aggregation method drops INNER JOIN required to select the title field. Specifically, this code drops it:\nif not inner_query.distinct:\n# If the inner query uses default select and it has some\n# aggregate annotations, then we must make sure the inner\n# query is grouped by the main model's primary key. However,\n# clearing the select clause can alter results if distinct is\n# used.\nif inner_query.default_cols and has_existing_annotations:\ninner_query.group_by = [self.model._meta.pk.get_col(inner_query.get_initial_alias())]\ninner_query.default_cols = False\nCode is taken from Django 1.8 but 1.11 looks the same.\ndefault_cols is set to False and the INNER JOIN is dropped. Quick fix is to add a condition for setting default_cols to False:\nif not inner_query.distinct:\n# If the inner query uses default select and it has some\n# aggregate annotations, then we must make sure the inner\n# query is grouped by the main model's primary key. However,\n# clearing the select clause can alter results if distinct is\n# used.\nif inner_query.default_cols and has_existing_annotations:\ninner_query.group_by = [self.model._meta.pk.get_col(inner_query.get_initial_alias())]\nif not has_existing_annotations:\ninner_query.default_cols = False\nI don't know if it could be done in a nicer way. I was able to reproduce this in 1.8.18 and 1.11.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, we need to first understand the structure and the whereabouts of the involved code snippets. The bug description mentions specific classes, methods, and code structures within the Django framework. We will focus on finding:\n\n1. The `BaseItem` and `Item` classes to see their implementation, even if they are likely user-defined models based on the Django ORM. This is because the modification might need to be aware of how inheritance is handled in Django models to ensure compatibility.\n2. The `Query.get_aggregation` method, which is directly quoted as containing the buggy behavior. Since it\u2019s mentioned that the code looks the same in versions 1.8 and 1.11, finding it in the Django codebase is crucial.\n3. The use of `RawSQL` within querysets, particularly in annotations, to understand its typical usage patterns and ensure the proposed solution doesn\u2019t disrupt common use cases.\n\nGiven these requirements, here\u2019s how we should use the API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"BaseItem\")` and `search_class(\"Item\")` to check the definitions of these classes, even though the issue suggests they are simple models inheriting from `models.Model`.\n- `search_method(\"get_aggregation\")` to find the `get_aggregation` method within the Django codebase.\n- `search_code(\"RawSQL\")` to find how `RawSQL` is typically used within the codebase, focusing on annotations in querysets.\n\nThese calls will give us a broad overview of the involved components and their implementations, which is essential for crafting a patch that fixes the issue without side effects."
