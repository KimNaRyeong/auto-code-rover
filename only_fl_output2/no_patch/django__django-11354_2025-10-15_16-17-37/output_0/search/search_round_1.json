Query.get_aggregation method drops INNER JOIN required to select the title field. Specifically, this code drops it:\nif not inner_query.distinct:\n# If the inner query uses default select and it has some\n# aggregate annotations, then we must make sure the inner\n# query is grouped by the main model's primary key. However,\n# clearing the select clause can alter results if distinct is\n# used.\nif inner_query.default_cols and has_existing_annotations:\ninner_query.group_by = [self.model._meta.pk.get_col(inner_query.get_initial_alias())]\ninner_query.default_cols = False\nCode is taken from Django 1.8 but 1.11 looks the same.\ndefault_cols is set to False and the INNER JOIN is dropped. Quick fix is to add a condition for setting default_cols to False:\nif not inner_query.distinct:\n# If the inner query uses default select and it has some\n# aggregate annotations, then we must make sure the inner\n# query is grouped by the main model's primary key.

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### Collected Context on `BaseItem` and `Item` Classes:\n\nThe search for `BaseItem` and `Item` classes returned no results, indicating that these classes are likely user-defined models and not part of the Django framework itself. The importance of these classes to the issue is their demonstration of model inheritance in Django, and how fields from a base model (`BaseItem`) are being used within an inherited model (`Item`) in conjunction with raw SQL annotations.\n\n#### Collected Context on `get_aggregation` Method:\n\nThe `get_aggregation` method is found within `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and it seems to handle the aggregation of query results. According to the issue description, the bug is linked to this method's handling of INNER JOINs when `default_cols` is set to False and `has_existing_annotations` is true, which causes the INNER JOIN required to select the `title` field from the base model to be dropped, leading to the `Unknown column 'title' in 'field list'` error.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   The `get_aggregation` method appears to manage the aggregation procedure of a queryset, deciding whether to use a subquery based on conditions like if there's a limit, distinct values, or existing annotations on the queryset. The problematic section specifically manipulates whether to include default columns (`inner_query.default_cols`) and how grouping is handled in the presence of aggregate annotations, ultimately affecting the SQL query formulation.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:**\n   The bug is directly related to the conditional logic that decides whether `inner_query.default_cols` should be set to false. According to the issue, this decision-making drops necessary INNER JOINS for inherited model fields during aggregation, which then leads to a failure when executing `.count()` on the annotated queryset.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n   Ideally, the method should preserve necessary joins to ensure fields from base models are accessible and correctly interpreted, especially when raw SQL annotations are used, while still performing the intended aggregations. The condition for setting `inner_query.default_cols` to False needs to be adjusted to account for such cases where annotations require access to inherited fields.\n\n#### Context on Usage of `RawSQL`:\n\nThe use of `RawSQL` in annotations is common for executing raw SQL expressions within Django querysets. The observed usage in files like `django/db/models/expressions.py` and `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` suggests `RawSQL` is a flexible tool for such custom SQL operations, which should be seamlessly supported even when dealing with inherited model fields.\n\n### Considering the Next Steps:\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n- The problem seems centered around the treatment of `inner_query.default_cols` and potentially the handling of annotations that require access to fields from base models during aggregation.\n- The relationship between the `get_aggregation` method's implementation and annotations using `RawSQL` points towards a mismatch in how aggregated queries are constructed, particularly in the context of model inheritance.\n\nFurther steps could involve:\n\n1. **Review how `RawSQL` annotations are handled during query compilation.** This could mean diving into the files `django/db/models/expressions.py` and `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` to understand any special handling or assumptions made about the model fields within these annotations.\n\n2. **Exploring alternative fixes:** The quick fix suggested in the issue modifies the condition for setting `default_cols` to False. Experimenting with this fix or similar adjustments might involve direct edits to the Django source code followed by tests to ensure the fix addresses the bug without adverse side effects.\n\nUnderstanding the intended functionality and limitations of both `get_aggregation` and `RawSQL` usages is crucial for crafting a solution that tackles the root cause without disrupting expected behavior in unrelated parts of the Django framework."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

To fix the issue, the conditional logic that sets `default_cols` to False needs adjustment. Instead of unconditionally setting `default_cols` to False when `inner_query.distinct` is False, there should be a check to ensure that this operation does not drop required joins for inherited fields, as indicated by the issue description. Specifically, the condition proposed by the issue submitter should be implemented:\n\n  ```python\n  if not has_existing_aggregate_annotations:\n      inner_query.default_cols = False\n  ```\n\n  This adjustment makes `inner_query.default_cols` only set to False when there are no aggregate annotations, avoiding the unintended dropping of necessary INNER JOINs. This fix should preserve the existing functionality for queries not involving raw SQL annotations or inherited model fields while resolving the failure when calling `.count()` on annotated querysets that include inherited model fields."
