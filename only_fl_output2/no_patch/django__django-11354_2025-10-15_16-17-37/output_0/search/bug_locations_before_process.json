        "intended_behavior": "The code within `get_aggregation` needs to ensure that the INNER JOINs required for accessing fields from inherited models are not dropped when aggregating queries, especially when annotations using `RawSQL` are involved. To fix the issue, the conditional logic that sets `default_cols` to False needs adjustment. Instead of unconditionally setting `default_cols` to False when `inner_query.distinct` is False, there should be a check to ensure that this operation does not drop required joins for inherited fields, as indicated by the issue description. Specifically, the condition proposed by the issue submitter should be implemented:\n\n  ```python\n  if not has_existing_aggregate_annotations:\n      inner_query.default_cols = False\n  ```\n\n  This adjustment makes `inner_query.default_cols` only set to False when there are no aggregate annotations, avoiding the unintended dropping of necessary INNER JOINs. This fix should preserve the existing functionality for queries not involving raw SQL annotations or inherited model fields while resolving the failure when calling `.count()` on annotated querysets that include inherited model fields."
