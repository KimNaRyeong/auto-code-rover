Below is a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py`. This script aims to reproduce the issue as described in your statement. Importantly, ensure that you have Django and a database setup (e.g., MySQL, as mentioned in the description) to run this script. It assumes Django is already installed and configured in your project.

```python
import os
import django
from django.core.exceptions import ImproperlyConfigured
from django.db import models
from django.db.models.expressions import RawSQL

# Django setup
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project.settings')
try:
    django.setup()
except ImproperlyConfigured as e:
    print("Ensure your Django project's settings are configured correctly")
    raise e

# Models definition
class BaseItem(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=32)

    class Meta:
        app_label = 'your_app_name_here'  # Adjust this to your actual app name

class Item(BaseItem):
    class Meta:
        app_label = 'your_app_name_here'

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        queryset = Item.objects.all()
        queryset = queryset.annotate(title2=RawSQL("SELECT title FROM your_app_name_here_baseitem WHERE your_app_name_here_baseitem.id = your_app_name_here_item.id", ()))
        count = queryset.count()
        print("Count obtained without error:", count)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Test failed due to an exception.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Make sure to replace `'your_project.settings'` and `'your_app_name_here'` with the actual values from your Django project setup. This script does a basic setup of Django within the file to ensure it can be run standalone, with the provided models being part of your Django application.

When you execute this with `python3 reproducer.py`, it should generate an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, as described. If the issue is fixed, it would print the count of objects without raising an exception.

**Important Notes:**
1. For database connectivity, this example assumes a Django project setup including database configuration in your `settings.py`.
2. The `RawSQL` snippet is adapted according to the given description. However, actual usage may vary based on your database schema and Django setup. The SQL might need adjustment to match your table names and structure, especially if you customized them or if Django generated them differently.
3. Ensure your database user has the appropriate permissions and that your Django model tables (`BaseItem` and `Item`) exist in the database.
