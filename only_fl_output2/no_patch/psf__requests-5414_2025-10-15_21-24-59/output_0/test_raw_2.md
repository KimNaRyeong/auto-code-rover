This script attempts to reproduce the issue where trying to access a malformed URL (`http://.example.com`) using the `requests` library incorrectly raises a `UnicodeError` instead of the expected `InvalidUrl` exception. The function `test_get_invalid_url()` executes the critical action and checks for the specific unwanted behavior, i.e., raising a `UnicodeError`. If this error arises, it captures and shows the stack trace using `print_stacktrace(e)`, and then gracefully exits with code `0` to indicate the problem's presence. If any other type of exception is caught or no exception is raised when accessing the malformed URL, the script flags an error by raising `AssertionError` with a message indicating the unexpected situation. This should ensure a clear and automated way to demonstrate and check for the specific issue in question until a fix is applied.
