```

This updated `reproducer.py` includes a more specific test function `test_get_invalid_url()` aimed at reproducing the reported issue where fetching a malformed URL (`http://.example.com`) with the `requests` library should raise a `requests.exceptions.InvalidURL` but instead raises a `UnicodeError`. 

It tries to perform a GET request on a malformed URL, anticipates an `InvalidURL` exception, and exits with code 0, implying that the error was successfully reproduced as expected (indicating a successful test under an incorrect library behavior). It now correctly exits with code 1 when an unexpected exception type is caught or if no exception is raised, signaling a failure to reproduce the expected issue. This structured approach should help in automated testing scenarios to assert the presence of the bug without manual interpretation of the output.
