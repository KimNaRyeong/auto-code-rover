This preservation of the function signature is critical to enable `authenticate` methods, especially when decorated, to be invoked correctly without causing `TypeError` for an unmatching backend.\n\nThe core of the fix might involve ensuring that `functools.wraps` is utilized correctly within `sensitive_variables_wrapper` to accurately copy all relevant metadata, including the signature, from the original function to the wrapper function. This might necessitate a more nuanced approach to how sensitive variables are marked within the wrapper, potentially by employing an alternative strategy that does not interfere with the function's callability or interoperability with introspection tools like `inspect.getcallargs`.\n\nThe intended behavior is thus to maintain the original functionality and security benefits of `sensitive_variables` while eliminating the side effect of causing incorrect behavior in `authenticate` methods due to signature misrepresentation."
