        "intended_behavior": "The sensitive_variables decorator must ensure it preserves the decorated function's signature in a way that tools like inspect.getcallargs can accurately determine callable compatibility. This may involve refining how functools.wraps is applied within the decorator to ensure that all aspects of the function's signature, including parameter names and defaults, are preserved exactly. The fix must enable the decorator to mark variables as sensitive without altering the function metadata that affects how inspect.getcallargs evaluates argument compatibility."

        "intended_behavior": "It's crucial that when authenticate leverages inspect.getcallargs to determine if a backend's authenticate method can accept provided credentials, it correctly accounts for any modifications made by decorators like sensitive_variables. The intended fix here might not involve direct changes to this snippet. However, understanding its operation helps identify the requirements for sensitive_variables's behavior. Essentially, the interaction between sensitive_variables and authenticate methods should not lead to mismatches in expected arguments due to decorator usage."
