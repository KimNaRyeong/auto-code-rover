        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to collect relevant code context about the `sensitive_variables` decorator and the `authenticate` method of a custom `AuthenticationBackend`. Specifically, we aim to understand how `sensitive_variables` is implemented and how it interacts with `authenticate` such that it causes a mismatch with `inspect.getcallargs`. Let's outline the API calls we'll make:\n\n1. **Search for the `sensitive_variables` decorator implementation**: Since it's a decorator, it might be implemented as a function or class, so we'll start by searching for it across the codebase. This will help us understand its mechanics and how it might be affecting function signatures.\n\n2. **Search for the `AuthenticationBackend` class**: Given that the `authenticate` method is part of a custom `AuthenticationBackend`, we need to locate this class to find the method's implementation. This step is crucial for understanding the expected behavior of `authenticate` and identifying any modifications introduced by `sensitive_variables`.\n\n3. **Search for the `authenticate` method in the `AuthenticationBackend` class**: To get specific details about how `authenticate` is implemented and how it might interact with `sensitive_variables`, we'll search directly for this method within the identified class.\n\n4. **Search for usage of `sensitive_variables` with `authenticate`**: To see the decorator in action and its application to the `authenticate` method, we'll search for code snippets where `sensitive_variables` decorates `authenticate`. This will give us direct examples of the problem described in the issue.\n\nBased on these requirements, the API calls would be:\n\n1. `search_code(\"def sensitive_variables\")`: This call seeks to find the definition or implementation of the `sensitive_variables` decorator.\n   \n2. `search_class(\"AuthenticationBackend\")`: To locate the class definition of `AuthenticationBackend` where the `authenticate` method resides.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"authenticate\", \"AuthenticationBackend\")`: This dives deeper into the `AuthenticationBackend` class to specifically find the `authenticate` method's implementation.\n\n4. `search_code(\"@sensitive_variables\")`: Searches for instances where `sensitive_variables` is used, potentially decorating functions or methods, giving examples of its application."
