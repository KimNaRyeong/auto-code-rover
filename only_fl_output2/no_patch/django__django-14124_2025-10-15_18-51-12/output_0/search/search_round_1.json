The signature variable in this function is expected to match (request, exception) for all handlers except for handler500 which is expected to have only (request). A positional argument, template_name is also present.\nWhile using class based views, we get two positional arguments (self, request) and then it recieves *args and * *kwargs. The check is permitting other handlers as the number of arguments coincidentally match.\nI suggest a fix in the _check_custom_error_handlers which first checks if the handler* are function based or class based, and then it preceed the check with the appropriate number of arguments.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the collected context, let's analyze each piece:\n\n1. **_check_custom_error_handlers in django/urls/resolvers.py**\n\n   - This method performs checks on custom error handlers (like `handler404` and `handler500`) to ensure they take the correct number of arguments. For `handler400`, `handler403`, and `handler404`, it expects the handlers to take two arguments (`request`, `exception`), whereas for `handler500`, it expects the handler to take only one argument (`request`).\n\n   - **Relation to the bug**: The issue reported is that when setting `handler500` as a Class-Based View (CBV), Django raises a `SystemCheckError` complaining that the custom `handler500` view does not take the correct number of arguments. The method `_check_custom_error_handlers` is directly responsible for this check, and its current implementation does not account for Class-Based Views' `.as_view()` method which does indeed take only the `request` parameter but wraps the class instantiation and method calls in a way that may confuse this direct argument count check.\n\n   - **Intended behavior**: Given the issue, the intended behavior would involve this method correctly identifying and validating Class-Based Views used as error handlers, perhaps by recognizing when a view is a CBV and adjusting its expectations on the number of arguments accordingly.\n\n\n2. **as_view method in django/views/generic/base.py**\n\n   - The `as_view` method serves as the entry point for a request to a Class-Based View. It dynamically creates a function that instantiates the view class, sets it up with the incoming request (and any other provided arguments), and then calls the appropriate method on the view instance based on the request method (e.g., `get`, `post`).\n\n   - **Relation to the bug**: This part of the code is crucial because the issue occurs when using `.as_view()` with `handler500`. Understanding how `.as_view()` works clarifies why Django's argument check fails: `.as_view()` returns a view function that expects only the `request` parameter (and, implicitly, `*args` and `**kwargs`), aligning with the expectation for `handler500` but conflicting with Django's built-in check for the number of arguments.\n\n   - **Intended behavior**: The `as_view()` mechanism is meant to seamlessly integrate CBVs with Django's request handling flow, including error handling. To resolve the issue, Django's argument checks should accommodate the way `.as_view()` operates to avoid false positives in system checks.\n\n\n3. **Handler defaults in django/conf/urls/__init__.py**\n\n   - This part of the code defines default handlers for various status codes (400, 403, 404, and 500), which are functions expected to take specific arguments.\n\n   - **Relation to the bug**: This provides context for what Django expects by default for custom error handlers. The issue arises when a user-defined Class-Based View is used in place of these default function-based handlers, especially for `handler500`, where the framework's expectations misalign with the CBV `.as_view()` method's behavior.\n\n   - **Intended behavior**: The default handlers underscore the framework's expectation regarding error handler signatures. To resolve the issue while maintaining backward compatibility and framework consistency, adjustments are needed either in the checks (to support CBV syntax) or in the documentation/guidance on how to properly implement custom error handlers with CBVs.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems the solution involves modifying the system check (`_check_custom_error_handlers`) to correctly handle CBVs used as custom error handlers, specifically for `handler500`. A potential direction for a patch would be to improve argument validation logic to recognize and allow for the pattern used by `.as_view()` when determining if the correct number of arguments is provided by a CBV error handler."

For `handler500`, when a class-based view is used with `.as_view()`, it should recognize that the class-based view does inherently meet the required `(request)` argument pattern after being wrapped by `.as_view()`. This adjustment would involve either a pre-check to identify whether the handler is a CBV and handling its validation differently or adapting the argument binding check (`signature.bind(*args)`) to account for the additional encapsulation by `.as_view()`. Essentially, the goal is to preserve the method's existing functionality\u2014ensuring error handlers have the correct signature\u2014while accommodating the valid use case of class-based views as custom error handlers. The solution must maintain backward compatibility, not disrupting the current validation for function-based views or other handlers (`handler404`, etc.) that do not exhibit this issue."
