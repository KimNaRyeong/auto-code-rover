The signature variable in this function is expected to match (request, exception) for all handlers except for handler500 which is expected to have only (request). A positional argument, template_name is also present.\nWhile using class based views, we get two positional arguments (self, request) and then it recieves *args and * *kwargs. The check is permitting other handlers as the number of arguments coincidentally match.\nI suggest a fix in the _check_custom_error_handlers which first checks if the handler* are function based or class based, and then it preceed the check with the appropriate number of arguments.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to first understand how Django checks custom error handlers and how Class-Based Views are handled in these situations. Specifically, we'll need to look at the `_check_custom_error_handlers` method in Django's code for how it is parsing and validating custom handlers like `handler404` and `handler500`. Also, we should get an understanding of the Class-Based View mechanism, especially how `.as_view()` is implemented since it's related to the error described. \n\nLet's start by gathering some context using the following API calls:\n\n1. search_method(\"_check_custom_error_handlers\")\n2. search_class(\"MyView\")\n3. search_method(\"as_view\")\n4. search_code(\"handler500 =\")"
