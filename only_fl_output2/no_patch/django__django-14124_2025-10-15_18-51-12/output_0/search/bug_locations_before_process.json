        "intended_behavior": "This method should be updated to correctly differentiate between function-based and class-based views when checking for the correct number of arguments in custom error handlers. For `handler500`, when a class-based view is used with `.as_view()`, it should recognize that the class-based view does inherently meet the required `(request)` argument pattern after being wrapped by `.as_view()`. This adjustment would involve either a pre-check to identify whether the handler is a CBV and handling its validation differently or adapting the argument binding check (`signature.bind(*args)`) to account for the additional encapsulation by `.as_view()`. Essentially, the goal is to preserve the method's existing functionality\u2014ensuring error handlers have the correct signature\u2014while accommodating the valid use case of class-based views as custom error handlers. The solution must maintain backward compatibility, not disrupting the current validation for function-based views or other handlers (`handler404`, etc.) that do not exhibit this issue."
