However, instead of performing the SELECT COUNT(*) operation twice (once in _base_set and again in _cull), the count of total entries obtained in _base_set should be passed to _cull as a parameter. This eliminates the need for the second count inside _cull. The culling decision process should leverage the count of entries post any deletions within the _cull method itself without re-querying the database."

        "intended_behavior": "This method needs to be updated to accept an additional parameter that represents the current count of cache entries (count). It should use this count to determine if culling is needed after adjusting for any entries deleted as part of the method's current operations, thus avoiding a redundant count query. The calculation would adjust the passed-in count by subtracting the number of rows reported deleted by cursor.rowcount after expiring entries are removed. This change presupposes that the deletion count accurately reflects changes in the table, a safe assumption in the context of this single method's operations."
