First, in the cache setting code, it runs:\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM %s\" % table)\nnum = cursor.fetchone()[0]\nnow = timezone.now()\nnow = now.replace(microsecond=0)\nif num > self._max_entries:\nself._cull(db, cursor, now)\n(\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/d06c5b358149c02a62da8a5469264d05f29ac659/django/core/cache/backends/db.py#L120-L131)\nThen in self._cull (the last line above) it runs:\ncursor.execute(\"DELETE FROM %s WHERE expires < %%s\" % table,\n[connection.ops.adapt_datetimefield_value(now)])\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM %s\" % table)\nnum = cursor.fetchone()[0]\nif num > self._max_entries:\n# Do culling routine here...\n(\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/d06c5b358149c02a62da8a5469264d05f29ac659/django/core/cache/backends/db.py#L254-L260)\nThe idea is that if the MAX_ENTRIES setting is exceeded, it'll cull the DB cache down by some percentage so it doesn't grow forever.\nI think that's fine, but given that the SELECT COUNT(*) query is slow, I wonder two things:\nWould a refactor to remove the second query be a good idea? If you pass the count from the first query into the _cull method, you can then do:\ndef _cull(self, db, cursor, now, count):\n...\ncursor.execute(\"DELETE FROM %s WHERE expires < %%s\" % table,\n[connection.ops.adapt_datetimefield_value(now)])\ndeleted_count = cursor.rowcount\nnum = count - deleted_count\nif num > self._max_entries:\n# Do culling routine here...\nThat seems like a simple win.\nIs it reasonable to not run the culling code *every* time that we set a value? Like, could we run it every tenth time or every 100th time or something?\nIf this is a good idea, does anybody have a proposal for how to count this? I'd be happy just doing it on a mod of the current millisecond, but there's probably a better way (randint?).\nWould a setting be a good idea here? We already have MAX_ENTRIES and CULL_FREQUENCY. CULL_FREQUENCY is \"the fraction of entries that are culled when MAX_ENTRIES is reached.\" That sounds more like it should have been named CULL_RATIO (regrets!), but maybe a new setting for this could be called \"CULL_EVERY_X\"?\nI think the first change is a no-brainer, but both changes seem like wins to me. Happy to implement either or both of these, but wanted buy-in first.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insights into the current behavior of Django's cache backend and its potential implications for the reported issue:\n\n### Analysis of `_base_set` in `db.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `_base_set` method is responsible for updating or touching a cache entry. It begins by counting all entries in the cache table to determine whether culling is needed by comparing the current count (`num`) to the maximum allowed entries (`self._max_entries`). If the current count exceeds the maximum, it will trigger the culling process.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - This method includes the first of the two mentioned expensive `SELECT COUNT(*)` operations. This operation is identified as a performance bottleneck, especially in large-scale deployments with a significant count of cache entries.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Ideally, this code should efficiently manage the cache size by culling entries only when necessary, without unnecessarily counting all rows in the table, especially before the actual need for culling is determined.\n\n### Analysis of `_cull` in `db.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `_cull` method is called to potentially reduce the number of cache entries if the current count exceeds the configured maximum entries. It first attempts to delete expired entries and then counts the total number of entries again to confirm if further culling is needed.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue highlights the inefficiency of executing another `SELECT COUNT(*)` immediately after deleting expired entries. Given that the deletion count is available (`cursor.rowcount`), recalculating the total count from the database introduces unnecessary overhead.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The refactored behavior should aim to avoid the second count operation by utilizing the result of the first count and adjusting it based on the number of entries deleted. This approach would preserve the logical intent of the culling process while mitigating the performance impact.\n\n### Analysis of `MAX_ENTRIES` and `CULL_FREQUENCY`\n\n1. **What do these parts of the code do?**\n   - `MAX_ENTRIES` defines the maximum number of entries the cache is allowed to hold before triggering the culling process.\n   - `CULL_FREQUENCY` dictates the ratio of entries to be culled when the maximum is reached. For example, a `CULL_FREQUENCY` of 3 means that one-third of the entries would be culled.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between these parts of the code and the bug?**\n   - These settings directly influence the behavior and efficiency of the cache culling mechanism. The issue arises in part due to how often and when these settings trigger the culling process, combined with the inefficiency of current counting strategies.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of these parts of the code?**\n   - The ideal adjustment would be to make the culling process more intelligent and less frequent, perhaps by introducing an additional setting to control how often culling is attempted based on a more performant indicator than the current unconditional row count.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe findings suggest that the proposed optimization for passing the count into the `_cull` method could substantially improve performance by avoiding a repeat `SELECT COUNT(*)` operation. Additionally, introducing a mechanism to control the frequency of culling attempts, informed by practical considerations on cache size growth and operational requirements, could further enhance efficiency.\n\nThe next steps in crafting the patch would involve planning changes to these methods to incorporate the count variable seamlessly in the `_cull` method and considering a configuration strategy for intelligently scheduling culling operations."

However, instead of performing the `SELECT COUNT(*)` operation twice (once in `_base_set` and again in `_cull`), the count of total entries obtained in `_base_set` should be passed to `_cull` as a parameter. This eliminates the need for the second count inside `_cull`. The culling decision process should leverage the count of entries post any deletions within the `_cull` method itself without re-querying the database.\n\n   - **Location 2:**\n     - **File:** `django/core/cache/backends/db.py`\n     - **Class:** `DatabaseCache`\n     - **Method:** `_cull`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** This method needs to be updated to accept an additional parameter that represents the current count of cache entries (`count`). It should use this count to determine if culling is needed after adjusting for any entries deleted as part of the method's current operations, thus avoiding a redundant count query. The calculation would adjust the passed-in count by subtracting the number of rows reported deleted by `cursor.rowcount` after expiring entries are removed. This change presupposes that the deletion count accurately reflects changes in the table, a safe assumption in the context of this single method's operations.\n\n**Additional Notes on Intended Behavior:**\n\nFor _Location 1_, the modification ensures efficiency by removing redundant database operations, thus ideally reducing load and processing times for cache maintenance operations. This alteration respects the existing logic flow and maintains all functional requirements for cache entry management and culling.\n\nFor _Location 2_, by refining the culling process to avoid unnecessary database counts, we significantly optimize performance, especially under scenarios where the cache table is large. This change respects the original intent of culling\u2014keeping the size of the cache table within configured limits\u2014while doing so in a more resource-efficient manner.\n\nThis approach directly addresses the core issue: the performance penalty of redundant `SELECT COUNT(*)` operations on potentially large tables. By passing the initial entry count from `_base_set` to `_cull`, the need for a second count operation is effectively removed, streamlining the culling process."
