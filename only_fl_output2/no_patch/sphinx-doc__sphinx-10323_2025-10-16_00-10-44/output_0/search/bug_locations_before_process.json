        "intended_behavior": "The `LiteralInclude` class should be modified to ensure that when the `prepend` and `append` options are used, leading and trailing whitespace in the string values of these options is preserved. This implies adjusting the logic that strips out whitespace from these options, such possibly creating a mechanism to detect and preserve intentional whitespace that is part of `prepend` or `append` values.\n\nAdditionally, when the `dedent` option is applied to the included content, it should specifically target the code snippet being included without affecting the `prepend` and `append` inline content. This might involve separating the handling of `dedent` for the main content from that of `prepend` and `append`, ensuring `dedent` does not inadvertently remove significant whitespace from these elements.\n\nThese changes aim to maintain the functionality of `dedent` for adjusting the indentation level of the included code, while fixing the issue where leading whitespace in `prepend` or `append` content is not respected. The fix would enable more precise control over the formatting of included code snippets and their prefixed or suffixed content within Sphinx documentation."
