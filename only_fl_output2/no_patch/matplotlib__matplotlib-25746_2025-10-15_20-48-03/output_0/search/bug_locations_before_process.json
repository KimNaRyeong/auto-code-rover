This argument will specify the font family for the tick labels. The implementation must ensure that when this `fontfamily` parameter is provided, it overrides the default or any previously set font family specifically for the tick labels without affecting other text elements in the plot. This addition must preserve all existing functionality, providing backwards compatibility for users who do not use the new parameter."

This ensures that the functionality is accessible through the pyplot API, maintaining a consistent interface for matplotlib users. The addition should allow users to specify the font family for the tick labels directly when using `pyplot.tick_params`, with the same considerations for default behavior and backward compatibility as described for `_base.py`."
