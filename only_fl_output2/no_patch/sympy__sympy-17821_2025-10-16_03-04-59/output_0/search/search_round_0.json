In many cases we could generate those equations ourselves instead of typing them manually (I found errors while doing #11014 for example).\nThis PR should demonstrate the idea.  @asmeurer what do you think?  Will this work?  Its certainly nice for maintainance, although it is probably slightly less readable...\n(If we want to do this widely, the latex printer could probably be optimized for things like `^{2}` and when it uses `\\left(` instead of `(`.)\n#### Release notes\n* core\n* Catalan can be rewritten as a sum\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, I will perform several search API calls to gather the needed context about `S.Catalan`, the implementation of `rewrite` method, and how LaTeX equations are currently handled in the documentation. My search strategy will be as follows:\n\n1. Search for the `Catalan` class in the codebase to understand its current implementation.\n2. Search for the `rewrite` method within the `Catalan` class to see if it exists or needs to be implemented.\n3. Since the issue mentions the idea of automatically generating LaTeX equations in documentation and optimizing the LaTeX printer, search for methods related to LaTeX printing across the codebase to identify if there's existing logic that could be extended or optimized.\n\nGiven these steps, let's initiate the API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Catalan\")` to find where the `Catalan` class is defined.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"rewrite\", \"Catalan\")` to check if `S.Catalan.rewrite(Sum)` or a similar signature already exists.\n3. `search_method(\"latex_printer\")` to find the implementation of the LaTeX printer, which is likely to be involved in generating equations for documentation."
