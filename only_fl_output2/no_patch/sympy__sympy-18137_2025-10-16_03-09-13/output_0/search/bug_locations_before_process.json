        "intended_behavior": "The `_contains` method in the `Range` class should be adjusted to handle symbolic variables more gracefully. When the method encounters a symbolic variable, instead of attempting to evaluate its truthiness directly\u2014which leads to the TypeError\u2014it should return a symbolic condition that represents whether the variable is contained within the range. This would likely involve enhancing the method to return unevaluated expressions or conditions when the direct truth value cannot be determined due to the presence of symbols. The specifics of the implementation will depend on how `sympy` expects to handle such symbolic logic internally."

        "intended_behavior": "While the direct modification in `__nonzero__` (or `__bool__` in Python 3) might not be necessary for resolving the issue, understanding and possibly enhancing how relational expressions involving symbols are handled might provide a workaround or ancillary solution. The intended behavior, though, is not to alter the raising of the TypeError but to ensure that operations leading to this function account for symbolic cases differently. Therefore, the solution might not be in changing this function but ensuring that set operations like `intersect` do not rely on operations that inherently cannot be performed with symbolic arguments without explicit evaluation strategies in place."
