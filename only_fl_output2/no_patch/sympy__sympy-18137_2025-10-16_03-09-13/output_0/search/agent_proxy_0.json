The methods `intersect`, `_handle_finite_sets`, `fuzzy_and`, and `_contains`, along with the usage of relational operations, seem crucial. Starting from these, let's formulate the appropriate API calls:\n\n1. For the `Range` class and its interaction:\n   - `search_class(\"Range\")`: This will help us understand the basics of the `Range` class, especially its initialization and how it generally interacts with other set types like `FiniteSet`.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"intersect\", \"Range\")`: To get details on how the `Range` class's `intersect` method is implemented, which is directly involved in throwing the error.\n\n2. For the `FiniteSet` class handling:\n   - `search_class(\"FiniteSet\")`: Since the issue occurs when trying to find the intersection of a `Range` with a `FiniteSet`, getting insights into the `FiniteSet` class will be beneficial.\n\n3. To understand the error thrown during relational checks:\n   - `search_code(\"cannot determine truth value of Relational\")`: This search will likely lead us to the implementation or handling of relational operations that triggers the error.\n\nThese API calls should provide an initial set of information necessary to start addressing the issue."
