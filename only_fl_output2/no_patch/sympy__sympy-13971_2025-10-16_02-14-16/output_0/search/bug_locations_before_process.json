Specifically, it should ensure that square brackets are rendered without unnecessary backslash escapes, enabling the resulting LaTeX string to be displayed as intended in markdown cells in Jupyter. This means if the current implementation mistakenly prepends backslashes to square brackets, it should be adjusted to exclude them for the specific context of rendering sequences to LaTeX. This adjustment must be made in a way that doesn't adversely affect other LaTeX rendering functionalities within Sympy, maintaining its ability to generate correct LaTeX for other expressions and symbols."
