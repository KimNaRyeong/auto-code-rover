Here are the API calls that would likely provide the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"SeqFormula\")`: This will locate the `SeqFormula` class in the Sympy library.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"SeqFormula\", \"__str__\")`: Since the issue involves how the sequence is represented as a string, checking the `__str__` method (if it exists) in `SeqFormula` could provide insights.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"SeqFormula\", \"_repr_latex_\")`: This method is specifically used for rendering the LaTeX representation in Jupyter notebooks, which seems to be related to the issue described.\n4. `search_code(\"SeqFormula\")`: This will help us find additional references or utility functions that might be manipulating the `SeqFormula` representations outside of the class itself, including how it's rendered in Jupyter notebooks.\n\nThese searches should give us a good starting point to understand the issue better and formulate a solution."
