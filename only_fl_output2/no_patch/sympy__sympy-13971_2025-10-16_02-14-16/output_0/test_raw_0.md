Certainly! To replicate the issue described, I'll create a Python script named `reproducer.py`. This script will simulate the behavior mentioned, where the `SeqFormula()` display output in a Jupyter notebook environment may incorrectly escape square brackets.

Given the context, the script aims to check if the string representation of the sequence produced by `SeqFormula()` incorrectly includes backslash-escaped square brackets. We are assuming the string representation should match the expectation in a non-Jupyter environment like a standard Python interpreter, which might not fully replicate the behavior in a Jupyter notebook but aims to represent the crux of the problem.

Please, integrate the following Python script into your project:

```python
import sympy as sp

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_seq_formula_display():
    k, m, n = sp.symbols('k m n', integer=True)
    seq = sp.SeqFormula(n**2, (n, 0, sp.oo))
    
    # Simulating the expected string representation
    # Note: This doesn't fully replicate Jupyter's rendering,
    # but it's aimed at detecting the described issue.
    seq_str = sp.sstr(seq)
    
    # Check if the sequence string representation contains incorrect escaping
    if "\\left\\" in seq_str or "\\right\\" in seq_str:
        raise AssertionError("Incorrect bracket escaping found in SeqFormula representation.")
    
    # The expected format does not contain backslash-escaped brackets
    expected_format = '[0, 1, 4, 9, ...]'
    assert expected_format in seq_str, "SeqFormula representation doesn't match the expected format."

try:
    check_seq_formula_display()
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exits with non-zero to indicate failure/issue presence
else:
    print("No issue detected with SeqFormula representation.")
    exit(0)  # Exits with zero to indicate success/no issue detected
```

This script will attempt to verify if the representation of a sequence generated by `sympy.SeqFormula` matches the expected behavior without the incorrect backslash-escaped brackets. If the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace. Otherwise, it will state that no issue was detected and exit with code 0. 

Remember, this approach may not fully capture the unique rendering behavior of Jupyter notebooks, since it checks the issue based on textual representation in a Python script context.
