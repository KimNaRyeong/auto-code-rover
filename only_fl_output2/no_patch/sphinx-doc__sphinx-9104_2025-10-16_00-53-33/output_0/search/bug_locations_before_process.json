Potential adjustments could involve custom Sphinx extensions or overriding default behaviors of `autodoc` or `intersphinx` to either ignore the ellipsis in type annotations or to document them in a way that does not lead to warnings. The key is ensuring these configurations or custom extensions preserve the clarity and intention behind the use of ellipsis in the project's type hints while preventing Sphinx from generating warnings about unresolved references."
