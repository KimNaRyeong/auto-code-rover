Below is an example `reproducer.py` script that attempts to replicate the issue described. This script assumes the existence of a particular environment setup similar to what was provided, specifically it requires the Sphinx environment to be correctly installed and configured, as per the steps mentioned to reproduce the issue. Since the actual warning is generated by Sphinx during the documentation building process, this script mimics running Sphinx in a manner that might capture and assert against the expected warning message.

Please note that because this script interfaces with external tools and environments (e.g., Sphinx, your project setup), it might require adjustments to perfectly fit into your testing infrastructure.

```python
import subprocess
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_sphinx_build():
    # Set the paths according to your project structure
    docs_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'docs')
    build_command = ['make', 'html']

    try:
        # Ensure that the working directory is `docs` and run Sphinx build
        result = subprocess.run(build_command, cwd=docs_path, text=True, capture_output=True, check=True)
        return result.stderr
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

def main():
    error_message_fragment = "WARNING: py:class reference target not found: .."
    try:
        output = run_sphinx_build()
        # Check if the specific warning message is in the output
        assert error_message_fragment not in output, "The issue is still present."
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 if the issue is present or any other error occurs
    else:
        print("Issue resolved or not identified in the output.")
        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 when the issue is resolved or not found

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Remember, the effectiveness of this reproducer script depends on the accuracy of the error message check (`error_message_fragment` in this case) and whether the Sphinx setup from the command line is accurately replicated. You might need to adjust the paths and commands based on your specific project layout and how you manage your Python environment.
