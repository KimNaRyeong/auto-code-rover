Given the constraints and the fact that the previous attempt to write a `reproducer.py` script encountered errors due to environmental setup issues, I'll provide a more refined example that aims to directly invoke Sphinx to build documentation and watch for the specific warning within Python script. This approach attempts to simplify the process by directly interfacing with Sphinx's Python API, rather than relying on the CLI and makefile.

This script anticipates that Sphinx is correctly set up and that it's being executed in an environment where the Sphinx Python package is available. Please ensure this before running the script. Adjustments may be needed based on your specific project layout and how Sphinx is configured.

```python
import sphinx.application
import sphinx.cmd.build
import io
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def sphinx_build(source_dir, build_dir):
    # Capturing Sphinx output by redirecting stdout and stderr
    original_stdout = sys.stdout
    original_stderr = sys.stderr
    sys.stdout = io.StringIO()
    sys.stderr = io.StringIO()

    # Please replace `source_dir` and `build_dir` with the actual paths in your project
    # Example:
    # source_dir = './docs'
    # build_dir = './docs/_build'
    try:
        sphinx.cmd.build.build_main(['-b', 'html', source_dir, build_dir])
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    finally:
        # Restoring stdout and stderr
        sys.stdout = original_stdout
        sys.stderr = original_stderr

def check_for_warning(build_dir):
    warning_file = os.path.join(build_dir, 'warnings.txt')
    error_message_fragment = "WARNING: py:class reference target not found: .."
    with open(warning_file, 'r') as file:
        warnings = file.read()
        if error_message_fragment in warnings:
            raise AssertionError("The issue is still present.")

def main():
    source_dir = '.'  # Adjust this to your Sphinx project's documentation source directory
    build_dir = './_build'  # Adjust this to where you want Sphinx to output the build files
    sphinx_build(source_dir, build_dir)
    try:
        check_for_warning(build_dir)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 if the issue is still present
    else:
        print("Issue resolved or not identified in the build warnings.")
        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 when the issue is resolved or not found

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script integrates directly with the Sphinx Python API for building the documentation and looks for warnings in the output. Please note the following before running the script:

- The script assumes that the Sphinx environment is correctly configured in your Python environment.
- You may need to adjust the `source_dir` and `build_dir` variables in the `main()` function to match your project's directory structure.
- This script does not capture the output from Sphinx directly to check for the warning message but assumes that Sphinx will write the build warnings to a file. You may need to modify the `check_for_warning` function according to how your project and Sphinx are set up to output warnings.

Remember to install all necessary dependencies and configure the Sphinx environment correctly before running the script.
