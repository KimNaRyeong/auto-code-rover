Given the requirements, here's a revised version of `reproducer.py` to follow your request more accurately. This script specifically checks if the issue regarding "Integers to negative integer powers are not allowed." is present by attempting to reproduce the error condition. Upon encountering the expected `ValueError`, it prints a detailed stack trace. If the issue has been fixed, and no error is thrown, the script exits with code 0, indicating the absence of the issue.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeCV
    from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

    try:
        X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=10, noise=0.1)
        ridge = RidgeCV(alphas=[1, 10, 100, 1000]).fit(X, y)
        # If no exception is raised, assume the issue has been resolved.
        print("No issue found, the problem seems to be fixed.")
        exit(0)
    except ValueError as e:
        if "Integers to negative integer powers are not allowed" in str(e):
            # The specific issue we're looking for is present.
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("The issue is present.") from e
        else:
            # Some other ValueError occurred, which should be re-raised for clarity.
            raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as error:
        # Catch only the AssertionError we raise to confirm the issue is present.
        print(error)
        exit(1)  # Non-zero exit code to indicate the presence of the issue.
    except Exception as e:
        # Any other unexpected error should also be shown.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("An unexpected exception occurred. Further investigation is required.")
        exit(1)
```

In this script:
- `reproduce_issue` function tries to replicate the issue within a `try-except` block specifically catching a `ValueError`.
- It differentiates between the expected error message indicating the issue and any other `ValueError` that might arise, handling them distinctly.
- The `print_stacktrace` function is utilized as you've proposed to provide clarity on the source and context of the error when it's caught.
- If an `AssertionError` is explicitly raised, it points to the detection of the problem, and the script exits with code 1. If a different error occurs, the stack trace of this unexpected event is printed, acknowledging that further analysis is necessary.
