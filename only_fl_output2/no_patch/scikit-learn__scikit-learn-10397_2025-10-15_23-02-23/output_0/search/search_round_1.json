However, the search for the `fit` method within the `RidgeCV` class and the specific `alphas` code snippet did not return results. This implies that the `fit` method might be inherited from a base class or the handling of `alphas` might not be as straightforward as searching for the explicit list provided in the issue. \n\nGiven this, and considering the error related to integer powers, the problem could involve how numpy or underlying mathematical functions handle operations on the `alphas` parameter. Since the error indicates an issue with integers and negative powers, it's likely the processing or validation of `alphas` before they are used might not be converting them to floats, which are necessary for certain mathematical computations.\n\nThe intended behavior of the part of the code that handles `alphas` should ensure that any integer values passed to `alpha` parameters are either converted to floats or there's a validation step that prevents operations incompatible with integers.\n\nTo proceed, we need to locate where `alphas` are processed before the `fit` method uses them, considering that the `fit` method might be implemented in one of the base classes of `RidgeCV`. Based on this analysis, the following API calls seem appropriate:\n\n1. `search_class(\"_BaseRidgeCV\")` - Since `RidgeCV` is derived from `_BaseRidgeCV` (as indicated by the class definition) and we couldn't find a direct implementation of `fit` in `RidgeCV`, this class likely contains relevant implementation details.\n2. `search_code_in_file(\"fit\", \"sklearn/linear_model/ridge.py\")` - Even though searching for `fit` in `RidgeCV` didn't yield results, it's possible that the method is indeed defined in the file but wasn't captured due to it being inherited or dynamically assigned. Searching the file might reveal relevant implementations or inherited behaviors.\n3. `search_method(\"fit\")` - Since the specific search within `RidgeCV` did not find the `fit` method, it's worth performing a broader search to see if `fit` method implementations in the context of ridge regression are available elsewhere in the codebase, potentially revealing how `alphas` are handled."
