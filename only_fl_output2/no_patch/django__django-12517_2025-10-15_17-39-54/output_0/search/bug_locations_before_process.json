        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior here should ensure the datetime logging is consistent across different components of the Django server, particularly between WSGIRequestHandler and WSGIServer. To resolve the issue, WSGIRequestHandler may need a method or an adjustment to ensure it formats the datetime in a consistent and configurable manner, similar to or in sync with WSGIServer's logging mechanism. This could involve defining a standard format for datetime that can be used across the server's logging system or ensuring that the logging formatter used across these classes adheres to a configurable format specified either in Django settings or within the logging configuration itself."

        "intended_behavior": "Given that no specific method is identified as problematic, the intended behavior in WSGIServer would align with ensuring consistency in logging datetime formats, as mentioned. While WSGIServer might not directly exhibit the inconsistency issue, ensuring it uses a consistent, configurable datetime format for logging purposes, that matches or is easily aligned with WSGIRequestHandler, would be vital. This could mean adjusting how WSGIServer logs messages to use a standard, possibly overridden via settings, datetime format for its log entries."
