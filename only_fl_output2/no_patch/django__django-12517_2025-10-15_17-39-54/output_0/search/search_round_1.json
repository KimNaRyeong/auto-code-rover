On the other hand, WSGIServer uses logging without providing a server_time. This gets \"fixed\" in ServerFormatter.format using self.formatTime(record, self.datefmt), which uses a completely different format.\nCurrently we make this at least consistent by providing the datefmt parameter when constructing the logger, but it would be better if they were coded to be in sync (and configurable?).\n(Looking into it further, it looks like we should be using %(asctime)s instead of %(server_time)s, but would be good if that were the suggested default. In \u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/1.10/#runserver-output-goes-through-logging we see %(server_time)s.)\n</issue>"

We also want to explore the usage of `%(asctime)s` and `%(server_time)s` within the context of Django's runserver logging implementation.

Search for the class `WSGIServer`:\n   - `search_class(\"WSGIServer\")`\n\n3.

        "content": "The obtained information presents several important takeaways and pathways for further exploration:\n\n1. **WSGIRequestHandler and WSGIServer in `django/core/servers/basehttp.py`:**\n   - Both classes are essential in handling HTTP requests and the server's basic functionalities within Django's development server (`runserver` command).\n   - The absence of `log_date_time_string` in both classes suggests that the inconsistency in datetime logging might not be directly tied to an explicitly defined method with this name in `WSGIRequestHandler` or `WSGIServer`. This raises the possibility that the datetime formatting mechanism leverages underlying or inherited behavior not immediately obvious from the class definitions provided.\n   - Given the issue, the intended behavior would be for both classes to log datetime stamps in a consistent and configurable format.\n\n2. **Absence of `%(asctime)s` and `%(server_time)s` in the codebase:**\n   - This could indicate either the specific logging format strings are defined elsewhere (possibly in configuration or documentation) or managed by standard Python logging mechanisms not customized directly in the Django source we are searching.\n   - The intention, as per the issue, seems to be making the logging format easier to configure or standardize to use a common placeholder (likely `%(asctime)s`) for datetime logging.\n\n3. **Search for `log_date_time_string` and `ServerFormatter.format` produced no results:**\n   - This suggests that `log_date_time_string` might either not be used directly or is part of a library or base class that Django's server classes inherit from (implied by the reference to `BaseHTTPServer.log_date_time_string` in the issue description).\n   - The absence of `ServerFormatter.format` could mean we need to review how Django sets up and utilizes formatters for logging, possibly through a more generic approach or through inherited functionality from the Python `logging` module.\n\nFurther steps should involve:\n1. **Exploring the inheritance tree of `WSGIRequestHandler` and `WSGIServer`:** Since `simple_server.WSGIRequestHandler` and `simple_server.WSGIServer` are mentioned, there's a need to understand from which Python standard library modules (`wsgiref.simple_server` likely) these behaviors are inherited, and if that's where `log_date_time_string` is defined or utilized.\n   \n2. **Understanding Django's logging configuration for `runserver`:** It might be useful to examine how Django configures its logging, especially for the development server, to see if there's a way to define or override datetime formats in logs.\n\nGiven this, further API calls could include:\n- Exploring the `simple_server` module (if accessible) to understand how `WSGIRequestHandler` and `WSGIServer` inherit or modify behavior.\n- Searching for how logging is configured within Django for the development server to find potential leads on where `%(asctime)s` or logging format configurations could be applied.\n\nThis necessitates a broadened approach, potentially involving manual review of Django's documentation on logging and the inheritance structure of these server classes within the Python standard library."

To resolve the issue, `WSGIRequestHandler` may need a method or an adjustment to ensure it formats the datetime in a consistent and configurable manner, similar to or in sync with `WSGIServer`'s logging mechanism. This could involve defining a standard format for datetime that can be used across the server's logging system or ensuring that the logging formatter used across these classes adheres to a configurable format specified either in Django settings or within the logging configuration itself.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/core/servers/basehttp.py`\n  - **Class:** `WSGIServer`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Given that no specific method is identified as problematic, the intended behavior in `WSGIServer` would align with ensuring consistency in logging datetime formats, as mentioned. While `WSGIServer` might not directly exhibit the inconsistency issue, ensuring it uses a consistent, configurable datetime format for logging purposes, that matches or is easily aligned with `WSGIRequestHandler`, would be vital. This could mean adjusting how `WSGIServer` logs messages to use a standard, possibly overridden via settings, datetime format for its log entries.\n\nConsidering the bug involves inconsistency in logging formats between `WSGIRequestHandler` and `WSGIServer`, fixing it likely involves ensuring both use a unified approach to datetime logging, potentially making that approach configurable through Django settings. This would ensure developers have the flexibility to define the logging format that best suits their needs, including the formatting of datetime stamps in log entries."
