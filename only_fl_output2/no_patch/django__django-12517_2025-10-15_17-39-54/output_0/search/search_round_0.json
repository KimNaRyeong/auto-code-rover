On the other hand, WSGIServer uses logging without providing a server_time. This gets \"fixed\" in ServerFormatter.format using self.formatTime(record, self.datefmt), which uses a completely different format.\nCurrently we make this at least consistent by providing the datefmt parameter when constructing the logger, but it would be better if they were coded to be in sync (and configurable?).\n(Looking into it further, it looks like we should be using %(asctime)s instead of %(server_time)s, but would be good if that were the suggested default. In \u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/1.10/#runserver-output-goes-through-logging we see %(server_time)s.)\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we seek to understand how both `WSGIRequestHandler` and `WSGIServer` handle date and time logging, and where the formatting inconsistency originates. We also want to explore the usage of `%(asctime)s` and `%(server_time)s` within the context of Django's runserver logging implementation. Here are the specific API calls that would help gather the required context:\n\n1. Search for the class `WSGIRequestHandler`:\n   - `search_class(\"WSGIRequestHandler\")`\n\n2. Search for the class `WSGIServer`:\n   - `search_class(\"WSGIServer\")`\n\n3. Investigate the logging mechanisms, especially how `server_time` is calculated and used:\n   - `search_method(\"log_date_time_string\")`\n   \n4. Since the issue mentions `BaseHTTPServer.log_date_time_string`, it's important to seek any direct references or usages of this method within the relevant classes:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"log_date_time_string\", \"WSGIRequestHandler\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"log_date_time_string\", \"WSGIServer\")`\n\n5. Additionally, because the issue points towards a potential solution involving `%(asctime)s` and discussions about `%(server_time)s` being a part of the problem, it's insightful to search where these format specifiers are defined or used:\n   - `search_code(\"%(asctime)s\")`\n   - `search_code(\"%(server_time)s\")`\n\n6. Lastly, understanding how `ServerFormatter.format` is involved in the issue could yield insights into how logging formatting is applied and why it might be inconsistent:\n   - `search_method(\"ServerFormatter.format\")`\n\nThese API calls are aimed at uncovering the internal workings related to the issue reported, providing a comprehensive perspective that spans class definitions, method implementations, and specific code snippets associated with logging date and time in Django's development server."
