        "intended_behavior": "This file likely contains mixins used by Django model fields. The code handling the caching of field values in instances, especially regarding ForeignKey fields, needs to ensure that upon copying a model instance, the field cache (`_state.fields_cache`) does not cause unintended sharing of related objects between the original and the copied instance. Specifically, the mechanism in place for caching related field objects should be adjusted or extended to clear or re-initialize the cache for copied instances, ensuring that changes to related fields on the copied instance do not affect the original instance's cached relations. This might involve modifying the mix-in to intercept copy operations and appropriately handle the fields cache."

        "intended_behavior": "Considering this file deals with querying, it also might include logic for how model instances are handled post-retrieval from the database, including caching. The intended behavior here would be to audit and potentially adjust the code paths that manage `_state.fields_cache` during or after instantiation and retrieval operations to accommodate the nuances of model instance copying, ensuring that each instance maintains its own independent cache unless explicitly shared. This ensures that operations on copied model instances do not have unintended side effects on the caching of related objects of the original instances."
