It seems quite unexpected.\nWhat is the recommended way to clone a model instance? To date we have been using copy() in a similar fashion to the test without issue. deepcopy seems to work fine in >=2.0 but we haven\u2019t done too much testing yet.\nTest (placed in tests/model_fields/test_field_caching_change.py):\nimport copy\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom .models import Bar, Foo\nclass ForeignKeyCachingBehaviorTest(TestCase):\ndef test_copy(self):\nfoo1 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo1', d=1)\nfoo2 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo2', d=2)\nbar1 = Bar.objects.create(a=foo1, b='bar1')\nbar2 = copy.copy(bar1)\nbar2.pk = None\nbar2.a = foo2\n# bar2 points to foo2\nself.assertEqual(bar2.a, foo2)\nself.assertEqual(bar2.a.id, bar2.a_id)\n# bar1 is unchanged and must still point to foo1\n# These fail on Django >= 2.0\nself.assertEqual(bar1.a, foo1)\nself.assertEqual(bar1.a.id, bar1.a_id)\nand executed that via:\npython3.6 tests/runtests.py --parallel 1 model_fields\nIn \u200bhttps://groups.google.com/g/django-developers/c/QMhVPIqVVP4/m/mbezfaBEAwAJ Simon suggests:\n..... Model.copy should make sure to make a deep-copy of self._state now that fields are cached in self._state.fields_cache.\nwhich I will attempt to implement.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given the results of the initial API calls and considering the steps to proceed:\n\n### Analysis of Failed Searches\n1. **Classes `Bar`, `Foo`, and `TestCase` Not Found**: This suggests that these might be project-specific classes not found in the broader Django framework, or the search was not scoped correctly to include project-specific test files or app models. Therefore, it would be prudent to adjust the search to either look into specific application directories within a Django project or consider that these classes might be part of the test suite or demonstration code provided by the user, rather than part of the Django codebase itself.\n\n2. **Methods `copy` and `deepcopy` in Classes `Bar` and `Foo` Not Found**: Since `copy` and `deepcopy` are not directly overridden or defined in `Bar` and `Foo` (as they couldn't be found), it implies any issues related to copying behavior are likely due to Django's internal mechanisms or how Python\u2019s `copy` module interacts with Django models.\n\n### Analysis of Successful Searches: `_state.fields_cache`\n1. **Understanding `_state.fields_cache` Usage**:\n   - Files where `_state.fields_cache` is mentioned are likely involved in the internal handling of model state and field caching. This mechanism plays a crucial role in how Django models cache related field objects to minimize database queries. The change in behavior observed in the issue description likely stems from modifications in how these caches are managed between Django versions.\n\n2. **Relation to the Bug**:\n   - The issue mentions unexpected changes in ForeignKey field caching when copying model instances between Django 1.11.x and 2.x. The mentions of `_state.fields_cache` in the codebase suggest that this part of Django's ORM framework could be directly related to the problem, especially if changes in Django 2.x altered how copied model instances' related fields are cached or not cleared properly when instances are copied.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**:\n   - Ideally, upon copying a model instance, the new instance should not unintentionally share related field caches with the original instance, unless explicitly intended. This prevents unexpected side effects like mutating one instance's relations inadvertently affecting another, which seems to be the crux of the issue described. Understanding the implementation details of caching in `_state.fields_cache` could reveal whether the current behavior is a bug or an intentional design decision requiring different handling of model copying in Django 2.x.\n\n#### Next Steps\nGiven the analysis, the next steps should involve:\n1. **Examining the implementation in \"django/db/models/query.py\" and \"django/db/models/fields/mixins.py\"** to understand changes in caching behavior. This will require specific API calls:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"_state.fields_cache\", \"django/db/models/query.py\")`\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"_state.fields_cache\", \"django/db/models/fields/mixins.py\")`\n\n2. **Considering broader context API calls** to potentially locate the `Bar` and `Foo` models or the `TestCase` implementation if they are indeed part of the Django project's test suite rather than user-provided code. This might involve looking into common directories for Django projects such as:\n   - Searching for `Bar` or `Foo` definitions in known model locations: Unfortunately, without direct project structure visibility, specific API calls cannot be formulated without assuming a project directory. A manual search in the project's model definitions or test cases might be necessary.\n\nThese actions would provide insight into how Django handles field caching for model instances and how this mechanism's changes could lead to the issue observed when upgrading from Django 1.11.x to 2.x."

The code handling the caching of field values in instances, especially regarding ForeignKey fields, needs to ensure that upon copying a model instance, the field cache (`_state.fields_cache`) does not cause unintended sharing of related objects between the original and the copied instance. Specifically, the mechanism in place for caching related field objects should be adjusted or extended to clear or re-initialize the cache for copied instances, ensuring that changes to related fields on the copied instance do not affect the original instance's cached relations. This might involve modifying the mix-in to intercept copy operations and appropriately handle the fields cache.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/db/models/query.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Considering this file deals with querying, it also might include logic for how model instances are handled post-retrieval from the database, including caching. The intended behavior here would be to audit and potentially adjust the code paths that manage `_state.fields_cache` during or after instantiation and retrieval operations to accommodate the nuances of model instance copying, ensuring that each instance maintains its own independent cache unless explicitly shared. This ensures that operations on copied model instances do not have unintended side effects on the caching of related objects of the original instances.\n\nThese adjustments aim to preserve the existing functionality across the Django ORM while addressing the unintended side effects introduced by changes in the caching behavior observed after upgrading to Django 2.x. This ensures backward compatibility to a large extent, especially for applications relying on the older behavior for copying model instances."
