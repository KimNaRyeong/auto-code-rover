It seems quite unexpected.\nWhat is the recommended way to clone a model instance? To date we have been using copy() in a similar fashion to the test without issue. deepcopy seems to work fine in >=2.0 but we haven\u2019t done too much testing yet.\nTest (placed in tests/model_fields/test_field_caching_change.py):\nimport copy\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom .models import Bar, Foo\nclass ForeignKeyCachingBehaviorTest(TestCase):\n\tdef test_copy(self):\n\t\tfoo1 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo1', d=1)\n\t\tfoo2 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo2', d=2)\n\t\tbar1 = Bar.objects.create(a=foo1, b='bar1')\n\t\tbar2 = copy.copy(bar1)\n\t\tbar2.pk = None\n\t\tbar2.a = foo2\n\t\t# bar2 points to foo2\n\t\tself.assertEqual(bar2.a, foo2)\n\t\tself.assertEqual(bar2.a.id, bar2.a_id)\n\t\t# bar1 is unchanged and must still point to foo1\n\t\t# These fail on Django >= 2.0\n\t\tself.assertEqual(bar1.a, foo1)\n\t\tself.assertEqual(bar1.a.id, bar1.a_id)\nand executed that via:\npython3.6 tests/runtests.py --parallel 1 model_fields\nIn \u200bhttps://groups.google.com/g/django-developers/c/QMhVPIqVVP4/m/mbezfaBEAwAJ Simon suggests:\n..... Model.copy should make sure to make a deep-copy of self._state now that fields are cached in self._state.fields_cache.\nwhich I will attempt to implement.\n"

It includes a custom database router, `InMemoryRouter`, to ensure operations are routed correctly to the 'default' in-memory database.\n\nBefore running the actual test case, it executes Django's `migrate` command to apply database migrations, creating the necessary tables for `Foo` and `Bar` models. This step is vital to prevent the \"no such table\" error seen previously.\n\nFinally, the script attempts to replicate the ForeignKey caching behavior issue. If the issue is present, it will print a detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function and exit with code 1 to indicate failure. If the issue is not present, it signals success by printing a message and exiting with code 0."
