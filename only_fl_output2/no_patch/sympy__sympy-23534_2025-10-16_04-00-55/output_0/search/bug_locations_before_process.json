        "intended_behavior": "The `symbols` method needs to properly handle the `cls` keyword argument when it's provided with a tuple of identifiers and the class specified is `Function` (or potentially any class derived from `Function`). Currently, it seems to default to creating instances of `Symbol`, even when `Function` objects are expected. The method should distinguish between requests for symbols (`Symbol` instances) and functional symbols (`Function` instances), correctly instantiating objects of the class indicated by the `cls` argument. This involves parsing the input tuple correctly, identifying when a slice notation (e.g., `'q:2', 'u:2'`) is intended to denote multiple function names and creating the corresponding `Function` instances instead of `Symbol` instances. This adjustment must preserve the current functionality for all other use cases where `Symbol` instances or other types of objects are correctly created."
