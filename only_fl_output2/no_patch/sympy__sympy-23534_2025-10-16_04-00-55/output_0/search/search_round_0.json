        "content": "To address this issue, I will need to gather more context about the implementation of `symbols` and how it interprets its arguments to create symbol-like objects. To start, let's identify the relevant parts of the codebase:\n\n1. The `symbols` function, to understand its argument parsing and object creation logic.\n2. The `Function` class, to understand how it is expected to be instantiated in this context.\n3. The way `Symbol` and `Function` classes are differentiated during the object creation phase in the `symbols` function.\n\nGiven these points, I will perform the following search API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"symbols\")`: This will help us find the implementation of the `symbols` function to see how it handles its arguments and decides whether to create a `Symbol` or a `Function`.\n- `search_class(\"Symbol\")`: This will provide context on the `Symbol` class, it's construction, and usage constraints.\n- `search_class(\"Function\")`: This will give insights into the `Function` class, especially how instances are expected to be created and any particular handling or conditions required for its instantiation.\n- `search_code(\"smp.symbols\")`: This will help locate other instances where `symbols` is being used, potentially uncovering related patterns or misuse that could highlight limitations or bugs in the implementation related to the issue."
