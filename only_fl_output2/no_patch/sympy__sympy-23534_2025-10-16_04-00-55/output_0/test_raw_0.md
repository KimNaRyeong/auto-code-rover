This script aims to reproduce the issue described:
1. It uses Sympy to create symbols intended to be instances of `Function` by specifying `cls=smp.Function` within an extra layer of parentheses in the `symbols` function.
2. The script then checks if the first element of the created symbols (`q[0]`) is indeed an instance of `smp.FunctionClass`. Given the described bug, we expect it to be of type `Symbol` instead, which would cause the assertion to fail.
3. If the assertion fails, `print_stacktrace` is called to print the stack trace, providing clarity on where the issue occurred.
4. If fixed, the script would simply print "No issues detected" and exit with code 0.

Please run this script in an environment where SymPy version 1.10.1 is installed, as the observed behavior is specific to this version.
