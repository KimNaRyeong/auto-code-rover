Please describe.**\nI've been working on opening custom hdf formats in xarray, reading up on the apiv2 it is currently only possible to declare a new external plugin in setup.py but that doesn't seem easy or intuitive to me.\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nWhy can't we simply be allowed to add functions to the engine parameter? Example:\n```python\nfrom custom_backend import engine\nds = xr.load_dataset(filename, engine=engine)\n```\nThis seems like a small function change to me from my initial _quick_ look because there's mainly a bunch of string checks in the normal case until we get to the registered backend functions, if we send in a function instead in the engine-parameter we can just bypass those checks.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to collect information on how the `engine` parameter is currently handled within the xarray project. The feature request suggests improving the way custom backends, like custom hdf formats, are integrated with xarray by allowing functions to be passed directly to the `engine` parameter of functions like `load_dataset`. This suggests we need to look into the implementation of `load_dataset` and surrounding logic that deals with the `engine` parameter and how backends are registered and invoked.\n\nLet's gather more context on how engines are currently managed:\n\n1. **Search for the `load_dataset` function**: This is the main entry point that the issue refers to, so we need to understand how it's implemented and how it currently handles the `engine` parameter.\n\n2. **Search for code handling the `engine` parameter**: Since the `engine` parameter is crucial to this request, we need to find where it's processed and where the backend engine checks occur.\n\n3. **Search for backend registration logic**: Given the mention of registering external plugins via `setup.py`, it would be useful to find the code responsible for handling the registration of backends or engines. This could involve looking for plugin registration patterns or specific methods that load or register backends.\n\nBased on these requirements, here are the API calls we should make:\n\n- `search_method(\"load_dataset\")`: To find the implementation details of the `load_dataset` function and understand its current engine handling.\n- `search_code(\"engine parameter\")`: To locate parts of the code where the `engine` parameter is explicitly mentioned or processed.\n- `search_code(\"register_backend\")`: Assuming there might be a function or method for registering backends, looking for this can provide insights into how engines are currently added."
