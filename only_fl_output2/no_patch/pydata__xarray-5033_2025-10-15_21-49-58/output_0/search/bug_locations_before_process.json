        "intended_behavior": "The `open_dataset` method should be enhanced to allow the `engine` parameter to accept a callable (function or class) as an input, alongside the existing functionality to handle engine names as strings. This includes checking the type of the `engine` parameter, using the callable directly if it's a callable, handling errors gracefully, and updating the documentation to reflect the new capability."
