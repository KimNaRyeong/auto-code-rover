Example:\n```python\nfrom custom_backend import engine\nds = xr.load_dataset(filename, engine=engine)\n```\nThis seems like a small function change to me from my initial _quick_ look because there's mainly a bunch of string checks in the normal case until we get to the registered backend functions, if we send in a function instead in the engine-parameter we can just bypass those checks.\n</issue>"

The feature request suggests improving the way custom backends, like custom hdf formats, are integrated with xarray by allowing functions to be passed directly to the `engine` parameter of functions like `load_dataset`. This suggests we need to look into the implementation of `load_dataset` and surrounding logic that deals with the `engine` parameter and how backends are registered and invoked.\n\nLet's gather more context on how engines are currently managed:\n\n1. **Search for the `load_dataset` function**: This is the main entry point that the issue refers to, so we need to understand how it's implemented and how it currently handles the `engine` parameter.\n\n2. **Search for code handling the `engine` parameter**: Since the `engine` parameter is crucial to this request, we need to find where it's processed and where the backend engine checks occur.\n\n3. **Search for backend registration logic**: Given the mention of registering external plugins via `setup.py`, it would be useful to find the code responsible for handling the registration of backends or engines. This could involve looking for plugin registration patterns or specific methods that load or register backends.\n\nBased on these requirements, here are the API calls we should make:\n\n- `search_method(\"load_dataset\")`: To find the implementation details of the `load_dataset` function and understand its current engine handling.\n- `search_code(\"engine parameter\")`: To locate parts of the code where the `engine` parameter is explicitly mentioned or processed.\n- `search_code(\"register_backend\")`: Assuming there might be a function or method for registering backends, looking for this can provide insights into how engines are currently added."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected contexts provides an initial understanding of how the `load_dataset` function operates within the xarray project, though direct references to handling the `engine` parameter or backend registration logic were not found in the provided results. Let's dive deeper into the analysis.\n\n### Analysis of `load_dataset` Function Implementations\n\n#### `xarray/tutorial.py`\nThe `load_dataset` function in `xarray/tutorial.py` seems designed to facilitate the loading of datasets from an online repository into memory for tutorial purposes. It's a wrapper around an `open_dataset` call, which is likely a more general function used within the library for opening datasets located both locally and remotely.\n\n**Relation to the Issue**: This part of the code is more about convenience methods provided by xarray for specific use cases rather than core backend functionality. The issue, however, relates to enhancing how users specify custom backends for reading different file formats, which is more closely tied to the mechanics of `open_dataset` than this tutorial-oriented `load_dataset` implementation.\n\n#### `xarray/backends/api.py`\nThe `load_dataset` function in `xarray/backends/api.py` offers functionality to open, load into memory, and then close a `Dataset` from a file or file-like object. It's a wrapper around the `open_dataset` method, indicating that `open_dataset` may be the critical method where the engine parameter's handling and backend functionality are more explicitly defined or used.\n\n**Relation to the Issue and Intended Behavior**: This function's relationship to the issue is through its role as a higher-level abstraction that ultimately depends on `open_dataset` for dataset loading. Considering the issue's request, the underlying method (`open_dataset`) should likely be modified to accept a function as an 'engine' argument, bypassing the normal string-based engine checks. This would mean directly supporting custom backend logic without needing to register the backend in a traditional, string-identified manner.\n\n### Next Steps for Context Gathering\n\nGiven the findings and their implications, the next logical steps would involve:\n\n1. **Exploring `open_dataset` Implementation**: Since both `load_dataset` implementations wrap around `open_dataset`, understanding this method's implementation is crucial. It's where engine handling and potentially backend registration or invocation occur.\n   \n2. **Looking for Backend or Engine Handling Elsewhere**: The absence of results for \"register_backend\" and direct mentions of the engine parameter suggests a need to refine the search criteria, perhaps looking into how backends are handled more broadly or searching for specific engine names to find patterns.\n\n3. **Identifying Custom Backend Registration and Invocation Mechanics**: If direct mentions of \"register_backend\" or similar keywords didn't yield results, the functionality might be embedded within another system or named differently. Understanding the plugin system (if extant) or how external packages integrate could provide insights.\n\n### Refined API Calls to Make\n\nBased on the analysis and next steps, here are some refined API calls that could be helpful:\n\n- `search_method(\"open_dataset\")`: Provides insights into the function that `load_dataset` wraps around, which is potentially where the engine parameter is processed more concretely.\n- `search_code(\"engine=\")`: To directly locate instances where the engine parameter is being used or checked, which was not captured by searching for \"engine parameter\".\n- `search_method_in_class(\"register_backend\", \"BackendEntrypoint\")`: It's a stab in the dark, based on the assumption that there might be a class handling backend registration, even though the first search didn't find it. The class name is hypothetical and illustrates the approach rather than the exact query.\n\nThese steps and adjustments in search strategy are designed to get closer to the core of the issue and how the project's codebase could be modified to accommodate the feature request."

To resolve the issue, the method should be modified to additionally accept a direct reference to a backend engine function or class. This involves:\n\n   - **Preserving existing functionality:** Any string-based `engine` parameter values should continue to work as before, performing lookups against the registered backends.\n   - **Adding new functionality:** If the `engine` parameter is a callable (function or class), bypass the string lookup and directly use this callable for backend operations. This would allow users to pass custom backend logic without modifying the library's core or needing to register their backend in a traditional way.\n   - **Error Handling:** Ensure that if the engine parameter does not match any existing backend (either as a string or a valid callable), an informative error message is provided to the user.\n  \n   By implementing these changes, the library will support more flexible backend integrations, facilitating easier use of custom file formats and data sources while maintaining backward compatibility and existing functionality."
