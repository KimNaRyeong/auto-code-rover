Based on the updated requirements and acknowledging the previous mistake where the error was not reproduced due to the absence of the `sty` module, the revised `reproducer.py` script below will attempt to simulate the environment more closely as per the described issue. This time, it will ensure `sty` is installed before attempting the import. This is crucial because the previous attempt failed due to an ImportError, not the KeyError we are interested in.

Please note, in a real-world scenario, dependencies should be managed through proper package management tools and not dynamically within scripts. However, for the purpose of making this script self-contained and reproducible in isolation, we'll proceed with this approach.

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def install_package(package_name):
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", package_name])

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_test():
    try:
        # Ensuring that the 'sty' package is installed
        install_package('sty')

        # Attempting the import that causes the issue
        from sty import fg

        # Since the import is supposed to raise KeyError when the issue exists,
        # if the test reaches this point, it means the issue is likely fixed.
        print("Import success. The issue seems to be resolved.")
        exit(0)
    except KeyError as e:
        if e.args[0] == '__wrapped__':
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("KeyError: '__wrapped__' found. The issue is present.")
        else:
            # Raising the error if it's any other KeyError, not the one we're testing for.
            raise e
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred during setup or execution: {e}")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        run_test()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e, file=sys.stderr)
        exit(1)
```

This script will first ensure that the `sty` module is installed, mimicking a closer environment to the original issue context. If the `KeyError: '__wrapped__'` issue is still present, it will catch and print this specific exception stack trace. Additionally, it captures any unexpected errors during its setup or execution phase, providing a stack trace for those as well. This makes it easier to diagnose problems related to the environment setup or other unforeseen issues.
