The fix should include a check to ensure that the attribute exists before attempting to access it. This could either be a direct attribute check or a more comprehensive handling approach that gracefully deals with unexpected object structures. This functionality must preserve the ability to unwrap objects correctly, especially in situations where mock objects are involved, preventing unnecessary recursion while maintaining compatibility with objects that are either not mock objects or do not follow the expected mocking structure (e.g., having a '__wrapped__' attribute)."
