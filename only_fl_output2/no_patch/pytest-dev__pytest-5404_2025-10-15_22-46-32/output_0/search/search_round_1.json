        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, it's evident that the issue seems to be originating from a manipulation related to `inspect.unwrap` within the `_pytest/doctest.py` file, particularly in how it's been modified to become \"mock aware\".\n\n### Analysis of the Results\n\n#### `_mock_aware_unwrap`\n- **Purpose**: This method aims to replace `inspect.unwrap` with a version that is aware of mock objects to prevent unnecessary recursion on them. It suggests that under normal circumstances, `inspect.unwrap` could enter infinite recursion if it encounters a mock object that masquerades as a wrapper function.\n- **Relationship with the bug**: The error `KeyError: '__wrapped__'` might be directly related to this customization, especially if the function encounters an object that it incorrectly assumes has a `__wrapped__` attribute due to being a mock or similar decoration-related issues. This function tries to determine when to stop unwrapping based on whether an object is mocked, potentially leading to issues if an object doesn't conform to expected attributes.\n- **Intended Behavior**: Ideally, `_mock_aware_unwrap` should allow `inspect.unwrap` to gracefully handle mock objects without failing. It should correctly identify mock objects and not perform further unwrapping on them, thereby avoiding errors like `KeyError: '__wrapped__'`.\n\n#### Usage of `inspect.unwrap`\n- **Purpose**: These snippets show the process of temporarily replacing the standard `inspect.unwrap` function with `_mock_aware_unwrap` during some operations to make unwrapping behavior mock aware. This is crucial for avoiding recursion issues when dealing with mock objects in testing.\n- **Relationship with the bug**: The temporary patching of `inspect.unwrap` could be causing unforeseen side effects, such as the `KeyError` when certain objects are being unwrapped. If an object, directly or indirectly related to the usage of `from sty import fg`, lacks a `__wrapped__` attribute, the custom unwrapping logic might trip over it.\n- **Intended Behavior**: The patching mechanism is supposed to be a seamless improvement over the default `inspect.unwrap`, ensuring that test collection and execution in pytest, especially when dealing with doctests and mock objects, doesn't result in endless recursion or similar errors.\n\n### Going Forward\nGiven this context, a potential next step to diagnose the problem further could involve investigating:\n- How the patching mechanism interacts with different object types, including those imported from third-party modules like `sty`.\n- Whether there's any part of the code, potentially within `pytest` or related to the setup or use of `tox`, that might not comply with the expectations set by the mock-aware unwrapping function, particularly objects without a `__wrapped__` attribute but still get processed by `_mock_aware_unwrap`.\n\nConsidering the issue and the described behavior, additional API calls could include a deeper inspection into other files or modules that interact with `src/_pytest/doctest.py`, or any specific configurations set within `tox.ini` that could affect how imports or mocks are handled. Given the provided context, though, it seems we'd need access to project-specific configurations or usage examples that interact closely with the described patched behavior and the `sty` module import to pinpoint the conflict source further."

The fix should include a check to ensure that the attribute exists before attempting to access it. This could either be a direct attribute check or a more comprehensive handling approach that gracefully deals with unexpected object structures. This functionality must preserve the ability to unwrap objects correctly, especially in situations where mock objects are involved, preventing unnecessary recursion while maintaining compatibility with objects that are either not mock objects or do not follow the expected mocking structure (e.g., having a `__wrapped__` attribute).\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: \n  - **File**: `src/_pytest/doctest.py`\n  - **Method**: `_patch_unwrap_mock_aware`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: The patching mechanism introduced here should ensure that once `inspect.unwrap` is replaced with `_mock_aware_unwrap`, it does not inadvertently lead to errors when encountering objects lacking the `__wrapped__` attribute. An enhancement to the patching logic to include error handling for such cases, ensuring that the original `inspect.unwrap` functionality is preserved for objects not conforming to the expected structure, would be beneficial. This includes maintaining the performance of unwrapping operations across all objects types, including those originating from external modules, like the `sty` module mentioned in the error."
