My understanding was that both should return a unicode object. In essence, I thought \"iter_content\" was equivalent to \"iter_text\" when decode_unicode was True. Have I misunderstood something? I can provide an example if needed.\nFor reference, I'm using python 3.5.1 and requests 2.10.0.\nThanks!\n</issue>"

To understand the implementation and behavior of `iter_content` method, we'll search for this method in the codebase:\n   - `search_method(\"iter_content\")`\n\n2. Similarly, the `text` property's behavior and how it retrieves unicode content need to be understood. Knowing that `text` is likely a property, we still need to understand its underlying method or getter implementation, so a search for references in the code or a method that implements this functionality is needed:\n   - `search_code(\"r.text\")`\n\nThese calls should give us insight into how both are implemented and might hint at why their behavior differs concerning unicode handling."
