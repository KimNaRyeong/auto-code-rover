        "intended_behavior": "The code responsible for serializing `unique_together` constraints should specifically ensure that the output is ordered deterministically. This can be achieved by sorting the tuple elements that comprise the `unique_together` set based on their string representation before serializing them into the migration file. This ensures that regardless of the original order or the state of Python's hash randomization, the output in the migration files remains consistent. This sorting should apply universally to any set-like structures within the migration serialization process that might suffer from similar non-determinism, without altering the underlying functionality or representation within Django models themselves."
