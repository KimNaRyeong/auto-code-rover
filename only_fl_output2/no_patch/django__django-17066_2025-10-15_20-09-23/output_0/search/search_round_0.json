However, migrations serializer doesn't have any special facilities for ensuring stable output for sets and this is what causes annoying diffs for us all the time.\nI suggest to add a trivial serializer specifically for unordered sequences which ensures stable output no matter the iteration order. Stability can be achieved by sorting elements in the set by their string representation. This only affects the writer output, and doesn't interfere with the rest of Django in any way, so this change only improves developer experience, but has no effect on the performance and/or reliability.\nI hope that even though it's apparently not a major problem for most users you would still accept the fix to ensure stable migration writer output for the rest of us.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address this issue effectively, I will first search for relevant classes, methods, and code snippets that are directly tied to the serialization and handling of migration models, particularly focusing on parts that manage the `unique_together` constraints and their serialization. Based on the details provided in the issue description, here are the API calls I will make:\n\n1. **Search for Migration Serialization Classes**: The issue points to a problem in the serialization portion of migrations, specifically dealing with sets. Therefore, identifying the class responsible for serialization of migration files is crucial.\n\n    - `search_class(\"MigrationSerializer\")`\n\n2. **Search for ModelState class**: Since the issue mentions that constraints are normalized to sets internally in the `ModelState`, it is necessary to look into this class to understand how it handles unique and index constraints.\n\n    - `search_class(\"ModelState\")`\n\n3. **Search for AlterUniqueTogether Handling**: The issue example affects the `AlterUniqueTogether` operation, which suggests this operation or its serializer could be directly involved in causing or resolving the issue.\n\n    - `search_class(\"AlterUniqueTogether\")`\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"serialize\", \"AlterUniqueTogether\")`\n\n4. **Search for Code Snippets Matching the Issue Example**: Finally, to get the direct context of how constraints like `unique_together` are being serialized which results in the non-deterministic order, searching for code snippets similar to the example given in the issue can be helpful.\n\n    - `search_code(\"unique_together={\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to gather enough context around the classes and methods responsible for migration serialization, handling of `unique_together` constraints in model states, and the specific operation that seems to be affected by this issue. With the information gathered from these calls, it would be possible to approach a solution for ensuring deterministic order in migration files."
