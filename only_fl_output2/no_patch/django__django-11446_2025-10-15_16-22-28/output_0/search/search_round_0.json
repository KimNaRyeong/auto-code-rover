        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to default error webpages not being correctly-formed HTML pages in Django, we need to look into how Django serves these error pages in non-debug mode. Understanding how Django handles 404 errors specifically when `DEBUG=False` will be key. We should focus on how the framework builds and serves error pages in this scenario. Given the hint from the issue, the problem seems to be tied to the part of the code that generates error responses.\n\n1. Since Django uses views to handle errors like 404, we should first look for the default 404 error view. This means searching for where Django might define its default error handling views, particularly for the 404 error.\n   \n2. Also, understanding how Django decides which error page to serve in debug mode vs non-debug mode might give us insights into where the problem lies. There could be a condition or method that specifically handles rendering of these pages differently based on the debug flag.\n\n3. Given the structure of a Django project, the relevant logic might be in a views-related file or in Django\u2019s core handlers. Knowing Django's structure, the views might not directly contain the raw HTML; it could also be served through templates.\n\nBased on this analysis, here are the API calls we should make:\n- `search_method(\"page_not_found\")`: We start by looking for the method responsible for handling 404 errors, which is conventionally named something like `page_not_found` in the Django framework.\n- `search_code(\"DEBUG=False\")`: This would help us find where the code checks the DEBUG setting to potentially alter the error response.\n- `search_method(\"render\")`: Since rendering the correct HTML structure requires some form of rendering, searching for this method could help find where the error pages are generated.\n- `search_class(\"HttpResponseNotFound\")`: It's likely that Django would use a response class like `HttpResponseNotFound` for 404 errors, so we need to look into how this class is used.\n\nThese API calls are expected to give us a good starting point to understand how Django handles 404 errors and why the default error page might not be correctly formed HTML in non-debug mode."
