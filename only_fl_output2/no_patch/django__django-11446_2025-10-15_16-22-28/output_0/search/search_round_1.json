        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to default error webpages not being correctly-formed HTML pages in Django, we need to look into how Django serves these error pages in non-debug mode. Understanding how Django handles 404 errors specifically when `DEBUG=False` will be key. We should focus on how the framework builds and serves error pages in this scenario. Given the hint from the issue, the problem seems to be tied to the part of the code that generates error responses.\n\n1. Since Django uses views to handle errors like 404, we should first look for the default 404 error view. This means searching for where Django might define its default error handling views, particularly for the 404 error.\n   \n2. Also, understanding how Django decides which error page to serve in debug mode vs non-debug mode might give us insights into where the problem lies. There could be a condition or method that specifically handles rendering of these pages differently based on the debug flag.\n\n3. Given the structure of a Django project, the relevant logic might be in a views-related file or in Django\u2019s core handlers. Knowing Django's structure, the views might not directly contain the raw HTML; it could also be served through templates.\n\nBased on this analysis, here are the API calls we should make:\n- `search_method(\"page_not_found\")`: We start by looking for the method responsible for handling 404 errors, which is conventionally named something like `page_not_found` in the Django framework.\n- `search_code(\"DEBUG=False\")`: This would help us find where the code checks the DEBUG setting to potentially alter the error response.\n- `search_method(\"render\")`: Since rendering the correct HTML structure requires some form of rendering, searching for this method could help find where the error pages are generated.\n- `search_class(\"HttpResponseNotFound\")`: It's likely that Django would use a response class like `HttpResponseNotFound` for 404 errors, so we need to look into how this class is used.\n\nThese API calls are expected to give us a good starting point to understand how Django handles 404 errors and why the default error page might not be correctly formed HTML in non-debug mode."

        "content": "Analyzing the gathered context, let's go through each piece to understand its functionality, its relation to the bug, and what the intended behavior should be based on the issue description.\n\n### Analysis of `page_not_found` method in `django/views/defaults.py`\n\n1. **Functionality**: The `page_not_found` method is Django's default handler for 404 errors. It tries to render a `404.html` template with a context that includes the requested URL path and an exception message, if available. If the template `404.html` does not exist, it falls back to rendering hardcoded HTML within the method itself.\n   \n2. **Relation to the Bug**: The issue describes a scenario where the default page served for a 404 error in non-debug mode is not a correctly-formed HTML document. The fallback hardcoded HTML string in the `page_not_found` method does not include `<html>` or `<body>` tags, which directly relates to the described problem.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: Ideally, the method should ensure that the fallback error page is a full, correctly-formed HTML document. This means modifying the hardcoded HTML string to include `<html>` and `<body>` tags, aligning with the expected output described in the issue.\n\n### Analysis of `DEBUG=False` snippets\n\nThe snippets where `DEBUG=False` is mentioned do not directly impact the rendering of error pages but provide context on how Django's settings might influence the behavior of error handling and logging.\n\n1. **Functionality**: These snippets explain how Django's settings, particularly the `DEBUG` flag, influence the logging and error handling behavior. In non-debug mode (`DEBUG=False`), Django discards many log records and sends emails to site admins on HTTP 500 errors.\n\n2. **Relation to the Bug**: While these snippets do not directly address the 404 error page rendering, understanding how `DEBUG` settings affect the application's behavior is crucial. The issue occurs in `DEBUG=False` mode, highlighting the importance of how error handling differs based on this setting.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: There's no direct action required in relation to these snippets for resolving the current issue, but they help underline the importance of appropriately testing and handling errors in both debug and production environments.\n\n### Analysis of `HttpResponseNotFound` in `django/http/response.py`\n\n1. **Functionality**: The `HttpResponseNotFound` class is a subclass of `HttpResponse` that is specifically used to generate 404 responses. It sets the `status_code` to 404.\n\n2. **Relation to the Bug**: This class is likely utilized by the `page_not_found` method to return the 404 response to the user. The class itself does not define the content of the response, which is determined in the `page_not_found` method.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: The `HttpResponseNotFound` class functions as expected for a 404 error response. The modification needed to address the bug lies in the content passed to this response class, particularly ensuring the content is correctly-formed HTML.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nThe core of the issue lies within the `page_not_found` method in `django/views/defaults.py`, specifically the handling of cases where a custom `404.html` template does not exist. To resolve the issue, this method needs to be modified to ensure that the fallback HTML content includes `<html>` and `<body>` tags, making it a complete HTML document.\n\nGiven the analysis, the next step is to craft a patch modifying the `page_not_found` method's fallback HTML to include these tags, ensuring the response is correctly-formed HTML even when a custom `404.html` is not present."

This implies modifying the existing fallback HTML content to include `<html>` and `<body>` tags around the current content. The modified part of the method should look something like this:\n\n```python\n# Fallback in case a custom 404.html is not provided\ntemplate = Engine().from_string('''\n<html>\n<body>\n    <h1>Not Found</h1><p>The requested resource was not found on this server.</p>\n</body>\n</html>''')\nbody = template.render(Context(context))\ncontent_type = 'text/html'\n```\n\nThis change ensures that even in the absence of a custom `404.html` template, the response returned to the user will be a correctly-formed HTML document, addressing the core issue raised."
