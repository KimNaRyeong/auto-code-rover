Creating a standalone Django script to reproduce the issue described requires a different approach, especially considering the error encountered with models and app labels. Here's an attempt that focuses on mimicking the Django setup as close as possible within a script, bypassing the error related to models not being recognized due to missing app labels. This approach involves creating a minimal Django environment programmatically.

This script is designed to demonstrate the issue related to `SimpleLazyObject` in Django's `TemplateView.get_context_data()` method as described. It makes an assumption about Djangoâ€™s project setup and simplifies it for the sake of reproducing the issue. This script might need adjustments to fully integrate with different Django project setups.

This script is more of a conceptual representation and may require adjustments for exact scenarios or Django setups. It simulates the Django environment, including the minimal model and view setup required to test the issue described, all within a single Python file. The script tries to navigate around the problem of not having a dedicated Django app and not running in a full Django project context. It uses an in-memory SQLite database, which is created and migrated at runtime. Please note that using Django in such a scripted way is unconventional and primarily used for demonstration or testing purposes.
