If we provide a CSS style to draw a border around a `<kbd>` element, so single keystrokes are displayed correctly, then in the second example we'd get a double border (borders around the child elements, and another border around the parent element).\nIf you want to have borders around single keystrokes, and only around the child `<kbd>` elements in compound keystrokes, as shown on the screenshot below, the only way is to differentiate the container and child `<kbd>` elements with a CSS class.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/698770/103331868-9091ae80-4ab3-11eb-980a-94743f279511.png)\n**Expected behavior**\nSingle keystrokes are fine as they are, no change needed:\n```html\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">A</kbd>\n```\nFor compound keystrokes, the container `<kbd>` element should be marked with a CSS class (e.g. `compound`) so it can be styled differently than the child `<kbd>` elements:\n```html\n<kbd class=\"kbd compound docutils literal notranslate\">\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">Shift</kbd>+\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">X</kbd>\n</kbd>\n```\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Windows\n- Python version: 3.9.1\n- Sphinx version: 3.4.0\n- Sphinx extensions: -\n- Extra tools: -\n</issue>"

The issue refers to the generation of HTML elements for keyboard shortcuts and their styling, particularly differentiating between single and compound keystrokes in the HTML output.\n\nGiven this, we aim to find the part of the Sphinx codebase that handles the rendering of the `:kbd:` role to HTML. This will likely involve identifying the method or function responsible for processing the `:kbd:` role and then determining how the HTML is generated, allowing us to propose a modification to include a differentiating CSS class for compound keystrokes.\n\nTo begin, my API calls will be focused on identifying where the `:kbd:` role processing happens within Sphinx:\n\n1. Search for any class or method directly associated with the `:kbd:` role handling. Since the role is specific and might be handled by a named method or within a specific class, start with:\n   - `search_method(\"kbd\")`\n\n2. If the direct search does not yield useful results, the exact handling might be inside a more general method or class related to roles or directives processing. Therefore, we should also look into classes or methods that could be responsible for roles processing in general:\n   - `search_class(\"Role\")`\n   - `search_class(\"Directive\")`\n\n3. Lastly, if the Sphinx extensions could modify or influence how roles are processed, identifying any extension-related classes or methods could also be beneficial, though the issue does not specifically mention custom extensions being used:\n   - `search_class(\"Extension\")`\n\nThese searches aim to locate the part of the Sphinx codebase where the `:kbd:` role is processed and to find how the HTML output is generated for this role. After identifying the relevant sections, we can explore how to implement the requested feature of adding a CSS class to differentiate between single and compound keystrokes in the resulting HTML."

        "content": "Analyzing the provided search results, it's apparent that the initial attempt to find methods or classes directly associated with handling the `:kbd:` role or broadly related classes like `Role` or `Directive` came up empty. This could imply that the handling of roles, including `:kbd:`, is integrated into a more general part of Sphinx's processing workflow, rather than being managed by discretely named entities in the codebase that easily map to the Sphinx domain-specific language elements.\n\nThe search result for an `Extension` class in `sphinx/extension.py` suggests that extensions are a key part of Sphinx's architecture, allowing for customization and addition of features beyond Sphinx's core functionality. The `Extension` class likely serves as a base or utility for implementing extensions in Sphinx. Given the issue does not directly relate to an external extension but instead concerns the core rendering of markup to HTML\u2014a task Sphinx should handle internally\u2014the direct relevance of the `Extension` class to solving this specific issue seems minimal at this point.\n\nGiven these outcomes, we need to pivot our approach to consider how Sphinx translates reStructuredText (rST) directives and roles into HTML, focusing on mechanisms that might not be explicitly named after the roles or directives themselves. Recalling that Sphinx is built on docutils, a Python library for processing plaintext documentation into useful formats, including HTML, it's plausible that handling of something like the `:kbd:` role could be situated in a part of the code dealing with general rST to HTML conversion or styling.\n\nWith this in mind, further investigation could involve looking into:\n1. The docutils processing pipeline within Sphinx, since Sphinx extends docutils for many of its document processing capabilities.\n2. Any classes or methods related to HTML rendering or styling, possibly within the context of roles and directives conversion process.\n\nTherefore, the next steps in our API calls should aim to uncover these mechanisms:\n- Search for methods or classes involved in converting rST to HTML, or in rendering or styling processes within Sphinx. This could involve searching for keywords like \"render\", \"convert\", or \"HTML\" to find relevant parts of the codebase.\n- Given the specific challenge of enhancing the HTML output, locate any functionality that manages styling or CSS class assignments for elements generated from rST.\n\nThese approaches will hopefully yield insights into where the handling of the `:kbd:` role occurs and how we might insert the necessary logic to add a distinguishing CSS class to compound keystrokes."
