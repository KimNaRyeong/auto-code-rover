If we provide a CSS style to draw a border around a `<kbd>` element, so single keystrokes are displayed correctly, then in the second example we'd get a double border (borders around the child elements, and another border around the parent element).\nIf you want to have borders around single keystrokes, and only around the child `<kbd>` elements in compound keystrokes, as shown on the screenshot below, the only way is to differentiate the container and child `<kbd>` elements with a CSS class.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/698770/103331868-9091ae80-4ab3-11eb-980a-94743f279511.png)\n**Expected behavior**\nSingle keystrokes are fine as they are, no change needed:\n```html\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">A</kbd>\n```\nFor compound keystrokes, the container `<kbd>` element should be marked with a CSS class (e.g. `compound`) so it can be styled differently than the child `<kbd>` elements:\n```html\n<kbd class=\"kbd compound docutils literal notranslate\">\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">Shift</kbd>+\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">X</kbd>\n</kbd>\n```\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Windows\n- Python version: 3.9.1\n- Sphinx version: 3.4.0\n- Sphinx extensions: -\n- Extra tools: -\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand where and how the HTML for the `:kbd:` role is generated within the Sphinx project. The issue refers to the generation of HTML elements for keyboard shortcuts and their styling, particularly differentiating between single and compound keystrokes in the HTML output.\n\nGiven this, we aim to find the part of the Sphinx codebase that handles the rendering of the `:kbd:` role to HTML. This will likely involve identifying the method or function responsible for processing the `:kbd:` role and then determining how the HTML is generated, allowing us to propose a modification to include a differentiating CSS class for compound keystrokes.\n\nTo begin, my API calls will be focused on identifying where the `:kbd:` role processing happens within Sphinx:\n\n1. Search for any class or method directly associated with the `:kbd:` role handling. Since the role is specific and might be handled by a named method or within a specific class, start with:\n   - `search_method(\"kbd\")`\n\n2. If the direct search does not yield useful results, the exact handling might be inside a more general method or class related to roles or directives processing. Therefore, we should also look into classes or methods that could be responsible for roles processing in general:\n   - `search_class(\"Role\")`\n   - `search_class(\"Directive\")`\n\n3. Lastly, if the Sphinx extensions could modify or influence how roles are processed, identifying any extension-related classes or methods could also be beneficial, though the issue does not specifically mention custom extensions being used:\n   - `search_class(\"Extension\")`\n\nThese searches aim to locate the part of the Sphinx codebase where the `:kbd:` role is processed and to find how the HTML output is generated for this role. After identifying the relevant sections, we can explore how to implement the requested feature of adding a CSS class to differentiate between single and compound keystrokes in the resulting HTML."
