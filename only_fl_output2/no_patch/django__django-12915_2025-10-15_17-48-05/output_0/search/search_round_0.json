        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about the specific components mentioned in the issue. Based on the description, the focus would be on understanding the implementation of `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` and `StaticFilesHandlerMixin`, specifically looking for the existence or implementation details of `get_response_async` method in these or related classes. We should also understand the structure of `ASGIHandler` or related base classes to identify how `get_response_async` is intended to be invoked.\n\nGiven these needs, the following API calls would be appropriate to collect the necessary code context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ASGIStaticFilesHandler\")`: To get more information on the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` class, as this is the direct subject of the issue.\n\n2. `search_class(\"StaticFilesHandlerMixin\")`: To get more information on `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` as it is mentioned to be missing the async response function which could be causing the issue.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"get_response_async\", \"ASGIStaticFilesHandler\")`: To check if `get_response_async` method is implemented directly in `ASGIStaticFilesHandler`.\n\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"get_response_async\", \"StaticFilesHandlerMixin\")`: Since the issue suggests that `get_response_async` might need to be added or is missing from `StaticFilesHandlerMixin`, this will confirm its absence.\n\n5. `search_method(\"get_response_async\")`: To see how `get_response_async` is implemented in other parts of the framework or if it is defined in a base class that `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` should be inheriting from, but isn't.\n\nThese API calls will provide a broad overview, from specific classes involved in the issue to a wider search for the method in question, ensuring a thorough understanding of where the missing pieces might fit into the project's current structure."
