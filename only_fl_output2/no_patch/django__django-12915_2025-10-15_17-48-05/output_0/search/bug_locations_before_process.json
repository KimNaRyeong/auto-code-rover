        "intended_behavior": "This class should include a new method, `get_response_async`, which is responsible for asynchronously handling requests for static files. Given that the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` class is designed to work in an ASGI environment where asynchronous request handling is essential, the `get_response_async` method should be implemented to process requests in a non-blocking manner. The method should be capable of determining if a request is for a static file and, if so, serving the file asynchronously. If a request is not for a static file, it should delegate to the next handler in the chain, adhering to ASGI protocol standards. This ensures that the static file serving mechanism is fully compatible with asynchronous environments, maintaining efficiency and responsiveness, and aligning with the core principles of ASGI applications."
