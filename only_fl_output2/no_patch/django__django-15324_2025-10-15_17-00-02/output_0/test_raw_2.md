Here's an updated version of the `reproducer.py` script which addresses the requirement to raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present. This version attempts to directly target the described failure behavior, taking into account the specific error handling and exit codes as specified:

```python
# reproducer.py
import requests
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    contents = "." * (1024 * 1024 * 2.5)  # Float notation corrected for byte size calculation
    files = {"docfile": ("bogus.txt\x00", contents, "text/plain")}  # Null byte introduced in filename

    try:
        # Attempting to send the POST request to the server
        response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/", files=files)
        
        if response.status_code == 500:
            raise AssertionError("Server responded with a 500 status code, issue present.")

        print("The server did not crash, issue appears to be fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit normally indicating the issue does not exist

    except AssertionError as ae:
        print("AssertionError encountered!")
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code indicating the assertion was raised
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch all other exceptions that might be raised due to issues unrelated to the assertion
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code indicating an unexpected error was encountered

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This script is designed to be executed in the environment where the target Django application is running and accessible at `http://localhost:8000/`. Before running the script, ensure that the Django server is running and the application is ready to receive file uploads.

The script performs the following actions:
1. Prepares a file content that triggers the issue, specifically using a null byte in the filename.
2. Sends a POST request to the Django server with the malformed file.
3. Checks if the server responds with a `500` status code, which would imply the server crashed due to the issue.
4. Raises an `AssertionError` if the server crashes, prints the error stack trace, and exits with code `1`.
5. If the server does not crash, the script prints a success message and exits with code `0`, indicating the issue might be fixed.

This approach offers a programmatic way to verify the presence of the described issue, aiding in testing patches or fixes applied to the Django application handling file uploads.
