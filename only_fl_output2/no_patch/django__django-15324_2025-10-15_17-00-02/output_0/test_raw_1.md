Given the correction needed for the multiplication by a float, this revised standalone Python script `reproducer.py` should properly reproduce the issue:

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def send_malformed_request():
    try:
        # Create a dummy file content large enough to trigger the issue
        dummy_content = '.' * (1024 * 1024 * 3)  # Corrected integer calculation for file size.
        files = {"docfile": ("bogus.txt\x00", dummy_content, "text/plain")}
        
        # Prepare the malicious request
        req = requests.Request("POST", "http://localhost:8000/", files=files, data={})
        prepared = req.prepare()
        
        # Check for the assertion to prove if the issue exists
        assert isinstance(prepared.body, bytes), "Request body is not a byte sequence as expected."

        # Sending the request to the server
        response = requests.Session().send(prepared)
        
        if response.status_code == 500:
            print("Issue reproduced: Server responded with a 500 status code.")
            sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 indicating that the issue is present.
        else:
            print("The issue might have been fixed. Response code:", response.status_code)
            sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating no error.

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    send_malformed_request()
```

To execute this test:

1. Ensure your Django server (hosting the vulnerable code) is running locally on `http://localhost:8000/`.
2. Place `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your Django project (or any desired location where it has network access to the Django server).
3. Run the script using `python3 reproducer.py`.

- This script attempts to upload a file with a null byte in the filename, aiming to trigger the error described.
- It checks if the server response status code is `500` (indicating a server error), which would suggest the issue exists.
- The script uses an assert statement to add an additional check if the body of the prepared request is a bytes object as expected. If this assertion fails, it means there's something fundamentally different about how the request is being assembled or sent, which could itself be an issue or might indicate changes in library behaviors.
- The `print_stacktrace` function is used to print a detailed stack trace if an unexpected exception is caught, aiding in debugging.
