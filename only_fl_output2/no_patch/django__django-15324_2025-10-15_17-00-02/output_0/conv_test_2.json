Ensure your Django server (hosting the vulnerable code) is running locally on `http://localhost:8000/`.\n2. Place `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your Django project (or any desired location where it has network access to the Django server).\n3. Run the script using `python3 reproducer.py`.\n\n- This script attempts to upload a file with a null byte in the filename, aiming to trigger the error described.\n- It checks if the server response status code is `500` (indicating a server error), which would suggest the issue exists.\n- The script uses an assert statement to add an additional check if the body of the prepared request is a bytes object as expected. If this assertion fails, it means there's something fundamentally different about how the request is being assembled or sent, which could itself be an issue or might indicate changes in library behaviors.\n- The `print_stacktrace` function is used to print a detailed stack trace if an unexpected exception is caught, aiding in debugging."
