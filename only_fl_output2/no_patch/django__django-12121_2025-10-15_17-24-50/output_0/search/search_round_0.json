        "content": "<issue>Feature/docs: how should url converters decline to match for a named route?\nDescription\nIt is sometimes convenient to have multiple instances of a named route, where the correct one is chosen based on whether the URL converters to_url call succeeds. For example, the attached file has routes like this:\npath('export/foo/<foo:obj>', index, name='export'),\npath('export/bar/<bar:obj>', index, name='export'),\nI then wanted to put {% url \"export\" some_foo_or_bar %} in a generic export template and have the correct URL inserted.\nMy first attempt to do this was to raise ValueError in to_url for non-matching values, hoping that it would work the same as to_python where the docs specify that \"A ValueError is interpreted as no match.\"\nThat didn't work -- nothing catches the ValueError in to_url -- so I found the workaround demonstrated in the attachment: if to_url returns an empty string (or some string that doesn't match the converter's regex), then the later regex check in _reverse_with_prefix will detect the non-match and everything seems to work out.\nSo this is either a feature request or a documentation check. I'm thinking either:\n_reverse_with_prefix could be updated so to_url works the same as to_python, and a ValueError indicates no match (which I think just means wrapping try: ... except ValueError: continue around the appropriate line), or\nthe docs could be updated to indicate that, in to_url, a converter should return a non-regex-matching string such as the empty string in order to decline a match.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To understand and address the issue, we need to gather information on a few key areas of the codebase:\n\n1. **How the `to_url` method is implemented for custom URL converters**: Since the issue revolves around the behavior of `to_url` when it needs to decline to match a URL, it's essential we see how these converters are currently defined and function.\n\n2. **The `_reverse_with_prefix` method**: The issue suggests modifying `_reverse_with_prefix` to catch `ValueError` thrown by `to_url` or to document the current expected behavior of `to_url`. Therefore, seeing the current implementation of `_reverse_with_prefix` will give insight into potential changes.\n\n3. **Current usage of custom URL converters in routing**: An example of how custom URL converters are used within the router configuration might offer additional context on expected behaviors and integration points.\n\n4. **Documentation or comments mentioning `ValueError` in relation to `to_url` or `to_python`**: This could highlight current expectations or guidance provided to developers regarding the handling of non-matching cases in URL converters.\n\nHere are the API calls I would make to obtain the necessary context:\n\n- `search_method(\"to_url\")`: To find implementations or definitions of `to_url` in custom URL converters across the codebase.\n- `search_method(\"_reverse_with_prefix\")`: To inspect the handling within this method and see if and how `ValueError` is currently considered.\n- `search_code(\"path(\")`: Since the issue mentions the use of paths like `path('export/foo/<foo:obj>', index, name='export')`, searching for similar `path` function calls can help find usage examples of custom converters.\n- `search_code(\"ValueError\")`: This will help find instances where `ValueError` is specifically mentioned or used in the context of URL routing or conversion, potentially revealing existing patterns or documentation comments related to the issue.\n\nThis approach should provide a comprehensive overview of both the problem and potential points of intervention in the codebase."
