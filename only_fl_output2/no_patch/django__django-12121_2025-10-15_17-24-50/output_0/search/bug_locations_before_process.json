        "intended_behavior": "The code within `_reverse_with_prefix` should be modified to encapsulate the call to `converters[k].to_url(v)` within a try-except block, specifically catching `ValueError`. This catch should be interpreted as an indication that the conversion cannot be fulfilled for the given value, signifying that the current route does not match. Instead of raising an exception, the method should then continue to the next possible route. This adjustment allows for the use of `ValueError` within custom `to_url` methods to signal that a specific argument does not meet the necessary criteria for a successful URL conversion, thus enabling the routing mechanism to search for another route that might match.\n\nThe addition does not interfere with existing functionalities but extends the behavior of URL conversion error handling. This change provides a more flexible way for developers to control the URL matching process in complex scenarios, where the determination of a match might depend on dynamic conditions or specific properties of the objects being passed to the URL converters.\n\nThis modification enhances Django's URL routing system by making it more adaptable to complex routing scenarios without impacting applications that do not rely on this specific use case."
