This reintroduction should ensure that when a user specifies the `order` parameter, it correctly influences the memory layout of the resulting array. The implementation must default to the current behavior when `order` is not provided, thereby maintaining backward compatibility and expected functionality for other aspects of xarray that utilize `astype`."

It should seamlessly pass the `order` parameter to the backend-specific `astype` operations or provide a fallback mechanism that closely emulates the desired memory order effect."

It should delegate appropriately, considering the `order` parameter in its operations to uphold the users' specifications regarding memory layout. This might involve ensuring the parameter reaches the more granular `astype` implementations with accurate parameter passing or handling."
