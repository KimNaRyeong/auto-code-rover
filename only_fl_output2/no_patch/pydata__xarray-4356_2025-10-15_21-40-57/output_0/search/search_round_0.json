The user has already given us a specific location in the code where they suspect a fix can be applied. They believe changing `mask.shape[axis]` to `np.take(a.shape, axis).prod()` might resolve the issue. \n\nGiven this, I will prioritize the following actions:\n1. Inspect the code at the specified location in `nanops.py` to understand how `sum` with `min_count` is currently implemented for multi-dimensional reductions.\n2. Ensure we understand how `mask` and `a` are defined and used within this functionality.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps:\n\n1. Get the code context around the lines mentioned by the user in `nanops.py`.\n2. Search for where and how `mask` and `a` are used or defined in relation to our issue within the same file, primarily focusing on the reduction logic.\n\nAPI calls:\n\n- `get_code_around_line(\"xarray/core/nanops.py\", 35, 10)` to view the logic involved in calculating the number of valid elements.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"mask.shape\", \"xarray/core/nanops.py\")` and `search_code_in_file(\"a.shape\", \"xarray/core/nanops.py\")` to understand the uses and definitions of `mask` and `a` in that context."
