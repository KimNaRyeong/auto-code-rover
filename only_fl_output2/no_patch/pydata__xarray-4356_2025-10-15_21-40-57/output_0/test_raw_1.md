Given the feedback, let's ensure that the script properly attempts to reproduce the specific issue concerning the `sum` method with `min_count` on an `xarray.DataArray` across multiple dimensions. I'll adjust the code to handle exceptions more accurately to reflect whether the specific problem is present and ensure that we're directly testing the issue described.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import xarray as xr
    import numpy as np

    # Redefining a more specific check for the issue based on its nature
    try:
        da = xr.DataArray([[1., 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dims=["dim_0", "dim_1"])
        result = da.sum(["dim_0", "dim_1"], min_count=1)
        # Expectation: The operation completes successfully, indicating the issue would be fixed.
        print("Operation completed successfully.")
    except ValueError as e:
        if "min_count is not available for reduction with more than one dimensions" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1) # Exiting with code 1 to indicate the specific issue was caught
        else:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("An unexpected ValueError was raised")
    except Exception as e:
        # If there's any other exception, it might be unrelated or indicate a different problem.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An unexpected exception was encountered")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception:
        exit(1)
    else:
        exit(0) # Exit with code 0 to indicate no issue was found with the expected behavior
```

This script should directly target the reported issue, attempting the operation that was described to fail. It handles two distinct outcomes:
- If the `sum` operation succeeds, it implies the issue might be fixed, and the script exits normally.
- If the `sum` operation raises a `ValueError` that specifically matches the reported issue, it prints the stack trace and exits with code 1, indicating the issue has been reproduced.
- Any other exception will raise an `AssertionError` with information about the unexpected behavior or error.
