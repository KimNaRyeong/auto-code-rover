```

This script checks for a specific error message related to the `min_count` parameter usage with the `sum` method across multiple dimensions in an `xarray.DataArray`. If the issue described in the problem statement is reproduced (the specific error message is caught), the script raises an `AssertionError` with a relevant message. If the operation passes without exceptions or with a different error message, the outcome suggests the issue might have been resolved or differs from what was initially described.
