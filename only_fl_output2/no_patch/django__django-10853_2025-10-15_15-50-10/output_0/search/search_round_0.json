        "content": "<issue>SQLite (pre 3.25.0) does not support window functions, raises OperationalError\nDescription\nWindow functions are supported in SQLite 3.25.0 and newer, but Python 3.6.7 and 3.7.1 only ships with SQLite 3.21.0. Window function syntax is invalid for older versions.\nAs per the title, window functions therefore aren't supported, but Django doesn't check the SQLite version or availability of window functions. Instead, when the generated SQL is executed, the sqlite3 Python library raises the SQLite syntax error as sqlite3.OperationalError, which in turn is reraised as django.db.utils.OperationalError.\nI believe this is not intended behaviour, as it is incredibly confusing, and not documented. Typically, if a database feature is not supported, Django will explicitly raise an error when attempting it, rather than allowing the SQL execution to fail. It is also normally documented.\nThe following code raises an exception (it should work for any model):\nfrom django.db.models import F, Window\nfrom django.db.models.functions.window import RowNumber\n# import the model\nMyModel.objects.annotate(rn=Window(expression=RowNumber(), order_by=[F('pk')]))\nBasic Python code that will also raise sqlite3.OperationalError:\nimport sqlite3\nconn = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")\nc = conn.cursor()\nc.execute(\"CREATE TABLE t0(x INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, y TEXT)\")\nc.execute(\"INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (1, 'aaa'), (2, 'ccc'), (3, 'bbb')\")\nc.execute(\"SELECT x, y, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY y) AS row_number FROM t0 ORDER BY x\")\nTested on master branch (commit c5568340a525ab9c6898ed02c257394cc47285d7) with Python 3.6.6 64-bit (Windows 10 x64). This likely also affects 2.0 and 2.1 branches.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the mentioned issue effectively, we need to gather context on how Django interacts with SQLite, particularly how it checks (or fails to check) SQLite version compatibility before attempting to execute SQL syntax that requires a newer version of SQLite (3.25.0+) for window functions. This involves looking into the areas of Django that deal with model queries and database connections, specifically for SQLite.\n\n1. **Database backend for SQLite:** Since the issue is with SQLite, we first need to understand how Django configures and interacts with the SQLite database. This means looking into Django's database backend for SQLite.\n\n2. **Window function usage in Django models:** It is also crucial to see how Django models utilize window functions, which involves annotating querysets with methods like `Window()`.\n\n3. **OperationalError handling:** Since the problem results in an `OperationalError`, it's important to see how Django catches and handles these errors during database operations.\n\n4. **Checking SQLite version:** Lastly, to suggest a direct solution to the problem, finding out if and how Django currently checks SQLite version would be necessary to implement version-based feature gating for using window functions.\n\nLet's proceed with the first round of API calls to get the necessary context:\n- `search_class(\"DatabaseWrapper\")` to understand how Django's database backend for SQLite is implemented, as it's likely involved in version checking and feature support.\n- `search_method(\"annotate\")` to see how the annotate method (which is used in the issue's code snippet) is defined and how it could potentially interact with window functions.\n- `search_code(\"sqlite3.OperationalError\")` to find instances where Django specifically deals with `sqlite3.OperationalError`, which might show us current error handling strategies that could be relevant to this issue.\n- `search_code(\"sqlite_version\")` to find any existing checks for the SQLite version, which would be a starting point for implementing a new version check for window function support."
