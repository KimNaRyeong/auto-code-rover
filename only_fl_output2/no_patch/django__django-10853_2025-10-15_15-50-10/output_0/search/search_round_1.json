        "content": "<issue>SQLite (pre 3.25.0) does not support window functions, raises OperationalError\nDescription\nWindow functions are supported in SQLite 3.25.0 and newer, but Python 3.6.7 and 3.7.1 only ships with SQLite 3.21.0. Window function syntax is invalid for older versions.\nAs per the title, window functions therefore aren't supported, but Django doesn't check the SQLite version or availability of window functions. Instead, when the generated SQL is executed, the sqlite3 Python library raises the SQLite syntax error as sqlite3.OperationalError, which in turn is reraised as django.db.utils.OperationalError.\nI believe this is not intended behaviour, as it is incredibly confusing, and not documented. Typically, if a database feature is not supported, Django will explicitly raise an error when attempting it, rather than allowing the SQL execution to fail. It is also normally documented.\nThe following code raises an exception (it should work for any model):\nfrom django.db.models import F, Window\nfrom django.db.models.functions.window import RowNumber\n# import the model\nMyModel.objects.annotate(rn=Window(expression=RowNumber(), order_by=[F('pk')]))\nBasic Python code that will also raise sqlite3.OperationalError:\nimport sqlite3\nconn = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")\nc = conn.cursor()\nc.execute(\"CREATE TABLE t0(x INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, y TEXT)\")\nc.execute(\"INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (1, 'aaa'), (2, 'ccc'), (3, 'bbb')\")\nc.execute(\"SELECT x, y, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY y) AS row_number FROM t0 ORDER BY x\")\nTested on master branch (commit c5568340a525ab9c6898ed02c257394cc47285d7) with Python 3.6.6 64-bit (Windows 10 x64). This likely also affects 2.0 and 2.1 branches.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the mentioned issue effectively, we need to gather context on how Django interacts with SQLite, particularly how it checks (or fails to check) SQLite version compatibility before attempting to execute SQL syntax that requires a newer version of SQLite (3.25.0+) for window functions. This involves looking into the areas of Django that deal with model queries and database connections, specifically for SQLite.\n\n1. **Database backend for SQLite:** Since the issue is with SQLite, we first need to understand how Django configures and interacts with the SQLite database. This means looking into Django's database backend for SQLite.\n\n2. **Window function usage in Django models:** It is also crucial to see how Django models utilize window functions, which involves annotating querysets with methods like `Window()`.\n\n3. **OperationalError handling:** Since the problem results in an `OperationalError`, it's important to see how Django catches and handles these errors during database operations.\n\n4. **Checking SQLite version:** Lastly, to suggest a direct solution to the problem, finding out if and how Django currently checks SQLite version would be necessary to implement version-based feature gating for using window functions.\n\nLet's proceed with the first round of API calls to get the necessary context:\n- `search_class(\"DatabaseWrapper\")` to understand how Django's database backend for SQLite is implemented, as it's likely involved in version checking and feature support.\n- `search_method(\"annotate\")` to see how the annotate method (which is used in the issue's code snippet) is defined and how it could potentially interact with window functions.\n- `search_code(\"sqlite3.OperationalError\")` to find instances where Django specifically deals with `sqlite3.OperationalError`, which might show us current error handling strategies that could be relevant to this issue.\n- `search_code(\"sqlite_version\")` to find any existing checks for the SQLite version, which would be a starting point for implementing a new version check for window function support."

        "content": "Based on the collected context, let's analyze each piece to understand its relation to the reported issue and deduce the next steps:\n\n### 1. `DatabaseWrapper` Class in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py`\n- **What it does:** This class is likely responsible for encapsulating database-specific behavior, connection handling, and setup for SQLite. It is the core class through which Django interacts with the SQLite database.\n- **Relation to the bug:** Given that the issue involves Django's handling (or lack thereof) of SQLite version-specific features, `DatabaseWrapper` in `sqlite3/base.py` could contain logic related to initializing connections which might include version checking or could be extended to do so.\n- **Intended behavior:** Ideally, this class would check the SQLite version early in the connection setup process and set feature flags accordingly, such as whether window functions are supported.\n\n### 2. `annotate` Method in `QuerySet` Class\n- **What it does:** This method allows adding annotations to querysets, which could be extra data or aggregations. It's primarily used for extending the returned objects with additional properties dynamically.\n- **Relation to the bug:** The issue arises when using window functions via the `annotate` method with an SQLite version that does not support them. While `annotate` itself might not check database capabilities, enhancements here or in underlying methods it relies on could prevent misuse.\n- **Intended behavior:** The `annotate` method (or the mechanisms it uses) should ideally be aware of database features supported by the current connection. This prevents forming unsupported queries based on the database version, especially for features like window functions introduced in later versions.\n\n### 3. `sqlite3.OperationalError` Search Result\n- **What it does:** The search for `sqlite3.OperationalError` did not yield results, which indicates either the exception handling is done at a higher level without direct references, or it's not specifically caught for feature-version mismatches.\n- **Relation to the bug:** Direct handling of `sqlite3.OperationalError` might be necessary to provide informative errors when unsupported SQL syntax is used. Its absence suggests room for improvement in handling SQLite syntax errors due to version incompatibilities.\n- **Intended behavior:** Ideally, Django would catch `sqlite3.OperationalError` related to syntax at a point where it can distinguish it as a version mismatch issue and provide a clearer error message, or even avoid the error by preceding checks.\n\n### 4. `sqlite_version` Search Result\n- **What it does:** References to `sqlite_version` in `features.py` and `base.py` indicate that there's awareness and potential checking of SQLite version somewhere in the Django project.\n- **Relation to the bug:** This is directly relevant because our issue stems from the need to conditionally support features based on the SQLite version. Existing `sqlite_version` checks could be a foundation for extending support for detecting window function support.\n- **Intended behavior:** These sections of the code should be determining the capabilities of the SQLite version in use (such as support for window functions) and enabling or disabling functionality based on that, ideally avoiding attempts to use unsupported SQL features.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the analysis above, there are a few concrete paths forward to gather more details necessary for resolving the issue:\n1. **DatabaseWrapper's SQLite Version Handling:** We need to look into how `DatabaseWrapper` in `sqlite3/base.py` interacts with SQLite versions. This can specifically include how features are flagged based on the version.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"sqlite_version\", \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py\")` to see how versions are currently checked or mentioned.\n   \n2. **SQLite Feature Flags:** Since `sqlite_version` appears in `features.py`, checking there could reveal how Django flags database features based on the version.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"sqlite_version\", \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/features.py\")` to explore feature flags related to versions.\n\n3. **Improve OperationalError Handling:** Considering the `OperationalError` wasn't directly found, further investigation into where and how database errors are caught and handled would be beneficial.\n   - Investigating the error handling in Django when executing SQL might require reviewing how exceptions are propagated in Django's ORM layer, but without specific API calls related to error propagation, this might involve manual code review based on the current findings.\n\nThese steps aim to understand current SQLite version checking, extend it to account for newer features like window functions, and enhance error messaging or avoidance mechanisms within Django."
