This script checks whether the SQLite version used supports window functions and tries to execute a query that includes a window function. If the SQLite version is below 3.25.0, it is expected not to support window functions, and the code is designed to highlight this correctly. If an OperationalError is raised due to the usage of window functions in an unsupported SQLite version, the script handles this gracefully.

If the SQLite version is adequate (3.25.0 or newer) but an error still occurs, it prints a stack trace of the error. The script exits with code 0 if the test passes without issues, indicating that window functions are supported or that the failure is expected due to an older SQLite version. In cases of unexpected errors or assertions, it exits with code 1 after printing the relevant stack trace.
