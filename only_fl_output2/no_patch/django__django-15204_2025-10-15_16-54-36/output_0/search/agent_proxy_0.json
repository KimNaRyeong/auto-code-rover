Specifically, we're looking at classes and methods mentioned in the stack trace of the exception related to `DurationField` and its `clean` method, as well as the `parse_duration` function in `django/utils/dateparse.py`. Let's break down the necessary API calls:\n\n1. Since the issue mentions the `DurationField` class and its `clean` method, we should get more context about this class and method. We know it's likely part of Django's forms framework:\n   - `search_class(\"DurationField\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"clean\", \"DurationField\")`\n\n2. The issue also involves the `parse_duration` method, which fails when attempting to process a malformed string. This method is in `django/utils/dateparse.py`:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"parse_duration\", \"django/utils/dateparse.py\")`\n\nThis selection of API calls should provide sufficient context surrounding the `DurationField`'s handling of input and specifically how `parse_duration` is involved in this processing."
