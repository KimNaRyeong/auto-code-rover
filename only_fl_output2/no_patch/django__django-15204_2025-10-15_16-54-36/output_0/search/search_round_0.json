        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather context about where and how the issue occurs within the codebase. Specifically, we're looking at classes and methods mentioned in the stack trace of the exception related to `DurationField` and its `clean` method, as well as the `parse_duration` function in `django/utils/dateparse.py`. Let's break down the necessary API calls:\n\n1. Since the issue mentions the `DurationField` class and its `clean` method, we should get more context about this class and method. We know it's likely part of Django's forms framework:\n   - `search_class(\"DurationField\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"clean\", \"DurationField\")`\n\n2. The issue also involves the `parse_duration` method, which fails when attempting to process a malformed string. This method is in `django/utils/dateparse.py`:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"parse_duration\", \"django/utils/dateparse.py\")`\n\nThis selection of API calls should provide sufficient context surrounding the `DurationField`'s handling of input and specifically how `parse_duration` is involved in this processing."
