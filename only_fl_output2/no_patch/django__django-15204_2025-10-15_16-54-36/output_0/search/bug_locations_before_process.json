        "intended_behavior": "This function should be fortified to handle malformed inputs more gracefully. When encountering strings that can't be converted to floats (for parts of the duration), it should either raise a ValueError with a clear, user-friendly message indicating the malformed part of the input or return a specific error indication. This change aims to avoid uncaught exceptions by either preemptively validating the input against expected formats or ensuring that any conversion attempts are wrapped with appropriate error handling that can translate low-level Python exceptions (e.g., `ValueError: could not convert string to float`) into more informative, high-level error messages reflecting the domain (i.e., duration parsing)."
