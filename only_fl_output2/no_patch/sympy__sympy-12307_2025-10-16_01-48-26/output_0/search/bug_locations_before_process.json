        "intended_behavior": "The `_print_Function` method needs to include specific handling for the `sign` function to generate valid Fortran code. When the `sign` function is encountered, instead of translating it directly as `sign(x)`, which is not valid Fortran syntax, the method should produce `sign(1, x)` for general cases or `sign(1d0, x)` if the context requires a double precision operation. This change ensures that the output for the `sign` function adheres to the syntax expected by Fortran compilers, thus making the generated code compilable and functionally correct according to Fortran standards. The modification should consider the precision context to choose between `sign(1, x)` and `sign(1d0, x)`. Additionally, the method should continue to handle other functions as before, ensuring that this change does not impact the printing of other mathematical or user-defined functions."
