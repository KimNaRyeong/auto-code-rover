        "content": "To address the issue described, we'll need to gather more information about how the `DateField` class and specifically its `input_formats` attribute are implemented within the Django framework, as well as any attempts it makes to stringify this attribute. Here are the appropriate API calls to perform:\n\n1. Search for the `DateField` class to understand its structure and related files:\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"DateField\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions the `__str__` and `__repr__` methods, specifically in the context of how `input_formats` behave, it would be useful to look into these methods within the `DateField` class if they exist, or understand their defaults:\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"__str__\", \"DateField\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"__repr__\", \"DateField\")\n   ```\n\n3. Understanding how `input_formats` is defined within the `DateField` might also provide insight. Since `input_formats` is mentioned as an attribute, not necessarily a method, finding its occurrence in the codebase might help:\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"input_formats\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive context around how `DateField` operates, particularly focusing on its string representation and how it handles `input_formats`."
