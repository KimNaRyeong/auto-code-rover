First, it's essential to identify which class, method, or code snippet directly interacts with or defines `frac_field`. Given this context, the following search API calls will be useful:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_method(\"frac_field\")\nsearch_class(\"QQ\")\n```\n\nThese two calls should help us understand the structure and implementation details of `frac_field` within the class `QQ`, which is presumably related to rational numbers or a fraction field in some mathematical library or framework."
