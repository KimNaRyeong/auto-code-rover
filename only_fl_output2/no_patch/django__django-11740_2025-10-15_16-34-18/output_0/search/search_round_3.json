I am new in django community, so please help me, because i really dont know is it really \"bug\".\nI have a django project named \"testproject\" and two apps: testapp1, testapp2.\nIt will be simpler to understand, with this example:\n# TestApp1(models.py):\nclass App1(models.Model):\nid = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, unique=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False, verbose_name=_('identifier'))\ntext = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name=_('text'))\nanother_app = models.UUIDField(null=True, blank=True, verbose_name=_('another app'))\n# TestApp2(models.py):\nclass App2(models.Model):\nid = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, unique=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False, verbose_name=_('identifier'))\ntext = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name=_('text'))\nFirst model named \"App1\" has UUID field named \"another_app\":\nanother_app = models.UUIDField(null=True, blank=True, verbose_name=_('another app'))\nAfter some time i change field from UUID to FK, like this:\nanother_app = models.ForeignKey(App2, null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, verbose_name=_('another app'))\nAnd as result i create new migration, but Migration class was unexpected result, because it does not create any \"dependencies\" for App2, because of FK.\nI think the correct solution will be create dependency for App2.\nThis project use django version 2.2 and postgresql. Attach archive with sources. Project contains small test, after running him, you will get exception like this: ValueError: Related model 'testapp2.App2' cannot be resolved.\nSo is it problem in django or maybe i dont understand something ?\nHere is my post in django users:\n\u200bhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/django-users/Django$20bug$3A$20change$20uuid$20field$20to$20FK$20does$20not$20create$20dependency%7Csort:date/django-users/-h9LZxFomLU/yz-NLi1cDgAJ\nRegards, Viktor Lomakin\n</issue>"

The user mentions changing a UUID field to a ForeignKey in one of the models, but the migration does not include the expected dependencies. Specifically, we will look into the models `App1` and `App2` from `TestApp1` and `TestApp2` apps respectively, and inspect the migration files that were supposed to handle this change.\n\n1. To understand how `App1` and `App2` are defined, we should look at their class declarations within their respective files. This requires searching for these classes in their models.py files.

This discrepancy means we lack direct insight into how the models were initially defined and how the ForeignKey relationship was supposed to be established in `App1` towards `App2`.\n\n#### Failure in Finding the AlterField Code\n- Not finding the `AlterField` code snippet that changes `another_app` from a UUIDField to a ForeignKey indicates either the migration wasn't generated correctly/hasn't been generated at all or that the search parameters did not perfectly match how Django formulates migration operations in code. This situation is problematic because we cannot directly inspect how Django attempted to handle the UUID to ForeignKey conversion in the migration files, which is central to investigating the issue.\n\n#### Successful Search for `dependencies`\n- The successful search for snippets containing `dependencies = [` gives us a list of files, predominantly migrations and Django core files, where dependencies between migrations are defined. These results are essential because:\n  1. **What does this part of the code do?** Dependencies in migration files dictate the order of execution to ensure database schema changes occur in a coherent sequence. This mechanism is central to understanding why the migration system might not recognize or correctly handle dependencies for ForeignKey relationships, particularly between apps.\n  2. **Relationship with the bug?** The issue described involves the migration system not generating expected dependencies when converting a UUIDField to a ForeignKey, which should inherently create a dependency on the related model's migration (in this case, `App2` from `testapp2`). The presence or formulation of dependencies in Django migration logic might shed light on potential oversights or bugs in handling such cases.\n  3. **Intended Behavior** - The intended behavior would be for the migration system to recognize the creation of a ForeignKey relationship as necessitating a dependency on the related model's migration to ensure the database schema integrity is preserved. This dependency should be automatically detected and recorded in the generated migration file.\n\n### Next Steps in Investigation\n\n1. **Review Django's Handling of ForeignKeys in Migrations**\n   - To better understand how Django typically handles ForeignKey dependencies in migrations, it would be useful to inspect the relevant results found in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` or `django/db/migrations/writer.py`.\n\n2. **Manually Inspect Migrations for ForeignKey Implementation**\n   - Given the failure to directly find the modification via search, it should be beneficial to manually inspect migration files in `testapp1` or `testapp2`, especially those created or modified around the time of the reported issue.\n\n3. **Alternative Models and Migration Search**\n   - Attempt alternative search strategies that could uncover the model definitions:\n     - `search_class(\"App1\")` and `search_class(\"App2\")` without specifying file paths to locate their definitions anywhere in the codebase.\n   - Search for migrations in a broader scope that might include the `ForeignKey` creation:\n     - `search_code(\"models.ForeignKey\")` to find migrations or model definitions involving ForeignKey, which might have been missed due to file path or naming discrepancies.\n\nThese steps are aimed at piecing together how the Django application's migration system intended to handle the ForeignKey dependency and why it might have failed in this instance."

However, based on the issue's description and analysis of the situation, we can hypothesize potential areas that would require attention:\n\n### Potential Bug Location: Migration System Logic\n- **File:** Potentially within Django's migration framework files, such as `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` or `django/db/migrations/writer.py`.\n- **Class/Method:** Specific methods responsible for detecting model field changes (e.g., changing from `UUIDField` to `ForeignKey`) and auto-generating dependency links in migration files.\n- **Intended Behavior:** The system should correctly identify changes in model fields that reference another model (especially in cross-app scenarios) and automatically add the necessary migration dependency. This process ensures that the referenced model's table exists before attempting to apply migrations that establish foreign key constraints, thus preventing errors during migration application. The intended fix would ensure that whenever a `ForeignKey` relationship is established or modified, the migration system not only alters the field type but also scrutinizes the target model to establish an explicit migration dependency if the target model resides in a different app or if its migration is not already a dependency of the current app's latest migration.\n\n### Hypothetical Bug Location: App-Level Migration Dependency Handling\n- **File:** This would be within the app's specific migrations where the change from `UUIDField` to `ForeignKey` was made.\n- **Class/Method:** In the generated migration file itself that aimed to modify the `App1.another_app` field.\n- **Intended Behavior:** In case the Django migration system fails to auto-detect and include the necessary dependencies, developers might need to manually edit the generated migration to include an explicit dependency on the `App2` model's relevant migration. The migration file should have a `dependencies` attribute that includes the last migration of `testapp2` before this migration was created. This manual step ensures that the database schema operations occur in the correct order, respecting the database's referential integrity constraints.\n\nGiven the abstract nature of the issue without direct access to file contents, these recommendations serve as a conjectural guide based on common practices and the described problem. Further investigation with actual access to the codebase is necessary to refine these suggestions."

This exploration aims to understand the typical usage and handling of ForeignKey relations, potentially informing the resolution of the reported issue.\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe snippets containing `models.ForeignKey` across various files seem to illustrate different aspects of ForeignKey usage within Django:\n\n- **django/db/models/fields/related.py**: This is likely where the ForeignKey field itself is defined and possibly contains logic for how Django handles ForeignKey fields at a lower level, including relation definitions, database schema creation, and ORM querying mechanisms.\n  \n- **django/contrib/** files: These examples show `ForeignKey` fields in use within Django's own contributed apps, such as `sites`, `redirects`, and `admin`. They likely serve as practical applications of ForeignKey fields, demonstrating how Django expects these relations to be used within models and migrations.\n\n- **Migrations files (e.g., `0001_initial.py`)**: The presence of `ForeignKey` in initial migrations for Django's own apps showcases how ForeignKey relationships are codified in migrations, including how dependencies between apps are managed through migrations.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe snippets and their locations help illustrate Django's prescribed methods for defining and handling `ForeignKey` relations both at the model level and within migrations. Given the issue description\u2014where converting a `UUIDField` to a `ForeignKey` did not automatically generate the expected dependencies in a migration\u2014the context gathered here suggests a discrepancy between typical `ForeignKey` usage and what was experienced by the user. This discrepancy might either be due to an oversight in how the project's migrations were created or a misunderstanding of how Django handles ForeignKey dependencies across different apps.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nIn an ideal resolution:\n\n- **For model definition (`related.py`)**: When defining a ForeignKey relation in a model, Django should not only set up the ORM relationship but also ensure that any alteration to this field type from another type (like `UUIDField`) through migrations correctly infers and establishes model dependencies.\n\n- **For migrations (`0001_initial.py` and related files)**: When a migration is generated that introduces a ForeignKey pointing to another model, especially across different Django apps, Django's migration framework should automatically detect and codify the dependency on the target model's migration. This detection ensures migrations are applied in an order that maintains referential integrity.\n\nGiven the complex nature of Django's migration system and its handling of cross-app relations, the issue might stem from a gap or bug in how these automatic dependency detections are executed. Specifically, the intended behavior should ensure that any change that potentially alters database schema relations (like converting a UUID field to a ForeignKey) prompts a careful analysis of dependent migrations, especially in projects with multiple apps where cross-dependencies are common. \n\nAn investigation into whether there's an inherent limitation or bug in Django's migration system concerning cross-app ForeignKey relations might be warranted. Additionally, seeking clarification or guidance from the Django community or documentation regarding best practices for such cases could provide a workaround or highlight a need for more explicit manual specification of dependencies in complex projects."

The problem seems to revolve around Django's migration and model field handling system rather than a pinpointable bug within a specific part of the user's project code.\n\n### Hypothetical Bug Location and Intended Behavior\n\n- **Bug Location (Hypothetical):**\n  - **File/Module:** Django's internal migration generation and processing system (`django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` or similar).\n  - **Class:** Migration autodetector or related classes/methods responsible for analyzing model changes and generating corresponding migration operations.\n  - **Method:** Methods involved in detecting field type changes and establishing model dependencies.\n\n- **Intended Behavior:**\n  - When a field in a Django model is changed from a `UUIDField` to a `ForeignKey`, the migration system should automatically detect this change and generate a migration that:\n    1. Includes an operation to alter the field type appropriately.\n    2. Correctly identifies and establishes dependencies on the related model's migrations, especially if the related model is in a different app within the project.\n    3. Preserves existing functionality by ensuring that no data is lost or corrupted in the process, particularly considering the uniqueness and non-relational nature of UUID fields vs. the relational nature of ForeignKey fields.\n  \nThis situation suggests that a more in-depth investigation into the Django migration system's behavior in handling such specific field type changes might be necessary. It may also indicate a need for more detailed documentation or user guidance on handling such model alterations, especially in complex projects with inter-app dependencies.\n\nFor now, without direct access to or specific information about the project's migration files or model definitions, further action requires either more detailed error reports, access to the actual project codebase, or discussions with the Django development community for insights or confirmation of potential bugs in the Django framework itself."

Considering the absence of results with the previous strategy, the following broader search queries could provide more insight:\n\n- Search within the migration system documentation or source code for keywords and mechanisms generally associated with migration creation and dependency handling without tying the search to specific method names. This could involve:\n  - A search for keywords related to migration creation and field type analysis within `autodetector.py` or surrounding modules.\n  - Reviewing Django's official documentation or source code comments that could elucidate the steps taken during migration generation, particularly in relation to model field changes and app dependencies.\n\nGiven that the system did not find specific methods or classes named according to the search queries, it might be more productive to focus on understanding the components and workflows highlighted in Django's migrations documentation or by inspecting the source code directly without relying on specific naming conventions.\n\n### Analysis and Conclusion Without Additional Context\n\nAbsent further specific information from the codebase, we're left to conclude based on general knowledge of Django's operations:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?** Typically, the migration autodetector in Django is tasked with identifying changes in the models compared to the last migration state and generating migration files that represent these changes. This includes detecting new models, changes to fields, and deletions.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?** If there's a bug or limitation in detecting certain types of changes (such as converting a UUIDField to a ForeignKey) or accurately capturing dependencies between different app migrations, it could explain why the issue occurs as described by the user.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?** Ideally, any change that could affect database schema or inter-model relationships, like changing a field type to a ForeignKey, should be detected accurately, with migrations generated that both reflect the change and correctly establish any new dependencies necessitated by this change. \n\nWithout the ability to directly inspect the project code or the specific mechanisms Django used in this context, the analysis remains speculative. Direct examination of the Django source code relevant to migrations, alongside a broader understanding of how Django detects changes and formulates migrations, remains the most viable path to diagnosing and addressing the reported issue."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

The issue, as outlined, suggests a complex interaction between model definition changes and the migration system's ability to detect and appropriately generate dependencies for those changes.\n\nTherefore, without further specific details or access to the codebase to conduct a more granular analysis, we are unable to specify exact bug locations or propose detailed fixes accurately. The resolution to the described issue lies within understanding and possibly enhancing how Django's migration system detects field type changes (from `UUIDField` to `ForeignKey`) and ensures the correct generation of dependency declarations in migration files, especially across app boundaries within a project.\n\nIn this context, addressing the issue effectively would likely require:\n\n- Reviewing the Django migration system documentation and source code to better understand expected behaviors and mechanisms, particularly regarding cross-app model dependencies.\n- Engaging with the Django developer community for insights or similar reported issues, which might highlight undocumented behaviors or scenarios requiring special handling.\n- Experimentation within a controlled project environment to replicate the reported issue, observe the Django migration system's behavior with field type changes, and test potential solutions or workarounds.\n\nGiven the nature of the reported issue, the solution might involve adjustments to Django's internal migration generation logic (if a bug or oversight is indeed identified) or could require specific project-level migration scripting to manually manage the dependencies not automatically detected by Django's migration system."
