        "intended_behavior": "The `as_relational` method in the `Range` class should not only generate a relational expression that restricts the value of `x` to the range defined by the `start`, `stop`, and `step` properties but also ensure `x` adheres to the range's step interval. This behavior can be preserved and extended by incorporating an additional condition that asserts the modulus of `x - start` relative to `step` equals the modulus of `0` (or `Mod(start, step)`), thus correctly implementing the step condition. The modified method should:\n- Retain the check for equality with `floor(x)` to ensure `x` is an integer.\n- Maintain the existing bounds checks (`x >= self.inf` and `x <= self.sup`), adjusting for inclusivity/exclusivity as currently done.\n- Introduce a new condition using `Eq(Mod(x, step), Mod(start, step))` to ensure that `x` matches the sequence produced by the `Range` according to its `step`. This accounts for the correct interpretation of ranges where `step` is not equal to 1, ensuring the range's consistency with its definition in terms of the step interval."
