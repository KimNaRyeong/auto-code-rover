Given your feedback and the initial misunderstanding, let's adjust the approach. The script provided earlier was meant to raise an `AssertionError` if there's a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs from the `Range.as_relational` method, incorrectly suggesting that it would exit with code 0 if the issue is resolved. However, based on your scenario, it should raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present (which it did according to your output), and the message indicated success when there was none. 

We should aim for a script that correctly interprets this behavior, emphasizing the presence of an issue through the assertion mechanism correctly. Here's a revised version of the script:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_range_as_relational():
    from sympy import Range, symbols, Eq, floor, Mod
    
    x = symbols('x')
    # Attempt to reflect the current behavior and assert the expected correct behavior
    # Adjusted expected output to include modulus condition for completeness
    expected_relational = (x >= 3) & (x <= 9) & Eq(x, floor(x)) & Eq(Mod(x, 2), 1)
    try:
        # Generate relational representation of range
        generated_relational = Range(3, 11, 2).as_relational(x)
        # Convert expressions to strings to assert their equality for simplicity
        assert str(generated_relational) == str(expected_relational), "Generated relational expression is incorrect."
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print("AssertionError: The issue is present.")
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate the presence of the issue
    
    print("Success: The issue has been fixed.")
    exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate the issue has been fixed

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_range_as_relational()
```

This revised script correctly aligns with your request: It raises an AssertionError (indicating a problem) when the output does not match the expected correct behavior and exits with code 0 if the issue is fixed (i.e., when no exception is raised). The misunderstanding in the previous explanation stemmed from interpreting how the exit codes were being used in relation to the presence of the issue.
