To create a standalone Python script that reproduces the issue described, you can use the following `reproducer.py` file:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_range_as_relational():
    from sympy import Range, symbols, Eq, floor, Mod
    
    x = symbols('x')
    correct_relational = (x >= 3) & (x <= 9) & Eq(x, floor(x)) & Eq(Mod(x, 2), 1)
    try:
        # Assuming the Range.as_relational method has been implemented
        test_relational = Range(3, 11, 2).as_relational(x)
        # Here, we forcefully insert an AssertionError if the output of as_relational method
        # does not match our correct relational expression
        assert str(test_relational) == str(correct_relational), "Range.as_relational did not return correct expression"
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_range_as_relational()
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        exit(1)  # Non-zero exit code on failure
    exit(0)  # Zero exit code on success
```

Please ensure you have Sympy installed in your environment to test this script, as it utilizes classes and methods from Sympy. To install Sympy, you can use pip: `pip install sympy`. 

Remember, this script is designed to raise an `AssertionError` if the issue mentioned is present (i.e., if the `Range.as_relational` method does not produce the correct relational expression), including a stack trace for debugging. When the issue is fixed, the script should exit with code 0, indicating success.
