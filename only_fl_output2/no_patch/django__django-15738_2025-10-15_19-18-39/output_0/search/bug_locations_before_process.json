The alteration must ensure that any existing database schema constraints reflecting this constraint are properly dropped, preparing the model for the forthcoming field-type change."

        "intended_behavior": "A carefully crafted migration should change the `project_data_set` field from a `ForeignKey` relation to a `ManyToManyField` relationship. This involves not only the field change but also ensuring the database correctly reflects this modification with the appropriate table adjustments. This might involve creating an intermediary join table if not already existing or properly utilizing the `ProjectDataSet` table if it's intended to serve this role. In this context, it's also essential to ensure data integrity and continuity, possibly requiring a data migration step within the same or an additional migration file."
