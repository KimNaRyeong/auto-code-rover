        "intended_behavior": "This function should be enhanced to more accurately measure and account for the space requirements of wrapped text, especially for titles. It should ensure that when titles are wrapped due to length, the calculated space allocation for components within the figure dynamically adjusts to prevent clipping or overflowing of the text. This involves integrating a more robust calculation of text dimensions post-wrapping into the spacing algorithms used by the constrained layout system. The enhancement should preserve the function's existing capabilities to manage layout constraints for other figure elements, only extending its logic to better handle variable text block sizes."

        "intended_behavior": "When this method triggers the execution of the constrained layout engine, it should ensure that the current state, including any wrapped text elements (like titles), is accurately represented in the layout constraints calculations. This might entail a pre-processing step before executing the layout engine to update constraints based on the actual dimensions of wrapped titles. The method should continue to serve its purpose of applying the constrained layout but with added consideration for the actual space requirements of dynamically sized text elements. The aim is to allow for a more flexible and responsive layout adjustment that accounts for the variable sizes of wrapped text, thus addressing the issue of insufficient space for long, wrapped titles."
