It should ensure that when titles are wrapped due to length, the calculated space allocation for components within the figure dynamically adjusts to prevent clipping or overflowing of the text. This involves integrating a more robust calculation of text dimensions post-wrapping into the spacing algorithms used by the constrained layout system.

This might entail a pre-processing step before executing the layout engine to update constraints based on the actual dimensions of wrapped titles. The method should continue to serve its purpose of applying the constrained layout but with added consideration for the actual space requirements of dynamically sized text elements.
