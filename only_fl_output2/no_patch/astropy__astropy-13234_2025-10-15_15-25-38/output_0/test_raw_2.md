Based on your scenario, it seems like the execution environment may not have had the necessary dependencies installed, leading to the `ModuleNotFoundError`. Assuming the correct dependencies are installed, let's ensure the script is designed to run correctly under those assumptions. Here is an adjusted script that checks for the presence of necessary modules before proceeding with the test. It will print a clear message if a required module is missing.

Still, bear in mind that for this script to run successfully, you must have `numpy` and `astropy` installed in your Python environment. If they are not installed, you will need to install them first using `pip install numpy astropy`. 

Here's a revised version of `reproducer.py`, including checks for the presence of required modules:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def module_available(module_name):
    import importlib
    module_spec = importlib.util.find_spec(module_name)
    return module_spec is not None

def main():
    missing_modules = [name for name in ["numpy", "astropy.table"] if not module_available(name)]
    if missing_modules:
        print(f"Missing required modules: {', '.join(missing_modules)}")
        print("Please install them using pip and rerun the script.")
        exit(1)

    import io
    import numpy as np
    from astropy.table import Table, Column

    dtype = np.dtype([('z', 'f8'), ('name', 'f8'), ('y', 'i4')])
    t = Table()
    t['c'] = Column([(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)], dtype=dtype)
    
    out = io.StringIO()    
    try:
        t.write(out, format='ascii.ecsv')
        out.seek(0)  # Reset StringIO to start
        t2 = Table.read(out.getvalue(), format='ascii.ecsv')
        # Assert to ensure round-trip was successful, comparing original and read table sizes.
        assert len(t) == len(t2)
        # If no error, the issue is fixed, and we exit with code 0
        print("Issue is fixed.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script checks if the required modules (`numpy` and `astropy`) are installed at runtime and exits with a message prompting for their installation if they are not found, making it more user-friendly for environments where the dependencies may not be installed.
