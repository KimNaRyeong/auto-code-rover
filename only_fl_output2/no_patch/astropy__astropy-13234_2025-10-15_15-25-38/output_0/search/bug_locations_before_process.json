        "intended_behavior": "This method should be enhanced to correctly handle `SerializedColumn` objects when their `name` field is set to 'name', or other potentially problematic keywords. The method currently fails because it attempts to use a `SerializedColumn` as a dictionary key, which is not supported due to it being an unhashable type. To resolve the issue, the code needs to ensure that names used in the serialization process do not conflict with Python's built-in names or syntactical constructs. Additionally, it should allow for the `SerializedColumn` objects to be hashed or indirectly mapped in a way that supports the serialization process. One way to achieve this could be to robustly check and handle special cases where field names could interfere with the serialization mechanics or to ensure that serialized column references are always managed in a context that does not require them to be hashable keys."

        "intended_behavior": "Ensure that instances of `SerializedColumn` can interact correctly within the serialization/deserialization process, particularly in contexts where being hashable or uniquely identifiable is necessary. While the class itself might not necessarily be the direct source of the bug, ensuring that its usage (especially with 'problematic' names like `name`) does not lead to type errors or hashing issues is crucial. This might involve adding methods or altering how instances are used to guarantee they can be utilized as intended without causing exceptions. Adaptations here should ensure that `SerializedColumn` instances, when they contain critical data for column reconstruction, are always handled in a manner compatible with their intended use cases in serialization and deserialization flows."
