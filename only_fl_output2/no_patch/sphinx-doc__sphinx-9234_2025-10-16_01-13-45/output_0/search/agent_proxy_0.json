Based on the provided description, here are the API calls that would be valuable:\n\n1. Search for a class or method that is responsible for checking links. Since the issue description mentions a link check, but doesn't specify a class or method name directly, we'll first look for anything related to \"LinkCheck\" or \"link checking\" functionality in the codebase.\n   - `search_class(\"LinkCheck\")`\n   - `search_method(\"checkLink\")`\n\n2. There's mention of handling redirects, so it's likely there's a method for processing or validating redirects. Since the exact name is unknown, searching by likely method names could be helpful.\n   - `search_method(\"validateRedirect\")`\n   - `search_method(\"handleRedirect\")`\n\n3. The issue also suggests modifications or checks against a list of allowed redirects, implying there might be configuration or storage for such data.\n   - `search_code(\"allowed redirects\")`\n   - `search_code(\"redirect whitelist\")`\n\n4. Lastly, the description mentions `linkcheck/output.txt`, which implies that there's code for generating or writing to this file.\n   - `search_code(\"linkcheck/output.txt\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point by identifying key classes, methods, or parts of the code related to the feature request."
