Good websites will provide redirects to the correct new location or return an HTTP error code. Bad websites will redirect to an unrelated page or the root of the website.\nPreventing all redirects does not allow links to URLs like https://www.sphinx-doc.org/ which redirects to https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/. It needs to be possible to allow these redirects but disallow others.\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nIt should be possible to prohibit unknown redirects by listing all of the allowed redirects as pairs of URLs.\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nPost-process `linkcheck/output.txt` by removing filenames and line numbers then sorting it and comparing it with known good output.\n**Additional context**\nA link to https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/ (which used to work) now redirects to https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/. Linkcheck allows this but the original link is not valid and needs to be updated to the article's new URL of https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/.\nLinkcheck should be able to report an error for this redirect.\n</issue>"

Based on the provided description, here are the API calls that would be valuable:\n\n1. Search for a class or method that is responsible for checking links. Since the issue description mentions a link check, but doesn't specify a class or method name directly, we'll first look for anything related to \"LinkCheck\" or \"link checking\" functionality in the codebase.\n   - `search_class(\"LinkCheck\")`\n   - `search_method(\"checkLink\")`\n\n2. There's mention of handling redirects, so it's likely there's a method for processing or validating redirects. Since the exact name is unknown, searching by likely method names could be helpful.\n   - `search_method(\"validateRedirect\")`\n   - `search_method(\"handleRedirect\")`\n\n3. The issue also suggests modifications or checks against a list of allowed redirects, implying there might be configuration or storage for such data.\n   - `search_code(\"allowed redirects\")`\n   - `search_code(\"redirect whitelist\")`\n\n4. Lastly, the description mentions `linkcheck/output.txt`, which implies that there's code for generating or writing to this file.\n   - `search_code(\"linkcheck/output.txt\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point by identifying key classes, methods, or parts of the code related to the feature request."
