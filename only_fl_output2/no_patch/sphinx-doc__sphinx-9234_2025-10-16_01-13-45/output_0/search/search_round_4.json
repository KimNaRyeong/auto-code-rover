Therefore, I cannot provide specific bug locations or describe the intended behavior of the code at this moment due to a lack of returned context from the search API calls.\n\nHowever, in addressing the feature request from the issue, one would expect the intended behavior to involve:\n\n- **Identification and Handling of Redirects**: The link checker should be capable of identifying when a link redirects to another URL. It needs to capture both the initial URL and final destination URL after all redirects.\n  \n- **Redirect Whitelist Configuration**: The application should support a configuration option that allows users to specify pairs of allowed redirects. This includes identifying a source URL and its acceptable redirected destination URL.\n  \n- **Redirect Validation Against Whitelist**: When a redirect is detected, the link checker should validate the initial and destination URLs against the whitelist. If the redirect pair matches an allowed pair, the redirect is deemed valid. Otherwise, the link checker should raise an alert or error indicating an unacceptable redirect.\n  \n- **Output and Reporting Enhancements**: Modifications to the output or reporting mechanism to clearly indicate which redirects were accepted, which were rejected, and reasons for any rejections based on the lack of whitelist entry.\n\nIdeally, these behaviors would be implemented in a way that seamlessly integrates with the existing link checking functionality, ensuring that the tool remains useful for its primary purpose while gaining the ability to discern and reject unwanted redirects."

Keywords would include variants and synonyms of \"link\", \"redirect\", \"check\", \"validate\", and \"configuration\". \n\n4. **Incremental Search Refinement**: Start with broad searches in the codebase and then refine based on findings. For example, if a configuration file is discovered, examine it for clues on how redirects are currently handled or where link checking is implemented.\n\n5. **Assess Middleware or External Libraries**: Some projects use external libraries for parts of their functionality.

Given the absence of direct references to link checking and redirect handling, and considering the feature request to improve the link checker by prohibiting unknown redirects, these areas involving configuration and settings seem like potential points for enhancement or extension to support the new functionality.\n\n### Analysis of Collected Context:\n\n1. **Files Related to Configuration (`configuration` results):**\n   - The files like `sphinx/application.py`, `sphinx/theming.py`, `sphinx/config.py`, and others mentioned suggest a broad use of configuration throughout the Sphinx documentation generation process.\n   - `sphinx/config.py` in particular might be central to defining and managing configuration options, which could be relevant for introducing new settings related to link checking and redirect handling.\n\n2. **Files and Snippets Containing `settings` Information:**\n   - Files such as `sphinx/io.py`, `sphinx/environment/__init__.py`, `sphinx/writers/html.py`, and others are likely to influence how documents are processed, including how external links might be checked or formatted.\n   - The widespread presence of settings across multiple facets of the Sphinx project (from IO handling to specific builders like HTML or LaTeX) indicates that settings are versatile and deeply integrated, suggesting a possible point of leverage for introducing or modifying link check behaviors.\n\n### Relationship to the Issue and Intended Behavior:\n\nGiven the feature request to allow the link checker to prohibit unknown redirects, the configuration and settings files are likely relevant for introducing new options or flags that define acceptable redirects. This might involve:\n\n- Adding new configuration options to `sphinx/config.py` or `doc/conf.py` that allow users to specify pairs of URLs (source and destination) that are considered allowable redirects. This would require modifying the code to read and interpret these configurations.\n- Enhancing the link checking process (which might be part of a broader set of functionalities scattered across the mentioned files) to consult these new settings and determine the validity of a given redirect based on the configured allowed pairs.\n\n### Next Steps for Patch Creation:\n\n1. **Extend Configuration Management (`sphinx/config.py`):**\n   - Introduce a new configuration option for specifying allowed redirect pairs. This involves defining the option and ensuring it can be parsed from user input or configuration files.\n\n2. **Utilize Settings in Link Checking Logic:**\n   - Although the specific location of the link checking logic wasn't identified, the enhancement would likely need to interact with the structures or methods processing external links. This could mean hooking into `sphinx/builders/*` or `sphinx/environment/__init__.py`, depending on where external link processing is handled, to verify redirects against the user-defined allowed lists.\n\n3. **Testing and Documentation:**\n   - Add documentation for the new configuration option, explaining how to define allowed redirect pairs.\n   - Ensure existing tests pass and consider adding new tests that validate the functionality of blocking unknown redirects while allowing specified ones.\n\nBy modifying these areas to properly interpret and act on new configuration options centered around link redirects, the project can provide the requested feature in a way that is consistent with existing architecture and patterns."

The analysis points us towards the areas of the Sphinx project where adjustments could be made to address the feature request regarding link redirection handling. However, because we haven't identified the precise implementation location of the link checking functionality, the following outlines potential modification locations and their intended behavior rather than specific buggy locations.\n\n1. **Modification Locations and Intended Behavior:**\n\n- **File**: `sphinx/config.py`\n  - **Location**: Configuration definitions.\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Add a new configuration option that allows users to specify allowed redirect pairs. This configuration should be designed to preserve backward compatibility, defaulting to a mode that behaves as the link checker currently does unless explicitly configured to enforce redirect constraints.\n\n- **File**: `doc/conf.py`\n  - **Location**: Project-specific configuration file.\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Document the usage of the new configuration option for specifying allowed redirect pairs. Provide examples on how to set it to help users adopt the feature.\n\n- **To be identified file(s)** related to link checking and reporting:\n  - **Location**: The specific implementation of link checking might be dispersed across files that handle documentation parsing, rendering, or both.\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Modify the link checking logic to consult the new configuration option for allowed redirect pairs. If a link's redirection is not in the list of allowed pairs, it should report it according to the existing reporting mechanism (e.g., as an error or warning). This modification should not affect the handling of links that do not redirect or whose redirects are on the allowed list.\n\n2. **Potential Addition for Enhancing Link Check Reporting:**\n\nGiven the feature request implies dissatisfaction with unknown redirects not being flagged, enhancing the reporting mechanism to differentiate between various types of link issues could be beneficial. This could involve:\n\n- **File**: Relevant files in `sphinx/builders/` or `sphinx/environment/`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Expand the link issue reporting to include categories for redirects, specifically unknown or unauthorized redirects based on the new configuration. This will help users in quickly identifying issues and taking corrective action.\n\n### Summary:\n\nWhile specific \"buggy\" locations are not identified due to the nature of the feature request (it's an enhancement rather than a fix for incorrect behavior), the configuration file `sphinx/config.py` and the exemplary project configuration `doc/conf.py` are highlighted as primary modification targets. Additionally, without direct insight into where link checking is implemented within the Sphinx codebase, a theoretical approach to integrating the new feature has been described, focusing on modifying link check behaviors and reporting based on new configuration options.\n\nThis approach aligns with preserving existing functionality while introducing a new, opt-in feature that addresses the identified need for more granular control over link redirection validation."
