Good websites will provide redirects to the correct new location or return an HTTP error code. Bad websites will redirect to an unrelated page or the root of the website.\nPreventing all redirects does not allow links to URLs like https://www.sphinx-doc.org/ which redirects to https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/. It needs to be possible to allow these redirects but disallow others.\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nIt should be possible to prohibit unknown redirects by listing all of the allowed redirects as pairs of URLs.\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nPost-process `linkcheck/output.txt` by removing filenames and line numbers then sorting it and comparing it with known good output.\n**Additional context**\nA link to https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/ (which used to work) now redirects to https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/. Linkcheck allows this but the original link is not valid and needs to be updated to the article's new URL of https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/.\nLinkcheck should be able to report an error for this redirect.\n</issue>"

Since the specific classes, methods, and phrases directly mentioned in the issue or our initial guess did not yield results, we might need to broaden or reframe our search queries. Let's proceed by:\n\n1. **Expanding on Link Check Functionality**: Since \"LinkCheck\" and \"checkLink\" were not found, it's possible the functionality might be encapsulated under different naming conventions. We need to look for more generic terms related to link checking that might be used in the codebase.\n   - `search_method(\"checkURL\")`\n   - `search_method(\"verifyLinks\")`\n\n2. **Redirect Handling**: Even though specific method searches like \"validateRedirect\" and \"handleRedirect\" didn't return anything, we can try more generic terms related to HTTP requests or responses since redirect handling would involve such aspects.\n   - `search_code(\"HTTP redirect\")`\n   - `search_code(\"followRedirects\")`\n\n3. **Configuration or Settings for Redirects**: Since our targeted search for a whitelist or allowed redirects configuration didn't provide results, it might be useful to look for configuration settings or files in general that might relate to external links or HTTP request handling.\n   - `search_code(\"config\")`\n   - `search_code(\"settings\")`\n\n4. **General Link Check Output**: Given that nothing was found for \"linkcheck/output.txt\", it's possible the tool or function outputs results in a different manner or the relevant code does not reference the output path directly. Searching for output or report generation related to link checking might provide some context.\n   - `search_code(\"generateReport\")`\n   - `search_code(\"output links\")`\n\nThis approach will cast a wider net that might help in identifying relevant parts of the code or related functionality."

The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Thus, for the purpose of this exercise, I will not construct additional search API calls due to the limitation of interaction rules.\n\n2. Given the provided scenario where all search efforts failed, no direct bug locations, classes, methods, or specific files could be identified. Therefore, I cannot provide specific bug locations or describe the intended behavior of the code at this moment due to a lack of returned context from the search API calls.\n\nHowever, in addressing the feature request from the issue, one would expect the intended behavior to involve:\n\n- **Identification and Handling of Redirects**: The link checker should be capable of identifying when a link redirects to another URL. It needs to capture both the initial URL and final destination URL after all redirects.\n  \n- **Redirect Whitelist Configuration**: The application should support a configuration option that allows users to specify pairs of allowed redirects. This includes identifying a source URL and its acceptable redirected destination URL.\n  \n- **Redirect Validation Against Whitelist**: When a redirect is detected, the link checker should validate the initial and destination URLs against the whitelist. If the redirect pair matches an allowed pair, the redirect is deemed valid. Otherwise, the link checker should raise an alert or error indicating an unacceptable redirect.\n  \n- **Output and Reporting Enhancements**: Modifications to the output or reporting mechanism to clearly indicate which redirects were accepted, which were rejected, and reasons for any rejections based on the lack of whitelist entry.\n\nIdeally, these behaviors would be implemented in a way that seamlessly integrates with the existing link checking functionality, ensuring that the tool remains useful for its primary purpose while gaining the ability to discern and reject unwanted redirects."
