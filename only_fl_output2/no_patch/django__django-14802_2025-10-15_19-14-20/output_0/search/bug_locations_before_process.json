        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior is to introduce a new method named `make_and_validate_key` within the `BaseCache` class. This method will perform the task of key creation and validation in one step, streamlining the process for all cache backends inheriting from `BaseCache`. The method will accept a `key` and an optional `version` parameter, construct the cache key using the existing `make_key` method, validate it with `validate_key`, and then return the validated key. This enhancement is intended to preserve existing functionality by providing an additional, more efficient way to ensure keys are both made and validated according to the cache backend's requirements. This method should be documented to clearly explain its use and purpose, ensuring developers understand when and how to use it as opposed to directly calling `make_key` and `validate_key`."
