        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue related to default value support for the `Sum` aggregation function (and potentially other aggregation functions) in a Django project, we should consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify where `Sum` is defined**: Since `Sum` is an aggregation function, it is likely defined within Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer. Thus, finding the class or module where `Sum` is defined is crucial.\n\n2. **Understand how aggregation functions are handled**: It will be useful to see if there's a generic way or specific hooks where a default value can be introduced, perhaps by modifying the query or processing its result.\n\n3. **Check for existing mechanisms to handle `NULL` values**: Given the mention of `COALESCE` in the monkey patch example, it would be useful to check if and how Django's ORM already uses or allows the usage of `COALESCE` for dealing with `NULL` values.\n\n4. **Consider the impact on other aggregation functions**: If the solution involves modifying a base class or method that affects multiple aggregation functions, understanding the broader context is necessary.\n\nBased on these steps, here are the API calls I would start with:\n\n- `search_class(\"Sum\")`: This will help in identifying the file and the exact definition of the `Sum` class to understand how it is currently implemented.\n- `search_method(\"aggregate\")`: Since `Sum` is an aggregation function, it's likely used in conjunction with the `aggregate` method of QuerySets. Understanding how `aggregate` works will help in figuring out where a default value logic can be integrated.\n- `search_method(\"annotate\")`: Given that the issue description mentions the use of `annotate(sum_field = Sum(...))`, it's relevant to check how `annotate` is implemented and how it handles aggregation functions and their results.\n- `search_code(\"COALESCE\")`: This search will help to find if and where `COALESCE` is already used within Django's ORM layer, which could provide insights into integrating a default value for `NULL`.\n\nThese initial API calls should provide a solid foundation of the code context involved in resolving the issue."
