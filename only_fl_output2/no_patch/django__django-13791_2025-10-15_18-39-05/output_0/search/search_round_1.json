The sign of a timedelta string will be ignored by django.utils.dateparse.parse_duration if the input string only contains days. Compare the following (notice the minus signs):\nIn [4]: timedelta(days=-1)\nOut[4]: datetime.timedelta(days=-1)\nIn [5]: td = timedelta(days=-1)\nIn [6]: duration_iso_string(td)\nOut[6]: '-P1DT00H00M00S'\nIn [7]: parse_duration(duration_iso_string(td))\nOut[7]: datetime.timedelta(days=1) # <-- Why is this 1 and not -1?\nIn [8]: td = timedelta(days=-1, microseconds=1)\nIn [9]: duration_iso_string(td)\nOut[9]: '-P0DT23H59M59.999999S'\nIn [10]: parse_duration(duration_iso_string(td))\nOut[10]: datetime.timedelta(days=-1, microseconds=1)\nI guess the problem is in django/utils/dateparse.py line 147 that reads return days + sign * datetime.timedelta(**kw).\nHowever, if datetime.timedelta(**kw) ends up being zero (timedelta(0)) then the sign multiplication ends up in zero, not -0. This is just a preliminary quick look though and maybe the problem is something else.\n</issue>"

What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `parse_duration` function is designed to parse a string representing a duration into a `datetime.timedelta` object. The function supports multiple formats, including the preferred Django format (`'%d %H:%M:%S.%f'`), ISO 8601 duration, and PostgreSQL's day-time interval format.\n\nThe specific part of the code relevant to the issue starts by identifying different components of a duration string (like days, hours, minutes, seconds, and microseconds) and parsing them into a dictionary (`kw`). The `days` component is popped from this dictionary and converted to a `datetime.timedelta` object. Then, the rest of the components are used to create another `datetime.timedelta` object, which is combined with the `days` object. The overall sign of the duration is applied to this second timedelta object.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe bug is related to the function ignoring the sign of the duration when the string only contains days. From the issue description, we understand that the function fails to handle the sign correctly specifically when no other components than days are present in the string. This failure is likely due to how the sign is applied to the timedelta object created from the remaining components (`**kw`). If there are no other components than days, the second `datetime.timedelta(**kw)` results in a timedelta of zero duration. Since multiplying by `sign` (-1 or 1) won't change the zero duration (`0 * -1 = 0`), the negation is effectively lost, leading to the observed bug.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior is for the `parse_duration` function to accurately reflect the sign of the input duration string in the returned `datetime.timedelta` object, even when the duration only specifies days. This means that if the input string indicates a negative duration in days (e.g., \"-P1D\" for negative one day), the returned `timedelta` should also represent a negative duration (`timedelta(days=-1)`).\n\nUnderstanding this, it appears the solution may involve ensuring the `days` component maintains its sign before or during its addition to the `datetime.timedelta(**kw)` computation. Given the identified issue, one approach may include reconsidering how the `days` and the remaining duration components are combined and ensuring that the sign is faithfully applied regardless of which components are present or absent in the input string."

This requires ensuring that the sign of the duration (positive or negative) is properly applied to the `datetime.timedelta` result, consistent with the input string.\n\n  To resolve the issue, the method must be adjusted to ensure that the sign is correctly applied even when the parsed duration only contains days and no other time components. One potential approach to preserve existing functionality while fixing the bug might involve modifying the way the `days` component of the duration and its sign are treated. Specifically, the adjustment could ensure that:\n\n  - The `days` component maintains its sign correctly irrespective of the presence or absence of other duration components.\n  - The sign is applied to the total duration effectively, which includes scenarios when the duration is exclusively composed of days. This might mean applying the sign directly to the `days` component before or while combining it with the rest of the time components to form the final timedelta object.\n\n  This fix should not interfere with the correct parsing and sign application for durations that include time components other than days, preserving the method's existing functionality while correcting the handling of durations that are exclusively in days."
