        "content": "<issue>parse_duration() ISO string sign is ignored when the timedelta only has days\nDescription\nI'm pretty sure that this is a bug even though I'm not an expert on the ISO 8601 standard. The sign of a timedelta string will be ignored by django.utils.dateparse.parse_duration if the input string only contains days. Compare the following (notice the minus signs):\nIn [4]: timedelta(days=-1)\nOut[4]: datetime.timedelta(days=-1)\nIn [5]: td = timedelta(days=-1)\nIn [6]: duration_iso_string(td)\nOut[6]: '-P1DT00H00M00S'\nIn [7]: parse_duration(duration_iso_string(td))\nOut[7]: datetime.timedelta(days=1) # <-- Why is this 1 and not -1?\nIn [8]: td = timedelta(days=-1, microseconds=1)\nIn [9]: duration_iso_string(td)\nOut[9]: '-P0DT23H59M59.999999S'\nIn [10]: parse_duration(duration_iso_string(td))\nOut[10]: datetime.timedelta(days=-1, microseconds=1)\nI guess the problem is in django/utils/dateparse.py line 147 that reads return days + sign * datetime.timedelta(**kw).\nHowever, if datetime.timedelta(**kw) ends up being zero (timedelta(0)) then the sign multiplication ends up in zero, not -0. This is just a preliminary quick look though and maybe the problem is something else.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue related to the `parse_duration()` method improperly handling the sign of ISO string durations, we will focus on gathering more information about the method itself and any relevant code snippets mentioned in the issue. Specifically, we need to examine how `parse_duration()` interprets ISO 8601 duration strings, and how it deals with the sign of the duration, especially when the duration only includes days.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls will provide crucial information:\n\n1. **Search for the `parse_duration` method in the entire codebase**: This will help us locate the file and class (if any) where `parse_duration` is implemented.  \n   `search_method(\"parse_duration\")`\n\n2. **Search for the mentioned code snippet**: The issue mentions a specific line of code which is suspected to be related to the bug, so let's locate it within the codebase. This snippet is `return days + sign * datetime.timedelta(**kw)`.  \n   `search_code(\"return days + sign * datetime.timedelta(**kw)\")`\n\nThis will help us understand the implementation details of the `parse_duration` method, and possibly locate the bug that causes the method to ignore the sign of the duration when it only includes days."
