        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior of the `parse_duration` method is to accurately parse an ISO 8601 duration string into a correctly signed `datetime.timedelta` object, even if the duration only specifies days. This requires ensuring that the sign of the duration (positive or negative) is properly applied to the `datetime.timedelta` result, consistent with the input string.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the method must be adjusted to ensure that the sign is correctly applied even when the parsed duration only contains days and no other time components. One potential approach to preserve existing functionality while fixing the bug might involve modifying the way the `days` component of the duration and its sign are treated. Specifically, the adjustment could ensure that:\n\n- The `days` component maintains its sign correctly irrespective of the presence or absence of other duration components.\n- The sign is applied to the total duration effectively, which includes scenarios when the duration is exclusively composed of days. This might mean applying the sign directly to the `days` component before or while combining it with the rest of the time components to form the final timedelta object.\n\nThis fix should not interfere with the correct parsing and sign application for durations that include time components other than days, preserving the method's existing functionality while correcting the handling of durations that are exclusively in days."
