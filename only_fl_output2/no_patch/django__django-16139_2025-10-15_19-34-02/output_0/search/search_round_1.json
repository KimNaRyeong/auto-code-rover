        "content": "<issue>Accessing UserAdmin via to_field leads to link to PasswordResetForm being broken (404)\nDescription\n(last modified by Simon Kern)\nAccessing the UserAdmin via another model's Admin that has a reference to User (with to_field set, e.g., to_field=\"uuid\") leads to the UserAdmin being accessed via an url that looks similar to this one:\n.../user/22222222-3333-4444-5555-666677778888/change/?_to_field=uuid\nHowever the underlying form looks like this:\nCode highlighting:\nclass UserChangeForm(forms.ModelForm):\npassword = ReadOnlyPasswordHashField(\nlabel=_(\"Password\"),\nhelp_text=_(\n\"Raw passwords are not stored, so there is no way to see this \"\n\"user\u2019s password, but you can change the password using \"\n'<a href=\"{}\">this form</a>.'\n),\n)\n...\n...\ndef __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\nsuper().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\npassword = self.fields.get(\"password\")\nif password:\npassword.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")\n...\n...\nThis results in the link to the PasswordResetForm being wrong and thus ending up in a 404. If we drop the assumption that UserAdmin is always accessed via its pk, then we're good to go. It's as simple as replacing password.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\") with password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")\nI've opened a pull request on GitHub for this Ticket, please see:\n\u200bPR\n</issue>"

        "content": "The analysis of the collected context from the search API calls provides insights into the `UserChangeForm` class in the Django `auth` framework, specifically its initialization method and the handling of the password field. Let's break this down according to the questions:\n\n### What does this part of the code do?\n\n- The found code in `django/contrib/auth/forms.py` under `UserChangeForm` defines a form used in the Django admin to change user details. Particularly, the `password` field is set up as a read-only field with the help text providing a link supposed to lead administrators to a form where they can change the user's password.\n- Within the `__init__` method, if the `password` field exists, its help text is formatted to include a relative link path `\"../password/\"`. The method also configures a queryset for `user_permissions` to optimize database access with `select_related`.\n\n### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\n- The issue states that when accessing the `UserAdmin` using a URL with a different field as the identifier (e.g., `uuid` instead of the default primary key), the constructed link for the password change form leads to a 404 because the relative path `\"../password/\"` no longer correctly resolves to the password change form page. The context provided from the search API confirms that this relative path is hardcoded into the help text for the `password` field, thus directly relating to the described bug.\n\n### What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\n- The intended behavior would let administrators access the password change form for a user, no matter through which field (`pk` or another unique field like `uuid`) the `UserAdmin` has been accessed. Therefore, the help text link should dynamically adjust to the field used to access `UserAdmin` and still correctly lead to the password change form. Instead of a static relative path, a more dynamic approach that considers the actual access path (probably by incorporating the actual identifier of the user, whether it's a `pk` or another unique field) is required.\n\nConsidering the collected context and the issue description, to resolve the bug, the code needs to be modified in such a way that the link in the password field's help text correctly resolves to the password change form under all circumstances in which the `UserAdmin` can be accessed. This calls for replacing the static path `\"../password/\"` with a dynamic path that accurately points to the password change form regardless of how the `UserAdmin` page was accessed. A possible solution, as hinted in the issue description, involves modifying the way the help text's link is formatted, perhaps to something like: `../../{self.instance.pk}/password/` ensuring that `{self.instance.pk}` dynamically fetches the correct identifier used in the URL."

Instead of using the hardcoded relative path `\"../password/\"`, the link should be adapted based on the user's unique identifier accessed in the admin URL. This entails adjusting the help text formatting to something like `../../{self.instance.pk}/password/`, where `{self.instance.pk}` dynamically fetches and inserts the primary key (or another unique identifier if `to_field` is used) of the user instance being changed into the URL. This modification will ensure that the password change link correctly resolves in scenarios where the `UserAdmin` is accessed via non-standard fields (e.g., `uuid`), thereby supporting the Django admin's extensibility and custom user models with attributes other than the default primary key."
