        "intended_behavior": "The intention is to ensure that the link for changing the user's password dynamically and correctly points to the password change form, regardless of how the UserAdmin page is accessed. Instead of using the hardcoded relative path \"../password/\", the link should be adapted based on the user's unique identifier accessed in the admin URL. This entails adjusting the help text formatting to something like \"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\", where \"{self.instance.pk}\" dynamically fetches and inserts the primary key (or another unique identifier if `to_field` is used) of the user instance being changed into the URL. This modification will ensure that the password change link correctly resolves in scenarios where the `UserAdmin` is accessed via non-standard fields (e.g., `uuid`), thereby supporting the Django admin's extensibility and custom user models with attributes other than the default primary key."
