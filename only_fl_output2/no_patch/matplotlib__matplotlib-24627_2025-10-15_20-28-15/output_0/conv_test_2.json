This update is designed to ensure that the script will only exit with code 0 when the issue is actually corrected (i.e., when the assertion for the `l.axes` attribute to be `None` after calling `a.cla()` passes). If the issue persists, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace, as you requested. \n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef test_issue():\n    try:\n        # First test case: Removing an artist unsets its `.axes` attribute\n        f, a = plt.subplots(); l, = a.plot([1, 2]); l.remove()\n        assert l.axes is None, \"Artist's `.axes` attribute not unset after removal.\"\n\n        # Second test case: Clearing the axes via cla() does not unset artist's `.axes` attribute\n        f, a = plt.subplots(); l, = a.plot([1, 2]); a.cla()\n        assert l.axes is None, \"Artist's `.axes` attribute not unset after axes are cleared.\"\n\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        test_issue()\n    except AssertionError:\n        # An AssertionError at this point means the issue was successfully reproduced.\n        exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero exit code to indicate the issue reproduction/failure.\n    # If no exception is caught, the issue is considered fixed or not reproducible.\n    print(\"Issue is fixed, or could not reproduce the issue.\")\n    exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate success/non-reproduction.\n```\n\nThis script more accurately tests for the described behavior, ensuring that `l.axes` is indeed `None` after each operation that should logically unset it (removal and clearing of the axes). By adhering to the described behavior and outcomes, this revised approach should meet the criteria for both detection of the issue and verification of its resolution."
