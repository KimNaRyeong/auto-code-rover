        "intended_behavior": "The `cla()` method should be extended to explicitly unset the `.axes` attribute for all artists contained within the axes. This could be achieved by iterating over all children artists of the axes before the axes content is cleared (much like how individual artists are handled by their `remove()` method). The method should preserve all other state-reset functionality it currently performs but include a new step where each artist's `.axes` attribute is set to `None` to reflect its removal from the axes. This ensures consistency with the expected behavior when artists are removed individually from the axes, aligning with the report in the issue description. This approach preserves existing functionality while addressing the specific inconsistency reported, ensuring that all artists previously attached to the axes no longer hold a reference to it once `cla()` is executed. This update would also mirror the conceptually similar process that the `remove()` method undertakes for individual artists, thereby maintaining a consistent API behavior within the library."
