We should look into the classes and methods that handle the artist's `.axes` and `.figure` properties, as well as the implementation of `cla()` (which clears the current axes) and `clf()` (which clears the current figure), to see why they might not unset these attributes as expected. \n\nGiven this, our strategy will involve:\n\n1. Finding the implementation of `cla()` and `clf()` methods to understand their current behavior.\n2. Looking into the Artist class or related classes to see how the `.axes` and `.figure` attributes are managed.\n3. Identifying any method that is responsible for \"removing\" an artist, to understand how it currently unsets `.axes`.\n\nTherefore, I will make the following API calls:\n- `search_method(\"cla\")`\n- `search_method(\"clf\")`\n- `search_class(\"Artist\")`\n- `search_method(\"remove\")`"
