Based on the provided instructions, let's create a standalone script named `reproducer.py` that aims to reproduce the described issue and follows the specified error-reporting format. The script will perform two actions to evaluate the behavior of matplotlib: first, it will remove a line artist from its axes and check if the `.axes` attribute is unset (expected to be `None`), and second, it will clear the axes with `cla()` and then verify if the `.axes` attribute of the line artist is also unset.

If the script finds that the `.axes` attribute of a line artist is not `None` after calling `a.cla()`, it represents the presence of the issue and will raise an `AssertionError` accordingly. If the issue is fixed (i.e., `l.axes` is `None` after invoking `cla()`), then it should exit with code 0, indicating success.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # First scenario: Removing an artist should unset its `.axes`
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    line, = ax.plot([1, 2])
    line.remove()
    try:
        assert line.axes is None, "Artist's `.axes` attribute should be None after removal."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

    # Second scenario: Clearing the axes should unset the `.axes` of its children
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    line, = ax.plot([1, 2])
    ax.cla()  # Clear the axes
    try:
        assert line.axes is None, "Artist's `.axes` attribute should be None after axes are cleared."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

    print("Issue is fixed, or could not reproduce the issue.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script checks both conditions described in the issue and uses the provided `print_stacktrace` function to report errors in the expected format. By running this script, it's intended to help in identifying whether the issue still exists or not by evaluating the two specific situations: 1) removing an artist from axes, and 2) clearing the axes with `cla()`.
