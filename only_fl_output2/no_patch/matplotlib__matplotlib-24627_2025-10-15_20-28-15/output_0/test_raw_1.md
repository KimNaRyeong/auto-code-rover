Based on your request and taking into account your specific requirements, I've adjusted the script to correctly reflect the issue as described. This update is designed to ensure that the script will only exit with code 0 when the issue is actually corrected (i.e., when the assertion for the `l.axes` attribute to be `None` after calling `a.cla()` passes). If the issue persists, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace, as you requested. 

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_issue():
    try:
        # First test case: Removing an artist unsets its `.axes` attribute
        f, a = plt.subplots(); l, = a.plot([1, 2]); l.remove()
        assert l.axes is None, "Artist's `.axes` attribute not unset after removal."

        # Second test case: Clearing the axes via cla() does not unset artist's `.axes` attribute
        f, a = plt.subplots(); l, = a.plot([1, 2]); a.cla()
        assert l.axes is None, "Artist's `.axes` attribute not unset after axes are cleared."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_issue()
    except AssertionError:
        # An AssertionError at this point means the issue was successfully reproduced.
        exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero exit code to indicate the issue reproduction/failure.
    # If no exception is caught, the issue is considered fixed or not reproducible.
    print("Issue is fixed, or could not reproduce the issue.")
    exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate success/non-reproduction.
```

This script more accurately tests for the described behavior, ensuring that `l.axes` is indeed `None` after each operation that should logically unset it (removal and clearing of the axes). By adhering to the described behavior and outcomes, this revised approach should meet the criteria for both detection of the issue and verification of its resolution.
