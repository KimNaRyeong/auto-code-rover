        "content": "Analyzing the collected context reveals crucial details concerning the `pytest` functionality related to fixtures and handling of the `--fixtures` command-line argument. Let's break down the findings:\n\n### 1. `showfixtures` and `show_fixtures_per_test`\n\nThe `showfixtures` method seems to be a primary entry point invoked when the `--fixtures` command-line argument is used. It delegates to `_showfixtures_main` within a `wrap_session` call, indicating that it's preparing and executing a session-specific operation, presumably listing available fixtures.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug**: Since the issue involves enhancing `--fixtures` output, it's likely that `showfixtures` or its delegated function `_showfixtures_main` (which wasn't directly retrieved) will need modifications to include fixture scope information.\n- **Intended behavior**: This method should be modified or extended to collect and display fixture scope information alongside existing fixture data.\n\n### 2. `FixtureManager`\n\nThe `FixtureManager` class appears to be central to managing fixture definitions, including parsing, registration, and retrieval. It contains method placeholders for registering plugins, retrieving fixture information, and more.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug**: Although we didn't find `add_fixturedef` directly, it's clear that the `FixtureManager` handles the internal mechanics related to fixtures. Information on fixture scope must reside within or be accessible through `FixtureManager` or its managed objects.\n- **Intended behavior**: If the fixture scope data is managed here, we might need to interface with this class or its methods to retrieve scope information to be included in the output of `showfixtures`.\n\nGiven the above, the next steps in resolving the issue should include:\n- **Dive deeper into `FixtureManager`** to understand how scope information is stored or associated with fixtures. This might involve looking for methods that relate to fixture scope even if `add_fixturedef` wasn't found. Given the context, useful API calls could include `search_code(\"fixture scope\")` or more targeted searches for methods in `FixtureManager` not identified earlier.\n- **Further investigation of `_showfixtures_main`**, which seems to be the core function called by `showfixtures` and likely responsible for generating the output of listed fixtures. This function wasn't directly retrieved in our search results, suggesting a need to closely examine the code mentioned in the `showfixtures` snippet or to search more explicitly for `_showfixtures_main`.\n\nContinuing with the investigation requires more specific API calls based on these findings, such as:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"_showfixtures_main\", \"src/_pytest/python.py\")`\n- `search_code(\"scope\", \"src/_pytest/fixtures.py\")`\n\nThese steps are aimed at pinpointing where and how to include fixture scope information in the `pytest --fixtures` output."

To further refine our understanding and gather the necessary context to address the described issue effectively, the following API calls are needed:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"_showfixtures_main\", \"src/_pytest/python.py\")`\n   - `search_code(\"scope\", \"src/_pytest/fixtures.py\")`\n\n2. **Bug Locations and Intended Behaviors**\n\n    - **Location 1:**\n      - **File:** `src/_pytest/python.py`\n      - **Method:** `showfixtures`\n      - **Intended Behavior:** This method should be extended to not only call `_showfixtures_main` for listing fixtures but also to include fixture scope data in its presentation. While preserving the original functionality of listing available fixtures, it should now also annotate each fixture with its scope (e.g., \"function\", \"module\", \"class\", \"session\"). This might involve modifying or extending `_showfixtures_main` to retrieve and render this additional data.\n\n    - **Location 2:**\n      - **File:** `src/_pytest/fixtures.py`\n      - **Class:** `FixtureManager`\n      - **Intended Behavior:** Although a specific method for modification wasn't directly identified from the initial search, this class is critically involved in fixture management. Modification or extension here might be necessary to provide an accessible way to retrieve fixture scopes for each fixture managed by the `FixtureManager`. This would involve ensuring that when fixtures are registered or retrieved, their scope is easily accessible and can be passed along to the `showfixtures` method for display.\n\nThese locations and intended changes aim to implement the feature requested while integrating seamlessly with the existing `pytest` functionality, ensuring that users can obtain fixture scopes using the `--fixtures` command-line option without disrupting the current utility of the command."
