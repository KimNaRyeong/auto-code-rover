        "intended_behavior": "This method should be enhanced to include the scope of each fixture in its output. Upon printing each fixture's information, the fixture's scope should be retrieved from the fixturedef.scope attribute and included next to the fixture's name or description in the output. Importantly, the addition of scope information must be done in a manner that keeps the output readable and consistent with pytest's existing output formatting standards. The modification should ensure that for each fixture listed, its scope (e.g., 'function', 'module', 'class', 'session') is clearly indicated, helping users understand at which level each fixture is available without altering the primary functionality of listing fixtures."
