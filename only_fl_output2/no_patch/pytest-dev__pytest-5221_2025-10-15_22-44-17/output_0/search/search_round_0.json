        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue of displaying fixture scopes with `pytest --fixtures`, we'll need to narrow down where in the pytest codebase the processing of `--fixtures` occurs and where fixture scopes are defined or managed. Accordingly, I'll make the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the method responsible for handling the `--fixtures` argument within pytest. This could either be where command-line arguments are defined or where they're processed.\n    - `search_method(\"parse_fixtures\")`\n    - `search_method(\"show_fixtures_per_test\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions showing fixture scopes, and we know fixtures are registered and managed within pytest, we'll look for methods or classes related to fixture registration or scope management.\n    - `search_class(\"FixtureManager\")`\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"add_fixturedef\", \"FixtureManager\")`\n\n3. Lastly, given that we need to modify the output of `--fixtures` to include scope information, let's locate where the output for this argument is formatted and presented to the user.\n    - `search_method(\"format_fixtures\")`\n    - `search_method(\"showfixtures\")`\n\nThese searches aim to highlight the key areas in the pytest codebase related to registering and displaying fixtures and specifically how the `--fixtures` command-line option is implemented. With the information retrieved from these API calls, we'll have a solid foundation for implementing the requested feature."
