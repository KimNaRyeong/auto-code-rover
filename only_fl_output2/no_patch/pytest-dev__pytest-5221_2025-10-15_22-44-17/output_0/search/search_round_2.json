Let's break down the findings:\n\n### 1. `showfixtures` and `show_fixtures_per_test`\n\nThe `showfixtures` method seems to be a primary entry point invoked when the `--fixtures` command-line argument is used. It delegates to `_showfixtures_main` within a `wrap_session` call, indicating that it's preparing and executing a session-specific operation, presumably listing available fixtures.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug**: Since the issue involves enhancing `--fixtures` output, it's likely that `showfixtures` or its delegated function `_showfixtures_main` (which wasn't directly retrieved) will need modifications to include fixture scope information.\n- **Intended behavior**: This method should be modified or extended to collect and display fixture scope information alongside existing fixture data.\n\n### 2. `FixtureManager`\n\nThe `FixtureManager` class appears to be central to managing fixture definitions, including parsing, registration, and retrieval. It contains method placeholders for registering plugins, retrieving fixture information, and more.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug**: Although we didn't find `add_fixturedef` directly, it's clear that the `FixtureManager` handles the internal mechanics related to fixtures. Information on fixture scope must reside within or be accessible through `FixtureManager` or its managed objects.\n- **Intended behavior**: If the fixture scope data is managed here, we might need to interface with this class or its methods to retrieve scope information to be included in the output of `showfixtures`.\n\nGiven the above, the next steps in resolving the issue should include:\n- **Dive deeper into `FixtureManager`** to understand how scope information is stored or associated with fixtures. This might involve looking for methods that relate to fixture scope even if `add_fixturedef` wasn't found. Given the context, useful API calls could include `search_code(\"fixture scope\")` or more targeted searches for methods in `FixtureManager` not identified earlier.\n- **Further investigation of `_showfixtures_main`**, which seems to be the core function called by `showfixtures` and likely responsible for generating the output of listed fixtures. This function wasn't directly retrieved in our search results, suggesting a need to closely examine the code mentioned in the `showfixtures` snippet or to search more explicitly for `_showfixtures_main`.\n\nContinuing with the investigation requires more specific API calls based on these findings, such as:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"_showfixtures_main\", \"src/_pytest/python.py\")`\n- `search_code(\"scope\", \"src/_pytest/fixtures.py\")`\n\nThese steps are aimed at pinpointing where and how to include fixture scope information in the `pytest --fixtures` output."

The method collects fixture definitions, deduplicates them, sorts, and then iteratively formats each for output. \n\n- **Relationship to the bug:** This method is directly related to the issue as it is responsible for generating the output seen by the user when they invoke `pytest --fixtures`. The existing implementation, however, does not include fixture scope information in the output.\n\n- **Intended behavior:** The method should be extended to include the scope of each fixture in its output. This involves retrieving the scope from each `fixturedef` object (`fixturedef.scope`) and including this information in the printed output so that users can see the scope at which each fixture is available.\n\n### 2. Fixture Scope Handling in `src/_pytest/fixtures.py`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?** From the returned search results, it is evident that fixture scope is handled in various methods within `src/_pytest/fixtures.py`. Methods and functions such as `get_scope_node`, `fixture`, and `_compute_fixture_value` likely interact with fixture scope in different ways, from determining the correct scope for fixture execution to defining fixtures.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug:** Since fixture scope is integral to how fixtures are defined and managed, this file and its methods are crucial for resolving the issue. However, without specific access to the code of each method, it's clear that the concept of \"scope\" is widely used and key to how `pytest` manages fixtures.\n\n- **Intended behavior:** While specific modifications were not identified in this step, the intended behavior would involve ensuring that fixture definitions (`fixturedef` objects) accurately reflect their scope and that this scope is accessible for use in output formatting functions like `_showfixtures_main`.\n\nGiven the comprehensive understanding of how fixtures are handled and displayed in `pytest`, the next steps towards resolving the issue would involve:\n\n1. **Modifying `_showfixtures_main`** to retrieve and display fixture scope information. This means adjusting the line in the loop that formats `funcargspec` (or after it) to include `fixturedef.scope`. Ensure this addition respects the `verbose` setting, possibly including more detailed output when `verbose` is higher.\n\n2. **Reviewing and potentially refactoring how fixtures' scope data is accessed**, ensuring it's straightforward and efficient to retrieve the scope of a fixture for inclusion in the output. This may not require specific changes to `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` based on this investigation but understanding how scopes are represented and accessed in this file will be valuable for correctly implementing the feature in `_showfixtures_main`.\n\nThese adjustments would address the issue by enhancing the output of `pytest --fixtures` to include the much-needed scope information, aligning with the intended behavior outlined for `_showfixtures_main`."

Upon printing each fixture's information, the fixture's scope should be retrieved from the `fixturedef.scope` attribute and included next to the fixture's name or description in the output. Importantly, the addition of scope information must be done in a manner that keeps the output readable and consistent with `pytest`'s existing output formatting standards. The modification should ensure that for each fixture listed, its scope (e.g., \"function\", \"module\", \"class\", \"session\") is clearly indicated, helping users understand at which level each fixture is available without altering the primary functionality of listing fixtures.\n\nGiven that the current mechanism for listing fixtures already involves sorting and deduplicating fixtures based on various criteria, the inclusion of scope in the output should respect these mechanisms and integrate seamlessly with them.
