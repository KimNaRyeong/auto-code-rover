        "intended_behavior": "This function must precisely manage the datatype of input arrays throughout the distance computation process. When handling `float32` inputs, the function should either avoid converting these inputs to `float64` or ensure such conversions do not affect the final precision of the output. If intermediate steps require `float64` for accuracy, the final output must be converted back to `float32` in a manner that does not introduce significant precision loss, aligning with the precision obtainable through direct `np.linalg.norm` calculations using `float32`. This would involve scrutinizing and potentially adjusting any arithmetic operations, array initializations, or other operations that could cause unintended datatype conversions or precision loss."
