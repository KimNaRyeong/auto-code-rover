        "content": "<issue>Numerical precision of euclidean_distances with float32\n#### Description\nI noticed that sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances function agrees with np.linalg.norm when using np.float64 arrays, but disagrees when using np.float32 arrays. See the code snippet below.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy\nimport sklearn.metrics.pairwise\n# create 64-bit vectors a and b that are very similar to each other\na_64 = np.array([61.221637725830078125, 71.60662841796875,    -65.7512664794921875],  dtype=np.float64)\nb_64 = np.array([61.221637725830078125, 71.60894012451171875, -65.72847747802734375], dtype=np.float64)\n# create 32-bit versions of a and b\na_32 = a_64.astype(np.float32)\nb_32 = b_64.astype(np.float32)\n# compute the distance from a to b using numpy, for both 64-bit and 32-bit\ndist_64_np = np.array([np.linalg.norm(a_64 - b_64)], dtype=np.float64)\ndist_32_np = np.array([np.linalg.norm(a_32 - b_32)], dtype=np.float32)\n# compute the distance from a to b using sklearn, for both 64-bit and 32-bit\ndist_64_sklearn = sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances([a_64], [b_64])\ndist_32_sklearn = sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances([a_32], [b_32])\n# note that the 64-bit sklearn results agree exactly with numpy, but the 32-bit results disagree\nnp.set_printoptions(precision=200)\nprint(dist_64_np)\nprint(dist_32_np)\nprint(dist_64_sklearn)\nprint(dist_32_sklearn)\n```\n#### Expected Results\nI expect that the results from sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances would agree with np.linalg.norm for both 64-bit and 32-bit. In other words, I expect the following output:\n```\n[ 0.0229059506440019884643266578905240749008953571319580078125]\n[ 0.02290595136582851409912109375]\n[[ 0.0229059506440019884643266578905240749008953571319580078125]]\n[[ 0.02290595136582851409912109375]]\n```\n#### Actual Results\nThe code snippet above produces the following output for me:\n```\n[ 0.0229059506440019884643266578905240749008953571319580078125]\n[ 0.02290595136582851409912109375]\n[[ 0.0229059506440019884643266578905240749008953571319580078125]]\n[[ 0.03125]]\n```\n#### Versions\n```\nDarwin-16.6.0-x86_64-i386-64bit\n('Python', '2.7.11 | 64-bit | (default, Jun 11 2016, 03:41:56) \\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)]')\n('NumPy', '1.11.3')\n('SciPy', '0.19.0')\n('Scikit-Learn', '0.18.1')\n```\n[WIP] Stable and fast float32 implementation of euclidean_distances\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\nFixes #9354\nSuperseds PR #10069\n#### What does this implement/fix?

The hardcoded amount of additional memory of 10MB is also derived from a benchmark.\nAs a side bonus, this implementation should also support float16 out of the box, should scikit-learn support it at some point.\nAdd a test for numeric precision (see #9354)\nSurprisingly bad precision, isn't it?\nNote that the traditional computation sqrt(sum((x-y)**2)) gets the results exact.\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\n#### What does this implement/fix?

        "content": "Analyzing the results from the API calls, we can start by examining what each part of the code does and its relationship with the bug.\n\n### Analysis of `pairwise_distances` Implementation\n\nThe snippet from `pairwise_distances` in `sklearn/metrics/pairwise.py` outlines how distances between vector arrays (or between two vector arrays) are computed. It supports a variety of distance metrics, including those native to scikit-learn and those coming from `scipy.spatial.distance`. Specifically, for common metrics like 'euclidean', it mentions an optimization that uses a scikit-learn specific implementation which is faster and supports sparse matrices.\n\n**Relationship with the Bug:** The issue reported involves a discrepancy in numerical precision when using `float32` arrays with the `euclidean` metric. The code snippet does not directly show handling of different data types such as `float32` vs. `float64`, but it does indicate that the function is designed to delegate the calculation to optimized implementations or to scipy functions, depending on the specified metric.\n\n**Intended Behavior:** Ideally, `pairwise_distances` should handle `float32` and `float64` data types such that the precision of the output is consistent with the precision provided by numpy functions, like `np.linalg.norm`. The reported issue suggests that somewhere within `pairwise_distances` or in the functions it delegates to, `float32` data might not be handled optimally for the 'euclidean' metric.\n\n### Euclidean Distances References\n\nWhile the search for \"euclidean_distances\" within the codebase returned multiple files where it is mentioned or used, without specific details on the snippets, it's hard to directly link to how it handles `float32`. However, it is clear that \"euclidean_distances\" is widely used across different modules in sklearn, ranging from clustering to manifold learning.\n\n**Relationship with the Bug:** Since \"euclidean_distances\" is a pivotal function, its implementation is likely optimized for different scenarios, including potential special handling for float32 data types. Any bugs or idiosyncrasies in its implementation could explain why the `pairwise_distances` function exhibits precision discrepancies.\n\n### References to `float32`\n\nThe broad references to `float32` across the codebase in various contexts, from benchmarks to specific models, indicate that sklearn is designed to support `float32` data types. Given the variety of contexts (e.g., linear models, decomposition, ensemble methods) where `float32` is referenced, we can infer that sklearn aims to handle this data type efficiently.\n\n**Relationship with the Bug:** Since the issue describes a specific problem with numerical precision in `float32`, these references suggest that there might be a uniform way of handling `float32` arrays that could be optimized further or that an inconsistency in such handling is causing the reported discrepancy.\n\n### Next Steps in Investigation\n\nGiven the information gathered and the analysis above, further steps should involve:\n\n1. **Deep Dive into `pairwise_distances` Handling of Data Types:** Specifically, how does `pairwise_distances` and the underlying `euclidean_distances` function handle `float32` and `float64` data types? Is there an implicit typecasting happening that degrades precision for `float32`?\n   \n2. **Review of Euclidean Distances Calculation:** It seems essential to specifically review the code implementation of \"euclidean_distances\" in `sklearn/metrics/pairwise.py`, to understand how exactly distances are computed and if any optimization or code path affects `float32` precision differently from `float64`.\n\n3. **Explore How Other Modules Handle `float32`:** Given the widespread references to `float32`, examining if there's a consistent pattern or best practice that `pairwise_distances` might not be adhering to could provide clues.\n\nTo proceed with these steps, a deeper look into the `euclidean_distances` function within `pairwise_distances` could be enlightening. This would involve reviewing its specific implementation details and any code that it specifically calls for dealing with numerical operations on `float32` data."

Specifically, when the inputs are of type `float32`, the calculations (or any intermediate casting to `float64`) should be handled in a way that the final output retains `float32` precision, aligning with the numpy `np.linalg.norm` function's results. This may involve adjusting the delegation logic within `pairwise_distances` to handle `float32` inputs differently or ensuring that any downcast to `float32` after a computation in `float64` (if necessary for higher precision intermediate steps) happens in a way that minimizes precision loss.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `sklearn/metrics/pairwise.py`\n  - **Function:** `euclidean_distances` implementation detail within the file.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The implementation of `euclidean_distances` should explicitly consider the input data types (`float32` vs. `float64`) ensuring that the entire calculation path is optimized for minimal precision loss when dealing with `float32`. If the function relies on NumPy or other backend operations that might lead to unintentional typecasting or precision loss, these spots should be carefully managed to preserve `float32` precision. The intended behavior would include reviewing and potentially redesigning the computation flow to mitigate precision loss - for example, by using `dtype=np.float32` when initializing any new NumPy arrays or carefully managing any intermediate steps that might cause unwanted upcasting to `float64` and then a lossy conversion back to `float32`.\n\nThese adjustments will ensure that the precision of distance calculations in scikit-learn remains consistent across different numerical types, addressing the issue reported."
