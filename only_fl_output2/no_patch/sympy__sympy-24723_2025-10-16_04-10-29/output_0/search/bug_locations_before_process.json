        "intended_behavior": "The code within this location should accurately compute the probability density function (PDF) for a `MatrixNormal` distribution. This includes correcting the calculation of the constant term in the PDF to align with the mathematical definition provided in the issue description. Specifically, the constant in the denominator should reflect the correct formulation of \\(\\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{\\frac{kn}{2}}}\\) considering the dimensions of the matrix. The correction ensures the PDF calculation is mathematically accurate, thereby resolving the discrepancy highlighted in the issue. This fix should not alter the broader functionality of the `MatrixNormal` distribution's implementation within Sympy but rather correct the specific issue with the PDF computation to ensure its correctness and reliability in statistical analysis tasks."
