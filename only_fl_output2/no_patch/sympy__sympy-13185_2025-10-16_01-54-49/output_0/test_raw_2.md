Given the requirements, here is a modified version of the script that attempts to reproduce the original issue of strange behaviour with `cse()` and `MatrixSymbol` indexing. This script explicitly checks for the problem highlighted—where `x0` and `x2` seem to incorrectly behave as mere copies of `a` and `b`—and raises an `AssertionError` if such unexpected behavior is detected. The script aims to provide clear output and error tracking:

```python
import sympy as sp

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def sub_in_matrixsymbols(exp, matrices):
    for matrix in matrices:
        for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):
            for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):
                name = f"{matrix.name}_{i}_{j}"
                sym = sp.symbols(name)
                exp = exp.subs(sym, matrix[i, j])
    return exp

def t44(name):
    return sp.Matrix(4, 4, lambda i, j: sp.symbols(f'{name}_{i}_{j}'))

def test_issue():
    # Construct matrices of symbols
    a = t44("a")
    b = t44("b")

    # Set up expression
    e = a * b

    # Replace symbols with MatrixSymbols
    e2 = sub_in_matrixsymbols(e, [sp.MatrixSymbol("a", 4, 4), sp.MatrixSymbol("b", 4, 4)])
    cse_subs, cse_reduced = sp.cse(e2)

    # The following block attempts to reproduce and identify the described issue
    for sym, expr in cse_subs:
        if isinstance(expr, sp.MatrixExpr):  # This checks if expr is a Matrix expression
            continue  # This is expected, we skip to the next iteration
        else:
            # The issue of concern: if Matrix expressions get improperly reduced to scalar symbols
            if isinstance(expr, sp.Symbol):
                raise AssertionError("Unexpected symbol substitution in cse reduction for MatrixSymbols.")

    # This statement will only be reached if no AssertionError was raised,
    # indicating the script did not encounter the described problem 
    print("Issue not present, or the diagnosis criteria needs adjustment.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    exit(0)
```

This version fixes the attempt at using `sp.MatrixElement`, relying instead on a more general check for if expressions are improperly reduced to scalar symbols when they're expected to reference or be part of `MatrixExpr`. Furthermore, it correctly handles the potential exceptions, printing a stack trace for better diagnosis if something goes wrong.
