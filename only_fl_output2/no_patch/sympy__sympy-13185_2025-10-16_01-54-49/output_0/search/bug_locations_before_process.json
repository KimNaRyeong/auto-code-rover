        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior of the `cse` method should include improved handling of `MatrixSymbol` indexing to efficiently recognize and extract common subexpressions involving indexed elements of matrix symbols. This improvement should ensure that when matrix operations (specifically multiplication, as highlighted in the issue) involve repeated elements of `MatrixSymbol` instances, these are identified as common subexpressions, minimizing the redundancy in the generated code. The optimization should preserve the existing functionality for non-matrix expressions and other types of operations, only extending the optimization capabilities to better support matrix expressions. This means enhancing the algorithm's ability to parse and recognize patterns in expressions involving `MatrixSymbol` indexed operations without affecting the performance and output for other types of symbolic expressions."
