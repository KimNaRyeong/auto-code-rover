Given the previous attempt did not directly address the intended issue reproduction and instead encountered an installation-related error which lies outside the scenario you've described, let's adjust the strategy slightly. Below is a revised version of `reproducer.py` that directly aims to reproduce the described issue regarding the `label_ranking_average_precision_score` calculation in a clean and isolated manner, ensuring that any potential error is truly related to the issue described.

```python
import numpy as np
import sklearn.metrics
from sklearn.metrics import label_ranking_average_precision_score

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_label_ranking_average_precision():
    # Define inputs
    truth = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=bool)
    scores = np.array([[0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]])
    sample_weight = [1.0, 1.0, 0.0]

    # Expected result based on manual calculation / expected behavior
    expected_result = 0.625  # Average precision of first and second samples only

    # Calculate actual result using sklearn function with sample weighting
    actual_result = label_ranking_average_precision_score(truth, scores, sample_weight=sample_weight)

    # Compare actual result with expected result
    try:
        assert np.isclose(actual_result, expected_result), \
            f"Expected weighted average precision to be {expected_result}, but got {actual_result}."
        print("The test passed: the issue is not present.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("The test failed: the issue is present.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise  # Re-raise the caught AssertionError to ensure the script exits with a non-zero exit code for failed cases

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_label_ranking_average_precision()
    except AssertionError:
        exit(1)
    exit(0)
```

This script is structured to:

1. Perform the calculation with inputs that highlight the alleged issue.
2. Evaluate whether the special case of handling samples with zero labels (all false) is improperly ignoring sample weights.
3. Compare the actual outcome against the expected behavior and assert correctness.
4. Utilize the `print_stacktrace` function to enhance debugging information visibility if the assertion fails.

This refined script should be more focused on identifying whether the specific problem with `label_ranking_average_precision_score` exists as described, free from errors unrelated to the logic in question.
