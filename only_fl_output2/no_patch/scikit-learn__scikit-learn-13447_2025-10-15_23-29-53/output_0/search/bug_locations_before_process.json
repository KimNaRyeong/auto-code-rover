        "intended_behavior": "When processing samples with all labels being true or all labels being false (the special cases), the `sample_weight` should be applied to these samples before they contribute to the cumulative score, `out`. Specifically, instead of adding `1.` directly to `out` for these cases (line 731), the code should first check if `sample_weight` is not `None`. If it isn't, it should add `sample_weight[i]` instead of `1.` to `out`, ensuring that each sample's weighted contribution is accurately reflected in the overall metric. This change will ensure that the calculation of the label ranking average precision score correctly applies sample weights across all samples, including those with uniform labels, thus aligning the function's behavior with the expected metric calculation under weighted conditions."
