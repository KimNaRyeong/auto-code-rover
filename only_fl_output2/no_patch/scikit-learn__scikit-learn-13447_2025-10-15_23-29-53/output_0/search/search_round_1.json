Separately, individual samples whose labels are the same for all classes (all true or all false) are treated as a special case (precision == 1, [line 732](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7b136e9/sklearn/metrics/ranking.py#L732)). However, this special case bypasses the application of sample_weight ([line 740](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7b136e9/sklearn/metrics/ranking.py#L740)).  So, in the case where there is both non-default sample_weighting and samples with, for instance, zero labels, the reported metric is wrong.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\nSee example in [this colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19P-6UgIMZSUgBcLyR7jm9oELacrYNJE7)\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport sklearn.metrics\n# Per sample APs are 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 (default for zero labels).\ntruth = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=np.bool)\nscores = np.array([[0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]])\nprint(sklearn.metrics.label_ranking_average_precision_score(\ntruth, scores, sample_weight=[1.0, 1.0, 0.0]))\n```\n#### Expected Results\nAverage of AP of first and second samples = 0.625\n#### Actual Results\nSum of AP of all three samples, divided by sum of weighting vector = 2.25/2 = 1.125\n#### Versions\nSystem:\npython: 3.6.7 (default, Oct 22 2018, 11:32:17)  [GCC 8.2.0]\nexecutable: /usr/bin/python3\nmachine: Linux-4.14.79+-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-18.04-bionic\nBLAS:\nmacros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\nlib_dirs: /usr/local/lib\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\nPython deps:\npip: 19.0.3\nsetuptools: 40.8.0\nsklearn: 0.20.3\nnumpy: 1.14.6\nscipy: 1.1.0\nCython: 0.29.6\npandas: 0.22.0\n</issue>"

The key steps in this calculation are:\n- Line 722 initializes the score accumulator `out` and other variables.\n- The loop starting from line 724 iterates over each sample in the input.\n- The conditional block starting at line 728 checks if all labels for a given sample are either relevant (all true) or irrelevant (all false). If so, it increases the score accumulator `out` by 1 and continues to the next iteration without further processing for that sample, as indicated by `continue` on line 732.\n- The sample's scores are then ranked, and an auxiliary score (`aux`) is calculated based on these ranks.\n- If a `sample_weight` is provided, it is applied to `aux` before adding `aux` to the cumulative score `out`.\n- The average precision score is then normalized by the total number of samples (`n_samples`) or the sum of `sample_weight` if provided.\n\n### Relationship between this part of the code and the bug\nThe issue report highlights a significant oversight: **when samples have all labels either true or false (resulting in a precision of 1 for those samples), the function correctly avoids unnecessary calculation by incrementing the score by 1 and moving to the next iteration. However, it incorrectly omits applying the `sample_weight` to these samples.** This behavior contradicts the expected behavior where `sample_weight` should influence the score of all samples, including those with all labels true or false. This inconsistency in applying `sample_weight` directly leads to the inaccurate computation of the final metric, notably in scenarios where weighted averages are necessary for an accurate assessment.\n\n### Intended behavior of this part of the code\nThe intended behavior would be for each sample's contribution to the final score to be weighted by its corresponding `sample_weight`, if provided. This should hold true regardless of the label configuration for the sample (whether all true, all false, or a mix). Thus, the handling of the special case described around lines 728-732 should include logic to account for `sample_weight` before continuing to the next iteration. \n\nFor the correct application of `sample_weight`, even for the special case when the sample has all labels equal, the modification might involve checking if `sample_weight` is not `None` and then, instead of just adding 1 to `out`, adding `1.0 * sample_weight[i]` for the corresponding sample. This adjustment would ensure that every sample's contribution to the overall metric is appropriately scaled by its weight, aligning with the intended behavior and resolving the reported issue."

Specifically, instead of adding `1.` directly to `out` for these cases (line 731), the code should first check if `sample_weight` is not `None`. If it isn't, it should add `sample_weight[i]` instead of `1.` to `out`, ensuring that each sample's weighted contribution is accurately reflected in the overall metric. This change will ensure that the calculation of the label ranking average precision score correctly applies sample weights across all samples, including those with uniform labels, thus aligning the function's behavior with the expected metric calculation under weighted conditions."
