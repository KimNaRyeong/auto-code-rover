Certainly, below is the revised version of `reproducer.py` tailored to directly address and detect the specified issue regarding the `label_ranking_average_precision_score` function not applying `sample_weight` to items with zero true labels. The script includes error handling to precisely identify and signify the presence of the issue through an assertion and detailed stack trace for diagnostic purposes.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import label_ranking_average_precision_score

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Example inputs where sample_weighting is expected to influence the result
    truth = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=np.bool)
    scores = np.array([[0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]])
    sample_weight = [1.0, 1.0, 0.0]

    try:
        # Compute label ranking average precision score with sample_weight applied
        result = label_ranking_average_precision_score(truth, scores, sample_weight=sample_weight)
        
        # The expected outcome assumes the third sample is ignored due to weight of 0.0, thus considering only first two samples
        # AP for first sample: 1.0 (perfect match)
        # AP for second sample: (0.5 + 1.0)/2 = 0.75 (match on last label position contributes half the precision of a perfect match)
        # Expected average: (1.0 + 0.75) / 2 = 0.875
        expected_result = (1.0 + 0.75) / 2

        assert np.isclose(result, expected_result), "Sample weighting not applied correctly."
        print("No issue detected: test passed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Issue Detected: test failed.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except Exception as e:
        exit(1)
    exit(0)
```

This script checks whether the sample weighting is correctly applied to items with zero true labels by comparing the result of the `label_ranking_average_precision_score` function against the manually calculated expected result. If the assertion fails (indicating the issue is present), it prints a detailed stack trace to help diagnose the problem.
