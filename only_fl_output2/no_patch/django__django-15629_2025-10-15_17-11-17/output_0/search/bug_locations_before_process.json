        "intended_behavior": "When a primary key field's db_collation is altered, the MigrationAutodetector should not only generate an AlterField operation for this field but also ensure that any foreign key fields referencing it are included in the migration operations with their db_collation altered to match. This involves extending the field comparison mechanism to recognize changes in db_collation as significant for migration, automatically generating AlterField operations for both the changed field and any referencing foreign key fields, and ensuring that these operations are executed in a sequence that maintains referential integrity and consistency across the database schema. Additionally, it's essential to ensure that dependency management within the generated migrations accounts for these operations, including setting the correct dependencies in the migration file to ensure that the AlterField operation for the foreign key fields is executed after the alteration of the primary key field they reference."
