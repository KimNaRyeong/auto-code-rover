Given the requirements and the context around the test failure, let me provide you with a revised standalone Python script that attempts to specifically reproduce the test failure scenario regarding the `test_unicode_multipart_post_fieldnames` failure. This script will focus on the specifics of encoding field names in a multipart POST request as described in the original issue.

```python
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def httpbin(endpoint):
    """
    Helper function to format URL for httpbin testing.
    """
    return f'https://httpbin.org/{endpoint}'

def test_unicode_multipart_post_fieldnames():
    try:
        # Mimic the scenario described in the original issue with field names and file
        data = {'stuff'.encode('utf-8'): 'elixr'}
        files = {'file': ('test_requests.py', open(__file__, 'rb'))}
        r = requests.Request(method='POST',url=httpbin('post'),data=data,files=files)
        prep = r.prepare()

        # Assertions that replicate the scenario in the original test
        assert b'name="stuff"' in prep.body, "The byte string 'name=\"stuff\"' was not found in the request body."
        assert b'name="b\'stuff\'"' not in prep.body, "The byte string 'name=\"b\'stuff\'\"' was unexpectedly found in the request body."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Ensure that exception causes a non-zero exit, indicative of failure to match expected behavior
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_unicode_multipart_post_fieldnames()
```

This script aims to reproduce the issue as closely as possible based on the original description given. It should trigger an `AssertionError` if the problem described in the issue exists, and it will print a detailed stack trace to help locate the source of the failure.

Before running the script, make sure the project's root directory is properly set up and that you have the `requests` library installed in your Python environment. You can install the requests library using `pip install requests` if it's not already installed.

If the issue has been resolved in a newer version of the `requests` library or if the behavior does not match the failure scenario for any reason, the script will pass without an exception, indicating that the specific issue cannot be reproduced under these test conditions.
