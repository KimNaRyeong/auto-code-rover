Given the request for a specific `reproducer.py` script that raises an `AssertionError` when the issue is present and provides a clear stack trace if the error occurs, below is such a script tailored for the scenario described. This script attempts to simulate the HTTP POST operation with multipart/form-data including a file upload and a text field, similar to what was described in the reported issue.

```python
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def httpbin(endpoint):
    """
    Helper function to format URL for httpbin.
    """
    return f'https://httpbin.org/{endpoint}'

def test_unicode_multipart_post_fieldnames():
    try:
        # Preparing a request that mimics the test case scenario
        files = {'file': ('reproducer.py', open('reproducer.py', 'rb'))}
        data = {b'stuff': b'elixr'}  # Encoding keys and values as bytes
        response = requests.post(httpbin('post'), files=files, data=data)

        # Convert response body to JSON and retrieve the 'files' and 'form' part
        resp_json = response.json()
        form_data = resp_json['form']
        files_data = resp_json['files']

        # Assert conditions based on reported issue
        assert 'stuff' in form_data, "Form field 'stuff' not found in response."
        assert b'name="stuff"' in response.request.body, "Byte string 'name=\"stuff\"' not found in request body."
        assert b'name="b\'stuff\'"' not in response.request.body, "Byte string 'name=\"b\\'stuff\\'' unexpectedly found in request body."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise  # Re-raise the exception to allow the script to exit with a non-zero status if the assertion fails.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_unicode_multipart_post_fieldnames()
```

This script performs an HTTP POST request to httpbin.org with a file and a piece of data that should reproduce the issue described if it still exists in the `requests` library being used. If an `AssertionError` is raised due to the conditions being met (or not met), a detailed stack trace will be printed to standard error. The script exits with code 0 when the test passes, denoting the issue is fixed or unable to be reproduced under these conditions.
