        "intended_behavior": "The deserialization logic should robustly handle the resolution of natural keys to foreign keys across different databases, not just the default. This means ensuring that when loaddata is invoked with a specific database target, the deserialization logic respects the database alias and correctly queries for related object instances using their natural keys within the specified database context. This would involve potentially enhancing the way get_by_natural_key is invoked or how the database context is passed down to the queryset methods querying for related objects during the deserialization process. The goal would be to maintain the functionality of loading data via natural keys while ensuring the correct database is targeted throughout the process."
