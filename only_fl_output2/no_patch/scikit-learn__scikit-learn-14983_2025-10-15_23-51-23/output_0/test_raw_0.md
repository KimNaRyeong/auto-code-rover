This script attempts to reproduce the issue described where the `__repr__` method of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` does not return the expected string representation of the object instances. When the issue is present, the script will raise an AssertionError and print a stack trace of the issue, clearly showing where the problem occurred. The script will exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed, as per the instruction, it doesn't explicitly do so on success, but Python scripts exit with 0 by default if they end without uncaught exceptions.
