        "content": "The collected context reveals that both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes are defined in the `sklearn/model_selection/_split.py` file and inherit from `_RepeatedSplits`. Since explicit `__repr__` methods were not found in either class, it's likely that their string representation defaults to Python's standard object representation, leading to the issue's observed behavior.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **What do these parts of the code do?**\n   - The provided code snippets show the initialization definitions (`__init__`) for `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`. These initializers set up instances with specific numbers of splits, repeats, and an optional random state, intended for use in cross-validation procedures.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The absence of a defined `__repr__` method in both classes means that Python falls back to the default representation provided by the base `object` class, which merely indicates the object's memory address. This behavior is not informative for users who wish to understand the configuration of a CV splitter object directly from its string representation.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be for both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` to provide a human-readable `__repr__` string that includes the class name and the initial parameters passed (`n_splits`, `n_repeats`, `random_state`). Such output should guide users on the object's configuration without needing to inspect its attributes manually.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nGiven the current context, it's important to determine how `__repr__` is typically implemented or inherited by similar classes within the same module or library, specifically those classes that correctly return informative `__repr__` strings. This will likely involve looking into the superclass `_RepeatedSplits` to see if it provides a `__repr__` implementation that could be extended or modified to fix the reported issue for its subclasses. Following actions are proposed:\n\n- search_class(\"_RepeatedSplits\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"__repr__\", \"_RepeatedSplits\")"

This class serves as a base class for `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`, as inferred from the initial class search results and the nature of these classes within scikit-learn's architecture.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `_RepeatedSplits` class serves as an abstract base class for creating repeated splits of data for cross-validation. It defines the basic structure and behavior (e.g., `split` and `get_n_splits` methods) that its subclasses should adhere to or extend. The constructor initializes instances with parameters common across the subclasses, such as `n_repeats` and `random_state`.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Since `_RepeatedSplits` is the common base class for both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` and does not have a `__repr__` method, this absence directly relates to the reported issue. The subclasses inherit this lack, resulting in the default object representation instead of a more informative string detailing key parameter values.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would include implementing a `__repr__` method within `_RepeatedSplits` or directly within its subclasses. This method should return a descriptive string accurately reflecting the name of the class and the values of its key parameters (`n_splits`, `n_repeats`, `random_state`). Implementing such a method in `_RepeatedSplits` could provide a uniform and efficient way to achieve the desired `__repr__` functionality across both subclasses, assuming no subclass-specific adjustments are necessary.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince the `__repr__` method is absent in both the subclasses and their base class `_RepeatedSplits`, an effective resolution to the reported issue involves adding a `__repr__` method to either level. However, adding this method directly to `_RepeatedSplits` might present a more centralized and maintainable approach, benefiting not only `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` but also any future subclasses of `_RepeatedSplits`.\n\n### Further Action:\n\nGiven this analysis does not require further context as we've identified the location and nature of the required fix. The action plan involves implementing a `__repr__` method within the `_RepeatedSplits` class, designed to dynamically return a string formatted with the actual class name and the instantiated values of `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`. This approach assumes these parameter names and their significance are consistent across current and future subclasses of `_RepeatedSplits`."

This method will dynamically construct and return a string that provides a descriptive representation of the instance, including the initialized values of `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`. This string should be formatted to reflect the actual class of the instance (e.g., `RepeatedKFold` or `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`), making use of the instance's class attribute or a similar mechanism to obtain the correct name.
