This approach ensures that any subclass of _RepeatedSplits, including RepeatedKFold and RepeatedStratifiedKFold, will automatically benefit from a more informative __repr__, enhancing the user experience by providing clear, concise, and accurate descriptions of these objects without requiring additional per-class implementations."
