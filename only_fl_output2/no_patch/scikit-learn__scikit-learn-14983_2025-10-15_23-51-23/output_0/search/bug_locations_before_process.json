        "intended_behavior": "Implement a new __repr__ method within the _RepeatedSplits class. This method will dynamically construct and return a string that provides a descriptive representation of the instance, including the initialized values of n_splits, n_repeats, and random_state. This string should be formatted to reflect the actual class of the instance (e.g., RepeatedKFold or RepeatedStratifiedKFold), making use of the instance's class attribute or a similar mechanism to obtain the correct name. This approach ensures that any subclass of _RepeatedSplits, including RepeatedKFold and RepeatedStratifiedKFold, will automatically benefit from a more informative __repr__, enhancing the user experience by providing clear, concise, and accurate descriptions of these objects without requiring additional per-class implementations."
