Certainly! Based on your request, I've created a standalone `reproducer.py` script that aims to reproduce the original issue concerning the incorrect `__repr__` strings for `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes from `scikit-learn`. The script also incorporates the `print_stacktrace` function for detailed error logging.

```python
# reproducer.py

def main():
    from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedKFold, RepeatedStratifiedKFold

    # Create instances of RepeatedKFold and RepeatedStratifiedKFold
    rkf = RepeatedKFold()
    rskf = RepeatedStratifiedKFold()

    # Expected __repr__ string patterns
    expected_rkf_repr = "RepeatedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)"
    expected_rskf_repr = "RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)"

    # Validate __repr__ strings
    try:
        assert repr(rkf) == expected_rkf_repr, f"Incorrect __repr__ for RepeatedKFold: {repr(rkf)}"
        assert repr(rskf) == expected_rskf_repr, f"Incorrect __repr__ for RepeatedStratifiedKFold: {repr(rskf)}"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError:
        # Ensures the script exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed, in this case, by catching the AssertionError.
        # Note: This is based on the premise - Exception indicates failure (issue present), no exception indicates success (issue fixed).
        exit(1) # Use exit(1) to indicate error due to assertion failing.
    exit(0) # Normal exit, indicating no issues with __repr__ strings detected.
```

This script checks the string representations of instances of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes. The script will raise an `AssertionError` if the actual `__repr__` output does not match the expected strings, thereby indicating the presence of the issue. The provided `print_stacktrace` function is utilized for detailed error logging when an assertion fails. Finally, the script is designed to exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed (i.e., no exceptions are raised), and with code 1 to signify an error when the assertion fails, indicating the presence of the bug.
