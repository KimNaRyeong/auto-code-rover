I see there may have been some confusion due to the error output you experienced, which seems related to a different problemâ€”specifically an issue with the scikit-learn installation or environment, not directly with the `__repr__` functionality itself. However, assuming you need a `reproducer.py` script focusing on the initially described `__repr__` issue, you should ensure your Python environment has a properly installed and built version of scikit-learn. Below is the proposed Python script as per your request:

```python
# reproducer.py

def main():
    from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedKFold, RepeatedStratifiedKFold

    rkf = RepeatedKFold()
    rskf = RepeatedStratifiedKFold()
    
    expected_repr_rkf = "RepeatedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)"
    expected_repr_rskf = "RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)"
    
    try:
        assert repr(rkf) == expected_repr_rkf, "RepeatedKFold __repr__ mismatch"
        assert repr(rskf) == expected_repr_rskf, "RepeatedStratifiedKFold __repr__ mismatch"
        print("Both representations are correct.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please follow these steps if you haven't already to ensure a correct scikit-learn setup, which might help in resolving the import error you encountered:
- Make sure you have installed scikit-learn properly in your environment. This can be done using pip (`pip install scikit-learn`) or conda (`conda install scikit-learn` if you're using a conda environment).
- If you're working from a source installation, make sure to compile the Cython extensions with `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`.

This script checks the `__repr__` outputs of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` and should behave as specified, raising an `AssertionError` and printing a stack trace if the representations do not match the expected values.
