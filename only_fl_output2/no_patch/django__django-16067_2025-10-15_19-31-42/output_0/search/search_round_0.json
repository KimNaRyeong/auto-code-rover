        "content": "To effectively resolve the issue, the following API calls are necessary to gather sufficient context:\n\n1. Search for the `DecimalField` class to understand how it processes and validates decimal values:\n   - `search_class(\"DecimalField\")`\n\n2. Search for the `DecimalValidator` class to get insight into how validation is performed and potentially identify where the scientific notation is not being handled properly:\n   - `search_class(\"DecimalValidator\")`\n\n3. Given that the traceback mentions the `clean` method raising a `ValidationError`, we need to inspect this method within the `DecimalField` class to understand how it interacts with decimal values and validators:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"clean\", \"DecimalField\")`\n\n4. Since the description indicates that the issue was introduced in a specific commit, looking at the code around `to_python` method, which is suggested as a workaround location, might provide insights on how adding `.normalize()` can be integrated properly or how it worked before:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"to_python\", \"DecimalField\")`\n\n5. Finally, to understand the validation logic that leads to the error, it's beneficial to inspect the code where the `DecimalValidator` is instantiated and used, specifically within the context of how it's applied to `DecimalField` values:\n   - `search_code(\"DecimalValidator(8, 7)\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive view of the `DecimalField` and `DecimalValidator` implementations, their interaction, and the validation process, enabling us to identify where and how the issue with scientific notation can be resolved."
