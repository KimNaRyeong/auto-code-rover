        "intended_behavior": "The `to_python` method should be enhanced to gracefully handle and validate decimal numbers expressed in scientific notation, specifically the representation of zero (e.g., '0E+1', '0E+2'). This enhancement entails recognizing such inputs as valid representations of zero and ensuring they do not raise a `ValidationError` when they meet the field's defined `max_digits` and `decimal_places` criteria. It should correctly parse scientific notation before applying any digit and decimal place constraints. This would involve normalizing the decimal to its expanded form or directly assessing its equivalency to zero (since any scientific notation of zero is still zero). Implementing this change should preserve the existing validation functionality while extending support for scientifically notated zero inputs."
