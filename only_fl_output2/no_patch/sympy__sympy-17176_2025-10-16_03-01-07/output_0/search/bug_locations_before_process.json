        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, `_finger` must be adjusted to produce distinct fingerprints for boolean expressions involving `Xor` and its negation. This implies enhancing how `_finger` evaluates and assigns fingerprints to more intricately consider the presence and roles of `Xor` and `~Xor` within expressions. The adjustment should ensure that the fingerprints reflect the unique logical structure brought by these operators, allowing `bool_map` to accurately differentiate them in its mapping process."

        "intended_behavior": "While the immediate bug seems more closely related to the `_finger` method, ensuring `bool_map` correctly uses the results from `_finger` may also require adjustments. Specifically, after improvements to `_finger`, `bool_map` should accurately recognize and apply the more refined distinctions in expression structures when determining logical equivalences and mappings. This means verifying the logic within `bool_map` that interprets and acts on fingerprint information aligns with the newly refined outputs of `_finger`, particularly in how it handles complex boolean expressions including `Xor` and negated `Xor`."
