        "content": "Based on the issue description, it is clear that the focal points are the `Xor` function, `bool_map` function, and `_finger` function within the sympy library. To understand how these components work and potentially interact with each other within the codebase, it would be necessary to investigate their definitions and usages. Here are the relevant API calls:\n\n1. To understand how `Xor` is implemented or used in sympy:\n   - `search_method(\"Xor\")`\n\n2. To investigate the `bool_map` function, which seems central to the issue described:\n   - `search_method(\"bool_map\")`\n\n3. Because the `_finger` function is highlighted as having a flaw, understanding its implementation will be critical:\n   - `search_method(\"_finger\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a broad context of where and how these components are implemented, enabling a more targeted investigation into how they interact and potentially why the issue described is occurring."
