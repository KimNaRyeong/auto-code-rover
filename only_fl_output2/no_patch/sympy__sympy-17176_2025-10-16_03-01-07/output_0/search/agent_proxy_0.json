To understand how these components work and potentially interact with each other within the codebase, it would be necessary to investigate their definitions and usages. Here are the relevant API calls:\n\n1. To understand how `Xor` is implemented or used in sympy:\n   - `search_method(\"Xor\")`\n\n2. To investigate the `bool_map` function, which seems central to the issue described:\n   - `search_method(\"bool_map\")`\n\n3. Because the `_finger` function is highlighted as having a flaw, understanding its implementation will be critical:\n   - `search_method(\"_finger\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a broad context of where and how these components are implemented, enabling a more targeted investigation into how they interact and potentially why the issue described is occurring."
