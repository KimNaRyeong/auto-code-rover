To create a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that will reproduce the described issue, we will simulate the scenario by using Django's test client. The script will interact with the Django application, mimicking the steps a user would take to trigger the problem. Ensure you have the Django project and app set up as described in the issue before running this script. The script below assumes that your Django app is named `app` and that you have a model named `File` as described. If your setup differs, you might need to adjust the script accordingly.

```python
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_environment():
    os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'csrfbug.settings'

def simulate_file_upload(client, file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as fp:
        response = client.post('/admin/app/file/add/', {'file': fp}, follow=True)
    return response.status_code, response.content.decode()

def main():
    setup_environment()
    import django
    django.setup()

    from django.test import Client
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User

    # Ensure the user exists for authentication
    if not User.objects.filter(username='admin').exists():
        User.objects.create_superuser('admin', 'admin@example.com', 'pass')

    client = Client()
    client.login(username='admin', password='pass')

    # Scenario 1: File uploads under FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE
    temp_file_path = 'media/tmp/test_file.tmp'
    with open(temp_file_path, 'wb') as temp_file:
        temp_file.write(b'x' * 1024)  # 1KB file

    status_code, content = simulate_file_upload(client, temp_file_path)
    if status_code != 200:
        print("Unexpected status code for small file upload.", file=sys.stderr)
    
    # Scenario 2: Remove temp directory and retry file upload
    os.rmdir('media/tmp')
    try:
        simulate_file_upload(client, temp_file_path)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("File upload failed due to CSRF error instead of a filesystem error.")

    # Cleanup: Recreate the folders for further tests or runs
    os.makedirs('media/tmp', exist_ok=True)

    # Scenario 3: Remove media directory entirely and try to upload
    os.system('rm -rf media')  # Be careful with this command
    try:
        simulate_file_upload(client, temp_file_path)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Missing CSRF error or incorrect handling when media directory is gone.")

    print("If this message is reached, the script did not detect the issue as expected.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print(ae)
        sys.exit(1)

**Important Notes:**

- This script directly manipulates the file system (creates, writes, and removes directories/files), so make sure you understand the implications of these actions within your project directory before running the script.
- It is a simplified example to trigger and demonstrate the core issue. The actual results might vary depending on the specific Django configuration and version.
- Make sure `media` and `media/tmp` exist and are writable by the script before running it for the first time or after testing Scenario 3.
- This script might need adjustments based on your Django project's specific set up, such as application name, authentication details, and the exact file paths.
- Running this script directly impacts the state of the application's environment (specifically the `media` directory). Consider running it in a controlled (development or testing) environment to prevent data loss or configuration issues.
