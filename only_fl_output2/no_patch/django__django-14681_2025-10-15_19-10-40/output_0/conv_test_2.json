Request aborted.\nReason given for failure: CSRF token missing or incorrect.\nExpected behaviour:\nFilesystem error or similar reporting incorrect media storage setup. \nComment:\nYes, the setup in this scenario is invalid to begin with, but the error message has nothing to do with the actual problem. \nI suspect a real problem with an underlying filesystem will also get covered in the same way.\n"

The following script is tailored for a Django environment and should be placed in the root directory of the Django project (`csrfbug`). Please ensure that your Django project name is `csrfbug`, or adjust the import paths accordingly.\n\nThis script will try to recreate the scenarios described by performing operations that mimic user actions (like file uploads) and the Django admin interface, without relying on an actual web browser or manual interactions.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport django\nfrom django.core.files.uploadedfile import SimpleUploadedFile\nfrom django.test import TestCase, Client\nfrom django.urls import reverse\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\nclass StorageIssueTestCase(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Django setup\n        os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'csrfbug.settings')\n        django.setup()\n\n        from django.contrib.auth.models import User\n        User.objects.create_superuser('admin', 'admin@test.com', 'password')\n        \n        # Make sure media directory is correctly set up\n        if not os.path.exists('media'):\n            os.makedirs('media')\n        if not os.path.exists('media/tmp'):\n            os.makedirs('media/tmp')\n\n        self.client = Client()\n        self.admin_login()\n\n    def admin_login(self):\n        self.client.login(username='admin', password='password')\n\n    def test_upload_scenario(self):\n        # Upload file under normal circumstances\n        try:\n            self.upload_file(\"test1.txt\", content=b'Hello', expect_failure=False)\n        except AssertionError:\n            raise AssertionError(\"Scenario 1 failed: File upload should work with correct setup.\")\n        \n        # Remove media/tmp directory and retry upload\n        os.rmdir('media/tmp')\n        try:\n            self.upload_file(\"test2.txt\", content=b'Hello', expect_failure=True)\n        except AssertionError:\n            raise AssertionError(\"Scenario 2 failed: Expected failure when media/tmp directory is missing.\")\n\n        # Remove whole media directory and retry upload\n        os.system('rm -rf media')  # Warning: This removes the media directory!\n        try:\n            self.upload_file(\"test3.txt\", content=b'Hello', expect_failure=True)\n        except AssertionError:\n            raise AssertionError(\"Scenario 3 failed: Expected failure when media directory is missing.\")\n\n    def upload_file(self, name, content, expect_failure):\n        url = reverse('admin:app_file_add')\n        file = SimpleUploadedFile(name, content)\n        response = self.client.post(url, {'file': file}, follow=True)\n        \n        if expect_failure and response.status_code != 403:\n            raise AssertionError(\"Expected a CSRF failure but didn't get one.\")\n        elif not expect_failure and response.status_code == 403:\n            raise AssertionError(\"Got an unexpected CSRF failure.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    try:\n        StorageIssueTestCase().run_test('test_upload_scenario')\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise e\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        sys.exit(1)\n    else:\n        print(\"Test completed successfully - the issue is fixed.\")\n        sys.exit(0)\n```\n\nImportant notes:\n\n- This script uses Django's `TestCase` and testing client to simulate the web requests and the Django admin behavior.\n- Before running this script, ensure your Django project and `app` are properly configured, and the media paths align with the script's assumptions.\n- Adjust the Django settings module (`csrfbug.settings`) and model/admin registration (`app:app_file_add`) according to your project configuration.\n- This script will modify the filesystem (`media` directory), so ensure you understand these operations' implications or run them in a safe environment.\n- The script is designed to exit with code `0` when the issue is fixed (i.e., the behavior meets the expectations outlined in your scenario). It will raise exceptions and print stack traces when the issue is present or if there's an unexpected result."
