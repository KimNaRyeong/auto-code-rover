If a file upload fails due to storage configurations, instead of defaulting to a CSRF error, it should either allow the error to propagate or handle it in such a way that gives a clear indication of the actual problem to the developer or end-user. This method should preserve its primary function of managing CSRF tokens while ensuring that unrelated errors are not obscured."
