Below is a `reproducer.py` script tailored to address the described scenario. This script attempts to import the module in question and captures the `ImportError`. It checks if the version of the `py` library is `1.1.1` as specified, asserting the presence of the issue using the aforementioned error criteria. Finally, it uses the provided function to print the stack trace if the issue is replicated.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproducer():
    try:
        # This must replicate the import line that is failing
        from sympy.utilities import benchmarking
        # If the import passes, we assume the issue is fixed.
        print("No issue detected.")
        return 0
    except ImportError as e:
        # Catch the ImportError specifically related to the original issue
        # Validate version to assert this is the expected failure scenario
        import py
        assert py.__version__ == '1.1.1', "Test valid only for py version 1.1.1"
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Reaching this point means the assertion has passed and the issue is present.
        raise AssertionError("The issue with importing benchmarking from sympy.utilities is present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproducer()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
```

This script does the following:
- Attempts to import the `benchmarking` module from `sympy.utilities`, which is expected to fail with an `ImportError` due to the problematic import within `benchmarking.py`.
- Checks if the installed version of `py` is `1.1.1`. If not, it raises an assertion error to indicate that the test is only valid for version `1.1.1`.
- If the import fails as anticipated under the conditions defining the issue, it prints the stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function.
- If the script proceeds without encountering the import error (indicative of a scenario where the issue has been resolved), it simply prints a message indicating no issue was detected.
- The script is designed to be executed in the root directory of the project, making it simpler for those diagnosing the reported issue to quickly validate and understand the failure context.
