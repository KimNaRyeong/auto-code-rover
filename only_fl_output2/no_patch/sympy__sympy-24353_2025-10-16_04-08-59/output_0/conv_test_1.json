If not, it raises an assertion error to indicate that the test is only valid for version `1.1.1`.\n- If the import fails as anticipated under the conditions defining the issue, it prints the stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function.\n- If the script proceeds without encountering the import error (indicative of a scenario where the issue has been resolved), it simply prints a message indicating no issue was detected.\n- The script is designed to be executed in the root directory of the project, making it simpler for those diagnosing the reported issue to quickly validate and understand the failure context.\n"
