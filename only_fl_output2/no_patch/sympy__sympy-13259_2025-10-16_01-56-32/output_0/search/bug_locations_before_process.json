        "intended_behavior": "The simplify method needs to include additional logic or improve existing conditions to correctly handle simplification of trigonometric expressions with complex arguments. This specifically involves ensuring that transformations between trigonometric and hyperbolic functions respect the properties of complex numbers. For instance, it should verify the mathematical validity of such transformations with complex arguments and preserve the numerical equivalence of the expression before and after simplification. The method should ideally distinguish between cases where transformations like cos to cosh (and vice versa) are mathematically sound and those where they would lead to incorrect simplifications due to the presence of complex numbers. The enhancement should aim at maintaining the general functionality of simplify, improving its accuracy and reliability for expressions involving complex trigonometric functions."
