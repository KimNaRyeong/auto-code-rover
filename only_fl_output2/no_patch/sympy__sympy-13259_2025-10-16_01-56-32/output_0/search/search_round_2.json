Let's break down the steps required to collect relevant code context using the search APIs:\n\n1. **Investigate the `simplify` function:** Since the issue arises during the simplification process, it's crucial to examine the `simplify` method to understand how it decides to simplify expressions, especially trigonometric functions with complex arguments.\n\n2. **Examine the trigonometric functions (`cos` and `cosh`):** Understanding the implementation and interaction between `cos` and `cosh` in Sympy will provide insight into how these functions are transformed during simplification.\n\n3. **Look into handling of complex arguments:** Since the issue points out a specific problem with the handling of complex arguments in the context of trigonometric simplification, we might need to explore how complex numbers and their operations are managed in Sympy.\n\nBased on these steps, I'll perform the following API calls to gather the necessary code context:\n\n- `search_method(\"simplify\")`: To get an overview of where and how the `simplify` method is implemented.\n- `search_method(\"cos\")`: To find the implementation or overrides of the `cos` function, which might give clues on how it's treated differently when provided with complex arguments.\n- `search_method(\"cosh\")`: Similarly, to understand the implementation of the `cosh` function and any potential logic that could lead to its incorrect selection during simplification.\n\nThese searches should help us piece together why Sympy is incorrectly simplifying the expression by not handling complex arguments in trigonometric functions correctly."

        "content": "Analyzing the provided snippets:\n\n### 1. `simplify` method context\nThe search for `simplify` returned several matches throughout the codebase, indicating its widespread use for various types of expressions, including logic, matrices, vectors, functions, expressions, and polynomial domains. The reference to `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` suggests that this could be a central place where the general logic for simplification is implemented or orchestrated. This broad application hints at a complex underlying mechanism for simplification that likely delegates to more specific simplification routines based on the type of expression.\n\n**Relation to the bug:** The issue describes a specific case where the simplification process incorrectly transforms a trigonometric expression with a complex argument from `cos` to `cosh`. This suggests a potential flaw in the simplification logic or in the rules applied for trigonometric functions, especially those involving complex numbers. The intended behavior would be to accurately simplify expressions without altering their numerical equivalence, respecting the nature of trigonometric identities and complex numbers.\n\n### 2. `cos` method context\nThe `cos` function implementation provided is within `sympy/plotting/intervalmath/lib_interval.py`, focusing on evaluating the cosine for intervals, which seems somewhat tangential to the core issue of simplifying trigonometric expressions. This implementation provides insight into handling numeric and interval inputs using numpy for computations, especially in determining the cosine values over a range of inputs.\n\n**Relation to the bug:** While the specific implementation details of `cos` in `lib_interval.py` are not directly related to the simplification process described in the issue, understanding how `cos` is implemented might offer insights into Sympy's broader handling of trigonometric functions. However, the actual simplification issue likely lies elsewhere, in the logic that determines how and when to apply specific trigonometric identities and transformations.\n\n### 3. `cosh` method context\nThe `cosh` function, like `cos`, is implemented in `sympy/plotting/intervalmath/lib_interval.py` for interval mathematics. It evaluates the hyperbolic cosine given numeric or interval inputs, employing numpy for the underlying calculations. This function highlights handling both symmetric and monotonic intervals for hyperbolic cosine computations.\n\n**Relation to the bug:** Similar to `cos`, the `cosh` implementation here is more focused on interval calculations and not directly tied to the simplification process. The issue might rather stem from a higher-level decision-making process in the simplification workflow that incorrectly opts for hyperbolic functions (`cosh`) over trigonometric functions (`cos`) when complex arguments are involved.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the analysis, the actual bug seems to be related more to the decision-making logic within the simplification process, particularly in how it treats complex arguments in trigonometric functions. A direct examination of simplification rules or mechanisms in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` and possibly deeper into how complex arguments are evaluated in trigonometric simplifications might be necessary.\n\nTo get closer to the bug's root:\n- Investigate the specific part of the code in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` that outlines the simplification process for trigonometric functions.\n- Review any part of the codebase that deals with transformation rules between trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, especially in the context of complex arguments.\n\nWe should consider making the following API call:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"simplify\", \"sympy/simplify/simplify.py\")`: To explore the implementation and logic contained within the main simplification module, potentially uncovering how trigonometric simplifications are handled."

Specifically, when subtracting `I` times an expression (as in the bug report), it should correctly assess whether the transformation is applicable and preserve the numerical equivalence of the expression. The rules for such transformations must also correctly interpret the phase of complex expressions.\n\n  2. **Complex Argument Handling:** The simplification process must include a thorough validation for expressions containing complex numbers, ensuring that the transition between trigonometric functions to hyperbolic functions (and vice versa) does not erroneously assume real arguments where complex arguments are present. This would involve checking the conditions under which such transformations are mathematically valid and implementing additional checks to prevent incorrect simplifications.\n\nIn short, the simplification logic needs to correctly identify and process complex arguments in trigonometric expressions without altering their fundamental identities or numerical results. These adjustments would preserve the existing functionality while correcting the specific issue with trigonometric functions and complex arguments."

Let's focus on the ones most likely related to the trigonometric simplification issue with complex arguments.\n\n### Analysis\n\n#### 1. `simplify` function\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `simplify` function is a catch-all for attempts to simplify an expression, applying various heuristics and transformations to reduce an expression to a simpler form without changing its value. It's designed to work with a broad spectrum of symbolic expressions.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug:** \n  Given it's a general-purpose function, the `simplify` method is the first suspect for where the incorrect trigonometric simplification occurs. The issue arises when simplifying expressions involving `cos` with complex arguments, wrongfully simplifying to `cosh` without adequately handling the imaginary unit (`I`).\n\n- **Intended behavior:** \n  The intended behavior should preserve the mathematical integrity of trigonometric expressions, especially when complex arguments are involved. The correct simplification should understand the transformation rules applicable to complex numbers, ensuring that it does not wrongly apply identities or transforms that are not valid under complex operations. This might involve more nuanced checks or conditions that discern the specific nature of trigonometric functions with complex inputs.\n\n#### 2. Other Identified Functions (`hypersimp`, `nthroot`, `nsimplify`, etc.)\n- **What do these parts of the code do?**\n  Each of these functions performs specific types of simplifications or transformations. For example, `hypersimp` attempts simplification of expressions involving hypergeometric terms, `nthroot` simplifies nth roots, and `nsimplify` tries to express floating point numbers in simpler rational forms (when possible).\n\n- **Relationship to the bug:**\n  While these functions are less likely to be directly responsible for the trigonometric simplification issue with complex arguments, their handling and integration into the overall `simplify` framework could provide insight into how complex expressions are reduced. For instance, the mechanisms they use to decide on simplifications and how they handle complex numbers could shed light on potential areas where the logic for distinguishing between trigonometric and hyperbolic functions needs refinement.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n  For these specific functions, the intended behavior is to accurately recognize and apply their respective simplification rules without overreaching or misapplying transformations. When part of the general `simplify` workflow, they must ensure complex arguments are correctly interpreted and preserved through the simplification process.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe issue lies in how SymPy's simplification logic, particularly within the `simplify` function, handles and transforms trigonometric expressions with complex arguments. The intended correction is to refine this logic so that it respects complex arithmetic rules and only applies transformations like `cos` to `cosh` when mathematically valid. This refinement requires a careful review and possibly the introduction of additional checks or conditions specifically tailored to handling complex arguments in trigonometric functions. This ensures expressions are simplified correctly without altering their numerical equivalence or mathematical identity."
