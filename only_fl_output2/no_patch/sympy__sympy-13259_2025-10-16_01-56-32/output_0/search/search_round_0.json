        "content": "To begin resolving this issue, we need to understand how Sympy simplifies trigonometric functions with complex arguments and how it might misinterpret `cos` to `cosh` during simplification. The problem description involves several specific elements: the `cos`, `cosh`, `simplify`, and possibly `evalf` methods, as well as the handling of complex arguments in trigonometric functions. Let's break down the steps required to collect relevant code context using the search APIs:\n\n1. **Investigate the `simplify` function:** Since the issue arises during the simplification process, it's crucial to examine the `simplify` method to understand how it decides to simplify expressions, especially trigonometric functions with complex arguments.\n\n2. **Examine the trigonometric functions (`cos` and `cosh`):** Understanding the implementation and interaction between `cos` and `cosh` in Sympy will provide insight into how these functions are transformed during simplification.\n\n3. **Look into handling of complex arguments:** Since the issue points out a specific problem with the handling of complex arguments in the context of trigonometric simplification, we might need to explore how complex numbers and their operations are managed in Sympy.\n\nBased on these steps, I'll perform the following API calls to gather the necessary code context:\n\n- `search_method(\"simplify\")`: To get an overview of where and how the `simplify` method is implemented.\n- `search_method(\"cos\")`: To find the implementation or overrides of the `cos` function, which might give clues on how it's treated differently when provided with complex arguments.\n- `search_method(\"cosh\")`: Similarly, to understand the implementation of the `cosh` function and any potential logic that could lead to its incorrect selection during simplification.\n\nThese searches should help us piece together why Sympy is incorrectly simplifying the expression by not handling complex arguments in trigonometric functions correctly."
