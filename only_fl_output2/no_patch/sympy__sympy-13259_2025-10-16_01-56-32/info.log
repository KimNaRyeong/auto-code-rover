385 def simplify(expr, ratio=1.7, measure=count_ops, rational=False):
386     # type: (object, object, object, object) -> object
387     """
388     Simplifies the given expression.
389 
390     Simplification is not a well defined term and the exact strategies
391     this function tries can change in the future versions of SymPy. If
392     your algorithm relies on "simplification" (whatever it is), try to
393     determine what you need exactly  -  is it powsimp()?, radsimp()?,
394     together()?, logcombine()?, or something else? And use this particular
395     function directly, because those are well defined and thus your algorithm
396     will be robust.
397 
398     Nonetheless, especially for interactive use, or when you don't know
399     anything about the structure of the expression, simplify() tries to apply
400     intelligent heuristics to make the input expression "simpler".  For
401     example:
402 
403     >>> from sympy import simplify, cos, sin
404     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
405     >>> a = (x + x**2)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)
406     >>> a
407     (x**2 + x)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)
408     >>> simplify(a)
409     x + 1
410 
411     Note that we could have obtained the same result by using specific
412     simplification functions:
413 
414     >>> from sympy import trigsimp, cancel
415     >>> trigsimp(a)
416     (x**2 + x)/x
417     >>> cancel(_)
418     x + 1
419 
420     In some cases, applying :func:`simplify` may actually result in some more
421     complicated expression. The default ``ratio=1.7`` prevents more extreme
422     cases: if (result length)/(input length) > ratio, then input is returned
423     unmodified.  The ``measure`` parameter lets you specify the function used
424     to determine how complex an expression is.  The function should take a
425     single argument as an expression and return a number such that if
426     expression ``a`` is more complex than expression ``b``, then
427     ``measure(a) > measure(b)``.  The default measure function is
428     :func:`count_ops`, which returns the total number of operations in the
429     expression.
430 
431     For example, if ``ratio=1``, ``simplify`` output can't be longer
432     than input.
433 
434     ::
435 
436         >>> from sympy import sqrt, simplify, count_ops, oo
437         >>> root = 1/(sqrt(2)+3)
438 
439     Since ``simplify(root)`` would result in a slightly longer expression,
440     root is returned unchanged instead::
441 
442        >>> simplify(root, ratio=1) == root
443        True
444 
445     If ``ratio=oo``, simplify will be applied anyway::
446 
447         >>> count_ops(simplify(root, ratio=oo)) > count_ops(root)
448         True
449 
450     Note that the shortest expression is not necessary the simplest, so
451     setting ``ratio`` to 1 may not be a good idea.
452     Heuristically, the default value ``ratio=1.7`` seems like a reasonable
453     choice.
454 
455     You can easily define your own measure function based on what you feel
456     should represent the "size" or "complexity" of the input expression.  Note
457     that some choices, such as ``lambda expr: len(str(expr))`` may appear to be
458     good metrics, but have other problems (in this case, the measure function
459     may slow down simplify too much for very large expressions).  If you don't
460     know what a good metric would be, the default, ``count_ops``, is a good
461     one.
462 
463     For example:
464 
465     >>> from sympy import symbols, log
466     >>> a, b = symbols('a b', positive=True)
467     >>> g = log(a) + log(b) + log(a)*log(1/b)
468     >>> h = simplify(g)
469     >>> h
470     log(a*b**(-log(a) + 1))
471     >>> count_ops(g)
472     8
473     >>> count_ops(h)
474     5
475 
476     So you can see that ``h`` is simpler than ``g`` using the count_ops metric.
477     However, we may not like how ``simplify`` (in this case, using
478     ``logcombine``) has created the ``b**(log(1/a) + 1)`` term.  A simple way
479     to reduce this would be to give more weight to powers as operations in
480     ``count_ops``.  We can do this by using the ``visual=True`` option:
481 
482     >>> print(count_ops(g, visual=True))
483     2*ADD + DIV + 4*LOG + MUL
484     >>> print(count_ops(h, visual=True))
485     2*LOG + MUL + POW + SUB
486 
487     >>> from sympy import Symbol, S
488     >>> def my_measure(expr):
489     ...     POW = Symbol('POW')
490     ...     # Discourage powers by giving POW a weight of 10
491     ...     count = count_ops(expr, visual=True).subs(POW, 10)
492     ...     # Every other operation gets a weight of 1 (the default)
493     ...     count = count.replace(Symbol, type(S.One))
494     ...     return count
495     >>> my_measure(g)
496     8
497     >>> my_measure(h)
498     14
499     >>> 15./8 > 1.7 # 1.7 is the default ratio
500     True
501     >>> simplify(g, measure=my_measure)
502     -log(a)*log(b) + log(a) + log(b)
503 
504     Note that because ``simplify()`` internally tries many different
505     simplification strategies and then compares them using the measure
506     function, we get a completely different result that is still different
507     from the input expression by doing this.
508 
509     If rational=True, Floats will be recast as Rationals before simplification.
510     If rational=None, Floats will be recast as Rationals but the result will
511     be recast as Floats. If rational=False(default) then nothing will be done
512     to the Floats.

446 
447         >>> count_ops(simplify(root, ratio=oo)) > count_ops(root)
448         True
449 
450     Note that the shortest expression is not necessary the simplest, so
451     setting ``ratio`` to 1 may not be a good idea.
452     Heuristically, the default value ``ratio=1.7`` seems like a reasonable
453     choice.
454 
455     You can easily define your own measure function based on what you feel
456     should represent the "size" or "complexity" of the input expression.  Note
457     that some choices, such as ``lambda expr: len(str(expr))`` may appear to be
458     good metrics, but have other problems (in this case, the measure function
459     may slow down simplify too much for very large expressions).  If you don't
460     know what a good metric would be, the default, ``count_ops``, is a good
461     one.
462 
463     For example:
464 
465     >>> from sympy import symbols, log
466     >>> a, b = symbols('a b', positive=True)
467     >>> g = log(a) + log(b) + log(a)*log(1/b)
468     >>> h = simplify(g)
469     >>> h
470     log(a*b**(-log(a) + 1))
471     >>> count_ops(g)
472     8
473     >>> count_ops(h)
474     5
475 
476     So you can see that ``h`` is simpler than ``g`` using the count_ops metric.
477     However, we may not like how ``simplify`` (in this case, using
478     ``logcombine``) has created the ``b**(log(1/a) + 1)`` term.  A simple way
479     to reduce this would be to give more weight to powers as operations in
480     ``count_ops``.  We can do this by using the ``visual=True`` option:
481 
482     >>> print(count_ops(g, visual=True))
483     2*ADD + DIV + 4*LOG + MUL
484     >>> print(count_ops(h, visual=True))
485     2*LOG + MUL + POW + SUB
486 
487     >>> from sympy import Symbol, S
488     >>> def my_measure(expr):
489     ...     POW = Symbol('POW')
490     ...     # Discourage powers by giving POW a weight of 10
491     ...     count = count_ops(expr, visual=True).subs(POW, 10)
492     ...     # Every other operation gets a weight of 1 (the default)
493     ...     count = count.replace(Symbol, type(S.One))
494     ...     return count
495     >>> my_measure(g)
496     8
497     >>> my_measure(h)
498     14
499     >>> 15./8 > 1.7 # 1.7 is the default ratio
500     True
501     >>> simplify(g, measure=my_measure)
502     -log(a)*log(b) + log(a) + log(b)
503 
504     Note that because ``simplify()`` internally tries many different
505     simplification strategies and then compares them using the measure
506     function, we get a completely different result that is still different
507     from the input expression by doing this.
508 
509     If rational=True, Floats will be recast as Rationals before simplification.
510     If rational=None, Floats will be recast as Rationals but the result will
511     be recast as Floats. If rational=False(default) then nothing will be done
512     to the Floats.

</code><intended_behavior>The simplify method needs to include additional logic or improve existing conditions to correctly handle simplification of trigonometric expressions with complex arguments. This specifically involves ensuring that transformations between trigonometric and hyperbolic functions respect the properties of complex numbers. For instance, it should verify the mathematical validity of such transformations with complex arguments and preserve the numerical equivalence of the expression before and after simplification. The method should ideally distinguish between cases where transformations like cos to cosh (and vice versa) are mathematically sound and those where they would lead to incorrect simplifications due to the presence of complex numbers. The enhancement should aim at maintaining the general functionality of simplify, improving its accuracy and reliability for expressions involving complex trigonometric functions.</intended_behavior>]
