Based on your instructions and to ensure the script behaves as expectedâ€”raising an `AssertionError` when the issue is present and exiting with code 0 when the issue is fixed, here's a corrected version for `reproducer.py`. This version uses the `print_stacktrace` function as provided and aims to encounter an `AssertionError` if the `dtype` changes due to the `stack` operation in xarray, indicating the presence of the issue. 

```python
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    ds = xr.Dataset(coords={'a': np.array([0], dtype='i4')})
    # Intending to check if dtype stays the same after stacking, knowing the issue
    expected_dtype = np.dtype('i4')
    stacked_dtype = ds.stack(b=('a',))['a'].values.dtype

    try:
        assert stacked_dtype == expected_dtype, f"Expected dtype {expected_dtype}, but got {stacked_dtype}"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Exit with code 1 to indicate that the issue is present
        exit(1)

    # If no assertion error, the dtype did not change unexpectedly
    print("Issue not reproduced: dtype remains consistent after stack operation.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script explicitly checks if the dtype of the stacked coordinate `'a'` remains as `'i4'`, as expected. If the dtype changes (i.e., to `'i8'`), the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace as per your requirements. If the dtype remains unchanged, the script acknowledges that the issue is not reproduced and exits cleanly with code 0.
