Specifically, if the original dataset contains coordinates with a data type of 'i4', the method should avoid automatically casting these to 'i8' unless explicitly required by the operation being performed. This can be achieved by carefully checking the dtype of coordinates before the stack operation and explicitly setting or preserving the dtype during any intermediate steps that might lead to an unintended type conversion. Preserving the original data type is crucial to maintain user expectations and the integrity of the dataset's numerical precision."

        "intended_behavior": "Similarly, the `stack` method within the `dataarray.py` should be designed to preserve the data type ('dtype') of the coordinates after the stack operation. This means ensuring that any operation within this method that could potentially lead to an automatic dtype conversion, specifically from 'i4' to 'i8', is handled in a way that maintains the original dtype specified by the user or the source data array. If dtype conversions are necessary, they should be explicitly justified and documented, with checks in place to prevent unintended conversions that might affect the data's fidelity."
