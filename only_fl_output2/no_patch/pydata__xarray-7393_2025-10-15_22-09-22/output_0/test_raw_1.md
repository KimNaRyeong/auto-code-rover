The previous response mistakenly indicated a scenario where the issue could not be reproduced, and the output suggested a successful outcome without issue. If the requirement is to ensure the script reflects a true fail state for the described issue (where the test should indeed fail due to the dtype mismatch caused by `stack` operation changing dtype from int32 (`'i4'`) to int64 (`'i8'`)), please find below the revised script. This revised version ensures clarity in the purpose of the test and corrects the expectation to generate a fail state accurately under the condition that the issue is present.

```python
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    ds = xr.Dataset(coords={'a': np.array([0], dtype='i4')})
    try:
        # Check if the data types are the same. Expecting a mismatch to raise an exception.
        result = ds['a'].values.dtype == ds.stack(b=('a',))['a'].values.dtype
        assert result, f"Expected dtype 'i4', got '{ds.stack(b=('a',))['a'].values.dtype}' after stack"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Exit with code 1 to indicate the issue is reproduced (i.e., there was an error)
        exit(1)
    # If no exception is raised, it means the issue was not reproduced, hence the test didn't find the problem.
    print("Issue not reproduced: Data type did not change after stack as expected, which contradicts the initial problem statement.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version clarifies the expectation for reproduction: it is designed to fail if the issue as described (dtype change after stack) is observed, aligning with the original problem statement where such a dtype change is not expected. The exiting code `1` signifies the reproduction of the issue, and `0` would indicate the absence (fix) of the issue, which should be the expected behavior in a correct implementation.
