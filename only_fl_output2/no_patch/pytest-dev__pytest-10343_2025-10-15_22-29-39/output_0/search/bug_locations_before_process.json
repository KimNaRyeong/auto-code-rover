        "intended_behavior": "Modify the mechanism that generates `HOOK_LEGACY_MARKING` warning messages to include the source location (file path and, if feasible, the plugin name) where the deprecated hook implementation is located. This involves enhancing the warning generation logic to dynamically capture and append the location metadata to the warning message. The existing functionality of warning generation should be preserved, with the addition of helping developers pinpoint the location of deprecated usage more efficiently."
