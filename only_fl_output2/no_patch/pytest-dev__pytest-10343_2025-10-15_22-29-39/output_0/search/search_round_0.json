Search for occurrences of the deprecated configuration in the entire codebase to understand how the warning is generated:\n   - `search_code(\"old-style configuration options\")`\n\n2. Since the warning mentions the use of `pytest_configure` with old-style hooks, let's look for its definition to identify where it's being handled:\n   - `search_method(\"pytest_configure\")`\n\nThese searches aim to find the relevant parts of the code responsible for generating the deprecation warning and to understand how `pytest_configure` hooks are registered and processed. This should give us an initial direction for where to introduce improvements to include location information in the warning message."
