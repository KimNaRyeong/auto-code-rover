        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the two API calls, we have two major points of interest:\n\n1. **Occurrences of the Deprecated Configuration Warning in the Codebase:**\n   - The snippet from `src/_pytest/deprecated.py` defines a warning for old-style hook implementations. The warning text clearly outlines that the current usage is deprecated and suggests adopting the new decorator format for configuring hooks. This part of the code is directly responsible for generating the warning mentioned in the issue. However, it lacks details on the exact location (i.e., file or plugin name) where this deprecated usage exists.\n   \n   **Analysis:**\n   - **What does this part of the code do?** It generates a deprecation warning for hooks that use old-style configuration options.\n   - **Relationship to the bug:** This is the exact point where the enhancement needs to be made to include location information within the deprecation warning, as the current message lacks this.\n   - **Intended behavior:** Ideally, this warning should be augmented to include the originating file name, and if possible, the plugin name where the deprecated usage is found, making it easier for developers to locate and update the deprecated code.\n\n2. **Occurrences of the `pytest_configure` Method in the Codebase:**\n   - The `pytest_configure` methods are found in various files within the `src` and `testing` directories, indicating that this hook is widely used across the pytest codebase itself and potentially in external plugins.\n   \n   **Analysis:**\n   - **What does this part of the code do?** These are implementations of the `pytest_configure` hook in different parts of pytest and possibly in plugins, indicating how and where pytest's configuration can be extended or altered.\n   - **Relationship to the bug:** Any of these occurrences might be using old-style configuration options, and identifying which one exactly (especially in external plugins) is causing the warning is the current challenge.\n   - **Intended behavior:** Each usage of `pytest_configure` that follows the deprecated style should be easily identifiable by developers through enhanced warning messages that include precise location information.\n   \n**Next Steps Based on Analysis:**\nTo resolve the issue, an enhancement in the generation of the deprecation warning (as defined in `src/_pytest/deprecated.py`) is required. This enhancement includes:\n- Capturing and appending location information (file and potentially plugin name) to the warning message.\n- Ensuring that when `pytest_configure` or any hook implementation triggers this warning, the system can dynamically include this location information in the warning output.\n\nTo proceed with crafting a solution, further investigation into how warnings are generated and how location information can be programmatically captured and included in the warning message at runtime would be necessary. Additionally, exploring the mechanisms by which pytest tracks and manages the plugins or files defining these hooks could provide insights into accurately pinpointing the source of deprecated usage."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

This involves enhancing the warning generation logic to dynamically capture and append the location metadata to the warning message. The existing functionality of warning generation should be preserved, with the addition of helping developers pinpoint the location of deprecated usage more efficiently.\n\nThis enhancement aims to make debugging and updating deprecated code significantly more manageable for developers, especially in environments with many plugins or large codebases, by providing precise locations of deprecated configurations directly in the warning message."
