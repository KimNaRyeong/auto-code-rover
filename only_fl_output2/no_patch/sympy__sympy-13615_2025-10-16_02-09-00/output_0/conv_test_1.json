It will raise an `AssertionError` if the `Complement` operation does not work as expected when the input is a mixture of Symbols and numbers. Note that it utilizes the `print_stacktrace` function to clearly show the stack trace upon encountering an error:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import FiniteSet, Interval, Symbol, Complement\nimport sys\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\nx = Symbol('x')\ny = Symbol('y')\n\na = FiniteSet(x, y, 2)\nb = Interval(-10, 10)\n\ntry:\n    result = Complement(a, b)\n    # Check if result includes all elements from `a` except those in `b` correctly\n    assert result == FiniteSet(x, y), \"Complement does not correctly exclude numeric interval from mixed set\"\nexcept AssertionError as e:\n    print_stacktrace(e)\n    raise\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print_stacktrace(e)\n    sys.exit(1)  # To indicate an unexpected error occurred\n\nprint(\"Success: The issue is fixed.\")\nsys.exit(0)\n```\n\nThis script checks if the `Complement` operation between a finite set containing symbols and numbers and an interval behaves as expected. If the assertion fails (which means the complement does not behave correctly), it will print a stack trace indicating where the error occurred in the script. If the issue is fixed, it prints \"Success: The issue is fixed.\" and exits with code 0."
