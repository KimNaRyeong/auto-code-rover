        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the `FiniteSet` and `Interval` classes in `sympy/sets/sets.py`, it's clear that both classes are part of SymPy's sets module, which is a part of the symbolic mathematics library. The classes represent mathematical sets, with `FiniteSet` representing a set of discrete elements and `Interval` representing a range of numbers (possibly infinite on one or both ends).\n\n### Analyzing `FiniteSet` and `Interval`\n- Both classes inherit from `Set` and include methods for set operations like intersection (`_intersect`), union (`_union`), complement (`_complement`), and containment (`_contains`).\n- The issue mentions that the `Complement` operation does not work as expected when the input is a mixture of symbols and numbers. Given the methods found in both classes, it's reasonable to assume the bug could be within the implementation of `_complement`, as this would be called during a Complement operation.\n\n### Intended Behavior\n- The intended behavior, when performing a complement operation between a `FiniteSet` that includes symbols (e.g., `x`, `y`) and a numerical `Interval`, should still recognize and represent the set of symbols as being distinct from the numeric interval. Thus, when subtracting an interval from a set containing symbols, the symbols should remain unaffected since they do not fall within the numeric range of the interval. According to the issue, the expected output for the complement of `{x, y}` with `[-10, 10]` should yield `{x, y} \\[-10, 10]`, which explicitly maintains the symbols outside the numeric interval.\n\n### Next Steps for Resolution\nGiven this analysis, it seems the handling within the `_complement` method of either `FiniteSet` or `Interval` (or how these methods interact) does not properly account for symbols during complement operations. Since the `Complement` method couldn't be found directly, it's likely implemented through these `_complement` methods.\n\nTo further understand the issue and seek a resolution, I would:\n1. Examine the implementation of `_complement` in both `FiniteSet` and `Interval` classes to see how these types interact with each other during a complement operation.\n2. It's also worth checking if complement operations are centrally managed by another part of the SymPy sets module which might delegate to these `_complement` methods.\n\nGiven this, my next API calls should be:\n- search_method_in_file(\"_complement\", \"sympy/sets/sets.py\")\n- search_code_in_file(\"def Complement(\", \"sympy/sets/sets.py\") // This attempts to find a possible centralized complement function if the direct method search failed due to naming conventions or indirect implementation."

        "content": "Analyzing the results of the `_complement` methods in the `sympy/sets/sets.py` file reveals multiple implementations tailored to different set types within SymPy, such as `FiniteSet`, `Interval`, `Union`, etc. Each of these implementations is designed to handle complement operations specific to the set type it is implemented in, following set theory principles.\n\n### Analysis of `_complement` Methods\n\n1. **General Behavior:** \n   - The `_complement` methods define how to determine the complement of one set with respect to another. The general idea is to compute what elements are in the \"other\" set but not in \"this\" set.\n\n2. **Relationship with the Bug:**\n   - The described bug specifically involves performing a complement operation where the sets involved include both symbolic elements (like `x`, `y`) and numeric intervals. This type of operation likely involves processing across multiple `_complement` implementations (e.g., within `FiniteSet` dealing with symbolic elements and `Interval` dealing with numeric ranges).\n\n3. **Intended Behavior:**\n   - The intended correct behavior, given the issue description, would be that when a `Complement` operation is performed between a mixed set of symbols and numbers against a numerical interval, the output should clearly reflect the exclusion of the interval for numeric elements while retaining symbolic elements unaffected. That is, symbolic elements should not be eliminated or altered by numeric interval operations, preserving the distinction between symbolic and numerical content within sets.\n\n### Identifying the Bug and Fix Strategy\n\nGiven the outputs, the bug lies likely in how either `FiniteSet` or `Interval` processes the complement operation when an \"other\" set involves a mixture of symbols and numbers. The operation handling might be oversimplifying the operation or neglecting the symbolic elements' unique handling.\n\n- **Search Result 6 (`FiniteSet`'s `_complement` with an `Interval`):** This implementation hints at some differentiation between numerical and symbolic elements (`nums` and `syms`). However, it might not fully ensure the exclusion process respects symbolic elements' intended retention.\n\n- **Search Result 2 (`Interval`'s `_complement`):** This code snippet is focused on intervals and their interaction with `FiniteSet`s and numerics but does not directly address mixed sets containing symbols.\n\n### Specific Intended Behavior Adjustments:\n\n- Ensure `_complement` methods that process intersections between `FiniteSet`s containing symbols and `Interval`s (or any numeric set representations) preserve symbols distinctly. This may involve adjusting how symbols are treated in the logic that merges or excludes elements based on numeric boundaries.\n\n- An explicit check or handling within `FiniteSet`'s or `Interval`'s `_complement` method could be added or refined to guarantee symbolic elements are correctly managed during complement operations against numeric intervals.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA potential fix requires tweaking the logic in either the `FiniteSet`'s or `Interval`'s `_complement` method (or possibly both) to ensure symbolic elements are preserved as expected when numeric intervals are involved. The adjustment should maintain current functionality for pure numeric or symbolic operations while fixing the highlighted issue.\n\nGiven this analysis, to move towards resolving the bug, one would review and adjust the logic within these `_complement` methods in `sympy/sets/sets.py`, specifically focusing on how they interact when a set contains a mix of numeric and symbolic elements."

This may involve refining the logic to explicitly check for and exclude symbolic elements from numeric operations, ensuring symbols are retained in the output set as expected. The behavior should preserve existing functionality for sets that don't include a mixture of symbols and numeric intervals.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:** \n  - **File:** `sympy/sets/sets.py`\n  - **Class:** `Interval`\n  - **Method:** `_complement`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The `_complement` method in the `Interval` class should correctly handle cases where an `Interval` is being complemented with a `FiniteSet` that contains symbols. It should ensure that its treatment of the complement operation does not inadvertently affect symbolic elements. This might require adding logic to specifically handle or bypass symbolic elements, ensuring that the output of the operation preserves the distinct nature of symbolic elements when complemented with numeric intervals."
