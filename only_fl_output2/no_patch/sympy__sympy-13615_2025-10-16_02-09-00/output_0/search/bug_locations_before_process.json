        "intended_behavior": "Within the `_complement` method for the `FiniteSet` class, the method should ensure that when computing the complement of a `FiniteSet` including symbols against an `Interval`, it retains symbols unaffected by the numeric intervals. This may involve refining the logic to explicitly check for and exclude symbolic elements from numeric operations, ensuring symbols are retained in the output set as expected. The behavior should preserve existing functionality for sets that don't include a mixture of symbols and numeric intervals."

        "method": "_complement",
        "intended_behavior": "The `_complement` method in the `Interval` class should correctly handle cases where an `Interval` is being complemented with a `FiniteSet` that contains symbols. It should ensure that its treatment of the complement operation does not inadvertently affect symbolic elements. This might require adding logic to specifically handle or bypass symbolic elements, ensuring that the output of the operation preserves the distinct nature of symbolic elements when complemented with numeric intervals."
