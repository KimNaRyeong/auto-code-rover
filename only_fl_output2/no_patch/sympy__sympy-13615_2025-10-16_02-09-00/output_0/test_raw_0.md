Below is the standalone python file named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue you've described. It will raise an `AssertionError` if the `Complement` operation does not work as expected when the input is a mixture of Symbols and numbers. Note that it utilizes the `print_stacktrace` function to clearly show the stack trace upon encountering an error:

```python
from sympy import FiniteSet, Interval, Symbol, Complement
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

x = Symbol('x')
y = Symbol('y')

a = FiniteSet(x, y, 2)
b = Interval(-10, 10)

try:
    result = Complement(a, b)
    # Check if result includes all elements from `a` except those in `b` correctly
    assert result == FiniteSet(x, y), "Complement does not correctly exclude numeric interval from mixed set"
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # To indicate an unexpected error occurred

print("Success: The issue is fixed.")
sys.exit(0)
```

This script checks if the `Complement` operation between a finite set containing symbols and numbers and an interval behaves as expected. If the assertion fails (which means the complement does not behave correctly), it will print a stack trace indicating where the error occurred in the script. If the issue is fixed, it prints "Success: The issue is fixed." and exits with code 0.
