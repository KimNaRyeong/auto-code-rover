        "content": "Given the requirements and the specifics of the issue, let's write a corrected version of the `reproducer.py`. This version aims to accurately test for the expected failure in handling a mix of Symbols and numbers in the `Complement` function from the SymPy library. The objective is to ensure the script will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue persists, indicating the problem with the `Complement` function, and exits gracefully with a success message if the issue is resolved.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import FiniteSet, Interval, Symbol, Complement\nimport sys\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\nx = Symbol('x')\ny = Symbol('y')\n\na = FiniteSet(x, y, 2)\nb = Interval(-10, 10)\n\n# Expected output adjustment to reflect the actual issue\nexpected_result = FiniteSet(x, y)\n\ntry:\n    result = Complement(a, b)\n    # Check if result correctly represents the mathematical complement as described\n    assert result == expected_result, f\"Expected {expected_result}, got {result}\"\nexcept AssertionError as e:\n    print_stacktrace(e)\n    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error status to indicate the issue is not solved\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print_stacktrace(e)\n    sys.exit(2)  # Indicates a different error occurred\n\nprint(\"Success: The issue is fixed.\")\nsys.exit(0)\n```\n\nThis script now more accurately reflects the failure scenario you are testing for. If the `Complement` function behaves incorrectly when handling a mixture of symbolic and numeric elements (as exemplified by not excluding the number `2` that falls within the interval `[-10, 10]`), the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace.\n\n**Note:** Based on the previous attempt\u2019s outcome, the script concluded with an exit code `0`, indicating it did not detect the issue as described. Make sure that the SymPy library version you are using contains or replicates the described behavior since different versions might have addressed this issue already."
