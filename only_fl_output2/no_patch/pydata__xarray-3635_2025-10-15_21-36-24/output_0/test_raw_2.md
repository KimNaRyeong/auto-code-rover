Below is a revised standalone python file named `reproducer.py` that aims to faithfully reproduce the issue if it's present, and properly manage the exception handling and output based on the script's execution results. This takes into account the specific error message related to the `quantile` method usage with `xarray` and attempts to catch, assert, and print the stack trace for the incorrect exception message as per your instruction.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    import xarray as xr
    da = xr.DataArray([0, 1, 2])
    try:
        da.quantile(q=50)  # This should lead to the precise error outlined in your report.
    except ValueError as err:
        error_message = "Percentiles must be in the range [0, 100]"
        expected_message = "Quantiles must be in the range [0, 1]"
        # Check if the error message is incorrect
        if str(err) == error_message:
            print_stacktrace(err)
            assert str(err) == expected_message, f"Incorrect error message: {error_message}"
        else:
            print("The error message is not as expected, indicating a potential fix or change.")
            exit(0)
    except Exception as other_err:
        print_stacktrace(other_err)
        assert False, "An unexpected exception occurred."
    else:
        print("No exception was raised. Quantile value might have been accepted correctly.")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

This script checks for the specific `ValueError` associated with the `quantile` method call with a `q` value of `50`, which is outside the accepted range specified in the documentation for xarray. The expected behavior, based on your description, is for a `ValueError` to be raised with a message indicating that quantiles must be within the range [0, 1], as opposed to an indication of percentiles being in the range [0, 100], which is a numpy convention.

Run this script via:
```
python3 reproducer.py
```
It is designed to assert the presence of the issue based on the raised error message and exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed or if an error message different than expected is encountered, suggesting a potential fix or change in the error handling by `xarray`.
