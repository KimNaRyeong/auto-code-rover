        "content": "To address the issue effectively, it is essential to gather more context on the `BaseConstraint` class, especially focusing on the `deconstruct()` method and the `__eq__` operator method. Additionally, understanding the attribute `violation_error_message` and its usage within these methods will be crucial. Based on this requirement, the following API calls should provide the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"BaseConstraint\")`: This will help locate the file or files where the `BaseConstraint` class is defined.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"deconstruct\", \"BaseConstraint\")`: To get the implementation details of the `deconstruct` method within the `BaseConstraint` class.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__eq__\", \"BaseConstraint\")`: To investigate how the equality operator is implemented for the `BaseConstraint` class.\n4. `search_code(\"violation_error_message\")`: To understand how and where the `violation_error_message` attribute is used throughout the project, especially in relation to the `BaseConstraint` class."
