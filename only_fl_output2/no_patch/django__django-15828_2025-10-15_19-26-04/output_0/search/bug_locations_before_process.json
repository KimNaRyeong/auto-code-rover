This change ensures that any custom error messages assigned to a constraint are serialized alongside other attributes. This is crucial for accurately detecting changes to constraints in Django migrations. The method should return violation_error_message when it's set to a value other than the default. The adjustment should preserve the existing functionality, only adding the logic to include violation_error_message when relevant."

        "intended_behavior": "Implement an __eq__ method within the BaseConstraint class that compares objects not just by their name, but also by their violation_error_message if it has been set. This method should ensure that two constraints are considered equal if and only if both their name and violation_error_message (along with any other relevant attributes) are identical. This facilitates accurate comparison of constraint objects, especially in contexts where the uniqueness of a constraint can affect application behavior or database schema management."
