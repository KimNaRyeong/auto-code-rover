        "intended_behavior": "The `fit` method should preserve the `dtype` specification when it invokes `fit_transform` on the raw document data and applies the tf-idf transformation. The tf-idf transformation logic (`self._tfidf.fit(X)`) needs to explicitly ensure that the output matrix matches the `dtype` specified by the user at initialization. If this requires modifications to `_tfidf.fit` or how it's invoked to accommodate `dtype`, such enhancements should be made while maintaining existing functionality for users not specifying `dtype`."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to the `fit` method, `fit_transform` must also respect the user's `dtype` specification throughout the process. Given that `fit_transform` is often more efficient than separate `fit` and `transform` calls, it's crucial that the conversion from count matrix to tf-idf matrix within this method adheres to the requested `dtype`. Adjustments may need to ensure that `self._tfidf.transform(X, copy=False)` honors the `dtype` choice without defaulting to `np.float64`."
