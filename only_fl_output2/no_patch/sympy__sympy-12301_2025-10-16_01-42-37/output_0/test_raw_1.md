To correct the approach and ensure the program exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed or properly handles an `AssertionError`, see the modified `reproducer.py` below. This script directly targets the failing test's underlying cause by replicating the testing scenario instead of running the entire test suite, which can be time-consuming and may not effectively isolate and reproduce the specific issue. 

This version attempts to mimic the specific test from `test_cse.py` that causes the failure, reflecting a direct approach to triggering the problematic behavior.

```python
# reproducer.py
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_specific_test():
    from sympy.simplify.tests.test_cse import test_issue_11230
    try:
        test_issue_11230()
        print("Test passed.")
        return 0  # Exiting with code 0 indicating the test passed/success
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return 1  # Optionally, return a non-zero exit code to indicate failure
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return -1  # Indicates an unexpected error occurred

if __name__ == "__main__":
    os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = '736538842'
    import sys
    sys.exit(run_specific_test())
```

This script focuses on the specific function `test_issue_11230` from the `test_cse.py` file, expected to reproduce the `AssertionError` mentioned. This allows the reproduction attempt to be both focused and efficient, directly addressing the issue at hand. The use of `sys.exit` with the response from `run_specific_test` ensures that the script exits with the appropriate code based on the outcome of the test, meeting the criteria provided in the task description.
