Given the new requirements and understanding that the previous test did not reproduce the issue, I will adjust the approach accordingly. This time, the `reproducer.py` will directly invoke the condition specified in the test from `test_cse.py` that failed in the Travis environment, instead of calling the test function itself. This direct approach aims to reproduce the `AssertionError` under the conditions described.

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    from sympy import symbols, cos, cse
    x = symbols('x')
    expr = (x + cos(x) + 1, x**2 + cos(x)**2 + 1)
    replacements, reduced_exprs = cse(expr)
    assert not any(i.is_Mul for a in replacements for i in a[1].args), "Test issue reproduced: AssertionError"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = '736538842'
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
        print("Issue not present or test passed.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit code 0 for success or when the issue is fixed
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Maintains the process exit code to signal failure for CI/CD tools
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(-1)  # A different non-zero exit code for unexpected errors
```

This script directly assesses the condition from the test case mentioned in the initial problem statement. It replicates the setup and the assertion that led to the failure. 

When executed, this script will:

- Attempt to exactly reproduce the failing assertion from the test case.
- Print a detailed stack trace if the `AssertionError` is caught, aiding in diagnosing the problem.
- Exit with code 0 if the issue is not present or the test passes, signaling that the issue has been fixed or cannot be reproduced under the provided setup.
- Exit with code 1 when the `AssertionError` is encountered, directly indicating test failure.
- Handle unexpected errors gracefully, printing a stack trace and existing with a distinct error code (-1) to differentiate from the expected `AssertionError`.

This approach focuses the reproduction attempt on the specific failure mode observed in the original issue report, providing a clear path to diagnosing and eventually fixing the problem.
