Let's search for the file by just its name without assuming its path.\n   - `search_code(\"test_issue_11230\")`: This broad search will help us locate any references to the specific test case in the codebase which might give clues about its location or related functionalities.\n\n2. **To understand `is_Mul` usage or definition**: Given no direct method was found, `is_Mul` could be an attribute or a part of the class system dealing with expressions in sympy.\n   - `search_code(\"is_Mul\")`: This search aims to find any usage or definition that references `is_Mul`, providing insight into how it's implemented or used within the context of sympy expressions.\n\nThese searches should provide us with a significantly better understanding of the test's context and the functionalities involved in the issue."

This includes checking for any updates on how tests are structured or methods are named.\n3. **Community Resources**: Checking community forums, issue trackers, or mailing lists for mentions of the test or property/method in question. Sometimes, insights from recent discussions could shed light on structural changes or bug fixes related to the problem at hand.\n\nTo proceed effectively, access to more versatile search capabilities, direct consultation of the project's resources, or a broader scope of interaction to execute these exploratory steps would be required.
