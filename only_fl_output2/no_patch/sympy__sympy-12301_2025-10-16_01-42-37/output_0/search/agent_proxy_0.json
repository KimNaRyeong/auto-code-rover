Specifically, we want to inspect the `test_issue_11230` method within the `test_cse.py` file and understand the assertion that's failing. We would also benefit from understanding more about the `is_Mul` property or method being used in the assertion.\n\nLet's perform the following API calls:\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"test_issue_11230\", \"sympy/simplify/tests/test_cse.py\")`: This will help us find the definition of the failing test and see if there are any specific conditions or setup that could be leading to the failure.\n2. `search_method(\"is_Mul\")`: Since the assertion involves checking if any item `is_Mul`, understanding where and how `is_Mul` is defined and what it's supposed to do will be crucial in diagnosing the issue properly."
