This script directly targets the failing test's underlying cause by replicating the testing scenario instead of running the entire test suite, which can be time-consuming and may not effectively isolate and reproduce the specific issue. \n\nThis version attempts to mimic the specific test from `test_cse.py` that causes the failure, reflecting a direct approach to triggering the problematic behavior.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\nimport os\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef run_specific_test():\n    from sympy.simplify.tests.test_cse import test_issue_11230\n    try:\n        test_issue_11230()\n        print(\"Test passed.\")\n        return 0  # Exiting with code 0 indicating the test passed/success\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        return 1  # Optionally, return a non-zero exit code to indicate failure\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        return -1  # Indicates an unexpected error occurred\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = '736538842'\n    import sys\n    sys.exit(run_specific_test())\n```\n\nThis script focuses on the specific function `test_issue_11230` from the `test_cse.py` file, expected to reproduce the `AssertionError` mentioned. This allows the reproduction attempt to be both focused and efficient, directly addressing the issue at hand. The use of `sys.exit` with the response from `run_specific_test` ensures that the script exits with the appropriate code based on the outcome of the test, meeting the criteria provided in the task description."
