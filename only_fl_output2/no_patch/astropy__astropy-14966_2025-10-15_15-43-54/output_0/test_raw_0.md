Below is the `reproducer.py` file that you requested. It reproduces the issue described and behaves as specified, raising an `AssertionError` if the issue is present and printing a stack trace of the issue. It will exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed.

```Python
from astropy.table import QTable
import astropy.units as u

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_quantity_in_group_keys():
    tbl = QTable({"length": [1., 1., 2., 3., 1., 2.,]*u.m})
    gtbl = tbl.group_by('length')
    for cols in gtbl.groups.keys:
        print(cols)
        # Convert cols to dict for easy assertion
        cols_dict = dict(cols)
        # Extract the key to access the potentially problematic value
        for key, value in cols_dict.items():
            # The issue: values should be quantities (with units), not just floats
            column = tbl[key]
            original_unit = column.unit
            try:
                # Assert that the value is an astropy quantity and it has the correct unit
                assert hasattr(value, 'unit') and value.unit == original_unit, "Value does not include unit"
            except AssertionError as e:
                print_stacktrace(e)
                # If assertion fails, raise to exit with non-zero status code
                raise
            else:
                # If all checks pass, print success message
                print(f"All group keys for column '{key}' include correct units.")
    
try:
    test_quantity_in_group_keys()
except AssertionError:
    exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate error
else:
    exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate success
```

This script checks that the keys after grouping by a quantity contain the units and are not just float values. If the condition is not met, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints a stack trace. If the condition is met, it will simply indicate success for each key checked and exit with code 0.
