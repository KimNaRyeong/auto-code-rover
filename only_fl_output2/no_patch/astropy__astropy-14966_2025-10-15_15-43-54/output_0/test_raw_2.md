Understanding the instructions clearly, it's important to write a script that directly reproduces the described issue about group keys lacking units in an `astropy.table.QTable`. Let's rewrite `reproducer.py` to specifically check for unit presence in grouped table keys, and use the provided function to ensure that any AssertionError provides clear feedback.

```python
from astropy.table import QTable
import astropy.units as u

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    tbl = QTable({"length": [1., 1., 2., 3., 1., 2.] * u.m})
    gtbl = tbl.group_by('length')
    
    failed = False
    for cols in gtbl.groups.keys:
        try:
            # The printed value should be a Quantity, not just a float.
            # Checking if the unit is correctly attached to the keys.
            assert hasattr(cols['length'], 'unit'), "Unit is missing from the group key."
            print(f"Group key has correct unit: {cols['length'].unit}")
        except AssertionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            failed = True
            
    if not failed:
        print("All group keys have units. Exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)
    else:
        print("Some group keys are missing units. Exiting with code 1.")
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script attempts to group an `astropy.table.QTable` by a column containing quantities and then checks whether the keys of the grouped table retain their units. It utilizes the `print_stacktrace` function to clearly display where the exception occurred if any group key lacks its unit, fulfilling both the error reporting and debugging needs. Moreover, the script manages the exit codes according to the result of the unit presence check, making it straightforward to use in automated testing environments.
