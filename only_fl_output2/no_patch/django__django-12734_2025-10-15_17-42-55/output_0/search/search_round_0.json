        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context around the models and migration process within the project, specifically related to `ManyToMany` fields and how field changes are propagated to related tables. The following API calls will help us gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the `Vulnerability` model to see if there are other relevant changes or dependencies not mentioned in the issue description:\n   - `search_class(\"Vulnerability\")`\n\n2. Search for the `AppVersion` model since it's related to `Vulnerability` through a `ManyToManyField`. We need to understand its structure and any custom behaviors that might affect migration:\n   - `search_class(\"AppVersion\")`\n\n3. Look for migration files or methods to see how changes in models are detected and handled, specifically focusing on field changes like `max_length` in the `ManyToMany` context. This involves searching for the use of `AlterField` and potentially related migration operations:\n   - `search_method(\"AlterField\")`\n\n4. Check if there are custom migration methods or signals that might play a role in handling changes in models related through `ManyToManyField`:\n   - `search_code(\"ManyToManyField\")`\n\n5. Given that the issue description mentions a change was made but not reflected in a related table, it would be useful to search for any custom logic around migrations, like signal handlers or overridden save methods that might interfere with automatic migration detection:\n   - `search_method(\"save\")`\n   - `search_code(\"post_save\")`\n   - `search_code(\"pre_save\")`\n\nThese searches should give us a comprehensive overview of how the models are defined, how migrations are handled in the project, and any custom logic that might affect the automatic propagation of field changes through migrations."
