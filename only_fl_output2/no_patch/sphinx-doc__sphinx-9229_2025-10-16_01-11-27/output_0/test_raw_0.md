Certainly! To create a standalone script (`reproducer.py`) that aims to reproduce the reported documentation inconsistency for type aliases, follow the below steps closely. This script will automate the setup of a minimal Sphinx documentation environment, generate documentation for the given Python module (as described in the issue), and finally check if the issue persists. If the problem is detected, the script will raise an `AssertionError`, alongside with the detailed stack trace.

```python
import os
import sys
import shutil
import subprocess
from http.server import HTTPServer, SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
import threading
import urllib.request

def setup_sphinx_environment():
    """Sets up a minimal Sphinx environment with the necessary files."""

    os.makedirs('api', exist_ok=True)

    Callable[[Path, FileContents, ScaffoldOpts], Union[Path, None]]
- **path** (:obj:`pathlib.Path`): file path potentially to be written to/changed
  in the disk.
- **contents** (:obj:`FileContents`): usually a string that represents a text content
  of the file. :obj:`None` indicates the file should not be written.
- **opts** (:obj:`ScaffoldOpts`): a dict with PyScaffold's options.
If the file is written (or more generally changed, such as new access permissions),
by convention they should return the :obj:`file path <pathlib.Path>`.
If no file was touched, :obj:`None` should be returned. Please notice a **FileOp**
might return :obj:`None` if a pre-existing file in the disk is not modified.
.. note::
    A **FileOp** usually has side effects (e.g. write a file to the disk), see
    :obj:`FileFileContents` and :obj:`ScaffoldOpts` for other conventions.

This script executes the necessary steps to recreate the setup where the documentation inconsistency was noted, including generating HTML documentation through Sphinx and serving it over a temporary HTTP server to inspect the contents. Notably, if the issue persists (i.e., specific type alias documentation does not appear as expected), the script identifies this through assertions checking the HTML content and throws an `AssertionError`. Otherwise, it concludes without errors, indicating the absence or resolution of the previously reported problem.
