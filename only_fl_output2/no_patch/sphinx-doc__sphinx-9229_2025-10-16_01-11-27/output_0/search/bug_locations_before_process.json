        "intended_behavior": "Currently, the `setup(app)` function connects to the `autodoc-process-docstring` event, which could potentially alter docstrings in a way that affects how type aliases are documented, leading to the observed inconsistency. The intended behavior here should ensure that the processing of docstrings for type aliases is either excluded from any such modifications or specifically handled to ensure their correct documentation rendering. A careful review and possibly an update to this custom Sphinx setup logic could resolve the issue, ensuring that type aliases have their docstrings rendered accurately in the Sphinx-generated documentation. This could involve adding conditional logic within the `setup(app)` function to check for type aliases and ensuring their docstrings are processed without omission or alteration, or adjusting the `cut_lines` configuration to not affect type aliases."
