Creating a standalone Python script that sets up an environment to reproduce the issue described involves several steps. We need to:

1. Dynamically generate Python code that showcases the problematic behavior.
2. Setup Sphinx in a temporary environment.
3. Invoke Sphinx to generate documentation.
4. Verify the generated documentation for the presence or absence of expected content.
5. Clean up the environment post-verification.

The following `reproducer.py` script attempts to encapsulate these requirements to automatically reproduce the issue with Sphinx documentation of type aliases. When the issue is fixed, the script would exit with code `0`; otherwise, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints a detailed stack trace.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys
import shutil
import tempfile
from contextlib import contextmanager

# Providing a stacktrace printing function based on the provided template
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

This script does the following:
1. Creates a temporary directory to serve as the Sphinx project root, including minimal `conf.py` and `index.rst` files.
2. Injects the provided Python code into a `file.py` within the project.
3. Invokes Sphinx to generate HTML documentation.
4. Reads the generated HTML files to check for the expected docstrings.
5. If docstrings are missing or any operation fails, it prints the stack trace; otherwise, it confirms the issue wasn't reproduced.
6. Cleans up the temporary project directory.

Please ensure you have Sphinx installed (`pip install sphinx`) in your environment before running this script. The provided Python code simulates the possible situation described and is structured for easy adjustment depending on the specifics of the real-world issue encountered.
