Specifically, we need to see if `__len__` is implemented and how the `Pipeline` class is structured to potentially add this method. Given the information, the following API calls would be beneficial:\n\n1. To find out where the `Pipeline` class is defined and examine its current methods:\n   - `search_class(\"Pipeline\")`\n\n2. To check if the `__len__` method is already implemented in the `Pipeline` class somewhere or if there's a conversation around this:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__len__\", \"Pipeline\")`\n\nThese calls will provide the necessary context to understand the structure and current capabilities of the `Pipeline` class, which is crucial for developing a patch to address the issue."
