Based on the requirements and ensuring to address the originally stated issue that `Pipeline` should support `__len__`, here is how you can structure `reproducer.py`:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sklearn import svm
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_regression
    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

    try:
        X, y = make_classification(
            n_informative=5, n_redundant=0, random_state=42)

        anova_filter = SelectKBest(f_regression, k=5)
        clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')
        pipe = Pipeline([('anova', anova_filter), ('svc', clf)])

        # Attempt to use len on pipeline
        pipe_length = len(pipe)
        # Expectation: Length of the pipeline should be equal to the number of steps
        assert pipe_length == 2, f"Expected pipeline length 2, got {pipe_length}"
        print("Pipeline length check passed, no issue detected.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("Test failed, issue detected.")
        exit(0)  # Exiting with 0 to indicate script executed as expected but found the issue
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exiting with 1 to indicate an unexpected error occurred

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script performs the following actions:

1. Import necessary modules from `sklearn` (scikit-learn) including `svm`, `make_classification`, `SelectKBest`, `f_regression`, and `Pipeline`.
  
2. In the `main()` function, it follows the steps to reproduce the issue as described:
   - Data is generated using `make_classification` with given parameters.
   - A feature selection filter (`SelectKBest`) and a classifier (`svm.SVC`) are set up and combined into a `Pipeline`.
   - It attempts to get the length of the pipeline using `len(pipe)` and asserts that the length is expected to be 2 (since there are two steps in the pipeline).
  
3. If the assertion fails (which means there's an issue with `Pipeline`'s `__len__` implementation), an `AssertionError` is caught, and its stack trace is printed using `print_stacktrace`.
  
4. If any other exception occurs (indicating problems outside the specific issue being tested), it also catches this and prints the stack trace.
  
5. The script exits with code 0 when the assertion fails (issue detected) as per the requirements, or exits with code 1 if an unforeseen error occurs.

This approach provides a clear indication of whether the specific issue with the `Pipeline` class in scikit-learn has been resolved based on the exit code and the output generated by the script.
