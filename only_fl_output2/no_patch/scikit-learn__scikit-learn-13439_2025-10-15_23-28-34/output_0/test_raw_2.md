Given the requirement and the need for a precise script for reproducing the issue described, here's a refined version of `reproducer.py`. This script specifically aims to raise an `AssertionError` when the `Pipeline` object does not implement `__len__` correctly. If the implementation is as expected, the script should exit normally.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sklearn import svm
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_regression
    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

    try:
        X, y = make_classification(
            n_informative=5, n_redundant=0, random_state=42)

        anova_filter = SelectKBest(f_regression, k=5)
        clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')
        pipe = Pipeline([('anova', anova_filter), ('svc', clf)])

        # Attempt to call `__len__` on the pipeline instance and check its value
        assert len(pipe) == 2, "Pipeline `__len__` method did not return the expected number of steps."

        # The script should only reach this point and exit normally if the assertion did not fail
        print("Success: Pipeline `__len__` is implemented correctly.")
        exit(0)

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(0)  # Exit with 0 to indicate the assertion specifically designed to test was the cause
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with 1 to indicate an unexpected error occurred

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This version improves on the clarity and focus towards testing the specific issue raised, which revolves around the `Pipeline` object's support for `__len__`. The `try-except` blocks are tailored to address different outcomes: 
- If the assertion fails (meaning `__len__` didn't behave as expected), it prints the pertinent stack trace and exits with status code 0, as the failure is part of the test's design.
- If any other, unexpected exception is raised during execution, it also prints its stack trace but exits with status code 1, indicating an unforeseen error.

This careful handling and reporting of outcomes make it straightforward to use `reproducer.py` within automated testing environments or as part of manual diagnostic processes.
