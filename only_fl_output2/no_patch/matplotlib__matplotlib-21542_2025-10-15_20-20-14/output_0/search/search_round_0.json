Right now one can pass a callable directly (although that's not documented), and the default behaviour from #16715 is triggered. However, I guess making this change for format strings would imply a deprecation cycle, as it breaks current behaviour. Another option would be to check in `Axis._set_formatter`  for what kind of string format we've been passed (unsure how, although there must be way).\n### Additional context and prior art\n_No response_\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue, we need to perform several targeted search API calls:\n\n1. Retrieve the context around the default format strings in `colorbar` to understand the current implementation and how it uses old-style format strings:\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py\", 489, 5)`\n\n2. Examine the `update_ticks` method referenced in the issue to see how the colorbar's formatter is passed to the long axis. Since `update_ticks` is presumably a method within the `Colorbar` class, let's investigate its implementation:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"update_ticks\", \"lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py\")`\n\n3. To better understand the comparison with the normal axis format strings and the changes introduced in #16715 (without the specific merge or commit from the issue, we proceed based on the description), we may need to inspect the logic for setting formatters in the `Axis` class. As it's not guaranteed to be in the same file, let's search globally for this class and the `_set_formatter` method:\n   - `search_class(\"Axis\")`\n   - `search_method(\"_set_formatter\")`\n\nThese searches aim to clarify the current mechanism of formatting within both colorbars and axes, compare their implementations, and provide insights into pursuing the proposed solution or an alternative that respects the need for a possible deprecation cycle when adjusting format string handling."
