        "intended_behavior": "The initialization of the colorbar's formatter should be adapted to preferentially utilize new-style format strings, aligning it with the behavior introduced for axes in #16715. While maintaining backward compatibility, this would involve either directly using a new-style formatter as the default or modifying the conditional logic around line 489 to support or default to new-style formatting when a string is passed. This adjustment ensures that users transitioning to or already using new-style formatting elsewhere in matplotlib do not encounter inconsistencies when working with colorbars."

        "method": "update_ticks",
        "intended_behavior": "Although not directly implicated as faulty, any modifications to formatter initialization or handling in `__init__` could necessitate adjustments in `update_ticks` to ensure that the formatter, once set or modified to support new-style strings, is correctly applied to the colorbar's long axis. This may simply involve verifying compatibility or making minor adjustments following changes in the `__init__` method, ensuring that the formatter's application within `update_ticks` smoothly accommodates any new logic introduced to support the issue resolution. The resolution should ensure no disruption to existing functionalities for users who do not require new-style formatting, thus preserving the extensibility and customizability of matplotlib's plotting capabilities."
