This script will attempt to reproduce the issue specified. It runs the `mutual_info_score` function twice: first with the input array having dtype `object` due to `.astype(object)`, and second without enforcing object dtype, hence using the default dtype numpy chooses for string arrays. It then asserts that the results from both calls should be close to each other (indicating successful execution).

If the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError` when the output doesn't match the expectation due to the input validation regression in the clustering metrics, catching and printing the stack trace of the original `ValueError`.

Note: The comparison and catch blocks are based on the issue's description of expected output and errors. Depending on scikit-learn's version and its handling of numpy arrays with object dtype, the actual behavior might differ, and you could update the script accordingly.
