If necessary, it should include explicit handling or encoding of string-type labels to ensure that the matrix accurately reflects the relationships between true and predicted labels without data type conversion errors. This could involve incorporating a check or conversion for non-numeric label types to ensure compatibility with the matrix operations that follow."
