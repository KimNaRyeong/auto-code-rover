When used with a descending order it will look correct.\nUnfortunately in the fix in #30903 it was assumed that the col_suffixes passed to django.db.backends.ddl_references.Columns would be empty for ascending order but instead it will contain empty strings and thus causing this bug. See: \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/db/backends/ddl_references.py#L87\nThe expected output would be:\nCREATE INDEX \"idx\" ON \"schema_author\" (\u201cname\u201d text_pattern_ops)\n</issue>"

        "content": "To understand and resolve the issue of improper whitespace in `CREATE INDEX` statements generated by Django's ORM for both normal and opclass-indexed fields, we should gather more context around the code responsible for generating these statements. Based on the information from the issue, let's perform the following API calls:\n\n1. To examine the existing implementation of how Django's ORM constructs the `CREATE INDEX` SQL statement, which seems to be handled in the `Columns` class within `ddl_references.py`, and how it deals with `-name` (descending order) and opclasses:\n   - `search_class(\"Columns\")`\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"class Columns\", \"django/db/backends/ddl_references.py\")`\n   \n2. To inspect how `Index` objects translate their `fields` and `opclasses` attributes into part of the SQL statement, particularly focusing on the generation of column suffixes which seem to be at the heart of the issue:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"sql_create_index\", \"Index\")`\n   \n3. Since the issue also mentions incorrect handling of ascending order whereby `col_suffixes` is unexpectedly non-empty, hence leading to unwarranted whitespaces:\n   - `search_code(\"col_suffixes passed to django.db.backends.ddl_references.Columns\")`\n   \n4. Given that a previous attempt at resolving a related issue inadvertently introduced this bug, it may also be pertinent to examine changes made in response to ticket #30903, though the specific file or method to look into isn't explicitly called out. Understanding the exact modifications made during that fix could reveal how it interacts with the current bug:\n   - `search_code(\"ticket #30903\")`\n\nThese calls are expected to divulge crucial insights into how indexes are defined and processed within Django's ORM, the handling of `col_suffixes`, and any recent changes that might have affected this behavior."
