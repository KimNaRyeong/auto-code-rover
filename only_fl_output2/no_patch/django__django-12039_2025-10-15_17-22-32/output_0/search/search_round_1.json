When used with a descending order it will look correct.\nUnfortunately in the fix in #30903 it was assumed that the col_suffixes passed to django.db.backends.ddl_references.Columns would be empty for ascending order but instead it will contain empty strings and thus causing this bug.

Based on the information from the issue, let's perform the following API calls:\n\n1. To examine the existing implementation of how Django's ORM constructs the `CREATE INDEX` SQL statement, which seems to be handled in the `Columns` class within `ddl_references.py`, and how it deals with `-name` (descending order) and opclasses:\n   - `search_class(\"Columns\")`\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"class Columns\", \"django/db/backends/ddl_references.py\")`\n   \n2. To inspect how `Index` objects translate their `fields` and `opclasses` attributes into part of the SQL statement, particularly focusing on the generation of column suffixes which seem to be at the heart of the issue:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"sql_create_index\", \"Index\")`\n   \n3. Since the issue also mentions incorrect handling of ascending order whereby `col_suffixes` is unexpectedly non-empty, hence leading to unwarranted whitespaces:\n   - `search_code(\"col_suffixes passed to django.db.backends.ddl_references.Columns\")`\n   \n4. Given that a previous attempt at resolving a related issue inadvertently introduced this bug, it may also be pertinent to examine changes made in response to ticket #30903, though the specific file or method to look into isn't explicitly called out. Understanding the exact modifications made during that fix could reveal how it interacts with the current bug:\n   - `search_code(\"ticket #30903\")`\n\nThese calls are expected to divulge crucial insights into how indexes are defined and processed within Django's ORM, the handling of `col_suffixes`, and any recent changes that might have affected this behavior."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the API call results:\n\n1. **`Columns` class in `django/db/backends/ddl_references.py`**:\n   - This class is designed to hold references to one or many columns, as suggested by the brief snippet and comment within the source code. The initialization method (`__init__`) accepts parameters such as `table`, `columns`, `quote_name`, and `col_suffixes` with a default value of an empty tuple. This directly relates to the issue, as the handling of `col_suffixes` appears to be where the whitespace problem originates. The `Columns` class is likely responsible for assembling parts of the `CREATE INDEX` SQL statement, including how column names are referenced and any suffixes attached to them.\n   - The relationship with the bug: The issue describes that there's incorrect whitespace handling around column names and suffixes in `CREATE INDEX` statements. Specifically, it mentions that `col_suffixes` were assumed to be empty for ascending order but can contain empty strings, suggesting that the logic within `Columns` or related processing might not correctly handle these scenarios, leading to the unwanted whitespace.\n   - Intended behavior: The expected output should correctly format the `CREATE INDEX` statement with proper spacing, regardless of whether opclasses are used, the ordering specified, or whether suffixes are present or absent. The `Columns` class should probably ensure no trailing whitespace is introduced after column names and opclasses, especially when no specific ordering or suffix is required.\n\nGiven the findings and the inability to directly locate `sql_create_index` within the `Index` class or details about `col_suffixes` handling and the ticket #30903 reference, further actions should consider:\n- Directly examining the implementation code around the `Columns` class' handling of `col_suffixes` and format building within `__str__` or other methods involved in generating SQL parts, since the initialization hints at their relevance but doesn't show the actual logic.\n- Given the `sql_create_index` was not found under `Index`, it might be necessary to search more broadly for how `CREATE INDEX` statements are generated within Django's ORM layer, maybe under a different method name or within a different class related to database schema management or index management.\n- Expanding the search for how Django tracks and resolves issues (i.e., searching for commits or pull requests related to ticket #30903) to understand the changes made and how they might have led to this unintended behavior.\n- Another approach is to look into methods involved in the generation and formatting of SQL statements for index creation across the codebase, possibly by searching for related keywords or methods known to interact with `Columns` or index definition.\n\nTo progress, let's do the following search API calls based on these considerations:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"__str__\", \"django/db/backends/ddl_references.py\")` to see how `Columns` generates the final string output, potentially illuminating how suffices and whitespaces are managed.\n- `search_code(\"CREATE INDEX\")` to find other parts of the codebase involved in generating index creation SQL, which might provide more context or indicate where the logic for handling opclasses and orderings is implemented."

This involves precise handling of `col_suffixes` to avoid introducing unwanted whitespace, particularly in scenarios where `col_suffixes` might be an empty string, indicating default (ascending) order without additional modifiers. The method needs to conditionally add spaces between parts of the SQL statement only when necessary, preserving all existing functionalities related to SQL statement generation for index creation. This adjustment ensures cleaner, syntactically correct SQL output in all cases, maintaining the readability and consistency of generated SQL scripts.\n"
