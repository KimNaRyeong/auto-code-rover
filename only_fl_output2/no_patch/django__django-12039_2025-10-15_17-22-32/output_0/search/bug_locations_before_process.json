        "intended_behavior": "This method(s) should ensure that when generating SQL statements for creating indexes, proper spacing is maintained between column names, order directives (e.g., ASC, DESC), and opclass specifications. This involves precise handling of col_suffixes to avoid introducing unwanted whitespace, particularly in scenarios where col_suffixes might be an empty string, indicating default (ascending) order without additional modifiers. The method needs to conditionally add spaces between parts of the SQL statement only when necessary, preserving all existing functionalities related to SQL statement generation for index creation. This adjustment ensures cleaner, syntactically correct SQL output in all cases, maintaining the readability and consistency of generated SQL scripts."
