        "intended_behavior": "The `construct` method must ensure that all coordinates that were present before the operation are maintained as coordinates after the operation. This involves:\n- Explicitly checking which variables were coordinates before the operation begins.\n- After reshaping the dataset or data array, re-assign those variables as coordinates, ensuring that non-dimensional coordinates are not demoted to variables.\n- This might involve adjusting the logic around lines 976-981, where the final dataset is being adjusted to set coordinates, to ensure that any pre-operation non-dimensional coordinates are identified and preserved correctly.\n\nThe preservation of coordinate status should be independent of the reshaping process, meaning that if a variable was a coordinate before calling `Coarsen.construct`, it should also be a coordinate afterward, barring any explicit modification to its dimensions that would inherently change its nature to a non-coordinate variable. This would resolve the issue by maintaining consistency in the dataset's structure, preventing unintended changes to variable status simply as a result of data reorganization."
