Here are the search API calls I would invoke:\n\n1. Search for the `Coarsen` class to understand its structure and context within the codebase:\n   - `search_class(\"Coarsen\")`\n\n2. Search for the `construct` method within the `Coarsen` class to understand how it's implemented and interacts with coordinates and variables:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"construct\", \"Coarsen\")`\n\n3. Because the issue mentions how coordinates are being demoted to variables, it's important to review any relevant code or methods that handle coordinates. The API calls related to coordinates and their manipulation could provide insight into where the issue might be stemming from:\n   - `search_method(\"assign_coords\")`\n   - `search_method(\"to_dataset\")`\n\n4. Additionally, to see how the `coarsen` method is utilized within datasets could provide more context, especially around the pattern of usage that leads to the issue:\n   - `search_method(\"coarsen\")`\n\nThese search API calls should help us gather comprehensive context regarding the issue reported, especially focusing on how the `Coarsen.construct` method is implemented and its impact on dataset coordinates."
