This will help in understanding any changes in Django 3.1 that may affect the behavior of `get_context_data`.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"get_context_data\", \"TemplateView\")`\n\n3. **Search for the usage of `get_object_or_404`**, since the issue mentions that the type passed to this function from `kwargs` is causing a problem.\n   - `search_code(\"get_object_or_404\")`\n\n4. **Search for the configuration of URLs**, particularly the URL pattern mentioned in the issue, to understand how `offer_slug` is passed to `OfferView`.\n   - `search_code(\"path(\\\"/offers/<slug:offer_slug>/\\\", OfferView.as_view(), name=\\\"offer_view\\\")\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive view of the areas in the codebase that are relevant to the reported issue, including how the `OfferView` class is defined and interacts with Django's URL dispatcher and ORM system. This will serve as a solid foundation for crafting a patch to address the issue."
