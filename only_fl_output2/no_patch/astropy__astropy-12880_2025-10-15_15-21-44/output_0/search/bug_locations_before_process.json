        "intended_behavior": "The `get_cols` method within the `EcsvHeader` class needs to be modified to allow `datetime64` as a valid data type. This involves adjusting the `ECSV_DATATYPES` constant to include `datetime64` or implementing a special handling case for datetime types within the method. The modification should ensure that when `get_cols` processes columns, it recognizes `datetime64` as a valid datatype and proceeds without raising a `ValueError`. This change will permit the reading of ECSV files created with older versions of Astropy that contain `datetime64` columns, preserving backward compatibility and expected functionality. Additionally, care should be taken to ensure that this broader acceptance of datatypes does not adversely affect the parsing of other supported types, maintaining the existing functionality for non-datetime columns."
