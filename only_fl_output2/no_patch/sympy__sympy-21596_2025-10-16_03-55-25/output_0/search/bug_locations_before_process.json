        "intended_behavior": "The method should accurately construct an ImageSet that correctly reflects both real and imaginary number operations. Specifically, when imageset is used to generate sets involving complex operations (like those involving I, the imaginary unit), it must ensure that the set operations like membership (in) checks and intersection (intersect) with Reals accurately represent the mathematical reality. The fix should ensure that when an ImageSet resulting from such operations is intersected with Reals, the members of the resulting set are indeed real numbers (if any), and membership checks align with mathematical expectations. This includes correcting any logic that inaccurately simplifies or evaluates set expressions involving complex numbers."

        "intended_behavior": "Ensure that the methods within Reals (and potentially how Reals interacts with methods like intersect in other classes) correctly identify and handle ImageSets that involve complex number operations. This might involve refining how Reals determines the presence (or absence) of real numbers within such sets. The behavior must preserve the mathematical integrity such that operations like S1.intersect(Reals) correctly identify when complex number expressions result in real numbers and when they do not, thus correcting the current issue where 2 in S1.intersect(Reals) incorrectly evaluates to True."
