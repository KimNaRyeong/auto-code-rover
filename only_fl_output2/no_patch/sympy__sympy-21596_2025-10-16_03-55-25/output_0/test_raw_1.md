Given your requirements, here is a corrected version of the `reproducer.py` that takes into account the previous feedback and includes the correct usage of the `print_stacktrace` function if an error occurs. This script is specifically designed to assert the incorrect behavior as described and output detailed error information if the assertions fail, thus helping to pinpoint the presence of the stated issue.

```python
def main():
    from sympy import symbols, imageset, Lambda, I, S
    from sympy.abc import n

    S1 = imageset(Lambda(n, n + (n - 1)*(n + 1)*I), S.Integers)

    try:
        assert 2 not in S1, "Assertion failed: 2 was found in S1, but it shouldn't be."

        # Correct behavior should not find 2 in the intersection of S1 and Reals
        assert 2 not in S1.intersect(S.Reals), "Assertion failed: 2 was found in the intersection of S1 and Reals."

        # Check the intersection of S1 and Reals to see whether it's as expected
        intersection = S1.intersect(S.Reals)
        assert intersection == {-1, 1}, f"Assertion failed: The intersection of S1 and Reals was expected to be {-1, 1}, but was {intersection}."

        print("All checks passed. The issue appears to be fixed.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Ensure the script exits with a non-zero code if an assertion fails

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script checks specifically for the incorrect outcomes described in your issue. When run, it will:
- Assert if the value `2` incorrectly appears to be in the set `S1` or its intersection with `Reals`.
- Verify if the intersection between `S1` and `Reals` is not matching the expected result of `{-1, 1}`.
- Utilize the `print_stacktrace` to provide detailed error information if any assertion fails, thus confirming the presence of the issue. If the assertions do not fail (implying the issue might have been resolved), it prints a confirmation message and exits with code `0`.
