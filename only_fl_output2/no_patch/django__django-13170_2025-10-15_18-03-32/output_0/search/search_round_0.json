        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the reported issue regarding supporting nested relations in `FilteredRelation`'s condition, I will perform the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `FilteredRelation` class to understand how it is currently implemented and where modifications might be needed to support nested relations.\n2. Find out where the `FilteredRelation`'s condition is evaluated. This involves both the class where it happens and the specific method(s), as understanding the current evaluation logic is crucial for adjusting it to support nested relations.\n3. Given the example provided in the issue description uses `Q` objects (e.g., `Q(pizzas__toppings__name__startswith='n')`), it's also important to look into how `Q` objects are handled in relation to `FilteredRelation`.\n\nHere are the API calls I will use based on the above analysis:\n\n- `search_class(\"FilteredRelation\")`: This call will provide information on where the `FilteredRelation` class is defined.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"add_q\", \"QuerySet\")`: Since `Q` objects are typically added to querysets, understanding how this process works may give insights into how to enable support for nested relations within `FilteredRelation`.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"build_filter\", \"QuerySet\")`: This is to investigate how filters are built and how it could relate to handling nested relations within `FilteredRelation`.\n- `search_code(\"FilteredRelation(condition=\")`: This call is designed to find implementations or usage examples within the codebase that might highlight how the `condition` attribute of `FilteredRelation` is handled.\n  \nThese calls should provide a solid starting point for crafting a patch to support nested relations in `FilteredRelation`'s condition."
