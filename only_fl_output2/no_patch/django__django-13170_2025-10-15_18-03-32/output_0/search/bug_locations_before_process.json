This includes parsing the nested relationship fields (e.g., handling `pizzas__toppings__name__startswith='n'` effectively) and assembling the correct SQL join operations to reflect the nested conditions within the query. The modification must ensure that it does not interfere with the existing functionality for relations that are not nested, maintaining backward compatibility."

        "intended_behavior": "In the `as_sql` method, enhancements are needed to generate the appropriate SQL query that supports nested relation filtering based on adjusted conditions from `resolve_expression`. This involves correctly interpreting nested conditions and translating them into the SQL JOINs and WHERE clauses necessary to fulfill the nested relation query requirements. The behavior must remain compatible with current uses of `FilteredRelation` where nested relations are not involved."
