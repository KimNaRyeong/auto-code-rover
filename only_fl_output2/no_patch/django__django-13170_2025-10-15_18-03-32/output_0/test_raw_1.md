To address the issue with the `AppRegistryNotReady` error and properly configure a Django environment within a standalone script, adjustments are required. It's essential to properly initialize the Django environment before defining models or executing queries. Here is an amended version of the `reproducer.py` file considering these requirements:

```python
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import FilteredRelation, Q
from django.core.management import call_command

# Basic Django settings
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        "default": {
            "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
            "NAME": ":memory:",
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=("__main__",),
    TIME_ZONE="UTC",
    USE_TZ=True,
)
django.setup()

# Models definition
class Restaurant(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

class Pizza(models.Model):
    restaurant = models.ForeignKey(Restaurant, related_name='pizzas', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

class Topping(models.Model):
    pizza = models.ForeignKey(Pizza, related_name='toppings', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run():
    # Migrate database
    call_command('migrate')

    # Attempt to use FilteredRelation with nested relation
    try:
        Restaurant.objects.annotate(
            pizzas_with_toppings_startswith_n=FilteredRelation(
                'pizzas__toppings',
                condition=Q(pizzas__toppings__name__startswith='n'),
            ),
        ).first()
        # The script should not reach this point without an error if the issue is present
        print("The issue seems to be fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert str(e) == "FilteredRelation's condition doesn't support nested relations (got 'pizzas__toppings__name__startswith').", \
            "Unexpected issue encountered, check the stack trace."

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run()
```

Make sure you have Django installed in your environment before running this script:

```sh
pip install django
```

This script initializes the Django settings and executes database migrations before attempting to reproduce the issue by creating an annotated queryset using `FilteredRelation` with a nested relation. If the encountered issue matches the expected `ValueError`, it will print the stack trace using the provided function. If the issue is resolved in future Django releases or patches, the script will indicate that the problem seems to be fixed and will exit with code 0.
