        "intended_behavior": "The `inv_trig_table` should include all inverse trigonometric functions (`asin`, `acos`, `atan`, `acot`, `acsc`, `asec`) to allow the `_print_Function` method to properly transform these functions into their full LaTeX representation when `inv_trig_style=\"full\"` is selected. This update will preserve the existing functionality (support for `\"abbreviated\"` and `\"power\"` styles should remain unaffected) while ensuring that `acsc` and `asec` are also correctly represented in the `\"full\"` style, following the same pattern as `asin`, `acos`, etc., by being prefixed with `\"arc\"` in their LaTeX form. This modification directly addresses the reported issue by expanding the handling capabilities for inverse trigonometric functions, ensuring consistency and correctness in the produced LaTeX code."
