        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue described, the intended behavior should involve modifying the `Command` class that handles the `diffsettings` command, including: adding a new argument to the command line options to specify a base settings module for comparison (e.g., `--default=settings.base`), altering the logic in the handling method to load and compare the specified settings module against the project's current settings, and ensuring this new functionality does not interfere with existing capability to compare with default Django settings."
