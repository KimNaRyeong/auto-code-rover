The issue requires enhancing the `diffsettings` command to allow comparison with another settings module, not just the default Django settings. This implies that we need to understand the current implementation of `diffsettings` to propose a suitable enhancement.\n\nFirst, identify the command's implementation: \n- search_method(\"diffsettings\")\n\nThis command is most likely part of Django's management command infrastructure, so it might be implemented in a specific management command class. If the above search does not directly lead us to the `diffsettings` command implementation, we might need to investigate the class or file where Django's management commands are defined, specifically those for settings management. However, let's start with the proposed search to direct us toward the implementation details."
