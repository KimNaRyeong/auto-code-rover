```

This script will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present by checking if the `latex` representation of the `Mul(6, S.Half, evaluate=False)` expression does not match the expected result, which includes a proper number separator, such as `\\cdot` for a multiplication operation. If the issue is not present, the script will complete normally and exit with code 0, indicating the issue has been fixed.
