Here's a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that should help reproduce the issue you're encountering. You can copy this script into your project's root directory and run it using Python 3. It's designed to check the behavior of the `latex()` function from SymPy when dealing with an unevaluated multiplication that includes a fraction (specifically `1/2`). The script will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present (i.e., if there's no separator between the numbers in the output of the `latex()` function), thereby providing a stack trace to help identify the issue's location.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import Mul, S, latex
    try:
        result = latex(Mul(6, S.Half, evaluate=False))
        # Check if the output has the correct spacing (separator) between numbers.
        # Expected output could vary, but for the issue at hand, checking for spacing.
        assert "6 \\frac{1}{2}" in result or "6 \\times \\frac{1}{2}" in result, "Issue with latex output: no proper separator"
        print("The issue is fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError:
        # Exit with code 0 if the assertion fails (indicating the issue is present).
        # Normally, a non-zero exit code indicates an error, but the instructions specify to use code 0.
        # This might confuse some systems or standards that consider 0 as success.
        import sys
        sys.exit(0)
```

Please make sure you have SymPy installed in your Python environment before running this script, as it relies on the `sympy` package. You can install SymPy via pip if you haven't done so already:

```
pip install sympy
```

Running this script (`python3 reproducer.py`) will assess the formatting issue with the `latex()` function's output. If the issue exists, the script will print a stack trace and exit with code 0 due to the specific requirements you provided. If the issue is fixed in a future version of SymPy or if this test case does not accurately reproduce the problem, the script will simply print "The issue is fixed." and terminate normally.
