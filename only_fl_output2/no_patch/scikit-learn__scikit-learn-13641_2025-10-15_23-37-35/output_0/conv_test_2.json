        "content": "Given your requirements, here's a revised standalone Python file `reproducer.py` that should more appropriately target the issue described. This version attempts to setup a scenario that recognizes whether the `CountVectorizer` properly handles a custom analyzer in conjunction with an `input` parameter that is not suited for direct string inputs. As requested, it will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is indeed present (in this context, if the setup does not match the expected failure or misbehavior) and will provide a clear stack trace for diagnosis. Since the issue brief suggests a concern over the `input` parameter being potentially ignored with custom analyzers, the script now focuses on this aspect while ensuring any deviation from expected behavior is caught and reported:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nimport os\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        # Setup: write a temporary file to use with the 'filename' input\n        temp_filename = 'temp_text_file.txt'\n        with open(temp_filename, 'w') as temp_file:\n            temp_file.write(\"hello world\")\n\n        # Attempt to use CountVectorizer with a custom analyzer and 'filename' input\n        cv = CountVectorizer(analyzer=lambda x: x.split(), input='filename')\n        cv.fit([temp_filename])\n        vocab = cv.vocabulary_\n\n        os.remove(temp_filename)  # Cleanup the temporary file\n\n        # Assert to check if 'vocab' behaves as expected when issue is present\n        # Given no explicit test condition for failure here, we emphasize on structure\n        expected_vocab = {'hello': 0, 'world': 1}\n        assert vocab == expected_vocab, \"Vocabulary does not match expected output. Issue might be present.\"\n\n    except AssertionError as ae:\n        print_stacktrace(ae)\n        raise  # Ensures non-zero exit code for AssertionError\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise  # Reraise any other exception after printing the stack trace\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nImportant to note:\n- This script now writes a temporary file to act as input, aligning with the expectation that `input='filename'` would imply the use of file paths rather than direct string lists.\n- The script cleanup includes the removal of the temporary file to avoid leaving artifacts from its execution.\n- The assertion and expected behavior need alignment with the context of how `input='filename'` should work with `CountVectorizer` when used with a custom analyzer. The \"issue\" as described might revolve around understanding whether `CountVectorizer` can indeed process file input with a custom analyzer directly, which by default behavior it might not without additional handling for reading files within the custom analyzer or proper setup.\n- The script checks for a specific expected output to assert against, which represents a successful pass condition. Any deviation leading to the `AssertionError` might suggest the presence of the described issue or a misalignment in expectations."
