        # Therefore, reaching this point without an exception implies the issue is present.
        raise AssertionError("CountVectorizer with custom analyzer did not ignore 'input' argument as expected.")
    
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()

I have revised the `reproducer.py` script to focus on the essence of the reported issue, which centers around `CountVectorizer`'s handling of a custom analyzer function simultaneously with an `input` parameter set inconsistently with the data actually passed to the `fit` method. This script should raise an `AssertionError` to signify when the described misbehavior is detected - that is, if the process progresses without the system raising any errors regarding the improper use of the `fit` method's input.

Important considerations:
- The script will try to use the `fit` method incorrectly by passing direct text data when the `CountVectorizer` is configured to expect filenames (due to the `input='filename'` setting).
- An exception should arise from the misuse; the script anticipates this and is structured to flag an AssertionError if it proceeds without incident, symbolizing the discussed issue is present.
- If the script executes correctly (that is, it faces an error as anticipated under correct `CountVectorizer` operation), the issue, as stated, might not be reproducible in the current environment or with the version of `sklearn` being tested.
- The try-except blocks are primed to catch any exception and print a stack trace for debugging purposes, adhering to the stipulated method for error reporting.
