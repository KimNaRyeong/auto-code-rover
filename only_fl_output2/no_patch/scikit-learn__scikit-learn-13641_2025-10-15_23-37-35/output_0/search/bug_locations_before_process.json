It should be clearly stated that when `input='filename'`, the method expects file paths as input, and this behavior is maintained even with a custom analyzer, meaning the files will be read before applying the custom analyzer."

        "intended_behavior": "The `fit` method should be enhanced to respect the `input` parameter when a custom analyzer is provided. This entails addition of logic to handle the case when `input='filename'` or `input='file'`, ensuring that files are read and their contents passed to the custom analyzer. The implementation should maintain backward compatibility and not affect existing functionality for users not utilizing the `input` or custom `analyzer` parameters. Specifically, when `input` is `filename`, the method should iterate through the given filenames, open each file, read its content, and then apply the custom analyzer (if specified) to the content of each file. This adjustment would ensure that the `CountVectorizer` works as intended for all supported types of input."
