        "intended_behavior": "The `MpmathPrinter` should be enhanced to include `min_fixed` and `max_fixed` settings, akin to its handling of other formatting options. The method responsible for printing `Float` types (`_print_Float`) should be modified or extended to check these settings and determine the appropriate notation (fixed-point or scientific) based on the value of the float being printed and the `min_fixed`, `max_fixed` settings. This behavior should coexist with the current capabilities, such as handling of known functions and constants."

        "intended_behavior": "The `_print_Float` method in `LatexPrinter` should be updated or another mechanism should be implemented to consider `min_fixed` and `max_fixed` settings when printing floats, similar to the enhancement described for `MpmathPrinter`. This will involve conditioning the representation on the numerical value of the float, ensuring consistency across different printing methods. The handling of `strip_zeros` shows there's an opportunity to integrate these settings in a similar fashion, ensuring the floating-point numbers are printed correctly in LaTeX format."
