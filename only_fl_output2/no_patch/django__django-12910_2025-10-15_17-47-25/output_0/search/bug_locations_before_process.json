        "intended_behavior": "Replace the `requires_system_checks = True` attribute with `required_system_checks = '__all__'`. This attribute should now be capable of accepting a list of system check tags that are required to run before the command's execution. If set to an empty list, it would imply that no system checks are required, mimicking the previous `False` setting. When set to `'__all__'`, it signals that all registered system checks should run, preserving existing functionality for commands that do not override this attribute. Update the mechanism within the Django management command framework that interprets this attribute to handle lists of check tags in addition to the string `'__all__'`. This enhancement would allow command subclasses more granular control over which checks need to be executed, potentially skipping unnecessary checks to improve efficiency or to prevent irrelevant checks from causing command failure."
