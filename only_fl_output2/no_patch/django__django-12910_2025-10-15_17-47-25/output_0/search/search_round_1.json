That would prevent having do to the manual and error prone options['skip_checks'] dance. In all cases that should be done in a different PR.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the provided context from the search results, here's what we can deduce regarding the questions raised:\n\n### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe snippet found in `django/core/management/base.py` sets a class attribute `requires_system_checks = True` within what appears to be a base class for management commands in Django. This attribute likely serves as a flag to mandate system checks before executing the command it's associated with by default unless overridden.\n\n### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue calls for the replacement of the `requires_system_checks = True` boolean flag with a more flexible attribute that can specify exactly which checks need to be run. The snippet represents the exact location where this attribute is defined and thus highlights the point in the codebase where modifications will need to be made to implement the solution described in the issue.\n\n### Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior after modification would no longer be a simple boolean flag. Instead, the attribute would ideally accept a list of tags (or `__all__` to signify all checks should be performed) that represent specific system checks to be run before the command execution. This change aims to allow command subclasses to specify which system checks are necessary for them, rather than adhering to a binary \"all or nothing\" approach. It not only increases the flexibility and granularity of control over the system checks but also simplifies the process for developers by eliminating the need for manually skipping checks via the `options['skip_checks']` mechanism.\n\nTo move forward, the adjustment in `base.py` should be to:\n\n1. Replace the `requires_system_checks` boolean attribute with `required_system_checks` that defaults to `'__all__'`.\n2. Adjust the logic that interprets this attribute throughout the framework to handle a list of strings (tags) in addition to the `'__all__'` string.\n\nFurther exploration is needed to understand how system checks are invoked and how they can be selectively run based on this new attribute\u2014this may involve looking into the method(s) within the Django framework that handle the execution of system checks prior to command execution."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This attribute should now be capable of accepting a list of system check tags that are required to run before the command's execution. If set to an empty list, it would imply that no system checks are required, mimicking the previous `False` setting. When set to `'__all__'`, it signals that all registered system checks should run, preserving existing functionality for commands that do not override this attribute.\n    - Update the mechanism within the Django management command framework that interprets this attribute to handle lists of check tags in addition to the string `'__all__'`. This enhancement would allow command subclasses more granular control over which checks need to be executed, potentially skipping unnecessary checks to improve efficiency or to prevent irrelevant checks from causing command failure.\n    \nThis change maintains backward compatibility by ensuring that commands which currently do not override `requires_system_checks` will continue to operate as before, undergoing all system checks, due to the default `'__all__'` setting. Commands wishing to opt out of all checks can do so by setting `required_system_checks` to an empty list, and commands desiring only specific checks can specify those checks by tag in the list."
