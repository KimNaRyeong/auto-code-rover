This is not straightforward because resolving expressions with non-existent throws FieldError, so we cannot just collect columns from Query._gen_cols().\nFollow up to #26167.\nI attached tests.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to adding system checks for invalid model field names for functional indexes in `Meta.indexes`, the following API calls should be made:\n\n1. Search for any existing system check related methods in the codebase. This could involve classes or methods that are already performing model validation or system checks to see how they're implemented and if they can be extended or modified to include the functionality for functional indexes. \n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"check\")\n```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that resolving expressions with non-existent fields throws `FieldError`, it might be beneficial to look into how `FieldError` is currently being handled within the system checks or if it's being caught at all during the validation process.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"FieldError\")\n```\n\n3. The method `_gen_cols()` is mentioned as a point of reference for collecting columns, although it is noted in the issue description that we cannot directly use this due to limitations with `FieldError`. However, investigating its current implementation can provide insights into how columns are generated and may hint at where the checks for function index validity need to be integrated.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"_gen_cols\")\n```\n\n4. To understand more about the context in which `Meta.indexes` is defined and possibly validated, it is important to look into the definition and usage of `Meta` classes, especially in relation to model definition.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"Meta.indexes\")\n```\n\nThese API calls are aimed at getting a broader view of the system's current mechanism for performing model checks, handling field-related errors, and understanding how indexes are defined and utilized within the project."
