Search for any existing system check related methods in the codebase.

The method `_gen_cols()` is mentioned as a point of reference for collecting columns, although it is noted in the issue description that we cannot directly use this due to limitations with `FieldError`. However, investigating its current implementation can provide insights into how columns are generated and may hint at where the checks for function index validity need to be integrated.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"_gen_cols\")\n```\n\n4. To understand more about the context in which `Meta.indexes` is defined and possibly validated, it is important to look into the definition and usage of `Meta` classes, especially in relation to model definition.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"Meta.indexes\")\n```\n\nThese API calls are aimed at getting a broader view of the system's current mechanism for performing model checks, handling field-related errors, and understanding how indexes are defined and utilized within the project."

        "content": "Analyzing each piece of collected context in relation to the issue of adding system checks for invalid model field names for functional indexes in `Meta.indexes`:\n\n### 1. Results from `search_method(\"check\")`\n\n#### Analysis:\n- The `check` methods are scattered across various components of Django's architecture, including model validation, URL resolvers, admin checks, and database backends. \n- These checks are likely related to Django's system check framework, which is designed to identify common problems and encourage best practices.\n\n#### Relationship to Bug:\n- Among these, the checks found in model and database-related files (like `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`) are particularly relevant. These could be places where checks for functional indexes could be integrated.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\n- Ideally, a `check` method in one of these locations should be capable of validating the field names used in functional indexes, identifying those that do not exist, and notifying users about such issues.\n\n### 2. Results from `search_code(\"FieldError\")`\n\n#### Analysis:\n- `FieldError` is referenced in files that handle field operations and expressions, meaning it's a common exception raised for issues related to field operations, including potentially invalid field references.\n\n#### Relationship to Bug:\n- The handling and raising of `FieldError` in files related to expressions (`django/db/models/expressions.py`), queries (`django/db/models/sql/query.py`), and model field definitions suggest where Django expects valid field references. Understanding these contexts could help pinpoint where and how to introduce the check for functional indexes.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\n- Upon attempting to add a functional index with an invalid field name, the system should validate against this scenario, ideally before a `FieldError` condition is met at runtime, providing immediate feedback during system checks.\n\n### 3. Results from `search_method(\"_gen_cols\")`\n\n#### Analysis:\n- The `_gen_cols` method is involved in generating columns from expressions, indicating it processes expressions, including possibly those used in functional indexes.\n\n#### Relationship to Bug:\n- Since `_gen_cols` processes expressions and yields columns based on those expressions, it has a direct implication on how functional indexes (which are dependent on expressions) are to be resolved and validated.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\n- While directly using `_gen_cols` for validation as described in the issue might not be feasible due to the risk of `FieldError`, understanding its mechanism of handling expressions can guide the development of a validation strategy that preemptively checks for field validity within functional indexes without executing the expressions themselves.\n\n### 4. Results from `search_code(\"Meta.indexes\")`\n\n#### Analysis:\n- This snippet indicates where Django assembles SQL statements for all types of indexes defined on a model, including field indexes, `index_together`, and `Meta.indexes`.\n\n#### Relationship to Bug:\n- The inclusion of `Meta.indexes` in the index SQL generation process identifies where functional indexes are likely to be processed. This is a crucial junction for inserting the validation logic for the field names used in such indexes.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\n- The intended behavior would involve extending or enhancing the `_model_indexes_sql` method or similar logic to include a step where field names within functional indexes are checked for validity against the model's field definitions, thus ensuring that only correct and existent field references are permitted.\n  \n---\n\nConsidering this analysis, the next steps towards implementing a fix could involve determining an appropriate place to insert the validation logic. Since the system performs various checks when models are loaded or when running migrations, integrating the custom validation logic within these sequences, especially where `Meta.indexes` are processed, would be logical. This would allow catching configurations that may lead to runtime errors as early as possible, ideally during the system checking phase or before migration files are generated and applied."

Do we need more context?\nNo additional context is needed at this point to hypothesize potential locations and strategies for the fix based on the given information.\n\n### 2. Where are bug locations:\n\n#### Location 1:\n- **File:** django/db/models/sql/query.py\n- **Class:** Query\n- **Method:** _gen_cols\n- **Intended Behavior:** While `_gen_cols` itself may not be directly modified to resolve the issue due to its current functionality focusing on generating columns, understanding its workings gives insight into handling expressions. The actual fix may involve developing a parallel mechanism or utilizing the insights gained from `_gen_cols` to implement pre-validation checks of fields referenced in functional indexes within either this class or closer to where these indexes are defined and processed.\n\n#### Location 2:\n- **File:** django/db/backends/base/schema.py\n- **Class:** BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor\n- **Method:** _model_indexes_sql\n- **Intended Behavior:** Enhance the `_model_indexes_sql` method or integrate a new validation method within this class to perform checks on the field names used in `Meta.indexes` before proceeding with index SQL statement generation. This enhancement should include a mechanism for parsing functional index declarations, identifying field names (or expressions that imply a field name), and verifying those against the model's field definitions. If a field name does not exist, the system should raise an appropriate error during the validation phase, clearly informing the developer of the misconfiguration.\n\n#### Additional Context and Strategy:\n- While specific methods have been identified as points of interest, the exact implementation of the validation logic will likely require creating a new method focused on this validation rather than modifying existing ones. This ensures that the core functionality remains unaffected, and only the additional functionality of validating `Meta.indexes` for invalid field names is added. This method could be situated in a class responsible for model validation (potentially in `django/db/models/base.py` within the `Model` class) or within the existing system checks framework, which might involve extending the checks in `django/core/checks/model_checks.py` or a similar module dedicated to model validation. \n\n- The validation logic should preferably be invoked at a stage where it's guaranteed that all model fields are already loaded and available for inspection, ensuring that the validation is comprehensive and accurate. \n\nBy addressing these locations with the described intended behavior, the Django framework can offer more robust error handling and guidance for developers, specifically around the complex area of functional indexes in models."
