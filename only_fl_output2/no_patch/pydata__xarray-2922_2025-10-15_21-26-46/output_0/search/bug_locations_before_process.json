        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, a new method named `average` should be added to the `Dataset` class. This new method would compute weighted averages across specified dimensions of the `Dataset`. The designed method will have to consider several factors to integrate seamlessly with the existing functionality of the class: - Ability to Specify Dimensions: The method should allow users to specify which dimensions to average over. This is consistent with other methods in the class, such as `sum` and `mean`, which work over specified dimensions. - Weight Application: The method must support the application of weights to the averaging process. This could involve accepting another Dataset or DataArray containing weights that correspond to the dimensions being averaged. Implementing weighted averages is crucial for many scientific and geospatial analyses where data points contribute unevenly to the overall average. - Preservation of Dataset Structure: The method should preserve the overall structure of the Dataset, meaning that it should return a new Dataset with the same coordinates and other dimensions intact, excluding those dimensions over which the average was computed. - Handling of Missing Values: The method should decide on a strategy for handling NaNs or missing values within the Dataset. It could follow similar conventions to other aggregation methods, offering users control over whether to skip or include these values in the computation. - Integration with Existing Methods: The method should be thoughtfully integrated into the existing set of Dataset methods, considering interactions with methods for selection, indexing, and other forms of data manipulation. This includes considering how it interacts with Dask-based lazy computations if `Dataset` objects can be backed by Dask arrays for out-of-memory computation."
