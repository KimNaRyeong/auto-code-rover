        "content": "To address the issue of adding an `average` function that can compute weighted averages, especially for geo data, we need to gather information about existing structures that the new function will interact with or be a part of. The core of the request revolves around a data structure or class, likely represented as `ds` in the issue description. This hint suggests `ds` could be an abbreviation or a variable of a specific class within the codebase that represents data, possibly a dataset or data structure.\n\nHere's how we'll approach gathering context:\n\n1. **Identify the class**: Since `ds` is used like an object that could potentially have methods (as `ds.average()` is requested), it's important to find out what class `ds` refers to. Given that `ds` could be shorthand for a commonly understood class in the context of the project, we need to look for classes that could represent datasets or similar data structures.\n\n2. **Current methods and structures**: Understanding what methods and properties the class currently supports will help in designing the `average` function to fit coherently within the existing framework. It will also help to know if there are any existing methods for summation, finding means, or handling weights that the new feature can leverage or needs to be compatible with.\n\nGiven these steps, I will initiate the exploration with the assumption that we are looking for a dataset or similarly named class and related components within the project. Let's start with:\n\n- search_method(\"average\")\n- search_class(\"Dataset\")\n- search_class(\"DataStructure\")"
