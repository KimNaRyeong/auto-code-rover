        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, let's break down each piece of information to address the concerns raised in the issue description regarding adding the ability to know where an object was deleted from to pre/post delete signals.\n\n### Analysis of `Signal` Class\nThe `Signal` class found in `django/dispatch/dispatcher.py` serves as a cornerstone for signal handling within the Django framework. Signals are a Django-specific way of allowing certain senders to notify a set of receivers that some action has taken place. The methods within the `Signal` class, such as `connect`, `disconnect`, `send`, and `send_robust`, allow for the registration of callbacks (receivers) that should be called when the signal is emitted (sent).\n\n#### Relationship to the Issue\nThe issue description suggests enhancing the pre/post delete signals, which would inherently involve this `Signal` class since any signal, including delete signals, would go through this mechanism for sending and receiving signal notifications.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nGiven the issue, the intended behavior would involve modifying or extending the signal handling mechanism to include information about the origin of the deletion\u2014whether the deletion was initiated directly through a model instance or via a queryset. This could involve adjusting how signals are sent to include additional context about the deletion's origin.\n\n### Absence of `DeleteSignal` Class\nThe absence of a `DeleteSignal` class suggests that the deletion signals are not handled by a specialized signal class but rather by the generic mechanism provided by `Signal`. This implies modifications to deletion signaling would likely not involve creating or modifying a dedicated class but rather changing how existing deletion signals are handled or how they transmit information.\n\n### Analysis of `delete` Methods\nThe presence of multiple `delete` methods across various files indicates that deletion functionality in Django is widely utilized, including model instances (`django/db/models/base.py`) and querysets (`django/db/models/query.py`). \n\n#### Relationship to the Issue\nThe issue directly concerns the actions these methods perform. Providing additional context in the deletion signals likely requires modifications at the locations where these `delete` methods reside\u2014especially to distinguish between direct instance deletions and queryset-based deletions.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nThe intended behavior would probably involve modifying these `delete` methods to emit signals with additional data about the deletion origin. This could involve passing additional parameters to the `send` method of signals or somehow augmenting the signal mechanism to include this information.\n\n### Next Steps \nGiven the results and analysis, the following actions could provide additional context to address the issue fully:\n- Investigate how signals are emitted upon deletion within the specific `delete` methods identified. Specifically, look into the code of `delete` in `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/query.py` to understand the current mechanism for emitting delete signals.\n  - `search_method_in_file(\"delete\", \"django/db/models/base.py\")`\n  - `search_method_in_file(\"delete\", \"django/db/models/query.py\")`\n\n- Because the search for `queryset.delete` did not yield results, and knowing that deletion via querysets is common in Django, it would be helpful to directly inspect the `delete` method in the queryset class to see how deletion is handled there. This could clarify how queryset deletions could be enhanced to include origin information.\n  - `search_method_in_class(\"delete\", \"QuerySet\")`\n\nThese steps aim to directly pinpoint the deletion mechanisms within Django to enable modifications for transmitting origin information through delete signals."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

To address the issue, it should be modified to emit pre-delete and post-delete signals with extra context indicating the deletion's origin as a queryset operation. This modification must preserve the method's initial behavior of efficiently deleting multiple instances while providing the additional context needed for signal listeners to distinguish the source of the deletion."
