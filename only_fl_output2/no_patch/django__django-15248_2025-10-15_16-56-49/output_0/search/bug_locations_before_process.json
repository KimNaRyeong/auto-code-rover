        "intended_behavior": "This method should be extended to include an optional parameter or context that allows for specifying the deletion's origin. When emitting pre-delete or post-delete signals, this method should ensure that the signal's data includes whether the deletion was initiated directly through a model instance. Signal receivers can then use this context to understand the deletion's origin. The implementation must ensure this functionality does not break or change the existing API in a way that would require changes from end-users unless absolutely necessary. This means adding parameters with default values could be a preferred approach, maintaining backwards compatibility."

        "intended_behavior": "Similarly, this method needs to be adapted to include context information about the deletion's origin as coming from a queryset operation. Given that `QuerySet.delete()` can affect numerous records, including a way to specify and pass along this information to the delete signals is crucial. Modifications to this method must ensure that any signals sent out as part of the deletion process carry this additional context. As with model instance deletions, it's essential to implement these changes in a way that doesn't disrupt existing usages of the method."
