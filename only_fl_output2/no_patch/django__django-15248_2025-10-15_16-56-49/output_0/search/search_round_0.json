If it's deleted from a model.delete(), you know which instance initiated the delete and if it's from a queryset.delete() you know which queryset initiated the delete, with the models in that queryset. Using this you know if the instance is being deleted directly or because it's related to another instance.\n</issue>"

Search for classes related to signals and deletion handling. Since the issue mentions pre/post delete signals, finding the relevant classes can provide insight into where modifications might be needed.\n   - `search_class(\"Signal\")`\n   - `search_class(\"DeleteSignal\")`\n\n2. Search for methods related to object deletion and queryset deletion, as the issue differentiates between these two source types for a delete action. This can help understand how deletion is currently implemented and where to inject the new functionality.\n   - `search_method(\"delete\")`\n   - `search_method(\"queryset.delete\")`\n\n3. Search for any existing code that might already be attempting to track the source of delete actions. This helps to avoid duplicating efforts or conflicting implementations.\n   - `search_code(\"delete source\")`\n   - `search_code(\"origin of delete\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to map out the relevant parts of the codebase that deal with deletion and signal handling, which are directly related to the issue's description."
