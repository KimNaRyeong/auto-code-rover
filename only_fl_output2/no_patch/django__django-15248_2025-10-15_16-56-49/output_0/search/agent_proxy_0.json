Search for classes related to signals and deletion handling. Since the issue mentions pre/post delete signals, finding the relevant classes can provide insight into where modifications might be needed.\n   - `search_class(\"Signal\")`\n   - `search_class(\"DeleteSignal\")`\n\n2. Search for methods related to object deletion and queryset deletion, as the issue differentiates between these two source types for a delete action. This can help understand how deletion is currently implemented and where to inject the new functionality.\n   - `search_method(\"delete\")`\n   - `search_method(\"queryset.delete\")`\n\n3. Search for any existing code that might already be attempting to track the source of delete actions. This helps to avoid duplicating efforts or conflicting implementations.\n   - `search_code(\"delete source\")`\n   - `search_code(\"origin of delete\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to map out the relevant parts of the codebase that deal with deletion and signal handling, which are directly related to the issue's description."
