        "content": "Given the issue description, it seems like the problem is related to the implementation of the `sqf_list` function, which is expected to factor polynomials into squares-free factors correctly but is failing in specific cases. To adequately address the issue, we need to gather more context about the implementation of `sqf_list` and any related classes or functions that might be involved in its computation.\n\nTherefore, I would suggest the following API calls for gathering the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"sqf_list\")` - To find out in which files and classes the `sqf_list` function is implemented. This will provide a starting point.\n\n2. `search_code(\"sqf_list\")` - To find instances where `sqf_list` function is called or mentioned. This could give additional context on how `sqf_list` is used within the codebase, potentially leading to further clues on where the inconsistency might arise.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, these calls should provide a solid foundation to understand where the `sqf_list` function is located, how it's implemented, and how it interacts with other parts of the codebase."
