        "content": "To address the issue reported, it's important to gather more information about how parallel processing (`--jobs`) is handled in the code. Since the issue specifically mentions a discrepancy in the output when the number of jobs changes, we should focus on collecting context on the implementation of parallelism in pylint, notably in the processing or linting of modules and handling of configurations for parallel jobs. Below are some targeted API calls to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. Search for the main method or function that handles command-line argument parsing to see how the `--jobs` argument is processed:\n   - `search_method(\"parse_args\")`\n\n2. Search for the main linting function or method to understand how files are dispatched for linting:\n   - `search_method(\"lint_files\")`\n\n3. Since the issue mentions discrepancies in the linting output, finding the logging or output section of the code might offer insights on how results are aggregated or displayed from parallel processes:\n   - `search_method(\"display_results\")`\n\nThese API calls are designed to gather comprehensive context around the handling of parallel execution in pylint, which is at the core of the reported issue."
