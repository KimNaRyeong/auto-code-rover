        "content": "<issue>Add support for adding non-key columns to indexes\nDescription\n(last modified by Hannes Ljungberg)\nPostgres got support for the INCLUDE clause in CREATE INDEX. This can be used to add non-key columns to the index.\nCREATE INDEX idx\nON t1 ( col1 )\nINCLUDE ( col2 );\nThis allows for Index Only Scans on queries like:\nSELECT col1, col2 FROM t1 WHERE t1 = 'foo';\nMore info:\n\u200bhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createindex.html\n\u200bhttps://use-the-index-luke.com/blog/2019-04/include-columns-in-btree-indexes\n\u200bhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-index-only-scans.html\nThe idea is to add an additional kwarg to Index to support this:\nIndex(\nname='some-idx',\nfields=['headline'],\ninclude=['pub_date']\n)\nOne of the biggest possibilities of this feature is to add included columns to unique indexes and use them to perform Index Only Scans. This would require adding the same kwarg to UniqueConstraint. The implementation would be a lot like the condition kwargs to both Index and UniqueConstraint.\nAt the moment the only Django-supported database that can use this feature is Postgres but it's also supported by Microsoft SQL Server and IBM Db2 with the same syntax. Because of this I think it shouldn't be implemented as a postgres only feature but exposed on BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor to ease the adding of support when/if sqlite or mariadb/mysql get it.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we'll need to gather information on the `Index` and `UniqueConstraint` classes, their constructors, and how they're implemented, especially how the `fields` and `condition` kwargs are currently handled. Additionally, we need insight into `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` for modifying index creation to support the `INCLUDE` clause for non-key columns. Here are the API calls I propose:\n\n1. **Search for the `Index` class:**\n   - `search_class(\"Index\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `UniqueConstraint` class:**\n   - `search_class(\"UniqueConstraint\")`\n\n3. **Search for the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class:**\n   - `search_class(\"BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor\")`\n\n4. **Once we find the files for `Index` and `UniqueConstraint`, we should look into their constructors to understand current arguments handling:**\n   - Assuming `Index` is in `indexes.py` and `UniqueConstraint` is in `constraints.py`, the API calls would conceptually be something like:\n     - `search_method_in_file(\"__init__\", \"indexes.py\")`\n     - `search_method_in_file(\"__init__\", \"constraints.py\")`\n\n5. **We would also need to understand how `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` handles index creation:**\n   - If we find the method responsible in `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` through its class search, we should then search for a method like `add_index` or similar. The specific API call can't be generated without knowing the exact method name or the file first, but a conceptual call would be:\n     - `search_method_in_class(\"add_index\", \"BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor\")`\n\nThese calls will help gather the necessary context to create a patch that implements the additional `include` kwarg in both the `Index` and `UniqueConstraint` classes, along with modifying `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` to support the `INCLUDE` clause in index creation SQL statements."
