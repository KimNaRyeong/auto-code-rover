Given the need to accurately reproduce the reported issue with a standalone Python file `reproducer.py` and based on the instructions and code provided, please see below the revised version that is structured to specifically trigger and validate the TypeError scenario related to using boolean values with the `HuberRegressor` from `scikit-learn`. This updated script properly includes the function for printing the stack trace for completeness and debugging clarity.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
    from sklearn.linear_model import HuberRegressor

    # Generate semi-random data
    X, y, coef = make_regression(n_samples=200, n_features=2, noise=4.0, coef=True, random_state=0)
    X_bool = X > 0  # Convert features to boolean

    try:
        # Attempt to fit HuberRegressor with boolean X
        huber = HuberRegressor().fit(X_bool, y)
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("HuberRegressor.fit raised a TypeError with boolean X.") from e

    # If no exception was raised, print a success message
    print("No error encountered; the issue may be fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate failure due to the issue presence
    exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate success (no issue present)
```

This script includes a clear structure for setup, execution, and error handling pertaining to the scenario described. It initiates by converting numeric data to boolean, then attempts to fit the `HuberRegressor` model with this boolean data, which, based on the reported issue, is expected to raise a `TypeError`. The `print_stacktrace` function is called if such an exception is caught, offering a detailed traceback for debugging purposes. If the script encounters the error, it asserts failure, reinforcing the presence of the mentioned issue. Conversely, running successfully to completion without exceptions would suggest the issue is resolved.
