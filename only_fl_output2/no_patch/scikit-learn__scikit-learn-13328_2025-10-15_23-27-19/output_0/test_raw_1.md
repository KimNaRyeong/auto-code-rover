Given the context and the previous mix-up, let's ensure the standalone Python file `reproducer.py` targets specifically reproducing the issue described initially, with a correct setup to catch and assert the TypeError when fitting a `HuberRegressor` with boolean predictors. The script will be adjusted to follow the requirement closely and ensure proper error handling.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_huber_regressor_with_boolean_X():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
    from sklearn.linear_model import HuberRegressor

    # Generate semi-random data
    X, y, coef = make_regression(n_samples=200, n_features=2, noise=4.0, coef=True, random_state=0)
    X_bool = X > 0

    try:
        # Trying to fit HuberRegressor with boolean X
        huber = HuberRegressor().fit(X_bool, y)
        # If the code execution reaches this point without exception, the issue might be fixed or not present
        print("Success: HuberRegressor handled boolean X without error.")
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("HuberRegressor.fit failed with boolean X due to TypeError.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_huber_regressor_with_boolean_X()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        exit(1)
    exit(0)
```

This script is specifically designed to test the fitting of a `HuberRegressor` with boolean predictors, aiming to catch the `TypeError` described. If the process raises a `TypeError`, the script will print the stack trace using the provided function and then re-raise an `AssertionError`, indicating the issue is present. If the error does not occur, it indicates that the issue might have been resolved or is not present, and thus the script should exit with code 0, signaling success.
