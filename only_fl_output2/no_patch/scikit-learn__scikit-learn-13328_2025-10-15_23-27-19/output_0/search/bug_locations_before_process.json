        "intended_behavior": "Before the method processes the input X for fitting, there should be an additional check or conversion for boolean input arrays. If X is found to be of boolean dtype, it should be automatically converted to float to preserve compatibility with the optimization routines that fit eventually delegates to. This conversion ensures that the method can handle boolean predictors by transforming them into a numeric format that is expected by the subsequent processing steps, thus preventing the TypeError. This conversion step should be placed after the input validation checks (check_X_y) to ensure that all inputs are validated before any transformation. This behavior should also be documented in the method's docstring to inform users of the automatic type conversion."
