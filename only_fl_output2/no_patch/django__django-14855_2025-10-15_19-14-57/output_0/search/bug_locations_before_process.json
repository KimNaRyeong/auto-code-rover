        "intended_behavior": "The method should correctly generate URLs for readonly ForeignKey fields taking into account the admin site it is being called from, specifically by using the current_app parameter. The method already attempts to reverse url_name with args=[quote(remote_obj.pk)]. The fix involves modifying it to also include current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name (assuming self.model_admin is the correct reference path to the admin_site object within the context it's called). This change ensures that URLs generated by get_admin_url correctly reflect the current admin site, supporting custom admin site URLs (e.g., /custom-admin/... instead of default /admin/...). This preserves existing functionality for the default admin site while correctly supporting custom admin sites."
