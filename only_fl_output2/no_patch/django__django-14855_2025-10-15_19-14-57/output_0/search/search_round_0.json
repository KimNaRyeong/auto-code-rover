(See django.contrib.admin.options.ModelAdmin response_add as just one example)\nI have been able to correct this specific issue by replacing the above line with:\nurl = reverse(\nurl_name,\nargs=[quote(remote_obj.pk)],\ncurrent_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name\n)\nHowever, I don't know if there are any side effects and I have not yet run the full suite of tests on this. Mostly looking for feedback whether I'm on the right track.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gain sufficient context for resolving the mentioned issue, let's proceed with the following search API calls based on the classes, methods, and code snippets mentioned:\n\n1. Search for the `get_admin_url` method to understand where it's defined and its usage context. The issue description doesn't specify in which class it resides, so a general search is necessary.\n   - `search_method(\"get_admin_url\")`\n\n2. Search for the `ModelAdmin` class in the Django admin codebase to understand how the `response_add` method, which correctly handles the `current_app` parameter, is implemented. This will give insight into the proper usage of `current_app` in the admin site context.\n   - `search_class(\"ModelAdmin\")`\n\n3. Given the issue revolves around custom admin sites, we should also understand how customization of admin sites is handled in Django, especially focusing on the `AdminSite` class.\n   - `search_class(\"AdminSite\")`\n\n4. Since the issue description mentions modifying a line in the `django.contrib.admin.helpers` module, it would be useful to find the file path of this module to examine it directly for further context.\n   - `search_code(\"django.contrib.admin.helpers\")`\n\n5. Finally, to ensure we can safely make the change, investigating the use of the `current_app` parameter in similar contexts, such as `response_add` as mentioned, could provide a template for the fix.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"response_add\", \"ModelAdmin\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive overview of where and how the fix can be implemented without unintended consequences."
