Since the issue mentions that the problematic LaTeX code includes `equation*` environment wrapped in `$$`, which results in incorrect LaTeX syntax, we should focus on finding the related code that handles this part of the conversion process. Given the mentioned steps and the nature of the issue, the keywords and phrases that stand out include:\n- LaTeX output or conversion\n- `equation*` environment\n- nbconvert\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls to gather more context and narrow down the location of the bug in order to craft a patch:\n1. Search for occurrences of LaTeX related conversion or output code to see if there's a specific part of the codebase responsible for generating LaTeX equations.\n2. Given that `nbconvert` is a tool used for converting notebooks, we should look for classes or methods related to this tool within the codebase.\n\nAPI calls to make:\n- search_method(\"convert\")\n- search_code(\"equation*\")"
