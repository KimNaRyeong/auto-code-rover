Given the nature of the issue, which is related to the generation of LaTeX output, the occurrences of `convert` within the LaTeX printing context are particularly relevant. The `convert` methods in `sympy/printing/latex.py` are likely responsible for converting mathematical expressions into LaTeX code. This makes it a prime candidate for further investigation, as the issue revolves around the incorrect LaTeX wrapping of equations.\n\n2. The code snippets containing `equation*` are found in a significant number within `sympy/printing/latex.py` as well, which supports the hypothesis that this file is crucial for the issue at hand. The presence of `equation*` in this context suggests that this file contains logic for deciding how to format equations when converting to LaTeX. Given the issue's description, this is precisely where we would expect to find code responsible for erroneously wrapping `equation*` environments with `$$`, which leads to the LaTeX error.\n\nGiven these observations, the intended behavior of the relevant part of the code in `sympy/printing/latex.py` should be to correctly wrap mathematical expressions meant for display in LaTeX documents without creating syntax errors. Specifically, instead of sandwiching the `equation*` environment between `$$` (which indicates a switch to math mode in LaTeX, unnecessary and incorrect for `equation*` which should already be in math mode), it should simply use `$\\displaystyle ...$` for inline equations or retain the `equation*` environment without additional delimiters for block equations.\n\nTo resolve the issue, it's evident we should focus on how `sympy/printing/latex.py` handles the conversion of mathematical expressions to LaTeX code, particularly how it chooses to wrap these expressions. The bug likely resides in a misapplication of LaTeX delimiters, which leads to the described issue when notebooks are converted to LaTeX or PDF via nbconvert.\n\nThe next steps should involve detailed examination of how `equation*` environments are generated and wrapped in `sympy/printing/latex.py` to ensure they are correctly formatted for LaTeX output. This means either analyzing the `convert` method(s) in this file or looking directly at the portions of code handling LaTeX equation environments."

The specific adjustment needed to fix the issue is how it wraps the `equation*` environments. Currently, it seems to erroneously enclose these environments within `$$` delimiters, which is incorrect and led to the mentioned LaTeX error during the conversion process by `nbconvert`. The intended behavior should be to ensure that when LaTeX code is generated for these environments, it does not wrap `equation*` environments with `$$`, as they are already in a math environment. Instead, for inline expressions, use `$\\displaystyle ...$`, and for block expressions (like `equation*`), leave them without additional math mode delimiters. This change would correct the syntax error occurring during the LaTeX compilation and preserve the correct display of mathematical expressions in the generated documents. This adjustment respects LaTeX syntax rules and fixes the described issue without affecting other functionalities of the code.\n"
