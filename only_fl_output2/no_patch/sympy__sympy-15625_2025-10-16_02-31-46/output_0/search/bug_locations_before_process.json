        "intended_behavior": "The code in this location is responsible for converting mathematical expressions to LaTeX. The specific adjustment needed to fix the issue is how it wraps the `equation*` environments. Currently, it seems to erroneously enclose these environments within `$$` delimiters, which is incorrect and led to the mentioned LaTeX error during the conversion process by `nbconvert`. The intended behavior should be to ensure that when LaTeX code is generated for these environments, it does not wrap `equation*` environments with `$$`, as they are already in a math environment. Instead, for inline expressions, use `$\\displaystyle ...$`, and for block expressions (like `equation*`), leave them without additional math mode delimiters. This change would correct the syntax error occurring during the LaTeX compilation and preserve the correct display of mathematical expressions in the generated documents. This adjustment respects LaTeX syntax rules and fixes the described issue without affecting other functionalities of the code."
