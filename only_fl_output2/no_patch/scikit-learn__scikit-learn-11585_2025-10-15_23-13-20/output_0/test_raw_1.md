Please note that the previous test run seems to have encountered an environment setup issue related to the `scikit-learn` package not being correctly installed or built, rather than directly related to the test script provided. 

However, I will re-write a corrected version of a standalone Python script, ensuring it matches the original request more closely. Please ensure your environment has `scikit-learn` correctly installed before running the script. Here's a version that explicitly checks for the reported scaling issue in the `SparsePCA.transform()` method, and attempts to raise an `AssertionError` if the issue exists:

```python
# reproducer.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.decomposition import SparsePCA

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def get_data(count, seed):
    np.random.seed(seed)
    col1 = np.random.random(count)
    col2 = np.random.random(count)
    data = np.hstack([a[:, np.newaxis] for a in [
        col1 + .01*np.random.random(count),
        -col1 + .01*np.random.random(count),
        2*col1 + col2 + .01*np.random.random(count),
        col2 + .01*np.random.random(count),
    ]])
    return data

def reproduce_issue():
    train = get_data(1000, 1)
    test = get_data(10, 1)

    spca = SparsePCA(max_iter=20)
    spca.fit(train)

    results_train = spca.transform(train)
    results_test = spca.transform(test)

    scale_train = np.abs(results_train).max()
    scale_test = np.abs(results_test).max()

    # Check if scales are considerably different
    if scale_test > scale_train * 1.5:  # Allowing some difference but not too much
        raise AssertionError("Scaling issue detected: test data scale is significantly higher than train data.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
        print("Test passed: Issue not detected or it has been fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected exception occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
```

Please run this script in an environment where `scikit-learn` is correctly installed. This code aims to rigorously test for the scaling issue mentioned, and provide clear feedback.
