        "intended_behavior": "The `transform` method of the SparsePCA class needs to be adjusted to ensure that the scaling of transformation results does not depend on the number of rows (samples) in the input `X`. To accomplish this, there are two proposed solutions; either can be chosen based on further discussion about the design intentions and the potential impact on users:\n\n- **Solution (a)**: Introduce a new instance attribute (e.g., `.scale_factor_`) that is learned during the `fit` process. This scale factor would be used in the `transform` method to scale the results consistently across different input data sizes. This requires modifications in both the `fit` and `transform` methods. `fit` would compute this scale factor and save it, while `transform` would use this precomputed scale factor instead of calculating `s` as it currently does.\n\n- **Solution (b)**: Alter the calculation of `s` within the `transform` method from `.sum(axis=0)` to `.mean(axis=0)`. This change directly affects the `transform` method and aims to remove the dependency on the number of input examples, aligning with the issue's proposed fix. This solution is simpler and directly addresses the problem but may have different implications on the algorithm's performance and result interpretation. \n\nBoth solutions aim to preserve the existing functionality of the SparsePCA `transform` method while fixing the scaling issue. The decision on which path to take should consider the broader impact on existing users and the theoretical integrity of the SparsePCA algorithm."
