        "content": "<issue>SparsePCA incorrectly scales results in .transform()\n#### Description\nWhen using `SparsePCA`, the `transform()` method incorrectly scales the results based on the *number of rows* in the data matrix passed.\n#### Proposed Fix\nI am regrettably unable to do a pull request from where I sit. The issue is with this chunk of code, as of writing this at [line number 179 in sparse_pca.py](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/decomposition/sparse_pca.py#L179):\n```python\nU = ridge_regression(self.components_.T, X.T, ridge_alpha,\nsolver='cholesky')\ns = np.sqrt((U ** 2).sum(axis=0))\ns[s == 0] = 1\nU /= s\nreturn U\n```\nI honestly do not understand the details of the chosen implementation of SparsePCA. Depending on the objectives of the class, making use of the features as significant for unseen examples requires one of two modifications. Either (a) **learn** the scale factor `s` from the training data (i.e., make it an instance attribute like `.scale_factor_`), or (b) use `.mean(axis=0)` instead of `.sum(axis=0)` to remove the number-of-examples dependency.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```python\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import SparsePCA\nimport numpy as np\ndef get_data( count, seed ):\nnp.random.seed(seed)\ncol1 = np.random.random(count)\ncol2 = np.random.random(count)\ndata = np.hstack([ a[:,np.newaxis] for a in [\ncol1 + .01*np.random.random(count),\n-col1 + .01*np.random.random(count),\n2*col1 + col2 + .01*np.random.random(count),\ncol2 + .01*np.random.random(count),\n]])\nreturn data\ntrain = get_data(1000,1)\nspca = SparsePCA(max_iter=20)\nresults_train = spca.fit_transform( train )\ntest = get_data(10,1)\nresults_test = spca.transform( test )\nprint( \"Training statistics:\" )\nprint( \"  mean: %12.3f\" % results_train.mean() )\nprint( \"   max: %12.3f\" % results_train.max() )\nprint( \"   min: %12.3f\" % results_train.min() )\nprint( \"Testing statistics:\" )\nprint( \"  mean: %12.3f\" % results_test.mean() )\nprint( \"   max: %12.3f\" % results_test.max() )\nprint( \"   min: %12.3f\" % results_test.min() )\n```\nOutput:\n```\nTraining statistics:\nmean:       -0.009\nmax:        0.067\nmin:       -0.080\nTesting statistics:\nmean:       -0.107\nmax:        0.260\nmin:       -0.607\n```\n#### Expected Results\nThe test results min/max values are on the same scale as the training results.\n#### Actual Results\nThe test results min/max values are much larger than the training results, because fewer examples were used. It is trivial to repeat this process with various sizes of training and testing data to see the relationship.\n</issue>"

What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `transform` function in the `SparsePCA` class is designed to project input data `X` onto the sparse components identified by the SparsePCA algorithm. The specific code segment identified around line 179 does the following:\n\n- Checks if the model (`self`) has been fitted by ensuring `components_` attribute exists.\n- Validates the input data `X` using the `check_array` function.\n- Handles the deprecation warning for the `ridge_alpha` parameter if it's specified directly in the `transform` method.\n- Defaults to using the `ridge_alpha` value specified in the SparsePCA constructor if not provided as a method argument.\n- Performs ridge regression using `self.components_.T`, the transposed components, and the transposed input data `X.T`, along with the `ridge_alpha` value.\n- Calculates a scaling factor `s` as the square root of the sum of squares of the ridge regression result (`U`), across the features (axis=0).\n- Adjusts for zero values in `s` to prevent division by zero.\n- Divides `U` by `s` to normalize the transformed data.\n- Returns the normalized data `U`.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe bug is related to how the results of the `transform` method are scaled. The issue arises from the way the scaling factor `s` is computed\u2014specifically, it sums over the square of the results and then takes the square root, leading to a scaling that is dependent on the number of examples in the input data. The observed effect is that the scale of the transformed data varies with the number of rows in the input data, which is not desired.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior would be to ensure that the scaling of the transformed data is consistent, regardless of the number of input examples. This means that the scale factor `s` should ideally be based on a statistic that is not influenced by the size of the input data, thereby ensuring the transformed results maintain a consistent scale between training data (`fit_transform`) and unseen/test data (`transform`). \n\nThe issue description suggests two potential fixes:\n- (a) Learn the scale factor `s` from the training data and make it an instance attribute (e.g., `.scale_factor_`), so it's consistent across different transformations.\n- (b) Change the scaling computation from `.sum(axis=0)` to `.mean(axis=0)`, which inherently removes the dependency on the number of examples.\n\nTo resolve the issue, one could modify how `s` is computed or saved during the `fit` method and then apply it during `transform`, or adjust the calculation of `s` in `transform` to not be dependent on the number of input samples. Choosing between these two solutions would require a deeper understanding of SparsePCA's design intentions and the implications for its use cases."

To accomplish this, there are two proposed solutions; either can be chosen based on further discussion about the design intentions and the potential impact on users:\n\n- **Solution (a)**: Introduce a new instance attribute (e.g., `.scale_factor_`) that is learned during the `fit` process. This scale factor would be used in the `transform` method to scale the results consistently across different input data sizes. This requires modifications in both the `fit` and `transform` methods. `fit` would compute this scale factor and save it, while `transform` would use this precomputed scale factor instead of calculating `s` as it currently does.\n\n- **Solution (b)**: Alter the calculation of `s` within the `transform` method from `.sum(axis=0)` to `.mean(axis=0)`. This change directly affects the `transform` method and aims to remove the dependency on the number of input examples, aligning with the issue's proposed fix. This solution is simpler and directly addresses the problem but may have different implications on the algorithm's performance and result interpretation. \n\nBoth solutions aim to preserve the existing functionality of the SparsePCA `transform` method while fixing the scaling issue. The decision on which path to take should consider the broader impact on existing users and the theoretical integrity of the SparsePCA algorithm."
