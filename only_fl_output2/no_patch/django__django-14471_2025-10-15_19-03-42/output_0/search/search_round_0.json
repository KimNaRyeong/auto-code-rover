        "content": "<issue>Reject requests earlier if the CSRF cookie token has the wrong format\nDescription\n(last modified by Chris Jerdonek)\n(This issue is similar to #32795 but for the cookie token rather than for the non-cookie token.)\nI noticed in CsrfViewMiddleware.process_view() that if the CSRF cookie has the wrong format (i.e. wrong length or contains invalid characters), then the code will do a fair amount of unnecessary work. Specifically, the code will proceed inside _get_token() at \u200bthis line to use Python's secrets module twice to generate both a new token and a mask for the token. But this new token will only be used for the purposes of later calling _compare_masked_tokens() in a way that will be guaranteed to fail (since the cookie being used will be brand new and so won't match). And then it will call _compare_masked_tokens() with that value.\nInstead, if the CSRF cookie is found at that line to have the wrong format, the middleware could reject the request outright similar to how #32795 does it if the token has the wrong format (as well as similar to how the code currently handles a missing cookie in the \u200blines after). I think this will simplify CsrfViewMiddleware and make it easier to understand because it will eliminate a number of steps that aren't needed for security. In particular, one thing this will do is cut down on the number of places where _get_new_csrf_token() is called, which will make it clearer where a new value is really needed / used. Similar to #32795, it will also make troubleshooting easier because the rejection messages will be more specific.\nI think this could be implemented as follows. After #32795 is merged, \u200b_get_token() could be changed to allow InvalidTokenFormat to bubble up instead of handling it. Then the InvalidTokenFormat exception could be handled differently in the two places _get_token() is called: (1) In process_request(), it could be handled by calling _get_new_csrf_token() (_get_token()'s current behavior). (2) In process_view(), it could be handled similar to how #32795 handles it. Namely, reject the request using the InvalidTokenFormat's reason string.\n</issue>"

So, it's crucial to see the current handling in this method.\n3. **process_view method**: Specifically, this method is where the check should be improved to reject requests earlier.\n4. **The lines after handling a missing cookie**: To see the current handling for a missing cookie which may give hints on how to handle the wrong format case.\n5. **_compare_masked_tokens method**: Mentioned as part of the workflow that becomes unnecessary due to the flawed cookie handling.\n6. **Code invoking Python's secrets module**: Given it's mentioned in relation to token and mask generation, identifying where this occurs might be key.\n\nBased on these needs, the following API calls can provide the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"CsrfViewMiddleware\")`: To get an overview of the `CsrfViewMiddleware` class.\n2. `search_method(\"_get_token\")`: To find where `_get_token` is defined and used.\n3. `search_method(\"process_view\")`: To see the implementation of `process_view` in the context of `CsrfViewMiddleware`.\n4. `search_code(\"missing cookie\")`: To find how the code currently handles missing CSRF cookies, which might provide insight into how to similarly handle cookies with the wrong format.\n5. `search_method(\"_compare_masked_tokens\")`: To understand how and where this method is used.\n6. `search_code(\"secrets\")`: To see where Python's `secrets` module is used for token generation, as this is part of the flow being questioned.\n\nLet's proceed with these API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"CsrfViewMiddleware\")`\n2. `search_method(\"_get_token\")`\n3. `search_method(\"process_view\")`\n4. `search_code(\"missing cookie\")`\n5. `search_method(\"_compare_masked_tokens\")`\n6. `search_code(\"secrets\")`"
