This exception should be caught by the calling method to properly reject the request due to the invalid token format before unnecessary operations are performed. This approach avoids generating a new CSRF token that won't be used meaningfully, thereby reducing unnecessary overhead. The intended behavior should preserve CSRF protection while optimizing the request handling flow."

This behavior aligns with minimizing unnecessary processing for requests that are ultimately invalid due to CSRF token format issues. This optimized handling should ensure that the security principle of failing fast is adhered to, reducing the load on the system and simplifying debuggability for developers."
