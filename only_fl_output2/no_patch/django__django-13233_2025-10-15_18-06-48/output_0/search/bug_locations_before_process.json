        "intended_behavior": "The `contribute_to_class` method is designed to attach the field to the model class it belongs to, ensuring that `ImageField` is properly initialized and connected within the model's lifecycle. To resolve the issue, the method should ensure that the `model` attribute of the `ImageField` consistently points to the concrete model class it's associated with. This might involve revisiting how signals like `post_init` are connected or ensuring that any changes made around Django 3.2 do not inadvertently affect the ability to introspect the field-to-model relationship. This includes preserving existing functionality where `ImageField` contributes additional setup to the model class, like dimension fields updating after model instantiation. The fix should aim to reinstate predictable, direct access to the model via the `ImageField` in a manner akin to Django 3.1 and before, without disrupting the optimizations or bug fixes introduced in Django 3.2. The existing logic that attaches update hooks and validators should remain unaffected, ensuring that `ImageField` continues to operate as expected in various model contexts."
