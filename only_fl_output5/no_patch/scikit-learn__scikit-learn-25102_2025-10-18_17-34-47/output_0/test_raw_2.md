Given your requirements, here's a modified script that reproduces the issue as described, ensuring it matches the problem of dtype preservation in pandas DataFrame output from Scikit-learn transformers. This version of `reproducer.py` carefully checks the dtypes after transformation and will raise an `AssertionError` if the dtypes are not preserved as expected. Please remember, this script assumes the issue is present if the dtypes are not correctly preserved post-transformation, and exits with code 0 otherwise, indicating the issue has been resolved if future updates or configurations prevent the problem.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, chi2

    try:
        X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)
        X = X.astype({"petal width (cm)": np.float16, "petal length (cm)": np.float16})
        X["cat"] = y.astype("category")

        selector = SelectKBest(chi2, k=2)
        X_transformed = selector.fit_transform(X, y)

        # Assuming the transformed DataFrame is converted back to pandas DataFrame with correct column names
        X_transformed = pd.DataFrame(X_transformed, columns=[X.columns[i] for i in selector.get_support(indices=True)])
        dtypes_transformed = X_transformed.dtypes

        expected_dtypes = X.dtypes[selector.get_support()]
        
        # Verify that the expected dtypes are preserved
        if not all(dtypes_transformed == expected_dtypes):
            raise AssertionError(f"Dtypes after transformation do not match. Expected {expected_dtypes}, got {dtypes_transformed}")
        
        print("Dtypes are preserved. Issue is fixed.")
    
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Remember that the output assumes conversions are happening within a scope where `SelectKBest` and similar transformers could be adjusted to support dtype preservation, which is not currently supported out-of-the-box in Scikit-learn as of the last updates before my last training. The script checks for dtype preservation by comparing the expected dtypes with those of the transformed DataFrame, using an improvised approach to handle the transformed DataFrame as if `set_output` were already implemented to support dtype preservation.
