And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue described, I'll perform a sequence of search API calls that aim to find the location and context of the incorrect hint message within the Django codebase. Given the information in the issue, I'll start by searching for any uses or definitions related to `ForeignKey` and `ManyToManyField` which might be involved in displaying the erroneous hint. I'll also look for any validation or error message mechanisms that could be involved in generating the hint mentioned in the issue.\n\nThe steps I'll follow are:\n\n1. Search for the method or class that validates ManyToMany fields, especially where it checks or sets `through_fields`, as the issue happens when \"no through_fields have been set.\"\n2. Search for the specific error message text to find where it is defined or used.\n\nTherefore, the API calls could be:\n\n- `search_code(\"through_fields have been set\")`: This call aims to find any parts of the codebase that reference or deal directly with the logic around setting `through_fields` for m2m fields.\n- `search_code('use ForeignKey(\"%s\", symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\")')`: This call is meant to locate the exact place where the incorrect hint message is defined or used.\n\nThese calls should provide relevant code snippets or files that relate closely to the issue at hand, which will enable further analysis or direct us to the necessary part of the codebase to evaluate and eventually craft a patch."
