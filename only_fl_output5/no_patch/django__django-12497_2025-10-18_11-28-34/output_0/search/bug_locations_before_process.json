        "intended_behavior": "The method `_check_relationship_model` should correctly identify and handle the cases where an intermediary model of a many-to-many (m2m) relationship does not specify `through_fields` correctly, especially when more than two `ForeignKey` fields are involved. The specific changes to resolve the issue should include:\n\n- **Correcting the Hint Message:** The erroneous hint provided should be corrected to reflect accurate advice for configuring m2m relationships. Since the original hint incorrectly suggests using `ForeignKey` with `symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\"`, which are arguments relevant to `ManyToManyField`, the hint must be updated to guide towards the correct use of `ManyToManyField`. Specifically, it should advise on using `ManyToManyField` with the `through` argument to specify the intermediary model and potentially hint towards the `through_fields` argument if needing to explicitly state the fields on the intermediary model that form the two sides of the m2m relationship. Also, remove the outdated mention of `symmetrical=False`, since this is not a requirement for recursive relationships with an intermediary model to self in Django 3.0 and later.\n  \n- **Preservation of Existing Functionality:** The correction should ensure that all existing validations and error handling regarding m2m relationships and the use of intermediary models continue to function as intended. The fix is primarily focused on providing accurate documentation and guidance through error messages without altering the fundamental validation logic that ensures the correct configuration of m2m relationships.\n\nThis resolution approach addresses the misconception conveyed in the hint and aligns the advice with the current Django practices and API expectations, without introducing regressions to the existing validation mechanisms."
