And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n</issue>"

Here's a breakdown based on the guided questions:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   \n   The `_check_relationship_model` method within the `ManyToManyField` class likely performs validations on the intermediary model of a many-to-many (m2m) relationship. Specifically, these snippets are part of error handling that occurs when there are more than two `ForeignKey` fields in the intermediary model and no `through_fields` have been specified. The method prepares an error message suggesting a correction, but incorrectly advises using `ForeignKey` with parameters relevant to `ManyToManyField` (`symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\"`).\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   \n   The provided snippets directly contain the bug described in the issue. The bug is the hint suggesting to use `ForeignKey` with parameters that are actually applicable to `ManyToManyField`, not `ForeignKey`. Moreover, the mention of `symmetrical=False` being outdated for recursive relationships with intermediary models since Django 3.0 makes this hint misleading and technically incorrect.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   \n   The intended behavior would be to give a correct hint that is applicable to the context of the error. Since the issue involves many-to-many relationships and not the `ForeignKey` directly, the hint should likely guide the developer towards using `ManyToManyField` correctly with `through` and `through_fields` parameters if necessary, rather than suggesting modifications to `ForeignKey`. The outdated mention of `symmetrical=False` for recursive relationships needs to be removed or updated to reflect the current requirements since Django 3.0.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correction would involve updating the hint in these snippets to provide accurate guidance that matches the usage context (m2m relationships with an intermediary model) and reflects the current API and requirements in Django 3.0 and beyond."

The specific changes to resolve the issue should include:\n\n- **Correcting the Hint Message:** The erroneous hint provided should be corrected to reflect accurate advice for configuring m2m relationships. Since the original hint incorrectly suggests using `ForeignKey` with `symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\"`, which are arguments relevant to `ManyToManyField`, the hint must be updated to guide towards the correct use of `ManyToManyField`. Specifically, it should advise on using `ManyToManyField` with the `through` argument to specify the intermediary model and potentially hint towards the `through_fields` argument if needing to explicitly state the fields on the intermediary model that form the two sides of the m2m relationship. Also, remove the outdated mention of `symmetrical=False`, since this is not a requirement for recursive relationships with an intermediary model to self in Django 3.0 and later.\n  \n- **Preservation of Existing Functionality:** The correction should ensure that all existing validations and error handling regarding m2m relationships and the use of intermediary models continue to function as intended. The fix is primarily focused on providing accurate documentation and guidance through error messages without altering the fundamental validation logic that ensures the correct configuration of m2m relationships.\n\nThis resolution approach addresses the misconception conveyed in the hint and aligns the advice with the current Django practices and API expectations, without introducing regressions to the existing validation mechanisms."
