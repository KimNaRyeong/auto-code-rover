        "intended_behavior": "The `configure` method should be modified to check if all keys in `**options` are uppercase. If any key is not uppercase, the method should raise a `ValueError` with a clear message indicating that only uppercase letters are allowed for settings names. This change will ensure that the settings configuration adheres to Django's conventions and documentation. The existing functionality for configuring settings should be preserved, with the addition that it now validates the case of setting names."
