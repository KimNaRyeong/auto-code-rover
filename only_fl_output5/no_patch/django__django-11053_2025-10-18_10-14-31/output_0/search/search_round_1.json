        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. `configure` method in `LazySettings` class\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  - The `configure` method in `LazySettings` allows manually setting up the settings for a Django project, overriding default settings. It accepts a dictionary of settings as `**options`, applies them to a `UserSettingsHolder` instance, and sets this instance as the current settings.\n- **Relationship with the bug**\n  - The issue points out that the `configure` method allows non-uppercase settings to be set, which is contrary to Django's convention that only uppercase settings should be used. This method does not filter or validate the case of the setting names before setting them.\n- **Intended behavior**\n  - To adhere to Django's documentation and conventions, the method should validate that all keys in `**options` are uppercase. If any key is not in uppercase, it should either raise an error or ignore the setting.\n\n#### 2. `UserSettingsHolder` class\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  - This class acts as a container for settings. It provides methods to set, get, and delete settings attributes. The `__getattr__` method is used to retrieve the value of a setting.\n- **Relationship with the bug**\n  - Though not directly modifying any attributes to filter out non-uppercase names, the `UserSettingsHolder` class\u2019s `__getattr__` method does not perform any checks to ensure that only uppercase settings are accessible. However, the main issue lies in how settings are set, not in how they are retrieved.\n- **Intended behavior**\n  - While the `__getattr__` could potentially enforce the retrieval of only uppercase settings, the filtering logic should primarily be applied at the point of setting these attributes to ensure that the settings conform to Django's guidelines.\n\n#### Solution Proposal\nGiven the issue and the analysis of the relevant sections of the code:\n\n- Modify the `configure` method in `LazySettings` to check if all keys in the `**options` are uppercase. If not, raise a `ValueError` or similarly appropriate exception to indicate the misuse of the settings configuration.\n- Although it might seem like a solution to enforce uppercase settings retrieval in the `UserSettingsHolder.__getattr__` method, it would not prevent non-uppercase settings from being set and stored in the first place. Therefore, the validation should occur upon setting in the `configure` method to prevent any non-compliant settings from being accepted.\n\nThis solution aligns with the principle that it's best to catch and correct errors as early as possible in the code flow."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

If any key is not uppercase, the method should raise a `ValueError` with a clear message indicating that only uppercase letters are allowed for settings names. This change will ensure that the settings configuration adheres to Django's conventions and documentation. The existing functionality for configuring settings should be preserved, with the addition that it now validates the case of setting names.\n\n   **Why This Location**: \n   - The `configure` method is directly responsible for setting up custom settings passed by the user. By introducing a validation step here, we prevent non-compliant settings from being set, thus resolving the issue without changing how settings are retrieved or used elsewhere in Django. This approach ensures that the error is caught as early as possible and maintains the intended behavior of allowing only uppercase settings to be dynamically configured."
