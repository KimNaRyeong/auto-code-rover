        "intended_behavior": "Before attempting to access `str_number[0]`, the code should include a check to ensure that `str_number` is not empty or null. This change is to prevent the \"IndexError: string index out of range\" when `number` is `None` or leads to an empty string representation. The existing functionality, which includes detecting and formatting negative numbers as well as handling other string manipulations for formatting purposes, should be preserved. To resolve the issue, a conditional check can be introduced right before the current check for `-`. If `str_number` is empty or `None`, the method should handle this gracefully, either by returning a fallback string immediately (such as `\"0\"` or `\"\"`, depending on the desired behavior when `number` is `None`) or by skipping operations that assume `str_number` has a length of at least one."
