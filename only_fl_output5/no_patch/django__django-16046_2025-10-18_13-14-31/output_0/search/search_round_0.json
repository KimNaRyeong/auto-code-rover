        "content": "To address the issue described, it's important to understand where the code snippet `if str_number[0] == \"-\"` is used within the project. Since the description mentions this line is involved in formatting for the admin list_display, it can be assumed this might be part of a method responsible for custom formatting of number fields. However, without specific class or file names provided in the issue, the strategy will be broad initially and then narrowed down based on the results.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for occurrences of the problematic code snippet** across the entire codebase to identify files and methods it's used in:\n   - `search_code(\"if str_number[0] == \\\"-\\\"\")`\n\n2. **Search for a method related to admin list_display formatting**, as this functionality might contain the bug or be closely related to it. The method name might be something along the lines of `format_number` or `admin_format`, but without explicit names, we might initially look for common patterns in admin model customization involving number fields:\n   - `search_method(\"format_number\")`\n   - `search_method(\"list_display\")`"
