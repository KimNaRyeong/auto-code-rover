To address the requirements effectively and ensure a robust test, we will craft a standalone `reproducer.py` script to programmatically start a Django development server and perform a HEAD request to it. The core challenge here is simulating the scenario closely, considering Django's typical project layout and mechanics.

Given the restrictions of a standalone script, we'll be integrating Django dynamically. This approach also takes into account that the server should only process the HEAD request and verify if the response incorrectly includes a body when it should not, in alignment with RFC 2616, section 4.3.

```python
import os
import sys
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
from django.core.handlers.wsgi import WSGIHandler
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.urls import path
import threading
import http.client
import traceback

# Function to print the stack trace of exceptions.
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Minimal Django settings required for the project.
MINIMAL_SETTINGS = {
    'INSTALLED_APPS': [
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
    ],
    'DATABASES': {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    },
    'ROOT_URLCONF': '__main__',
    'SECRET_KEY': 'fake-key',
}

# Set up Django settings.
settings.configure(**MINIMAL_SETTINGS)
django.setup()

# Define a minimal view for the root URL.
def head_view(request):
    return HttpResponse('This response body should not be sent for a HEAD request.')

# URLs configuration.
urlpatterns = [path('', head_view)]

# Starting the Django development server in a separate thread.
def start_server():
    execute_from_command_line(['manage.py', 'runserver', '127.0.0.1:8000'])

server_thread = threading.Thread(target=start_server)
server_thread.daemon = True
server_thread.start()

# Give the server a moment to start.
import time
time.sleep(3)  # Adjust this value if the server takes longer to start.

# Function to perform the HEAD request.
def perform_head_request():
    try:
        conn = http.client.HTTPConnection('127.0.0.1', 8000)
        conn.request('HEAD', '/')
        response = conn.getresponse()
        
        # Checking if the response has a body, which should not happen for HEAD requests.
        body = response.read()
        assert body == b'', f"Expected no response body for HEAD request, but got: {body}"

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("The test passed successfully, no body was returned for a HEAD request.")
        sys.exit(0)

# Actually perform the HEAD request after server is assumed to be running.
perform_head_request()
```

This script programmatically:
- Configures minimal Django settings.
- Defines a URL and view to respond to HEAD and other requests.
- Starts the Django development server (`runserver`) in a background thread.
- Performs the HEAD request and checks the response.

Key considerations:
- The `time.sleep(3)` line is a simple way to wait for the server to start before the request. You might need to adjust this duration based on your environment.
- The script is intended for demonstration purposes and may require adjustments for use in production or more complex applications.
- This script directly exits with code 0 on success to fulfill the requirement described; however, it exits with code 1 upon encountering an assertion failure or exception, which deviates slightly from the usual behavior of not explicitly defining successful exit codes in Python scripts.
