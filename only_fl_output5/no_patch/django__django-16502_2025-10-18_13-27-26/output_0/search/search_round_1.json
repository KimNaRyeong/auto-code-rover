Given the information from the issue, we know that the response stripping for HEAD requests was previously modified and that the change impacted the `runserver` command's behavior. This points us towards looking into the server implementation used by Django's development server (`WSGIServer`) and possibly how the request-response cycle is managed in Django. \n\nBased on this, let's make the following API calls to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. Search for the class related to Django's development server, which might be `WSGIServer` or a similarly named class responsible for handling HTTP requests in the development environment.\n\n2. Since the issue likely involves how Django handles HTTP HEAD requests during the request-response cycle, search for methods that are specifically tailored to handle or dispatch HTTP methods. Such methods might include parsing or processing the request method and deciding the response behavior.\n\nThus, the API calls would be:\n\n- `search_class(\"WSGIServer\")`\n\n- `search_method(\"handle_request\")` \n\nThese calls aim to find the implementation of Django's development server and understand how it processes requests, particularly looking for where the decision to include or exclude the body in the response for HEAD requests might be made."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides us with a starting point for addressing the issue with HTTP HEAD requests in Django's development server (`runserver`).\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The provided code snippet introduces the `WSGIServer` class, which is a specialized version of `simple_server.WSGIServer` used by Django's development server. The class has a custom `request_queue_size` and an `__init__` method that allows for IPv6 configuration, and `allow_reuse_address` to be set, among other things. There's also a mention of a `handle_error` method, although its implementation details aren't given.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Since the `WSGIServer` is the core class that Django uses to serve HTTP requests during development (`runserver`), any issues with how HTTP HEAD requests are handled\u2014more specifically, the inclusion of a response body contrary to the RFC 2616 specification\u2014would likely involve this class or how it's set up to manage and respond to requests. The bug reports that `runserver` does not strip the body from HEAD requests as it should, indicating a potential oversight in the request handling or response construction process within this server infrastructure.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Ideally, the `WSGIServer` or another part of the request-handling code should ensure that for HEAD requests, no body is sent in the response. This would mean intercepting HEAD requests specifically and either not generating a body or ensuring it's not sent in the response. The intended behavior would comply with RFC 2616, section 4.3, which mandates that the response to a HEAD request should have an identical header to the GET request but without the body.\n\nGiven the absence of a `handle_request` method in the search results, it's clear that the method call either doesn't exist with the given name or is part of a larger request-handling infrastructure not directly accessible or identifiable with the search term used. \n\nConsidering this, it might be useful to look at how Django's development server processes requests in general and how it constructs responses. Specifically, we should investigate:\n- The request handling workflow in `WSGIServer` to see if there's a specific handling for different HTTP methods.\n- Methods related to sending or constructing responses, which might include conditional logic for including or excluding the body based on the request method.\n\nTherefore, the next steps in our investigation could include:\n- Searching for methods related to the request handling and response sending within `WSGIServer`.\n- Expanding the search to classes or functions that might be responsible for constructing responses, specifically focusing on those that could have logic related to HTTP methods.\n\nTo advance our investigation based on these insights, we should make the following API calls:\n- `search_method_in_class(\"handle_error\", \"WSGIServer\")`\n- `search_code_in_file(\"handle\", \"django/core/servers/basehttp.py\")`"

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

If so, it should ensure that the response body is not sent back to the client, even though the headers signify what would have been sent for an equivalent GET request. This behavior would directly address the compliance issue with RFC 2616, section 4.3 by modifying the response construction or sending process to exclude the body for HEAD requests. The existing functionality for handling other types of requests should remain unaffected."
