If so, it should ensure that the response body is not sent back to the client, even though the headers signify what would have been sent for an equivalent GET request. This behavior would directly address the compliance issue with RFC 2616, section 4.3 by modifying the response construction or sending process to exclude the body for HEAD requests. The existing functionality for handling other types of requests should remain unaffected."
