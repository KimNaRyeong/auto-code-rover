(In certain configurations this also results in \"Broken pipe\" error messages in runserver output, since compliant user agents expect to be able to terminate the connection after the headers are sent.)\nSTR:\n1) mkvirtualenv django-test\n2) pip install 'Django>1.10,<1.11'\n3) django-admin startproject django-test\n4) cd django-test\n5) ./manage.py runserver\n6) In another terminal, run curl -iX HEAD http://127.0.0.1:8000/\n7) Observe response from curl\nExpected:\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 07 Apr 2017 14:56:39 GMT\nServer: WSGIServer/0.2 CPython/3.4.5\nContent-Type: text/html\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\nActual:\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 07 Apr 2017 14:56:39 GMT\nServer: WSGIServer/0.2 CPython/3.4.5\nContent-Type: text/html\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\"><head>\n <meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\">\n <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"NONE,NOARCHIVE\"><title>Welcome to Django</title>\n...\nTested with Python 2.7.13 and 3.4.5.\nDoesn't reproduce under Django 1.9.13.\n"

In a real-world scenario or a more elaborate testing environment, it's recommended to handle the server lifecycle (start and stop) more gracefully.\n- The server is started on `127.0.0.1:8000`, which should be suitable for most test environments but may need adjustment based on your specific requirements or if the port is already in use.\n- The script uses `curl` to make HEAD requests. This requires `curl` to be installed in the environment where the script is executed.\n- There is a `time.sleep(2)` which is a simple way to wait for the server to start. Adjustments might be required based on the performance of the environment where this script is executed."
