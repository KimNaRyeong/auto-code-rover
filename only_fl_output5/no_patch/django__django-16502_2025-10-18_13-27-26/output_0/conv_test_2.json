(In certain configurations this also results in \"Broken pipe\" error messages in runserver output, since compliant user agents expect to be able to terminate the connection after the headers are sent.)\nSTR:\n1) mkvirtualenv django-test\n2) pip install 'Django>1.10,<1.11'\n3) django-admin startproject django-test\n4) cd django-test\n5) ./manage.py runserver\n6) In another terminal, run curl -iX HEAD http://127.0.0.1:8000/\n7) Observe response from curl\nExpected:\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 07 Apr 2017 14:56:39 GMT\nServer: WSGIServer/0.2 CPython/3.4.5\nContent-Type: text/html\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\nActual:\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 07 Apr 2017 14:56:39 GMT\nServer: WSGIServer/0.2 CPython/3.4.5\nContent-Type: text/html\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\"><head>\n <meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\">\n <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"NONE,NOARCHIVE\"><title>Welcome to Django</title>\n...\nTested with Python 2.7.13 and 3.4.5.\nDoesn't reproduce under Django 1.9.13.\n"

This time, to circumvent the problem of improperly configured settings, we will more directly configure Django before trying to start the server or make the HEAD request. This script will be more self-contained, correctly setting up the Django environment prior to execution.\n\nPlease note that due to the nature of running a server and making requests to it within the same script, this might not be as straightforward or clean as running separate processes, but it will be an attempt to keep everything within a single Python executable script.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler\nfrom subprocess import Popen, PIPE\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\n# Minimal Django settings\nSETTINGS = {\n    'INSTALLED_APPS': ['django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles'],\n    'DATABASES': {'default': {'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3', 'NAME': ':memory:'}},\n    'ROOT_URLCONF': __name__,\n    'SECRET_KEY': 'fake-key',\n}\n\n# Minimal view to respond to HEAD requests\ndef simple_view(request):\n    from django.http import HttpResponse\n    return HttpResponse('Hello, World!')\n\n# Minimal URLConf\nfrom django.urls import path\nurlpatterns = [\n    path('', simple_view),\n]\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        # Setup\n        from django.conf import settings\n        settings.configure(**SETTINGS)\n        import django\n        django.setup()\n\n        from django.core.management.commands.runserver import Command as runserver\n        from django.core.handlers.wsgi import WSGIHandler\n\n        # Start the server in a new thread\n        def start_server():\n            command = runserver()\n            command.run_from_argv(['manage.py', 'runserver', '8000'])\n\n        server_thread = threading.Thread(target=start_server)\n        server_thread.setDaemon(True)\n        server_thread.start()\n\n        # Allow server to initialize\n        import time\n        time.sleep(2)\n\n        # Issue HEAD request\n        process = Popen(['curl', '-I', 'http://127.0.0.1:8000'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)\n        stdout, stderr = process.communicate()\n\n        assert b'<html' not in stdout, \"server responded with HTML content to a HEAD request\"\n\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)\n    else:\n        print(\"HEAD request was handled according to the specification.\")\n        exit(0)\n```\n\nThis script tries to internally configure a minimal Django application, run the server, and make a HEAD request to it. The specific limitations or environment-related issues (like network ports or Django's async server startup behavior) might still cause the script to behave unexpectedly. Adjustments based on your actual environment (e.g., wait times, Django configurations) might be required.\n\n**Important**: This script directly integrates Django settings and URL configurations, partially by-passing the typical Django project layout. Also, the success of this script heavily depends on the environment's readiness to start a Django application and the availability of system resources like the network port."
