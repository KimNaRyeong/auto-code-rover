Given the issues encountered with the initial approach, let's adjust the methodology for reproducing the issue within a standalone Python script. This time, to circumvent the problem of improperly configured settings, we will more directly configure Django before trying to start the server or make the HEAD request. This script will be more self-contained, correctly setting up the Django environment prior to execution.

Please note that due to the nature of running a server and making requests to it within the same script, this might not be as straightforward or clean as running separate processes, but it will be an attempt to keep everything within a single Python executable script.

```python
import os
import sys
import threading
from http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Minimal Django settings
SETTINGS = {
    'INSTALLED_APPS': ['django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions', 'django.contrib.messages', 'django.contrib.staticfiles'],
    'DATABASES': {'default': {'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3', 'NAME': ':memory:'}},
    'ROOT_URLCONF': __name__,
    'SECRET_KEY': 'fake-key',
}

# Minimal view to respond to HEAD requests
def simple_view(request):
    from django.http import HttpResponse
    return HttpResponse('Hello, World!')

# Minimal URLConf
from django.urls import path
urlpatterns = [
    path('', simple_view),
]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        # Setup
        from django.conf import settings
        settings.configure(**SETTINGS)
        import django
        django.setup()

        from django.core.management.commands.runserver import Command as runserver
        from django.core.handlers.wsgi import WSGIHandler

        # Start the server in a new thread
        def start_server():
            command = runserver()
            command.run_from_argv(['manage.py', 'runserver', '8000'])

        server_thread = threading.Thread(target=start_server)
        server_thread.setDaemon(True)
        server_thread.start()

        # Allow server to initialize
        import time
        time.sleep(2)

        # Issue HEAD request
        process = Popen(['curl', '-I', 'http://127.0.0.1:8000'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
        stdout, stderr = process.communicate()

        assert b'<html' not in stdout, "server responded with HTML content to a HEAD request"

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    else:
        print("HEAD request was handled according to the specification.")
        exit(0)
```

This script tries to internally configure a minimal Django application, run the server, and make a HEAD request to it. The specific limitations or environment-related issues (like network ports or Django's async server startup behavior) might still cause the script to behave unexpectedly. Adjustments based on your actual environment (e.g., wait times, Django configurations) might be required.

**Important**: This script directly integrates Django settings and URL configurations, partially by-passing the typical Django project layout. Also, the success of this script heavily depends on the environment's readiness to start a Django application and the availability of system resources like the network port.
