Below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue and verify the compliance or non-compliance based on the reported problem with Django handling HTTP HEAD requests improperly as of versions after 1.10 and before 1.11. 

The script assumes Django is installed in the environment it is running in, and would work correctly if Django's version is between 1.10 and 1.11 as specified in your description. For the versions that have fixed this issue, or versions before the introduction of this issue, the script would exit with code 0 successfully without raising an `AssertionError`. In the event the issue is present, it would print a detailed stack trace.

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_runserver_head_request():
    # Start Django runserver as a subprocess
    import django
    from django.core.management import call_command
    from threading import Thread
    
    def start_runserver():
        django.setup()
        call_command('runserver', '127.0.0.1:8000')
        
    t = Thread(target=start_runserver)
    t.daemon = True
    t.start()

    # Allow server to start
    import time
    time.sleep(2)
    
    # Making a HEAD request to the running server
    response = subprocess.check_output(['curl', '-i', '-X', 'HEAD', 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/'], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT).decode('utf-8')
    
    # Check for response body presence
    if "<!DOCTYPE html>" in response or "<html" in response:
        raise AssertionError("Response body was not stripped for HEAD request")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_runserver_head_request()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("HEAD request compliance check passed successfully.")
        sys.exit(0)
```

**Important Notes:**
- This script uses a background thread to start the Django development server (`runserver`). In a real-world scenario or a more elaborate testing environment, it's recommended to handle the server lifecycle (start and stop) more gracefully.
- The server is started on `127.0.0.1:8000`, which should be suitable for most test environments but may need adjustment based on your specific requirements or if the port is already in use.
- The script uses `curl` to make HEAD requests. This requires `curl` to be installed in the environment where the script is executed.
- There is a `time.sleep(2)` which is a simple way to wait for the server to start. Adjustments might be required based on the performance of the environment where this script is executed.
