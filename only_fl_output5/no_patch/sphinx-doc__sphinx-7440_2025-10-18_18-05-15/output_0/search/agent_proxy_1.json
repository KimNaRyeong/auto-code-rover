Since the attempt to directly access and validate the content of the `doc/glossary.rst` file resulted in failures due to the file not being found, it's clear that the specific bug locations cannot be pinpointed without the correct file path or confirmation of its existence within the codebase. Therefore, based on the information provided and the unsuccessful API call results, it's not possible to accurately identify:\n   - Buggy files\n   - Buggy classes\n   - Buggy methods\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\nWithout direct access to the mentioned `doc/glossary.rst` file or the actual content causing the reported Sphinx compilation warning, we can hypothesize the intended behavior necessary to resolve the reported issue:\n\n- **Normalization of Term Case Sensitivity in Glossary Definitions**: The glossary should handle terms in a case-insensitive manner while preserving the case for display purposes. This means that irrespective of how a term is capitalized in its definition (`MySQL` versus `mysql`), the glossary processing logic should consider them the same term to avoid duplicate definition warnings. However, the display name should follow the first occurrence or a predefined naming convention that aligns with the project's documentation standards.\n\n- **Deduplication Logic**: It's necessary to implement or refine deduplication logic in the documentation or build process to identify and flag potential duplicate entries under varying cases for review or automatic adjustment. For 'mysql', this could involve a preprocessing step before documentation build that merges or resolves duplicate terms, taking into account case sensitivities.\n\nSince we could not directly identify the file or locations within the codebase, the next best step would involve manually reviewing the project structure for `doc/glossary.rst` or equivalent documentation files, and then applying the intended behavior concepts once the correct locations are determined."
