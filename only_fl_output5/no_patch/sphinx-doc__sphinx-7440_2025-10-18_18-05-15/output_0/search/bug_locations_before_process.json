The file should include a configuration that either:\n   - Automatically treats glossary terms in a case-insensitive manner, ensuring 'MySQL' and 'mysql' are considered the same term, or\n   - Provides a clear specification or warning mechanism for when similarly named (but differently cased) terms are encountered, allowing for manual consolidation or review.\n\nAdditionally, while the direct modification might not occur in the specific files within the `sphinx/` subdirectories, developers should review Sphinx documentation and extension capabilities to identify if any settings or flags can be leveraged within `conf.py` to prescribe the desired behavior regarding term case sensitivity and duplicate handling.\n\nImplementing this behavior will require:\n- Ensuring any Sphinx or third-party extensions used by the project are configured to support this normalized term handling.\n- Verifying that this change does not negatively impact other parts of the documentation where case sensitivity may be intentional or required.\n\nThis approach maintains existing functionality while addressing the bug related to glossary term case sensitivity."
