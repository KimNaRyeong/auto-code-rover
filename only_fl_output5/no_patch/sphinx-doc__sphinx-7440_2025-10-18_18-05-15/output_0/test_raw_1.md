Let's revise the script to address the exit code 1 issue observed previously. The earlier script attempts to clone the phpMyAdmin repository into a directory that may already exist if the script is executed more than once, hence causing a `CalledProcessError`.

The improved script will check if the `phpmyadmin` directory exists before attempting to clone it, and if so, it will skip the cloning process. This involves a minor tweak in the logic to ensure the script can run multiple times without error due to the repository directory already existing.

Additionally, to better capture and evaluate the output from the `make html` command for detecting the specific issue regarding glossary terms with different cases, the script will carefully inspect both standard output and standard error streams.

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_glossary_case_sensitivity():
    # Check if the repository already exists to avoid cloning it again
    if not os.path.exists('phpmyadmin'):
        # Clone the phpMyAdmin repository
        subprocess.run(["git", "clone", "--depth", "1", "https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin.git"], check=True)

    # Change working directory to doc inside the phpMyAdmin repository
    os.chdir("phpmyadmin/doc")

    # Install Sphinx if not already installed
    subprocess.run(["pip", "install", "-q", "Sphinx"], check=True)

    # Attempt to build the HTML documentation, capture the output specifically
    process = subprocess.run(["make", "html"], capture_output=True, text=True)

    # Check process output for the specific warning about duplicate term descriptions
    error_msg = "duplicate term description of mysql, other instance in glossary"
    if error_msg in process.stdout.lower() or error_msg in process.stderr.lower():
        raise AssertionError("Duplicate glossary term with different case detected.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_glossary_case_sensitivity()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate the presence of the issue
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 due to unexpected error
    else:
        print("No issues detected.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed or not present
```

This revised script should be more resilient to the issue of retrying in an environment where the clone has been done previously, and it addresses the problem with more precision by inspecting both the standard output and error streams for the specific error message related to glossary term duplication.
