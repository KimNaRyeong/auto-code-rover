        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue with `randMatrix` failing to generate symmetric sparse matrices correctly, we'll need to investigate the implementation of the `randMatrix` method, especially how it handles the `symmetric` and `percent` parameters. Therefore, we will search for the `randMatrix` method, and since it's likely part of the `sympy.matrices` module as indicated in the issue, we will start there. If the method implementation involves specific helper methods or is located in classes dedicated to matrix operations in SymPy, it would be essential to check those as well.\n\nLet's plan to execute the following searches to understand how `randMatrix` is implemented and how it attempts to generate symmetric matrices, taking into account the `percent` parameter:\n\n1. Search for the `randMatrix` method in the entire codebase to find where it's defined.\n2. Once we identify the file and possibly the class it belongs to, we may need to look into how the method processes its arguments to generate matrices, with a focus on handling symmetry and sparsity.\n\nHence, the API calls we'll start with are:\n\n- `search_method(\"randMatrix\")`"
