        "intended_behavior": "The code within the `randMatrix` function should ensure that when generating a symmetric matrix (`symmetric=True`), the application of the `percent` parameter to control sparsity preserves the symmetry. This means two main logic adjustments are required:\n\n1. **Symmetry Preservation during Sparsification**: The method of applying sparsity, which directly sets the first `z` elements of the flattened matrix representation to zero and then shuffles, needs to consider symmetry. Rather than indiscriminately setting `z` elements of `m._mat` to zero, we must ensure that if an element `m[i, j]` is chosen to be set to zero for sparsification, its symmetrical counterpart `m[j, i]` (since the matrix is symmetric) is also set to zero. \n\n2. **Shuffling with Symmetry Preservation**: After selecting elements to be zero (based on `percent`), the shuffling operation that randomizes the positions of zero and non-zero elements across the matrix should be rethought to preserve the symmetry. This might involve a smarter selection process of which elements to set to zero (ensuring pairs are chosen) or adjusting the shuffling algorithm to shuffle pairs of symmetrical elements together."
