Certainly! Below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` intended to automate the process of setting up a minimal Sphinx project to reproduce the issue described. The script checks for the presence of a backslash before the underscore in the attribute `hello_` when using `sphinx.ext.autodoc` and `sphinx.ext.napoleon`. It raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, indicating that the bug still exists, and prints a detailed stack trace of where the assertion failed. If the issue is fixed, it simply exits with code 0.

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_project():
    # Setting up minimal Sphinx documentation project
    subprocess.run(["sphinx-quickstart", "--quiet", "--project", "Test Project", "--author", "Test Author", "--release", "0.1", "--makefile", "n"], check=True)
    with open("conf.py", "a") as conf_file:
        conf_file.write("\nextensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'sphinx.ext.napoleon']\n")

    # Creating a Python module with documented class
    with open("a.py", "w") as module_file:
        module_file.write(
            """

    \"""
    Attributes
    ----------
    hello_: int
        hi

    pass
"""
        )

    with open("index.rst", "w") as index_file:
        index_file.write(
            """
.. autoclass:: a.A
"""
        )

def build_docs():
    # Building the documentation
    env = os.environ.copy()
    env['PYTHONPATH'] = '.'
    subprocess.run(["make", "html"], env=env, check=True)

def check_issue():
    # Checking for issue in generated file
    with open("_build/html/index.html", "r") as html_file:
        content = html_file.read()
        assert "hello\\_" not in content, "Unexpected escaped underscore in attribute name."

def main():
    try:
        setup_sphinx_project()
        build_docs()
        check_issue()
        print("Issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script performs the following actions:

1. Uses `sphinx-quickstart` to generate a minimal Sphinx project with necessary configurations.
2. Creates a Python module `a.py` containing a class with a documented attribute `hello_`.
3. Configures `index.rst` to include the `a.A` class.
4. Builds the Sphinx documentation with the `make html` command.
5. Checks the output in `_build/html/index.html` for the incorrect escaping of the underscore in `hello_`.
6. Raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, along with a detailed stack trace for debugging purposes.

Please make sure that Sphinx and its related extensions are properly installed in your environment before running this script.
