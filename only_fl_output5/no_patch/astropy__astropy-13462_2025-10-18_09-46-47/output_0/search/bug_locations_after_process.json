        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, `two_sum` must ensure that its results are symmetric for any order of inputs, even for extreme floating-point values. This means carefully handling cases that could lead to numerical instability, such as overflow, underflow, or division by zero scenarios, ensuring that `two_sum(a, b)` and `two_sum(b, a)` produce the same sum and error parts. It may be necessary to introduce special handling for corner cases identified by the failing test, ensuring the method can gracefully handle very large or very small floating-point numbers without returning `NaN`. This special handling must preserve the method's existing functionality and its ability to accurately sum floating-point numbers while minimizing error, as intended."
