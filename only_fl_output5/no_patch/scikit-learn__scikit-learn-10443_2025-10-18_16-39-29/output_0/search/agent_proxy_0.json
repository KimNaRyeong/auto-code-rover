This will give us a better understanding of where the problem might be originating from. To do this, we can start with the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"TfidfVectorizer\")`: This will help locate the `TfidfVectorizer` class within the scikit-learn project.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"TfidfVectorizer\")`: Since the issue is related to the output of the `fit` or `fit_transform` method, this will provide insight into how the `fit` method is implemented for the `TfidfVectorizer`.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"fit_transform\", \"TfidfVectorizer\")`: This will help understand the implementation of `fit_transform`, which seems to be directly related to the issue.\n4. `search_code(\"dtype=np.float64\")`: To check if there's a hardcoded dtype as float64 in the project that might be causing this issue."
