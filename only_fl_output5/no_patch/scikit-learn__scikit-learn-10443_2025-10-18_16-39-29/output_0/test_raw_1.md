Certainly! Below is the `reproducer.py` script incorporating the function to print the stack trace more efficiently. This script is designed to test if the `TfidfVectorizer` from the `scikit-learn` library correctly respects the `dtype` argument. The correct behavior is checked by an assertion that will trigger an error with a stack trace if the actual output dtype does not match the expected `np.float32`.

```python
# reproducer.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    # Instantiate TfidfVectorizer with dtype=np.float32
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(dtype=np.float32)
    # Fit and transform a simple text
    tfidf_result = vectorizer.fit_transform(["Help I have a bug"])
    # Assert the resulting dtype is float32 as expected
    assert tfidf_result.dtype == np.float32, f"Expected dtype('float32'), got {tfidf_result.dtype}"
    # If everything is as expected, print a success message
    print("Success: The dtype argument is respected, and the output is float32.")
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 if the issue is present
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 if there is an unexpected error

# Exiting with code 0 if the issue is fixed
exit(0)
```

This script contains all necessary parts to reproduce the expected issue, capture any assertion errors, print detailed stack traces for debugging, and exit with the appropriate status code.
