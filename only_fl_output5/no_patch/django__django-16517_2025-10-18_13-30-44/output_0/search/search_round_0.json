        "content": "To get the necessary context to resolve the issue, we need to analyze several parts of the Django project mentioned in the bug report. Let's break down what we need based on the provided information:\n\n1. The issue mentions a problem with the URL generation for views in the Django admin documentation, particularly with mixed-case view/template names. The problem seems to occur when clicking on a link in the documentation that should lead to a detailed view of a class-based view.\n\n2. It's specifically mentioned that the issue might be related to the `_get_view_func` method. This hints that we should look into how this method processes the view name.\n\nBased on this, we need to gather context from the `django.contrib.admindocs.views.py` file, especially around the `_get_view_func` method and how class-based views are handled.\n\nLet's craft our API calls:\n\n1. Since the file `views.py` within `django/contrib/admindocs` is mentioned, we should first get the code around the mentioned line to understand the context better. This will help us see how views and templates are handled in this part of the Django admin documentation system.\n\n2. We need to investigate the `_get_view_func` method in the `views.py` file to understand how it interprets the view name:\n\n```python\nget_code_around_line(\"django/contrib/admindocs/views.py\", 168, 10)\nsearch_method_in_file(\"_get_view_func\", \"django/contrib/admindocs/views.py\")\n```\n\nThese API calls aim to provide enough context around the specified line number and the method that might be causing the issue to further investigate and resolve the problem."
