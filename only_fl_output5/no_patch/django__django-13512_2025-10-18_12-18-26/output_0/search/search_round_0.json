        "content": "To address the issue of Unicode characters not displaying properly in JSONFields within Django admin, especially when dealing with non-ASCII characters like Chinese, we need to gather more context on how JSONFields are handled in the Django project. Based on the issue description, emphasizing on `json.dumps` usage and the manipulation of JSONFields within Django admin, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n1. **Search for JSONField related classes**: Given that the issue revolves around JSONFields, it's likely that Django or the mentioned `django-mysql` package has a specific class for handling JSONFields. We can start by searching for a `JSONField` class in the codebase.\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"JSONField\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Search for admin-related methods or classes**: The issue description points towards the editing of a JsonField within Django admin, implying that there might be a class or method specifically for rendering or editing these fields in the admin interface. We should search for admin classes or methods that could be handling JSONFields.\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"Admin\")\n    ```\n\n3. **Search for json.dumps usage**: Since the issue is specifically related to the way `json.dumps` handles Chinese characters (using ASCII encoding by default), searching for `json.dumps` calls within files that handle JSONFields could provide insight into where the encoding issue might be occurring.\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"json.dumps\")\n    ```\n\nThese API calls aim to gather context on the handling of JSONFields and their representation within the Django admin area, as well as how `json.dumps` is used in relation to these fields. This information will be pivotal in devising a solution to properly display Unicode characters."
