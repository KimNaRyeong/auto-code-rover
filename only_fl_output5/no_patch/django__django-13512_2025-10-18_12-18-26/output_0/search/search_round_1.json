        "content": "To address the issue of Unicode characters not displaying properly in JSONFields within Django admin, especially when dealing with non-ASCII characters like Chinese, we need to gather more context on how JSONFields are handled in the Django project. Based on the issue description, emphasizing on `json.dumps` usage and the manipulation of JSONFields within Django admin, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n1. **Search for JSONField related classes**: Given that the issue revolves around JSONFields, it's likely that Django or the mentioned `django-mysql` package has a specific class for handling JSONFields. We can start by searching for a `JSONField` class in the codebase.\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"JSONField\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Search for admin-related methods or classes**: The issue description points towards the editing of a JsonField within Django admin, implying that there might be a class or method specifically for rendering or editing these fields in the admin interface. We should search for admin classes or methods that could be handling JSONFields.\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"Admin\")\n    ```\n\n3. **Search for json.dumps usage**: Since the issue is specifically related to the way `json.dumps` handles Chinese characters (using ASCII encoding by default), searching for `json.dumps` calls within files that handle JSONFields could provide insight into where the encoding issue might be occurring.\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"json.dumps\")\n    ```\n\nThese API calls aim to gather context on the handling of JSONFields and their representation within the Django admin area, as well as how `json.dumps` is used in relation to these fields. This information will be pivotal in devising a solution to properly display Unicode characters."

        "content": "Analyzing the results we have so far, we can deduce the following:\n\n### Classes Named `JSONField`\n- The presence of `JSONField` in different parts of Django suggests that we're dealing with a feature that crosses from forms to model fields, and is also extended to handle PostgreSQL-specific JSONB fields. This indicates a rich handling of JSON data within the framework.\n- **Relation to the bug**: The issue is likely related to how `JSONField` data is serialized or deserialized, particularly because the problem described involves encoding and the representation of characters in the Django admin. Both model and form fields might play a part in this, depending on where the serialization/deserialization issue is happening.\n- **Intended behavior**: Ideally, when Chinese characters (or any non-ASCII text) are put into a JSONField, they should be displayed as is (\"\u4e2d\u56fd\" instead of \"\\u4e2d\\u56fd\") in the Django admin. This might require ensuring that `json.dumps` is called with the correct arguments to prevent ASCII encoding of Unicode data.\n\n### Use of `json.dumps`\n- The widespread use of `json.dumps` across different Django components (from HTTP responses to admin interfaces) underscores its central role in serializing data to JSON. This includes handling form field values and preparing data for the admin interface.\n- **Relation to the bug**: The core of the issue is with the way `json.dumps` encodes non-ASCII characters by default, leading to the display issue within the admin for JSONFields containing Unicode data. Instances in `fields.json.py` or `admin/widgets.py` would be critical areas to inspect given that these modules likely interact directly with JSONField data as it's prepared for display or storage.\n- **Intended behavior**: When `json.dumps` is used within the context of handling `JSONField` data for the admin interface, it should ensure Unicode characters are preserved in their original form. This means potentially using the `ensure_ascii=False` argument with `json.dumps` calls to avoid conversion to ASCII escape sequences.\n\n### Next Steps for Context Gathering\nGiven the analysis, it's necessary to dig deeper into specific areas where the problem may be rooted, particularly the handling of `JSONField` in model fields, form fields, and the admin interface, as well as the exact usage of `json.dumps` in these contexts.\n\n1. **`JSONField` in `django/db/models/fields/json.py`**:\n   - Checking how `JSONField` is defined in models might reveal custom serialization or validation that could affect how data is saved or displayed.\n   - I will perform:\n     ```python\n     search_class_in_file(\"JSONField\", \"django/db/models/fields/json.py\")\n     ```\n\n2. **`json.dumps` in `django/contrib/admin/widgets.py`**:\n   - Looking at the use of `json.dumps` in admin widgets could provide insights into how JSONField data is prepared for display in the admin.\n   - I will perform:\n     ```python\n     search_code_in_file(\"json.dumps\", \"django/contrib/admin/widgets.py\")\n     ```\n\nThese focused searches are expected to provide the necessary context for understanding the bug's root cause and identifying possible places where the handling of `json.dumps` might need adjustment to support non-ASCII characters better."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This might involve modifying serialization logic to include `json.dumps` with `ensure_ascii=False`. This change must be done in a way that does not interfere with the existing functionality of storing and retrieving JSON data, including compatibility with databases and the Django ORM's expectations.\n\n**Bug Location 2**: \n   - **File**: `django/contrib/admin/widgets.py`\n   - **Intended Behavior**: In any method or function within this file where `json.dumps` is used to prepare `JSONField` data for display in the admin interface, the function call should be modified to use `json.dumps(ensure_ascii=False)`. This ensures that Unicode characters are correctly displayed in their original form within the Django admin. The rest of the admin interface's functionality, including any validation, storage, and retrieval of `JSONField` data, should remain unaffected by this change."
