This might involve modifying serialization logic to include `json.dumps` with `ensure_ascii=False`. This change must be done in a way that does not interfere with the existing functionality of storing and retrieving JSON data, including compatibility with databases and the Django ORM's expectations."

This ensures that Unicode characters are correctly displayed in their original form within the Django admin. The rest of the admin interface's functionality, including any validation, storage, and retrieval of `JSONField` data, should remain unaffected by this change."
