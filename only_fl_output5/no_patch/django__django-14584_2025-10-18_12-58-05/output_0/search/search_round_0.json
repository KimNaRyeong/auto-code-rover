        "content": "To gather the necessary code context for resolving the issue regarding the inclusion of the database alias in `django.db.backends` logging output, I will invoke the following search API calls:\n\n1. Search for the class that might be responsible for logging in the Django database backend to understand how the logging is currently implemented. We know that Django uses base classes for its database backends, so it's plausible that the logging setup or method that needs modification is in one of those base classes.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"BaseDatabaseWrapper\")\n```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that including the database alias in logging is essential, especially when working with database routing, I need to find out how the database alias is being handled within database operations. The `DatabaseWrapper` class is a likely candidate for holding such information.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"get_connection_params\", \"BaseDatabaseWrapper\")\n```\n\n3. Finally, to specifically address the logging part of the issue, I need to find the actual logging implementation within the database backend. This could be either a direct logging call within the `BaseDatabaseWrapper` class or through another method designed to handle logging. I aim to find a method responsible for logging queries or operations to see if and how it currently includes any identifying information about the database connection.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"log\", \"BaseDatabaseWrapper\")\nsearch_method(\"execute\")\n```\n\nThese calls are expected to provide a solid understanding of where the database alias needs to be included in the logging output, how the logging is currently performed within the Django database backend, and how the database alias is managed. This context will be crucial for designing an appropriate patch."
