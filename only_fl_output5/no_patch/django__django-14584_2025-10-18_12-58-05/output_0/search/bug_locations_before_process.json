        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `execute` method within the `CursorDebugWrapper` class to additionally log the database alias along with the executed SQL query and its parameters. This involves either extending the `debug_sql` method or directly incorporating the database alias into the log message within the `execute` method. The database alias can be retrieved from the cursor's connection attribute, ensuring that the modification preserves the existing functionality of executing and logging database operations while adding the essential context of the database alias for clarity and debugging purposes when using multiple databases."
