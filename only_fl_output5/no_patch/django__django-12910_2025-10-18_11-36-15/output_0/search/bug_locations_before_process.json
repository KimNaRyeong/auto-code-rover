        "intended_behavior": "This attribute should evolve into 'required_system_checks', with the default value of '__all__'. Instead of a boolean that enables or disables system checks globally, 'required_system_checks' will allow specifying which system checks to run. A value of '__all__' implies running all checks (preserving existing functionality), an empty list ([]) implies running no system checks (equivalent to False), and a list of specific tags (e.g., ['staticfiles', 'models']) would imply running only checks tagged accordingly. This change requires updating wherever 'requires_system_checks' is checked or utilized in the codebase, ensuring backward compatibility and clear documentation to guide developers on the new usage."

        "intended_behavior": "Any method that currently inspects 'requires_system_checks' should be updated to interpret 'required_system_checks'. This includes methods that might directly or indirectly trigger system checks before a command's execution. The handling logic should: Support the '__all__' value to run all checks, support an empty list ([]) to skip all checks, correctly interpret and filter checks based on a provided list of tags, and ensure that any command-specific logic that previously depended on the boolean 'requires_system_checks' to bypass checks is now compatible with the new scheme."
