        "content": "Analyzing the collected context allows us to understand the current implementation of `Command.requires_system_checks` and identify where modifications need to be made to implement the suggested change. Here's a breakdown based on the information retrieved:\n\n### Analysis of `Command` Class\nFrom the search results, it's evident that the `Command` class is extensively used across different modules in the Django project, such as `django/core/management/commands/`, `django/contrib/staticfiles/management/commands/`, and others. Each of these commands seems to represent a management command within Django, capable of performing specific tasks.\n\n### Relationship with the Bug\nThe proposed modification suggests replacing the boolean attribute `requires_system_checks = True` with a more flexible attribute `required_system_checks = '__all__'` (or an equivalent that supports specification by tags such as `['staticfiles']`). This new approach would ostensibly allow individual command classes to specify which system checks are necessary for them to run safely, potentially bypassing some checks if not relevant, thus making the system more efficient and less error-prone when skipping checks.\n\n### Analysis of `requires_system_checks = True`\nThe specific code snippet from `django/core/management/base.py` showing `requires_system_checks = True` indicates that this is a default setting applicable to all management commands unless overridden. This setting ensures that system checks are run by default, helping to maintain the integrity and stability of the application environment by verifying that the application's current state doesn't contain obvious errors.\n\n### Intended Behavior Post-Modification\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior after implementing the proposed changes would be to allow more granularity in how system checks are applied to different management commands. This implementation would enable:\n\n1. Disabling all system checks for a command by setting `required_system_checks` to an empty list.\n2. Enabling only specific checks by tagging those checks and listing those tags in `required_system_checks`.\n3. The default behavior (`requires_system_checks = True`) being represented by `required_system_checks = '__all__'`, ensuring backwards compatibility for commands that do not override this setting.\n\nBased on the provided code and context, it appears that changes will primarily need to be made in `django/core/management/base.py`, where the `Command` base class is likely defined (given the presence of `requires_system_checks` in this file). Furthermore, individual command classes might need adjustments to utilize the new attribute correctly.\n\nIn addition, since the search for `system checks` returned snippets from various management commands and core settings files, it's clear that system checks are a core part of the command execution flow in Django. Thus, the introduction of `required_system_checks` as a list or tag specifier would require adjustments not only in how commands declare their check requirements but possibly also in the system that executes these checks before command execution.\n\nFinally, understanding the current implementation of `handle` methods in different commands (e.g., how they use `skip_checks` or perform checks) could guide how to adjust the system check logic to accommodate the new attribute."

Instead of a boolean that enables or disables system checks globally, `required_system_checks` will allow specifying which system checks to run. A value of `'__all__'` implies running all checks (preserving existing functionality), an empty list (`[]`) implies running no system checks (equivalent to `False`), and a list of specific tags (e.g., `['staticfiles', 'models']`) would imply running only checks tagged accordingly. This change requires updating wherever `requires_system_checks` is checked or utilized in the codebase, ensuring backward compatibility and clear documentation to guide developers on the new usage.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/core/management/base.py`\n  - **Method:** Various methods across the `BaseCommand` class or its children that read the `requires_system_checks` or initiate system checks based on this flag.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Any method that currently inspects `requires_system_checks` should be updated to interpret `required_system_checks`. This includes methods that might directly or indirectly trigger system checks before a command's execution. The handling logic should:\n    - Support the `'__all__'` value to run all checks.\n    - Support an empty list (`[]`) to skip all checks.\n    - Correctly interpret and filter checks based on a provided list of tags.\n    - Ensure that any command-specific logic that previously depended on the boolean `requires_system_checks` to bypass checks is now compatible with the new scheme.\n\nThese changes aim to enhance the flexibility and granularity of system checks for Django management commands, encouraging precise control over what checks should run per command. The update would simplify disabling checks where not applicable and allow specific targeting of relevant checks, improving developer experience and system performance."
