That would prevent having do to the manual and error prone options['skip_checks'] dance. In all cases that should be done in a different PR.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue effectively, we need to gather context about where and how `Command.requires_system_checks` is used within the project, and if there's already a mechanism that can be adapted or extended for the proposed change to `Command.required_system_checks = '__all__'`. Here are the search API calls that will help gather the necessary information:\n\n1. Search for the `Command` class to understand its structure and to see if there's any documentation or existing properties/methods related to system checks:\n   - `search_class(\"Command\")`\n\n2. Search for the usage of `requires_system_checks = True` to find out where it is currently set in the codebase. This can help us understand its usage patterns and which files or classes might need modification:\n   - `search_code(\"requires_system_checks = True\")`\n\n3. Since the issue suggests handling a scenario where system checks can be skipped with an empty list, it\u2019s useful to check if there\u2019s any existing logic that interprets `requires_system_checks` or a similar attribute. This might involve methods that read or utilize `requires_system_checks`:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"handle\", \"Command\")`\n   - This is assuming that `handle` method might be where system checks are integrated based on standard Django command class structure.\n\n4. Finally, to prepare for the new feature of specifying a subset of checks by tags, we should look for any existing code that performs system checks by tags. This could be in a method that interprets the `requires_system_checks` attribute or elsewhere in the framework where system checks are managed:\n   - `search_code(\"system checks\")`\n\nThese calls should provide enough context to understand how `requires_system_checks` is currently used, where the changes need to be made, and how to best implement the new `required_system_checks` attribute while maintaining backwards compatibility and adhering to the desired functionality."
