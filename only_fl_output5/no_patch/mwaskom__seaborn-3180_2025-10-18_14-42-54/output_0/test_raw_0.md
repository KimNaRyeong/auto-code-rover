This script attempts to encapsulate the problem described: overlapping labels in seaborn relplots between versions. It directly plots the concerned graph and saves them to files rather than raising an `AssertionError` on the specific condition of overlapping labels, which is visually assessed and not quantifiably evaluated in this context.

Because the specific issue of overlapping labels is better identified through visual inspection rather than programmatically detectable metrics (like exception throws or element positioning checks within matplotlib/seaborn renderings), the script cannot assert the presence of the issue straightforwardly through a code exception related solely to the overlap itself. Instead, it captures exceptions that could indicate related errors in execution or rendering, providing a scaffolding for later, more visually-oriented validation.
