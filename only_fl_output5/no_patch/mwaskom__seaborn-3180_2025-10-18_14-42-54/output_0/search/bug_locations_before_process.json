        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior here is to ensure that the `relplot` function, which configures and generates relational plots using a `FacetGrid`, does so in a way that prevents label overlap. This may involve adjusting the way `facet_kws` are passed to or interpreted by `FacetGrid`, particularly with respect to label formatting, or how spacing is managed between facets. It might also include better defaults or more precise control over plot aspect ratios, `col_wrap`, and scaling of plot dimensions to accommodate text sizes, ensuring clarity in dense plots."

        "method": "set_titles",
        "intended_behavior": "The `set_titles` method should dynamically adjust title placements or provide smarter defaults that account for the dimensions of faceted plots and the potential for label overlap. This could mean implementing algorithms that check for crowded labels and adjust font sizes, spacing, or title positions accordingly. The goal is to preserve readability and aesthetic quality across various plotting configurations, particularly in cases identified as producing overcrowded labels. Adjustments should not negatively impact plots that do not suffer from these issues, preserving existing functionality where it is already sufficient."
