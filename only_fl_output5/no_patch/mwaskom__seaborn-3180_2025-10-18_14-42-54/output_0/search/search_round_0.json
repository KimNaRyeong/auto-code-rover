        "content": "To address the issue related to overlapping labels in `relplot` with Seaborn 0.12, as described, I will need to gather more information on several key aspects of the Seaborn codebase. These include the implementation details of `relplot`, as well as how Seaborn handles axes tick labels and title settings, especially in the updates leading to version 0.12, where the issue seems to have emerged.\n\nHere are the specific API calls that would help gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the `relplot` function in the entire codebase to understand its implementation and any changes that could have affected label handling:\n   - `search_method(\"relplot\")`\n\n2. The issue description suggests that modifications in the way axes and titles are handled could be affecting label overlap. Therefore, it's important to search for the methods responsible for setting titles and label formatting in axes, possibly within a class that `relplot` utilizes:\n   - `search_method(\"set_titles\")`\n   - `search_method(\"ticklabel_format\")`\n\n3. Since the problem appears in a visual output (the plots), code related to figure sizing and axis sharing might be relevant. The `facet_kws` parameter alteration between the examples suggests changes in axis sharing or layout settings might be implicated. Searching for these terms could uncover related functionality or changes:\n   - `search_code(\"facet_kws\")`\n   - `search_code(\"sharex\")`\n   - `search_code(\"sharey\")`\n\n4. Given that adjusting `col_wrap`, `height`, and axis sharing settings (`sharex=False`, `sharey=False`) influences the issue, it's beneficial to look into any utilities or methods that handle plot sizing or layout algorithms:\n   - `search_code(\"col_wrap\")`\n   - `search_code(\"height\")`\n\nImplementing these search API calls will give us a comprehensive context in understanding the source of the label overlapping issue and how plot dimensions, axis sharing, and label formatting might have been affected by updates from Seaborn 11.2 to 12.1."
