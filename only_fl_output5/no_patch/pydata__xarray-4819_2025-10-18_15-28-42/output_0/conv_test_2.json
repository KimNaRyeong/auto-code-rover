Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI am trying to drop particular indices from a dimension that doesn't have coordinates.\r\n\r\nFollowing: [drop_sel() documentation](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.drop_sel.html#xarray.Dataset.drop_sel),\r\nbut leaving out the coordinate labels:\r\n```python\r\ndata = np.random.randn(2, 3)\r\nds = xr.Dataset({\"A\": ([\"x\", \"y\"], data)})\r\nds.drop_sel(y=[1])\r\n```\r\ngives me an error.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI would think `drop_isel` should exist and work in analogy to `drop_sel` as `isel` does to `sel`.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, I could either create coordinates especially to in order to drop, or rebuild a new dataset. Both are not congenial. (I'd be grateful to know if there is actually a straightforward way to do this I've overlooked.\r\n\r\n\n"
