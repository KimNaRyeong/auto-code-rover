Given the initial misunderstanding, let's try again with a clearer example tailored to the specific request:

```python
import numpy as np
import xarray as xr
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_drop_sel_without_coords():
    data = np.random.randn(2, 3)
    ds = xr.Dataset({"A": (["x", "y"], data)})

    try:
        # Attempt to drop elements from dimension 'y' which doesn't explicitly have coordinates.
        ds_updated = ds.drop_sel(y=[1])
        print("Successfully dropped index from a dimension without coordinates.")
        exit(0)  # Exiting with code 0 indicates success in case the issue is fixed
    except KeyError as e:
        # KeyError is expected as of current behavior, indicating `y` isn't understood as a coordinate
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate the issue persists
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch-all for any other exceptions, not expected but handled gracefully
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate an unexpected issue occurred

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_drop_sel_without_coords()
```

This script is designed to directly address the issue of using `drop_sel` on a dimension without coordinates in xarray. The script tries to remove an index from such a dimension and is expected to cause an `AssertionError` if the operation succeeds or print a stack trace if the operation fails due to the current limitations.

- If the function `drop_sel` is enhanced to support dropping indices from dimensions without explicit coordinates, this script will succeed by exiting with code 0.
- If the issue persists, it will either exit with code 1 after printing a stack trace of a `KeyError` (the expected current behavior indicating the dimension or coordinates could not be found), or another exception if something unexpected occurs.
