        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior at this location is to add a new method named `drop_isel` which would allow users to drop indices from a dimension without the need for coordinate labels. The `drop_isel` method should mimic the behavior of the `drop_sel` method but utilize integer-based indexing instead of label-based. This method should be designed to accept integer indices or boolean masks as inputs and remove the corresponding elements from the dataset. It should support multi-dimensional operations and ensure compatibility with the existing API designs. Exception handling should be robust, providing informative errors or warnings when invalid indices are provided, or when an operation cannot be performed due to dataset constraints. The existing functionality of the Dataset class should be preserved, ensuring that this new method integrates seamlessly without affecting the current capabilities. Integration with the dataset's indexing, selection, and manipulation interface should be considered, providing users with a coherent and flexible API for handling data within xarray."
