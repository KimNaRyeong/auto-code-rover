        ds_updated = ds.drop_sel(y=[1])
        # If the above line does not raise an error, assert failure will indicate the issue is fixed.
        assert False, "Successfully dropped indices on a dimension without coordinates, issue seems fixed."

```
This Python script will reproduce the issue described: attempting to drop indices from a dimension that doesn't have coordinates using the `drop_sel` method in xarray, leading to an exception. The assertion will fail if the issue is fixed, meaning that if `drop_sel` successfully drops indices from a dimension without coordinates, indicating the problem is resolved. If an error is raised, the script will print a stack trace showing where the error occurred, helping to diagnose the issue.
