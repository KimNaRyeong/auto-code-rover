        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior for resolving the issue with `pairwise_distances` involves ensuring numerical precision is preserved for `float32` arrays throughout the computation, especially when using the \"euclidean\" metric. Precisely, when computing distances between arrays of type `float32`, the function should carefully manage the conversion (if necessary) to `float64` to avoid precision loss, or better yet, optimize the calculation to preserve `float32` precision without unnecessary type conversions. This could involve conditionally enabling such optimizations based on the dtype of the input arrays and the available memory for computations, thus preserving existing functionality while improving numerical precision for `float32`. The patch should also ensure that any block-wise operations or use of `X_norm_squared` for optimizations are correctly applied to maintain precision across types."

        "intended_behavior": "Although a specific method wasn't identified due to lack of precise match in the search results, the changes should conceptually address optimizations around memory usage and block-wise operations as mentioned in the issue. This includes ensuring that any blocks cast to `float64` for the purpose of improving precision do not inadvertently cause mismatches or precision loss when the original data was in `float32`. Implementing or refining a mechanism to dynamically calculate the optimal block size based on the input data type and available memory, ensuring symmetry in distance computations (i.e., between `X` and `Y`), and accurately copying results between blocks could achieve this. This might involve reviewing and potentially revising the logic that handles these aspects, ensuring that enhancements for handling `float32` do not compromise performance or accuracy for other types. Adjustments or additional logic may need to be integrated to ensure that the handling of `X_norm_squared` and potential `Y_norm_squared` during these operations aligns with the goal of precise and efficient distance computations for all supported data types, including `float32`."
