        "content": "<issue>Numerical precision of euclidean_distances with float32\n#### Description\nI noticed that sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances function agrees with np.linalg.norm when using np.float64 arrays, but disagrees when using np.float32 arrays. See the code snippet below.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy\nimport sklearn.metrics.pairwise\n# create 64-bit vectors a and b that are very similar to each other\na_64 = np.array([61.221637725830078125, 71.60662841796875,    -65.7512664794921875],  dtype=np.float64)\nb_64 = np.array([61.221637725830078125, 71.60894012451171875, -65.72847747802734375], dtype=np.float64)\n# create 32-bit versions of a and b\na_32 = a_64.astype(np.float32)\nb_32 = b_64.astype(np.float32)\n# compute the distance from a to b using numpy, for both 64-bit and 32-bit\ndist_64_np = np.array([np.linalg.norm(a_64 - b_64)], dtype=np.float64)\ndist_32_np = np.array([np.linalg.norm(a_32 - b_32)], dtype=np.float32)\n# compute the distance from a to b using sklearn, for both 64-bit and 32-bit\ndist_64_sklearn = sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances([a_64], [b_64])\ndist_32_sklearn = sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances([a_32], [b_32])\n# note that the 64-bit sklearn results agree exactly with numpy, but the 32-bit results disagree\nnp.set_printoptions(precision=200)\nprint(dist_64_np)\nprint(dist_32_np)\nprint(dist_64_sklearn)\nprint(dist_32_sklearn)\n```\n#### Expected Results\nI expect that the results from sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances would agree with np.linalg.norm for both 64-bit and 32-bit. In other words, I expect the following output:\n```\n[ 0.0229059506440019884643266578905240749008953571319580078125]\n[ 0.02290595136582851409912109375]\n[[ 0.0229059506440019884643266578905240749008953571319580078125]]\n[[ 0.02290595136582851409912109375]]\n```\n#### Actual Results\nThe code snippet above produces the following output for me:\n```\n[ 0.0229059506440019884643266578905240749008953571319580078125]\n[ 0.02290595136582851409912109375]\n[[ 0.0229059506440019884643266578905240749008953571319580078125]]\n[[ 0.03125]]\n```\n#### Versions\n```\nDarwin-16.6.0-x86_64-i386-64bit\n('Python', '2.7.11 | 64-bit | (default, Jun 11 2016, 03:41:56) \\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)]')\n('NumPy', '1.11.3')\n('SciPy', '0.19.0')\n('Scikit-Learn', '0.18.1')\n```\n[WIP] Stable and fast float32 implementation of euclidean_distances\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\nFixes #9354\nSuperseds PR #10069\n#### What does this implement/fix?

The hardcoded amount of additional memory of 10MB is also derived from a benchmark.\nAs a side bonus, this implementation should also support float16 out of the box, should scikit-learn support it at some point.\nAdd a test for numeric precision (see #9354)\nSurprisingly bad precision, isn't it?\nNote that the traditional computation sqrt(sum((x-y)**2)) gets the results exact.\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\n#### What does this implement/fix?

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Analyzing the collected context points towards understanding how `sklearn`'s `pairwise_distances` function and related components work, particularly with `float32` precision and the way Euclidean distances are computed and optimized. The findings and their implications are discussed below:\n\n### Analysis of `pairwise_distances` Implementation\nThe `pairwise_distances` function serves as a wrapper to compute the distance matrix from vector arrays `X` and optionally `Y`, supporting various metrics including \"euclidean\". This function checks metric validity, handles precomputed metrics directly, and for others, it routes the calculation through either a specific function from `PAIRWISE_DISTANCE_FUNCTIONS` or a more generic `cdist` computation provided by scipy for non-sparse inputs. The function's structure also indicates support for parallel computation (`n_jobs`) and custom metrics through callable objects.\n\n**Relation to the Bug:** Since the issue mentions a discrepancy in results between using `np.float32` and `np.float64`, especially with the Euclidean metric, the bug might stem from how data type conversions or computations are handled within this method or by the methods it delegates to. Precision loss in `float32` could be exacerbated by not adequately handling the numeric type or by the computation method chosen at runtime.\n\n**Intended Behavior:** For consistency in results across data types (with acceptable tolerance levels for floating-point arithmetic), the method should ensure that any internal conversions between `float32` and `float64`, if necessary for achieving higher precision, are performed optimally. The reference to optimizing memory and accuracy improvements via block-wise operations suggests an intended design to handle such issues. The bug report implies that these conversions or the way blocks are managed may not function as intended for `float32`.\n\n### `euclidean_distances` Usage Context\nMultiple files and snippets pointing to `euclidean_distances` usage highlight its importance across various components, especially in clustering and manifold learning (e.g., K-Means, Birch, MDS). These usages underscore the function's core role in calculating distances, fundamental to many algorithms.\n\n**Relation to the Bug:** Given its widespread use, any precision issues within `euclidean_distances` can have far-reaching implications across different sklearn components. The specific issue with `float32` might affect not only pairwise distance computations directly invoked by users but also internal algorithm behaviors relying on this computation.\n\n**Intended Behavior:** The `euclidean_distances` function, directly or indirectly involved in the issue, must accurately compute distances, preserving as much precision as possible across data types. It ideally should either maintain `float32` calculations when precision requirements are met or upscale to `float64` as necessary, without leading to drastic overheads or loss in precision.\n\n### `X_norm_squared` Context\nOccurrences of `X_norm_squared` within `sklearn/metrics/pairwise.py` suggest it's a precomputed component to optimize distance calculations, possibly by avoiding repeated computation of each vector's norm.\n\n**Relation to the Bug:** The issue's mention of `X_norm_squared` being converted to `float64` suggests a workaround for maintaining precision in distance calculations. However, if not carefully implemented, this could lead to mismatches or unexpected precision loss when comparing `float32` arrays, as the casting to `float64` could introduce rounding differences not present in the original `float32` calculations.\n\n**Intended Behavior:** Precomputing and possibly upcasting `X_norm_squared` to `float64` should optimize for both computational efficiency and precision. The process must ensure that any benefits from such optimizations do not introduce inconsistencies, especially when the input array is of `float32` type.\n\n### Inability to Find \"Swap X and Y\"\nThe lack of findings for \"swap X and Y\" could imply that the specific optimization or implementation detail was either not named directly as such within the codebase or is implemented under different terms. This optimization might be part of broader strategies ensuring efficient memory and computational resource use.\n\n**Next Steps for Context Gathering:**\nGiven the gap in finding direct references to swapping `X` and `Y`, it may be beneficial to delve more into memory management and optimization techniques applied within `euclidean_distances` or `pairwise_distances`. This could involve:\n\n- Searching for memory optimization or block-wise operation standards within `pairwise_distances` or related utility functions.\n- Examining how `PAIRWISE_DISTANCE_FUNCTIONS` are defined and implemented, especially for the Euclidean metric.\n- Inspecting how `X_norm_squared` and potentially `Y_norm_squared` contribute to optimizing distance computations; this might involve making more targeted search API calls focused on memory management or optimization strategies within the distance computations.\n\nBy addressing these areas, we can piece together a more comprehensive understanding of how `sklearn` manages datatype precision and optimizes distance computations, which is crucial for addressing the reported bug."

Precisely, when computing distances between arrays of type `float32`, the function should carefully manage the conversion (if necessary) to `float64` to avoid precision loss, or better yet, optimize the calculation to preserve `float32` precision without unnecessary type conversions. This could involve conditionally enabling such optimizations based on the dtype of the input arrays and the available memory for computations, thus preserving existing functionality while improving numerical precision for `float32`. The patch should also ensure that any block-wise operations or use of `X_norm_squared` for optimizations are correctly applied to maintain precision across types.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `sklearn/metrics/pairwise.py`\n  - **Method:** N/A (related to block-wise operations and memory optimizations mentioned in issue)\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Although a specific method wasn't identified due to lack of precise match in the search results, the changes should conceptually address optimizations around memory usage and block-wise operations as mentioned in the issue. This includes ensuring that any blocks cast to `float64` for the purpose of improving precision do not inadvertently cause mismatches or precision loss when the original data was in `float32`. Implementing or refining a mechanism to dynamically calculate the optimal block size based on the input data type and available memory, ensuring symmetry in distance computations (i.e., between `X` and `Y`), and accurately copying results between blocks could achieve this. This might involve reviewing and potentially revising the logic that handles these aspects, ensuring that enhancements for handling `float32` do not compromise performance or accuracy for other types. Adjustments or additional logic may need to be integrated to ensure that the handling of `X_norm_squared` and potential `Y_norm_squared` during these operations aligns with the goal of precise and efficient distance computations for all supported data types, including `float32`."
