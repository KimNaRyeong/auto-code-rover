The previous scenario seems to reference an environment where the Scikit-learn library was not properly installed or built, leading to an import error unrelated to the numerical precision issue being explored. Let us focus on creating a reproducible script specifically for the numerical precision issue of `euclidean_distances` with `float32` data type as initially described. Please ensure your Python environment has the necessary dependencies correctly installed â€“ particularly, numpy and scikit-learn. 

Here's how you could structure the Python file named `reproducer.py`:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import pairwise_distances

    # create 64-bit vectors a and b
    a_64 = np.array([61.221637725830078125, 71.60662841796875, -65.7512664794921875], dtype=np.float64)
    b_64 = np.array([61.221637725830078125, 71.60894012451171875, -65.72847747802734375], dtype=np.float64)

    # create 32-bit versions of a and b
    a_32 = a_64.astype(np.float32)
    b_32 = b_64.astype(np.float32)

    # compute the distance from a to b using numpy, for both 64-bit and 32-bit
    dist_64_np = np.linalg.norm(a_64 - b_64)
    dist_32_np = np.linalg.norm(a_32 - b_32)

    # compute the distance from a to b using sklearn, for both 64-bit and 32-bit
    dist_64_sklearn = pairwise_distances([a_64], [b_64])[0][0]
    dist_32_sklearn = pairwise_distances([a_32], [b_32])[0][0]

    try:
        assert np.isclose(dist_64_np, dist_64_sklearn, atol=1e-6), "64-bit distances do not match between NumPy and sklearn"
        assert np.isclose(dist_32_np, dist_32_sklearn, atol=1e-6), "32-bit distances do not match between NumPy and sklearn"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise SystemExit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    print("No issues detected.")
    SystemExit(0)
```

This script compares the Euclidean distance calculated by NumPy and scikit-learn for both `float64` and `float32` data types. An `AssertionError` is raised if the distances do not closely match, thereby indicating the presence of the reported numerical precision issue. The `atol=1e-6` argument to `np.isclose` specifies the absolute tolerance parameter, which you may adjust based on your precision requirements or empirical observations.

Please ensure you have the latest versions of NumPy and scikit-learn installed in your Python environment to test this accurately, as software updates may have addressed the issue since the time of the original report.
