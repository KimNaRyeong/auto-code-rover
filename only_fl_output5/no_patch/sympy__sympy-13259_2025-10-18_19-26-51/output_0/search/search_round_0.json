The implementation of the `simplify` method, as this is directly related to the problem.\n2. The classes and methods used to represent and manipulate complex numbers and trigonometric functions, specifically `I` (imaginary unit), `cos`, and `cosh`.\n3. Any specialized simplification rules for trigonometric functions, especially those that might involve transformation between `cos` and `cosh` with complex arguments.\n\nGiven this, here are the appropriate API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"simplify\")` to find where the `simplify` method is defined or utilized within the codebase.\n2. `search_class(\"I\")` to understand how the imaginary unit is defined, which could give insight into how it interacts with trigonometric functions.\n3. `search_method(\"cos\")` and `search_method(\"cosh\")` to investigate the implementation of these trigonometric functions and any conditional logic that might lead to an erroneous transformation.\n4. `search_code(\"cos(pi/6 - I*asinh\")` and `search_code(\"cosh(pi/6 + asinh\")` to locate any specific parts of the code that directly relate to the issue reported, including possibly hardcoded simplification rules or transformations. \n\nThese searches should provide enough context to understand how the simplification process goes wrong for the given expressions involving trigonometric functions with complex arguments."
