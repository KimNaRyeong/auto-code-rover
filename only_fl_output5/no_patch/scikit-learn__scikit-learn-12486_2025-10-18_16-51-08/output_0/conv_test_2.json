No error detected, the issue might have been resolved.\")\n```\n\nThis script endeavors to simulate the conditions under which the `IndexError` would manifest by integrating `GaussianMixture` through an adapter that synthesizes it as a classifier compatible with `roc_auc` scoring. By utilizing a mock classifier that wraps `GaussianMixture` to provide `predict_proba`, it aims to fit within the expectations of `roc_auc` scoring mechanism demands. \n\nThe script responsibly checks for the issue's presence by attempting to perform grid search operations under the specified parameters and catches any general exceptions to provide detailed traceback, ensuring clarity whether the issue persists or is resolved."
