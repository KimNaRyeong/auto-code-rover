        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the code should check if `y_pred` has more than one column before attempting to access the second column (`y_pred[:, 1]`). This is because a single-column output from a model's `predict_proba` method implies that it is either outputting probabilities for a single class (which might be the case with certain types of models or configurations, such as the mentioned Gaussian Mixture Model) or it is directly providing the positive class probabilities in a binary classification scenario. The intended behavior should include a conditional check on `y_pred`'s shape and handle the situation as follows:\n- If `y_pred` has only one column and the task is binary classification, it should assume this column represents the positive class probabilities directly.\n- If `y_pred` has two or more columns, it should proceed with the existing approach of using the second column as positive class probabilities.\n\nThis approach ensures compatibility with models that do not follow the conventional two-column output format for binary classification problems while preserving the existing functionality for models that do."

        "method": "__call__",
        "intended_behavior": "Similar to the _ProbaScorer, _ThresholdScorer's `__call__` method should be modified to safely handle cases where `y_pred` does not conform to the expected two-column format for binary classification probability predictions. Specifically:\n- Perform a check on the number of columns in `y_pred`. If there is only one column, assume this represents the probability of the positive class and proceed without attempting to access a non-existent second column.\n- For models outputting probabilities in a format that includes probabilities for positive classes across multiple columns (such as in multi-class scenarios), ensure that the logic is robust enough to select the appropriate columns based on the task at hand (for binary tasks, select the second column if it exists, otherwise use the single column available).\n\nThis modification will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring when the assumption of a two-column output is invalidated, ensuring that `roc_auc` scoring and potentially others that rely on positive class probabilities can be used seamlessly with a wider variety of classifiers."
