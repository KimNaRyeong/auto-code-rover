Explain your changes.\nWe are fixing this issue: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/7598\nWe added a test in the scorer.py file that raises a ValueError if the user is either trying to use a non classifier model for a classification problem, or is using a dataset with only one class.\n#### Any other comments?\n@reshamas\nBUG: Using GridSearchCV with scoring='roc_auc' and GMM as classifier gives IndexError\nWhen performing grid search using GridSearchCV using ootb scoring method 'roc_auc' and ootb GMM classifier from sklearn.mixture.GMM I get an index error.\nCode to reproduce:\n```\nfrom sklearn import datasets\nfrom sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.mixture import GMM\nX,y = datasets.make_classification(n_samples = 10000, n_features=10,n_classes=2)\n# Vanilla GMM_model\ngmm_model = GMM()\n# Standard param grid\nparam_grid = {'n_components' : [1,2,3,4],\n'covariance_type': ['tied','full','spherical']}\ngrid_search = GridSearchCV(gmm_model, param_grid, scoring='roc_auc')\n# Fit GS with this data\ngrid_search.fit(X, y)\n```\nSorry if the format is incorrect. First time I am posting.\nERROR:\nFile \"*/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/metrics/scorer.py\", line 175, in **call**\ny_pred = y_pred[:, 1]\nIndexError: index 1 is out of bounds for axis 1 with size 1\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather context around a few key components mentioned in the issue:\n\n1. The behavior of the `GridSearchCV` class when used with `scoring='roc_auc'`.\n2. How the `GMM` class from `sklearn.mixture` is implemented, particularly how it handles classification tasks and predictions.\n3. The specific part of the code in `scorer.py` that led to the `IndexError` due to `y_pred[:, 1]`.\n\nBased on these requirements, the following search API calls will be necessary:\n\n- `search_class(\"GridSearchCV\")`: This will provide context on how `GridSearchCV` is implemented and may reveal how it interacts with the scoring function and classifiers like GMM.\n- `search_class(\"GMM\")`: Since GMM is directly involved in the issue, understanding its interface and output format, especially related to predictions, is crucial.\n- `search_code(\"y_pred[:, 1]\")`: This will help us find where in the codebase the operation that led to the `IndexError` is located. Given the error occurs in the scorer.py context, this might pinpoint the exact location and logic leading to the bug.\n- `search_method_in_file(\"__call__\", \"*/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/metrics/scorer.py\")`: This directly targets the error's location mentioned in the issue and will help understand the circumstances under which `y_pred[:, 1]` is called, potentially revealing the assumption that there are always at least two classes predicted."
