Here is a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` designed according to your specifications to reproduce the issue described. When executed, this script will attempt to replicate the IndexError when using `GridSearchCV` with `GaussianMixture` from `sklearn.mixture`. It follows your instruction for handling and printing stack traces clearly.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_test():
    from sklearn import datasets
    from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
    from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture

    X, y = datasets.make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=10, n_classes=2)

    # Specify we are using GaussianMixture, which is the correct usage for newer versions
    gmm_model = GaussianMixture()

    param_grid = {
        'n_components': [1, 2, 3, 4],
        'covariance_type': ['tied', 'full', 'spherical']
    }

    try:
        grid_search = GridSearchCV(gmm_model, param_grid, scoring='roc_auc')
        grid_search.fit(X, y)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue detected with GridSearchCV and GaussianMixture.") from e

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        run_test()
    except AssertionError as e:
        # This block is reached if the AssertionError is raised, meaning the issue is present.
        print(e)
        exit(1)  # Indicates a failure due to the issue being present.
    else:
        print("Script executed successfully. The issue is likely resolved.")
        exit(0)  # Indicates success, meaning the issue was not encountered.
```

This script is prepared for potential failure due to incorrect use of the `GaussianMixture` model within a `GridSearchCV` context, particularly concerning the scoring parameter `roc_auc`, which expects a classifier that can provide a `predict_proba` method. Note, however, that as `GaussianMixture` directly does not fit this requirement without adaptation, the original issue description might stem from a misunderstanding of the model's capabilities. 

Direct execution of this script as specified (`python3 reproducer.py`) within the root directory of the relevant project should enable easy assessment of the presence or resolution of the identified issue, adhering to the output conventions you've outlined.
