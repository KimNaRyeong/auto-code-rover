Given the previous misalignment between the issue's expectation and the provided script, and recognizing the need directly tied to reproducing an `IndexError` stemming from `GridSearchCV` with `GaussianMixture` using `roc_auc` scoring, let's correct the approach:

We should highlight the initial mistake was presuming that `GaussianMixture` directly supports classification tasks which it does not inherently do, contributing to the problem with `roc_auc` scoring since this scoring relies on probability estimates of class memberships.

To address the requirement thoroughly, this updated script will ensure to emulate the scenario accurately, paying attention to the necessary conditions to trigger the error described and remediate the reproduction methodology accordingly. This includes directly approaching the problem described without assuming alterations in the libraries' behaviors beyond what's reported:

```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_gmm_grid_search():
    from sklearn import datasets
    from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
    from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture
    # Correction to use GaussianMixture which is the proper class name in newer versions of sklearn
    X, y = datasets.make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=10, n_classes=2)
    gmm_model = GaussianMixture(n_components=2, random_state=0)

    # Mocking an adapter to provide `predict_proba`, for GaussianMixture, essential for roc_auc scoring
    from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin
    
    class GMMClassifier(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin):
        def __init__(self, gmm_model):
            self.gmm_model = gmm_model
            
        def fit(self, X, y):
            self.gmm_model.fit(X)
            return self
        
        def predict_proba(self, X):
            return self.gmm_model.predict_proba(X)

    # Wrap GaussianMixture model to use it as a classifier
    gmm_classifier = GMMClassifier(gmm_model)

    param_grid = {
        'gmm_model__n_components': [1, 2, 3, 4], 
        'gmm_model__covariance_type': ['tied', 'full', 'spherical']
    }
    try:
        grid_search = GridSearchCV(gmm_classifier, param_grid, scoring='roc_auc')
        grid_search.fit(X, y)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue detected during GridSearchCV execution.") from e

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        test_gmm_grid_search()
    except AssertionError as err:
        print("Confirmed the error:", str(err))
    else:
        print("Script executed successfully. No error detected, the issue might have been resolved.")
```

This script endeavors to simulate the conditions under which the `IndexError` would manifest by integrating `GaussianMixture` through an adapter that synthesizes it as a classifier compatible with `roc_auc` scoring. By utilizing a mock classifier that wraps `GaussianMixture` to provide `predict_proba`, it aims to fit within the expectations of `roc_auc` scoring mechanism demands. 

The script responsibly checks for the issue's presence by attempting to perform grid search operations under the specified parameters and catches any general exceptions to provide detailed traceback, ensuring clarity whether the issue persists or is resolved.
