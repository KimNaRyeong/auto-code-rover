        "intended_behavior": "This method should ensure that when a colormap is registered with a new name, this new name takes precedence over the original name in all colormap lookups. To resolve the issue, the code should be adjusted to firmly associate the newly registered name with the colormap in such a way that subsequent calls to get_cmap with the registered name correctly retrieve the colormap. Specifically, an adjustment is needed to make sure that the colormap's original name does not override the registered name in internal lookup tables. This would ensure that when colormaps are registered under new names, these names are used consistently across all matplotlib components."

        "intended_behavior": "This function should be reviewed and potentially modified to ensure that it can always correctly retrieve colormaps by their registered names, even when these differ from the colormaps' original names. The fix should address the internal mechanism that maps colormap names to colormap objects, ensuring that registered names take precedence and are effectively resolved. This change would ensure users can reliably use registered names across different parts of the Matplotlib API, aligning with user expectations and preventing confusion."
