Based on the latest clarification and requirements, I will craft a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that targets the described issue explicitly. This script will reproduce the problem of colormap name handling in matplotlib, catch the specific exception, print the stack trace clearly, and assert the failure. Note, this example relies on catching the ValueError specifying the colormap was not recognized, as indicated in the issue description provided. This script is written to reflect the software versions and behavior described in the initial scenario:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from matplotlib import cm
    from matplotlib.colors import LinearSegmentedColormap
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib

    print(f"matplotlib version: {matplotlib.__version__}")

    my_cmap_data = [
        [1.5e-03, 4.7e-04, 1.4e-02],
        [2.3e-03, 1.3e-03, 1.8e-02],
        [3.3e-03, 2.3e-03, 2.4e-02]
    ]

    # Creating and registering the colormap
    my_cmap = LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list('some_cmap_name', my_cmap_data)
    cm.register_cmap(name='my_cmap_name', cmap=my_cmap)

    try:
        plt.set_cmap('my_cmap_name')
        plt.imshow([[1, 1], [2, 2]])
        plt.show()
        # If the program reaches this point without an error, it means the issue is fixed.
        print("No issue found, colormap is set correctly.")
        exit(0)
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
    
    raise AssertionError("Colormap registration or usage failed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Explanation:**

1. The script starts by defining a function `print_stacktrace` to output detailed information about exceptions caught during execution.
2. The `main` function sets up a colormap `my_cmap` using `LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list` and then registers this colormap with a specific name.
3. It attempts to use the registered colormap with `plt.set_cmap('my_cmap_name')` followed by a plotting function `plt.imshow`. According to the issue description, this is where the problem should occur due to the handling of the colormap name.
4. If a `ValueError` exception occurs during the plotting attempt, which is expected according to the issue details provided, it catches the exception and calls `print_stacktrace` to output the traceback.
5. If any other exception occurs, it is also caught, and its stack trace is printed, but this is noted as an unexpected error.
6. If no exceptions are thrown (indicating a potential fix or non-reproduction of the issue), a message is printed, and the script exits with code 0.
7. If a `ValueError` indicating an issue with colormap name recognition is caught as expected, an `AssertionError` is raised after the stack trace, indicating the reproduction of the issue.
