        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior in this method should include a way to explicitly pass configuration data when using the `delayed` function within a parallel execution context. The goal would be to allow `delayed` functions to receive configuration details from the context in which they are executed, particularly when used with `Parallel` processing tasks. This enhancement could involve adding functionality to the `_FuncWrapper` to store and apply the passed configuration when the function is eventually executed. Modifications should ensure that any thread-specific configurations are appropriately managed and applied to maintain existing functionality while fixing the issue of configuration passage across threads.\n\nThe solution to this issue would involve not just adjustments in how `delayed` functions capture and apply configuration but also ensuring the broader system that relies on `Parallel` execution can effectively manage and apply these configurations as needed. Adding explicit parameters to functions involved in parallel execution paths, or enhancing context management within the library to better handle configuration passage, could also be part of the solution. This would require careful design to avoid introducing performance penalties or complexity that could impact the usability or efficiency of parallel processing tasks within scikit-learn."
