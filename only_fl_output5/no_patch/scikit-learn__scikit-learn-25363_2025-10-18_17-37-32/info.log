This enhancement will likely involve modifying how the `delayed` decorator captures, stores, and passes configuration details to the `_FuncWrapper`, ensuring that when it's executed in a parallel or deferred context, the correct configuration is used. The method should preserve its existing functionality of capturing and deferring function calls but should be extended to handle configuration objects or parameters explicitly. This can involve introducing an optional parameter to `delayed` for passing configuration data or a mechanism to detect and warn about potential configuration mismatches."
