Given the previous attempt did not capture the essence of reproducing the issue due to the environment not having the necessary libraries, let's adjust the assumption and focus on a scenario where `numpy` and `astropy` are installed in the environment where this script is running. If these libraries are not installed, the script won't run as expected since it directly depends on them. Installing `numpy` and `astropy` can be done through `pip install numpy astropy` before running the script. Here's an updated version of the `reproducer.py` considering these dependencies are met:

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from astropy.stats import biweight_location

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_biweight_location_constant_array():
    constant_array = np.ones(4)
    try:
        result = biweight_location(constant_array)
        # Expecting the issue to be present, leading to an AssertionError if the result is nan
        assert not np.isnan(result), "biweight_location returned nan for a constant array."
        # If the result is not nan, further assert that it equals 1 (the expected correct mean of the constant array)
        assert result == 1, "The mean of a constant array should be equal to the constant value."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e
    else:
        print("Test passed: biweight_location correctly handles constant array.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_biweight_location_constant_array()
```

Here, the script explicitly checks for the issue where `biweight_location` would return `nan` when it shouldn't, for an array with no variance, and validates against both `nan` being returned and the correct value being returned. This script will raise an `AssertionError` if the result is `nan` or if the result is anything other than 1 for a constant array of ones, thus checking for the specific issue described.
