Understood, let's make sure the script is fully self-contained and correctly reproduces the issue by explicitly handling possible exceptions related to the assertion regarding the behavior of `biweight_location` with constant arrays. Also, ensure all required libraries are included with recommendations for installation if they are missing.

Here is an alternative version of `reproducer.py` that includes checks for missing libraries:

```python
# reproducer.py
try:
    import numpy as np
    from astropy.stats import biweight_location
except ImportError as e:
    print("This script requires numpy and astropy to be installed.")
    raise e

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_biweight_location_constant_array():
    constant_array = np.ones(4)
    try:
        result = biweight_location(constant_array)
        # Check if the result is nan
        if np.isnan(result):
            raise ValueError("Result is NaN for constant array.")
        assert result == 1, "biweight_location does not return the expected value for constant array."
    except Exception as e:  # Catching broad exceptions for demonstration purposes
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The test for 'biweight_location' with a constant array failed.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_biweight_location_constant_array()
```

Please note, running this script presumes you have both `numpy` and `astropy` installed. If not, you can install them using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy astropy
```

This script tries to ensure it checks for the specific issue at hand and provides a clear path for installation of dependencies, improving the chances of a successful reproduction in environments where dependencies might not be already installed.
