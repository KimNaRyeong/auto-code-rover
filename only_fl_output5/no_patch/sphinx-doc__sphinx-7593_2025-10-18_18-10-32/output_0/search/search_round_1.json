        "content": "Given the issue's description revolves around Sphinx's handling of `:kbd:` role and the necessity to transform the markup into individual or nested `<kbd>` HTML tags, the focus should be on Sphinx's mechanism for rendering roles into HTML.\n\n- First, understanding how Sphinx processes and converts roles (like `:kbd:`) into HTML requires identifying the relevant class or method responsible for this transformation. Since roles are a part of Sphinx's reStructuredText (reST) processing, classes or methods related to the domain or roles processing would be relevant.\n\n- Sphinx extensions and core functionalities often reside within Python modules that can be located by inspecting classes and methods related to document processing, specifically those that handle roles or direct HTML generation.\n\nGiven these points, the following search API calls are proposed to gather context for resolving the issue:\n\n1. Search for a class or method responsible for processing roles:\n    - `search_class(\"Role\")` or `search_class(\"Roles\")`\n    - `search_method(\"process_roles\")`\n    - `search_method(\"role\")` to find any method that might be registered or used to handle specific roles like `:kbd:`.\n\n2. Once the relevant class or method is identified, more targeted queries can be made to find the specific implementation details for the `:kbd:` role handling:\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"visit_kbd\", \"RoleVisitor\")` or a similar visitor class/method if the name is different in the actual codebase.\n    - `search_code(\"visit_kbd\")` to find custom handlers or overrides dealing with `<kbd>` elements. This search could yield results pointing to methods or functions that transform `:kbd:` role content into HTML.\n\nThese initial searches aim to pinpoint where in the Sphinx codebase `:kbd:` roles are converted into HTML, providing a foundation for understanding the current implementation and determining where modifications could be made to achieve the desired nested `<kbd>` tagging. Further searches may be necessary based on the results returned from these calls."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the `role` method search results, specifically within the `sphinx/domains/__init__.py` and `sphinx/ext/extlinks.py`, we notice a common pattern in how Sphinx processes roles and how it could potentially be related to the `:kbd:` role and its HTML conversion issue.\n\n### Analysis of `sphinx/domains/__init__.py`\n\nThe code provided from `sphinx/domains/__init__.py` reveals a method named `role`, which seems to be a factory or a resolver for role processing functions. This method looks up a registered role by name (e.g., `:kbd:`) and returns an adapter function that encapsulates the processing logic for the role in question. The adapter is responsible for invoking the actual role processing function with the correct arguments, including the role name, raw text, and various metadata such as line numbers and inline options.\n\n#### Relationship with the Issue\n\nGiven that the issue involves converting `:kbd:` role inputs into structured HTML `<kbd>` elements, the mechanism described in `sphinx/domains/__init__.py` is likely a starting point for diving deeper into how Sphinx handles specific roles. The `role` method's ability to dynamically fetch and execute role processing functions indicates that somewhere in the Sphinx codebase, there should be a specific implementation for handling `:kbd:` roles, although it has not been directly identified yet.\n\nThe issue's intended behavior suggests enhancing or replacing the current `:kbd:` processing logic to account for nested or sequential `<kbd>` elements, aligning with more semantic HTML standards as recommended by MDN.\n\n### Analysis of `sphinx/ext/extlinks.py`\n\nThe `extlinks.py` result shows a specific implementation of a role processing function, likely used for a different kind of role that handles external links. It demonstrates how role functions receive text and other meta-information to produce document nodes representing the role's output, in this case, creating a hyperlink node.\n\n#### Relationship with the Issue\n\nThough not directly related to the `:kbd:` role, this example illustrates the expected structure and behavior of role processing functions in Sphinx. It suggests that a similar approach could be taken to parse the `:kbd:` role's text and split it into multiple `<kbd>` HTML elements as per the feature request.\n\n### Intended Behavior and Next Steps\n\nThe intended behavior, as gathered from the original issue, involves parsing the input given within a `:kbd:` role to individually wrap keys or key combinations in `<kbd>` elements, either flat or nested, for better semantic clarity. Given the current insights, the next logical step would include identifying or creating a specific role handler for `:kbd:` that can parse the keystrokes or key combinations and output the appropriately structured HTML.\n\n### Additional Context Required\n\nTo move towards a resolution, further context is needed specifically around how custom roles like `:kbd:` are registered and handled within Sphinx. Some potential next steps might involve:\n- Searching for functionality that registers or defines custom roles (`:kbd:` in this case), possibly with calls like `search_code(\"role('kbd'\")` to see if there's a registration or definition of a `:kbd:` role.\n- Looking into how role handlers are written by exploring other roles' implementations, assuming a similar approach can be adopted for `:kbd:`.\n- Inspecting the Sphinx documentation builder or HTML renderer code parts for any existing hooks or extension points that could be used or modified for the `:kbd:` role."

Here are the search API calls that should help in this regard:\n   - `search_code(\":kbd:\")` to find references or uses of the `:kbd:` role within the Sphinx project codebase that may hint towards its registration or handling.\n   - `search_code(\"roles.register_local_role\")` because this or a similar function might be used for registering custom roles like `:kbd:`, providing insight into where `:kbd:` is implemented or how it can be modified or extended.\n\n2. Given the current information and without specific findings to point to an existing implementation for `:kbd:`, we cannot precisely define bug locations. However:\n   - Based on the standard practices in Sphinx, the implementation or enhancement for this feature would likely involve introducing modifications or additions in the `sphinx/domains/__init__.py` file, as it includes mechanisms for role resolution which are crucial for handling `:kbd:` role parsing and rendering.\n   - Existing implementations for roles, as seen in `extlinks.py`, suggest that adding or modifying a method specifically for `:kbd:` parsing within a relevant domain or extension module would be necessary. Since we haven't identified a specific handler for `:kbd:`, there's an implication that the work would either involve creating a new method/class for handling this role or enhancing an existing but yet unidentified part of the Sphinx codebase related to role processing.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\n\n- **File:** Likely within `sphinx/domains/__init__.py` or a similar file concerned with roles.\n- **Class/Method:** A new or existing role handling method for `:kbd:`.\n- **Intended Behavior:** This new or modified method should interpret the `:kbd:` directive's content, breaking it down into individual keys or key combinations and wrapping them in separate `<kbd>` HTML elements for semantic correctness and enhanced browser rendering. This method must be capable of handling complex inputs where keys are combined with modifiers (e.g., Control, Alt) or sequential inputs and producing nested or sequential `<kbd>` tags as illustrated in the issue description. The functionality should allow configuration or by default produce nested `<kbd>` elements to follow the MDN recommendation for key combinations, ensuring backward compatibility for documents expecting a single `<kbd>` tag."
