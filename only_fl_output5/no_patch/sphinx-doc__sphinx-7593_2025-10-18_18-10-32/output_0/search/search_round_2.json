Since roles are a part of Sphinx's reStructuredText (reST) processing, classes or methods related to the domain or roles processing would be relevant.\n\n- Sphinx extensions and core functionalities often reside within Python modules that can be located by inspecting classes and methods related to document processing, specifically those that handle roles or direct HTML generation.\n\nGiven these points, the following search API calls are proposed to gather context for resolving the issue:\n\n1. Search for a class or method responsible for processing roles:\n    - `search_class(\"Role\")` or `search_class(\"Roles\")`\n    - `search_method(\"process_roles\")`\n    - `search_method(\"role\")` to find any method that might be registered or used to handle specific roles like `:kbd:`.\n\n2. Once the relevant class or method is identified, more targeted queries can be made to find the specific implementation details for the `:kbd:` role handling:\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"visit_kbd\", \"RoleVisitor\")` or a similar visitor class/method if the name is different in the actual codebase.\n    - `search_code(\"visit_kbd\")` to find custom handlers or overrides dealing with `<kbd>` elements. This search could yield results pointing to methods or functions that transform `:kbd:` role content into HTML.\n\nThese initial searches aim to pinpoint where in the Sphinx codebase `:kbd:` roles are converted into HTML, providing a foundation for understanding the current implementation and determining where modifications could be made to achieve the desired nested `<kbd>` tagging. Further searches may be necessary based on the results returned from these calls."

This method looks up a registered role by name (e.g., `:kbd:`) and returns an adapter function that encapsulates the processing logic for the role in question. The adapter is responsible for invoking the actual role processing function with the correct arguments, including the role name, raw text, and various metadata such as line numbers and inline options.\n\n#### Relationship with the Issue\n\nGiven that the issue involves converting `:kbd:` role inputs into structured HTML `<kbd>` elements, the mechanism described in `sphinx/domains/__init__.py` is likely a starting point for diving deeper into how Sphinx handles specific roles. The `role` method's ability to dynamically fetch and execute role processing functions indicates that somewhere in the Sphinx codebase, there should be a specific implementation for handling `:kbd:` roles, although it has not been directly identified yet.\n\nThe issue's intended behavior suggests enhancing or replacing the current `:kbd:` processing logic to account for nested or sequential `<kbd>` elements, aligning with more semantic HTML standards as recommended by MDN.\n\n### Analysis of `sphinx/ext/extlinks.py`\n\nThe `extlinks.py` result shows a specific implementation of a role processing function, likely used for a different kind of role that handles external links. It demonstrates how role functions receive text and other meta-information to produce document nodes representing the role's output, in this case, creating a hyperlink node.\n\n#### Relationship with the Issue\n\nThough not directly related to the `:kbd:` role, this example illustrates the expected structure and behavior of role processing functions in Sphinx. It suggests that a similar approach could be taken to parse the `:kbd:` role's text and split it into multiple `<kbd>` HTML elements as per the feature request.\n\n### Intended Behavior and Next Steps\n\nThe intended behavior, as gathered from the original issue, involves parsing the input given within a `:kbd:` role to individually wrap keys or key combinations in `<kbd>` elements, either flat or nested, for better semantic clarity. Given the current insights, the next logical step would include identifying or creating a specific role handler for `:kbd:` that can parse the keystrokes or key combinations and output the appropriately structured HTML.\n\n### Additional Context Required\n\nTo move towards a resolution, further context is needed specifically around how custom roles like `:kbd:` are registered and handled within Sphinx. Some potential next steps might involve:\n- Searching for functionality that registers or defines custom roles (`:kbd:` in this case), possibly with calls like `search_code(\"role('kbd'\")` to see if there's a registration or definition of a `:kbd:` role.\n- Looking into how role handlers are written by exploring other roles' implementations, assuming a similar approach can be adopted for `:kbd:`.\n- Inspecting the Sphinx documentation builder or HTML renderer code parts for any existing hooks or extension points that could be used or modified for the `:kbd:` role."

Since we haven't identified a specific handler for `:kbd:`, there's an implication that the work would either involve creating a new method/class for handling this role or enhancing an existing but yet unidentified part of the Sphinx codebase related to role processing.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\n\n- **File:** Likely within `sphinx/domains/__init__.py` or a similar file concerned with roles.\n- **Class/Method:** A new or existing role handling method for `:kbd:`.\n- **Intended Behavior:** This new or modified method should interpret the `:kbd:` directive's content, breaking it down into individual keys or key combinations and wrapping them in separate `<kbd>` HTML elements for semantic correctness and enhanced browser rendering. This method must be capable of handling complex inputs where keys are combined with modifiers (e.g., Control, Alt) or sequential inputs and producing nested or sequential `<kbd>` tags as illustrated in the issue description. The functionality should allow configuration or by default produce nested `<kbd>` elements to follow the MDN recommendation for key combinations, ensuring backward compatibility for documents expecting a single `<kbd>` tag."

The first snippet from `sphinx/roles.py` shows a loop registering roles using `roles.register_local_role` with a specific `rolename` and `role` object. This registration process involves creating a `CustomRole` with a given `rolename`, linked to a `GenericRole` associated with a `nodeclass`, and finally registering it. The second snippet is an extension of the first, iterating through `specific_docroles` to register additional roles with specific functions.\n\n#### What These Parts Do\n\nThese parts of the code are responsible for initializing and registering different roles that Sphinx's reStructuredText parser will recognize. By registering roles, Sphinx allows these elements to be identified in reStructuredText documents, processed, and translated into corresponding output formats, such as HTML.\n\n#### Relationship to the Bug\n\nThe relationship to the bug lies in the mechanism for registering roles: to modify or enhance the parsing and rendering of `:kbd:` role content, one might need to introduce a new role handler or modify an existing one. These snippets provide insight into where and how such role handlers are registered, which is crucial for implementing the desired nested or sequential `<kbd>` HTML tags for `:kbd:` content.\n\n#### Intended Behavior in Relation to the Issue\n\nGiven the issue's description, the intended behavior within the code registering roles would involve either identifying if a specific handler for `:kbd:` already exists among these roles and modifying it to handle the new rendering logic or introducing a new custom role for `:kbd:` that can parse the keystroke sequences and output them according to the proposed HTML structure. This might require creating a new `CustomRole` dedicated to `:kbd:` that defines how to take the raw keystroke text and transform it into the corresponding nested `<kbd>` elements as HTML.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\n- **Intended Behavior:** Incorporate or adjust a role handler for `:kbd:` within the Sphinx role registration process, specifically tailored to parse and render `:kbd:` content into the desired HTML format. This handler should be capable of understanding and splitting keystrokes or key combinations represented in the `:kbd:` content and wrapping them in individual or nested `<kbd>` tags.\n   \n- **Next Steps:** Identifying the current handling of the `:kbd:` role, if it exists, is essential\u2014requiring a closer examination of the existing roles and potentially the mechanism that interprets and renders reStructuredText into HTML. If a specific handler for `:kbd:` does not currently exist, the snippets from `roles.py` and `util/docutils.py` show how a new role can be registered and suggest a template for implementing a new handler. This involves:\n   - Creating a `CustomRole` for `:kbd:` that implements the processing logic for the desired HTML structure.\n   - Using `roles.register_local_role` or a similar mechanism within the appropriate scope (likely within `setup` functions or as part of an extension) to ensure the new or modified handler is registered and recognized by Sphinx."

Thus, proposed changes and necessary locations for implementation would be:\n\n### Bug Location and Intended Behavior\n\n- **File:** `sphinx/roles.py`\n  - This file is part of the mechanism for role registration and setup in Sphinx. Given the structure and examples seen in the search results, adding or modifying a role for `:kbd:` would logically be situated here.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The code in this file should include either the addition of a new custom role for `:kbd:` that contains logic for parsing the text content of the role to identify individual keystrokes or key sequences and construct nested or individual `<kbd>` HTML elements accordingly. This would involve parsing the input text to separate keys or key combinations and wrapping them in `<kbd>` tags, supporting both the individual and nested output formats as described in the issue.\n  - **Functionality to Add or Modify:** Add a new `CustomRole` for the `:kbd:` role if not already present, with a role function that implements the described logic. This new role function should maintain existing functionality for simple `<kbd>` cases while adding the ability to output more complex nested structures for key combinations. It may also be pertinent to extend the role registration setup process to include this new or modified role, ensuring it is recognized and properly handled by Sphinx when processing reStructuredText documents.\n\n### Additional Consideration\n\n- Due to the nature of the proposed change\u2014enhancing how a specific reStructuredText role (`:kbd:`) is handled to produce more semantic HTML\u2014the actual \"buggy\" location is not an existing fault in the code but rather an absent feature. Thus, the enhancement involves creating or modifying functionality rather than correcting a specific error.\n- Continuing from this point would involve closely reviewing documentation and Sphinx's handling of roles to ensure compatibility and prevent unintended side effects, especially preserving backward compatibility with documents that currently use the `:kbd:` role in its simpler form."
