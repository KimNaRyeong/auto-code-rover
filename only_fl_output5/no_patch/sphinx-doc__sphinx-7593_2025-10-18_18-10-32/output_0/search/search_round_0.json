Please describe.**\n[:kbd:](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/roles.html#role-kbd) describes \"a sequence of keystrokes\". Sphinx converts it to a single [`<kbd>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd) element:\n```\n:kbd:`Control-x Control-f`\n```\nbecomes\n```html\n<kbd>Control-x Control-f</kbd>\n```\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nPotentially sphinx could parse the `:kbd:` value and convert it to individual (or nested) `<kbd>` elements, which is what [MDN suggests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd#Representing_keystrokes_within_an_input) as a way to represent key combinations. Something like:\n```html\n<-- Individual -->\n<kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>f</kbd>\n<-- Nested -->\n<kbd>\n<kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>f</kbd>\n</kbd>\n```\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nAlternatively the sphinx user could rewrite their markup:\n```\n:kbd:`Control`\\ -\\ :kbd:`x` :kbd:`Control`\\ -\\ :kbd:`f`\n```\n**Related**\n- https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/3160\n- https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/4197\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given the issue's description revolves around Sphinx's handling of `:kbd:` role and the necessity to transform the markup into individual or nested `<kbd>` HTML tags, the focus should be on Sphinx's mechanism for rendering roles into HTML.\n\n- First, understanding how Sphinx processes and converts roles (like `:kbd:`) into HTML requires identifying the relevant class or method responsible for this transformation. Since roles are a part of Sphinx's reStructuredText (reST) processing, classes or methods related to the domain or roles processing would be relevant.\n\n- Sphinx extensions and core functionalities often reside within Python modules that can be located by inspecting classes and methods related to document processing, specifically those that handle roles or direct HTML generation.\n\nGiven these points, the following search API calls are proposed to gather context for resolving the issue:\n\n1. Search for a class or method responsible for processing roles:\n    - `search_class(\"Role\")` or `search_class(\"Roles\")`\n    - `search_method(\"process_roles\")`\n    - `search_method(\"role\")` to find any method that might be registered or used to handle specific roles like `:kbd:`.\n\n2. Once the relevant class or method is identified, more targeted queries can be made to find the specific implementation details for the `:kbd:` role handling:\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"visit_kbd\", \"RoleVisitor\")` or a similar visitor class/method if the name is different in the actual codebase.\n    - `search_code(\"visit_kbd\")` to find custom handlers or overrides dealing with `<kbd>` elements. This search could yield results pointing to methods or functions that transform `:kbd:` role content into HTML.\n\nThese initial searches aim to pinpoint where in the Sphinx codebase `:kbd:` roles are converted into HTML, providing a foundation for understanding the current implementation and determining where modifications could be made to achieve the desired nested `<kbd>` tagging. Further searches may be necessary based on the results returned from these calls."
