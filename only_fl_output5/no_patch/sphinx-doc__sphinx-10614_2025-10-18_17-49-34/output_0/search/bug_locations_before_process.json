        "intended_behavior": "The code within `InheritanceGraph` related to URL or path generation for links in SVG diagrams should ensure that paths are correctly calculated relative to the document in which the diagram is embedded, rather than relative to the SVG file itself. This adjustment will require ensuring that links are properly prefixed with the necessary path to correct for being nested within subdirectories. Specifically, when generating links, the code should consider the depth of the directory structure in which the output document resides and adjust the link paths accordingly. This could involve calculating the relative path from the document to the root of the documentation site and then appending this to the links within the SVG, ensuring they correctly point to the intended class documentation pages regardless of the document's location in the directory hierarchy. Preserve the existing functionality for diagrams in the root directory, ensuring that no regression occurs for those use cases."
