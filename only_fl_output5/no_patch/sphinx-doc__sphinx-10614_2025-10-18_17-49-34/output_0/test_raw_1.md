Given the requirements and clarifications, the following `reproducer.py` attempts to automate the validation of the SVG inheritance diagrams and their link integrity within a Sphinx documentation project. This script performs tasks such as setting up a minimal Sphinx environment, generating documentation with an inheritance diagram, and verifying the correctness of links in the generated SVG files.

Note: This script assumes the provided ZIP structure has been adapted into a minimal Sphinx project setup, with necessary files placed in expected directories (`docs_source`, etc.). Make sure to adjust paths and link checks based on your actual project setup and expected outcomes.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_environment():
    # Ensure Sphinx is installed
    subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "sphinx"], check=True)

def generate_docs():
    # Run Sphinx to generate the documentation
    cmd = ["sphinx-build", "-b", "html", "docs_source", "docs_build"]
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
    if result.returncode != 0:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Error generating documentation: {result.stderr}")

def check_svg_links():
    # This is a simplistic check for the presence of specific link structures in an SVG file.
    # In real usage, you'd need a more robust HTML/SVG parser.
    svg_file = os.path.join("docs_build", "my_package", "index.html")
    expected_links = ["my_package/my_class_1.html#my_package.MyClass1",
                      "my_package/my_class_2.html#my_package.MyClass2"]

    if not os.path.isfile(svg_file):
        raise AssertionError(f"SVG file not found: {svg_file}")

    with open(svg_file, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
        content = file.read()

    for link in expected_links:
        if link not in content:
            raise AssertionError(f"Expected link '{link}' not found in SVG content")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        setup_environment()
        print("Environment setup complete.")
        generate_docs()
        print("Documentation generation complete.")
        check_svg_links()
        print("Link verification complete. No issues found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
```

This script ensures the necessary Sphinx environment, compiles the provided Sphinx documentation, and performs a basic validation of the expected link structure within the generated SVG files. Make sure your Sphinx project (`docs_source`) and the target build directory (`docs_build`) correspond to those used in the script or adjust accordingly. Further, the script assumes the existence of an SVG file within `docs_build/my_package/index.html` that contains links structured as described. Adjust the `check_svg_links` function and the `expected_links` list to match the actual expected outcomes in your SVG files.
