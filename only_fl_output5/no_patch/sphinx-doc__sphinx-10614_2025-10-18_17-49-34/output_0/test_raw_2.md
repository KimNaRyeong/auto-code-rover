Creating a precise `reproducer.py` script to automatically reproduce the mentioned issue involves several steps, including setting up a Sphinx project, generating documentation with SVG diagrams, and verifying if the links in those diagrams lead to 404 pages as described. It's important, however, to note that such a verification can be somewhat tricky to automate fully due to the need to inspect the content of SVG files and potentially serve the documentation to verify links programmatically.

Given these constraints, the outlined Python script focuses on generating the necessary documentation and then analyzing the generated SVG files for incorrect links. This version simplifies some of the network-related complexities by not automatically serving and clicking links but instead analyzing the SVG file paths directly.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_environment():
    # Ensure Sphinx is installed
    subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "sphinx"], check=True)

def generate_docs():
    # Run Sphinx to generate the documentation
    source_dir = "docs_source"  # Adjust to your Sphinx source directory path
    build_dir = "docs_build"    # Adjust to your Sphinx build directory path
    cmd = ["sphinx-build", "-b", "html", source_dir, build_dir]
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
    if result.returncode != 0:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Error generating documentation: {result.stderr}")

def verify_svg_links():
    svg_file_path = os.path.join("docs_build", "my_package", "_images", "inheritance-*.svg")  # Adjust according to where SVG is generated
    # Normally you'd load and parse SVG content, but for simplicity, we're just checking existence
    svg_files = glob.glob(svg_file_path)
    if not svg_files:
        raise AssertionError("SVG file not found.")
    
    # Example of how to check for a problematic link structure, adjust as necessary
    problem_found = False
    for svg_file in svg_files:
        with open(svg_file, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            content = f.read()
            if "../my_class_1.html#my_package.MyClass1" in content:
                problem_found = True
    
    if problem_found:
        raise AssertionError("Incorrect SVG link structure found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        setup_environment()
        print("Environment setup complete.")
        generate_docs()
        print("Documentation generation complete.")
        
        verify_svg_links()
        print("SVG link verification complete. No issues found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
```

This script does the following:
- Installs Sphinx if it's not already present.
- Generates documentation from a specified source directory.
- Attempts to locate the SVG file(s) generated and inspects them for a specific problematic link structure (you'll need to adjust paths and logic to match your exact file names and expected links).

Note: The script is somewhat generic and might need adjustments to fit the specifics of your documentation structure, especially the `verify_svg_links` function, which should be tailored to accurately reflect how your SVG files are named and where they're located within the build directory.
