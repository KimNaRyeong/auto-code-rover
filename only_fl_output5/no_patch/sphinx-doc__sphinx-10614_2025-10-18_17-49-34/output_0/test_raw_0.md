Below is a `reproducer.py` script designed to automate the reproduction of the issue described earlier. By focusing on the critical behaviors and assertions based on the expected outcomes, the script verifies the integrity of generated SVG links in a Sphinx project structure. When executed in a project root similar to the structure provided in your ZIP file, it simulates the running environment, generates documentation, and analyzes the output SVG file for correct link formats.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys
from xml.etree import ElementTree

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_environment():
    subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "sphinx"], check=True)
    subprocess.run(["sphinx-build", "-b", "html", "docs_source", "docs_build"], check=True)

def verify_svg_link():
    svg_file_path = "docs_build/my_package/index.html"
    expected_link_suffix = "my_package/my_class_1.html#my_package.MyClass1"

    if not os.path.exists(svg_file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"SVG file not found at {svg_file_path}")

    with open(svg_file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
        content = file.read()
        # Using ElementTree to parse HTML may not be ideal due to potential malformed HTML issues,
        # but should work for this controlled scenario
        namespace = {"html": "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"}
        root = ElementTree.fromstring(content, parser=ElementTree.XMLParser(encoding='utf-8'))

        # Find SVG object embed tags assuming this structure. In real cases, might need more generic handling.
        object_tags = root.findall(".//html:object", namespace)
        for obj in object_tags:
            data = obj.attrib.get("data", "")
            if expected_link_suffix not in data:
                raise AssertionError("Expected SVG link not found in generated documentation")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        setup_environment()
        verify_svg_link()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    print("Issue not present, the links in SVG are correct.")
    sys.exit(0)
```

Please ensure you adapt the `docs_source` and `docs_build` paths according to your actual Sphinx documentation source and build directories. Also, adjust `expected_link_suffix` as needed based on the expected correct paths in the SVG files. This script assumes you have initialized a Sphinx project in `docs_source` as per your ZIP file's structure and configuration.

Remember, the script as presented tries to directly parse HTML with `ElementTree`, which may fail for complex or malformed HTML since `ElementTree` expects well-formed XML. If the exact HTML structure differs significantly or uses namespaces, additional adjustments may be required.
