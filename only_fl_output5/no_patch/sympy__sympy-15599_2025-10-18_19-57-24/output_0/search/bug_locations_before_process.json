        "intended_behavior": "The `eval` method in the `Mod` class should incorporate logic that allows it to detect and simplify modulo expressions where a factor present in the modulo numerator can be distributed or cancelled out from the expression. Specifically, when handling expressions like `Mod(3*i, 2)`, it should reduce them to `Mod(i, 2)` under appropriate conditions (e.g., when `i` is an integer). This simplification should only occur when it does not disrupt the existing functionality, which includes correctly evaluating modulo operations as per mathematical rules and maintaining current handling for cases not related to this specific pattern of simplification. The proposed patch outlines an approach for adjusting the internal handling within the `eval` method to detect such cases and apply the simplification accordingly, ensuring the output is more intuitively aligned with algebraic expectations.\n\nThis modification must preserve all previously established behaviors of the `eval` method for cases that do not match the specific pattern targeted by this bug fix. That includes handling of various numeric types, symbolic expressions, and any special cases already covered by the existing implementation."
