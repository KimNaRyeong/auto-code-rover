When dealing with negative indices, `_fit_transform` should correctly interpret these to reference the appropriate columns from the end of the data structure, similar to how negative indexing works with Python lists or arrays. This might involve implementing or ensuring a utility function used within or before `_fit_transform` (like `_get_column`) properly converts negative indices to positive ones based on the width of the input data `X` before selecting columns. This ensures that transformers receive the correct columns of `X` for fitting or transforming, irrespective of whether indices are specified as positive or negative values.\n\n### Location 2:\n- **File**: `sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py`\n- **Class**: `ColumnTransformer`\n- **Method**: `transform`\n  \n**Intended Behavior**: While `transform` primarily relies on `_fit_transform` for data processing, examining its use points to the need for ensuring all underlying mechanics correctly handle column selection, including the processing of negative indices. The intended behavior here is indirect\u2014this method should benefit from any lower-level fixes (such as in `_fit_transform` or utilities it calls) that ensure negative column indices are correctly processed. This method should continue to apply the fitted transformers to the appropriately selected columns of new input data `X`, regardless of whether those columns were specified using positive or negative indices during the fitting phase.\n\nThese modifications should preserve all existing functionalities of the `ColumnTransformer`, ensuring that all forms of index specifications (positive, negative, slices) are uniformly and correctly interpreted and applied, thus resolving the issue with negative indices as reported."
