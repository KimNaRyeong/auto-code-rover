When dealing with negative indices, _fit_transform should correctly interpret these to reference the appropriate columns from the end of the data structure, similar to how negative indexing works with Python lists or arrays. This might involve implementing or ensuring a utility function used within or before _fit_transform (like _get_column) properly converts negative indices to positive ones based on the width of the input data X before selecting columns. This ensures that transformers receive the correct columns of X for fitting or transforming, irrespective of whether indices are specified as positive or negative values."

The intended behavior here is indirect\u2014this method should benefit from any lower-level fixes (such as in _fit_transform or utilities it calls) that ensure negative column indices are correctly processed. This method should continue to apply the fitted transformers to the appropriately selected columns of new input data X, regardless of whether those columns were specified using positive or negative indices during the fitting phase."
