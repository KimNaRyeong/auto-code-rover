The absence of direct search results for these classes implies that we lack direct context about how these models are structured beyond what is provided in the issue description. It suggests a need for a broader search strategy, perhaps looking for files related to the `adminpricing` app or searching for usages of the `ForeignKey` relationships described.\n\n### `check_filterable` Method Search Results\nThe search for the `check_filterable` method returned information about its implementation from `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. This method's purpose is to raise an error if an expression cannot be used in a `WHERE` clause due to its `filterable` attribute being set to `False`. \n\n#### Analysis\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - `check_filterable` checks whether an expression (e.g., a model field or an annotation) is allowed to be used in filter operations by inspecting its `filterable` attribute. If `filterable` is `False`, it raises a `NotSupportedError`, preventing the filtering.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue occurs because Django raises a `NotSupportedError` when attempting to filter `ProductMetaData` objects by `metadata_type`. According to the traceback, this happens because `check_filterable` determines that `ProductMetaDataType` (or an expression involving it) should not be used in a filter clause. Given that the field's name in the `ProductMetaDataType` model is also `filterable`, there might be an unintended interaction between the model field's name and the internal mechanism Django uses to evaluate whether a field is filterable.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be for `check_filterable` to allow fields or relations to be used in filter expressions unless explicitly marked as not filterable by the developer. The issue seems to be an unintended catch by `check_filterable` because of the naming collision with the model's `filterable` field, not because the `metadata_type` field was intentionally marked as unfilterable.\n\n### Next Steps for Context Gathering:\nGiven the apparent relationship between the issue and Django\u2019s internal `filterable` handling, the next step should be to search for where the `ProductMetaDataType` and `ProductMetaData` models are used in relation to filtering operations. Since direct class searches did not yield results, alternative strategies could include:\n\n- Searching for files by the `adminpricing` app label to find model definitions (`search_code_in_file(\"class ProductMetaDataType\", \"adminpricing/models.py\")`, `search_code_in_file(\"class ProductMetaData\", \"adminpricing/models.py\")`).\n- Looking into the relationship definitions in other parts of the codebase that might be using `ProductMetaDataType` and `ProductMetaData`, specifically focusing on filtering-related operations or method calls that involve these models.\n\nThis approach may provide the necessary context to understand the bug's root cause and guide us towards a solution, such as renaming the `filterable` field in the `ProductMetaDataType` model to avoid conflict with Django's internal logic or applying a workaround that allows filtering without triggering the `NotSupportedError`."

Since directly modifying Django's source is not typically advisable for end-users or for a specific project's needs, the actual solution would likely involve either:\n  \n  - **Adjusting the model definition**: Ensuring that no field names in user-defined Django models collide with reserved or special names used internally by Django, such as `filterable`. This could mean renaming the `filterable` field in the `ProductMetaDataType` model to something that does not conflict, like `is_filterable` or `can_filter`. This approach preserves existing functionality but requires a change in the model definition and any parts of the application code that reference the `filterable` field.\n  \n  - **Customization or Extension within Django (less likely and more complex)**: If it was essential to fix this issue within Django's logic (for instance, to make Django's filtering mechanism more robust in handling naming collisions), a more in-depth adjustment would involve modifying how Django's `check_filterable` method distinguishes between a model's custom fields and its internal attributes. This approach would likely be much more complex and beyond the scope of a typical project fix, requiring changes in Django's core querying mechanisms to ensure that attributes named `filterable` within user-defined models do not trigger the `NotSupportedError`.\n  \n  However, the most practical and immediate fix would be to rename the `filterable` field in the `ProductMetaDataType` model to avoid this issue, which doesn't require modification of Django's internal methods but rather an adjustment on the project level to accommodate the framework's limitations.\n  \n  This analysis hinges on the assumption that the issue stems from a name collision between the model's `filterable` attribute and Django's internal use of a `filterable` check within `check_filterable`. The recommended approach is to rename the field in the user model to resolve this conflict, which is a change outside of Django's source code and within the control of the project's developers."
