        "intended_behavior": "The method `check_filterable` needs to be fixed or the handling of the `ProductMetaDataType` model (or similar user-defined models) needs adjustment to prevent a naming collision with Django's internal `filterable` attribute logic. Since directly modifying Django's source is not typically advisable for end-users or for a specific project's needs, the actual solution would likely involve either:\n\n- **Adjusting the model definition**: Ensuring that no field names in user-defined Django models collide with reserved or special names used internally by Django, such as `filterable`. This could mean renaming the `filterable` field in the `ProductMetaDataType` model to something that does not conflict, like `is_filterable` or `can_filter`. This approach preserves existing functionality but requires a change in the model definition and any parts of the application code that reference the `filterable` field.\n\n- **Customization or Extension within Django (less likely and more complex)**: If it was essential to fix this issue within Django's logic (for instance, to make Django's filtering mechanism more robust in handling naming collisions), a more in-depth adjustment would involve modifying how Django's `check_filterable` method distinguishes between a model's custom fields and its internal attributes. This approach would likely be much more complex and beyond the scope of a typical project fix, requiring changes in Django's core querying mechanisms to ensure that attributes named `filterable` within user-defined models do not trigger the `NotSupportedError`.\n\nHowever, the most practical and immediate fix would be to rename the `filterable` field in the `ProductMetaDataType` model to avoid this issue, which doesn't require modification of Django's internal methods but rather an adjustment on the project level to accommodate the framework's limitations.\n\nThis analysis hinges on the assumption that the issue stems from a name collision between the model's `filterable` attribute and Django's internal use of a `filterable` check within `check_filterable`. The recommended approach is to rename the field in the user model to resolve this conflict, which is a change outside of Django's source code and within the control of the project's developers."
