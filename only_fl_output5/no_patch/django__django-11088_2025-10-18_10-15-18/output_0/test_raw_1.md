To accurately reproduce the Django migration issue described, we need to simulate the real steps that cause the problem, including creating migrations, applying them, and then attempting to reverse a migration that involves changing a `BinaryField` default value from an empty string (`''`) to empty bytes (`b''`). The revised script below adheres to these requirements more closely, encapsulates the operations within Django's framework capabilities, and avoids direct invocation of methods not meant for such a process. This implementation should capture the essence of the problem:

```python
import os
import sys
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models, migrations, connections, OperationalError
from django.core.management.color import no_style

# Minimal Django project settings
settings.configure(
    DEBUG=True,
    USE_TZ=True,
    DATABASES={
        "default": {
            "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
            "NAME": ":memory:",  # Use an in-memory database for simplicity
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=["__main__"],
)

django.setup()

# Define models to simulate the actions described in the issue
class InitialMigration(migrations.Migration):
    initial = True

    operations = [
        migrations.CreateModel(
            name="TableOne",
            fields=[
                ("id", models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),
                ("field1", models.BinaryField(default='')),  # Initial default as an empty string
            ],
        ),
    ]

class AlterFieldMigration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ("__main__", "0001_initial"),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.AlterField(
            model_name="tableone",
            name="field1",
            field=models.BinaryField(default=b''),  # Changed default to empty bytes
        ),
    ]

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_migration(migration_class):
    migration = migration_class("0001_initial" if migration_class == InitialMigration else "0002_alter_field", "__main__")
    connection = connections["default"]
    connection.prepare_database()
    project_state = connection.migration_executor.loader.project_state((migration.app_label, migration.name))
    with connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:
        migration.apply(project_state, schema_editor)

def revert_migration():
    connection = connections["default"]
    migration = AlterFieldMigration("0002_alter_field", "__main__")
    try:
        # Directly revert the specific migration
        connection.migration_executor.migrate([("__main__", "0001_initial")])
        print("Migration reverted successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise  # Re-raise the exception after printing the stacktrace to allow observing the issue

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        # Apply the initial migration and follow-up changes
        run_migration(InitialMigration)
        run_migration(AlterFieldMigration)
        # Attempt to revert the migration change
        revert_migration()
    except OperationalError as e:
        print("An OperationalError occurred:", e)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero status to indicate failure
```

Note: This script must be executed in an environment where Django is installed and accessible. It's designed around Django's migration system, dynamically applying and attempting to revert a migration that changes a `BinaryField`'s default from an empty string to empty bytes, aiming to replicate the specific issue described. Adjustments might be required based on the actual Django and database versions in your project setup.
