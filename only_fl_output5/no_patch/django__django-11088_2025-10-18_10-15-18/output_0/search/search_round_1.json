        "content": "Given the information from the issue, we need to investigate several parts of the Django codebase specifically related to handling the default value of `BinaryField` during migrations. The exception hint at problems during the `unapply_migration` and `alter_field` method calls for a `BinaryField` when migrating backwards. \n\nTo gain more context, we should look for:\n1. The `BinaryField` class to understand how it's defined and handles defaults.\n2. The `effective_default` method in `schema.py` where the proposed fix should be applied.\n3. The `alter_field` method in both the base `schema.py` and the PostgreSQL-specific `schema.py`, since the stack trace involves calls to these methods.\n4. The `unapply_migration` and `_migrate_all_backwards` methods to see how migrations are handled and where the error might be originating in the process.\n\nLet's break down the API calls that would be necessary:\n\n1. To investigate how `BinaryField` handles defaults, we would look up the `BinaryField` class.\n```python\nsearch_class(\"BinaryField\")\n```\n\n2. To get context about where the fix might be applied, and to understand how defaults are computed for schema operations:\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"effective_default\", \"django/db/backends/base/schema.py\")\n```\n\n3. Seeing how `alter_field` is implemented can give hints on the operation causing the type error, hence we check the base implementation and the PostgreSQL specific one:\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"alter_field\", \"django/db/backends/base/schema.py\")\nsearch_method_in_file(\"alter_field\", \"django/db/backends/postgresql/schema.py\")\n```\n\n4. To understand the migration process that leads to this error, we need to look at `unapply_migration` and `_migrate_all_backwards` methods in the executor to see how backward migrations are handled:\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"unapply_migration\", \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\")\nsearch_method_in_file(\"_migrate_all_backwards\", \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\")\n```\n\nThese API calls should provide sufficient context for understanding how `BinaryField` defaults are handled during migration operations and where the problem with migrating backwards from a non-bytestring default could be occurring."

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. `BinaryField` Class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \n  The `BinaryField` class represents a database field for storing raw binary data. It includes methods for initialization, deconstruction, internal type representation, placeholder handling, default value handling, value preparation for the database, converting to a string representation, and Python value conversion.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug:**  \n  The issue mentions a type error when migrating a `BinaryField`'s default value from `''` (an empty string) to `b''` (an empty byte string) and then attempting to reverse this migration. The `BinaryField` class defines how binary data should be handled, including default values if any. The handling of default values and possibly the internal type and preparation of values for the database are directly related to the bug.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**  \n  Ideally, when the default is specified as an empty string (`''`) initially and later changed to an empty bytes string (`b''`), migrations should handle both scenarios correctly. Specifically, reversing the migration should not result in a type error since both initializations intend to represent \"empty\" data for a `BinaryField`.\n\n#### 2. `effective_default` Method in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \n  The `effective_default` function computes the effective database default value of a field. It utilizes `field.get_db_prep_save` to prepare the field's default value for saving in the database, based on an internal effective default method.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug:**  \n  The issue includes a suggested fix in the `effective_default` method, indicating that this function is crucial in how default values are prepared and interpreted during migrations. The problem seems to arise when handling default values for `BinaryField`, especially when the default changes between string types.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**  \n  `effective_default` should correctly handle `BinaryField`'s default values, regardless of whether they are initially set as strings or byte strings. The method should ensure that reversing a migration involving a default value change respects the type expected by `BinaryField`.\n\n#### 3. `alter_field` Method in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \n  This function allows modification of a field's database characteristics, such as type, uniqueness, nullability, defaults, and constraints. It is responsible for carrying out the changes in the database schema when a field is altered between migrations.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug:**  \n  Given that the traceback involves the `alter_field` method during the migration reversal process, this method is a key area where the reported type error occurs. It attempts to apply changes to the field's schema based on the new and old field definitions, showing where the type incompatibility might be triggering the error.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**  \n  During a reversal of a migration that changes a `BinaryField`'s default, `alter_field` should seamlessly manage the transition between different default values without resulting in type errors. This implies correctly interpreting the field changes and applying them, respecting the data types involved.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nIn addressing the bug, a key focus should be on ensuring the `effective_default` and `alter_field` methods handle `BinaryField`'s default values properly during migrations. Specifically, transitions between string and byte string defaults should be seamlessly managed to prevent type errors, maintaining consistency with how `BinaryField` expects to process and store its data. Further steps would involve adjusting these methods to correctly interpret and apply migrations involving changes to binary field defaults."

Bug Locations:\n\n**Location 1:**  \n- **File:** `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`  \n- **Class:** `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`  \n- **Method:** `effective_default`  \n\n  - **Intended Behavior:**  \n    This method should include additional logic to handle the default value of `BinaryField` correctly when the default is specified as `''` (an empty string) initially and later changed to `b''` (an empty byte string). The fix should ensure that when computing the effective database default for a `BinaryField`, it interprets both `''` and `b''` appropriately, specifically when reverting migrations. The method should check if the field is a `BinaryField` and if its default is a non-byte string (e.g., `''`), then it should correctly handle or convert this to `b''` before attempting to prepare it for the database. This maintains the existing functionality while ensuring compatibility with the expected binary data type in backward migrations.\n\n**Location 2:**  \n- **File:** `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`  \n- **Class:** `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`  \n- **Method:** `alter_field`  \n\n  - **Intended Behavior:**  \n    While `alter_field` primarily may not be faulty in its current logic, improvements or checks added in the context of handling `BinaryField` migrations might impact this method. Ensuring that any adjustments made to handling defaults or type checks in `effective_default` are consistently applied or recognized in `alter_field` operations. This means that during a schema alteration that involves a `BinaryField`, especially with default value changes, the method should rely on the corrected logic in `effective_default` (or elsewhere if applicable) to prevent type errors. It's about ensuring the `alter_field` method cooperates with the fixed logic for handling default values seamlessly, thus preventing the type error from occurring during migration and rollback scenarios involving binary fields. \n\nThese adjustments aim to address the specific issue encountered when reversing migrations involving `BinaryField` default changes, ensuring the migrations system remains robust and error-free under these conditions."
