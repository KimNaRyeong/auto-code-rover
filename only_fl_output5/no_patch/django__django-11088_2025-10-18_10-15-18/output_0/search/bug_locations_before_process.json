The fix should ensure that when computing the effective database default for a `BinaryField`, it interprets both `''` and `b''` appropriately, specifically when reverting migrations. The method should check if the field is a `BinaryField` and if its default is a non-byte string (e.g., `''`), then it should correctly handle or convert this to `b''` before attempting to prepare it for the database. This maintains the existing functionality while ensuring compatibility with the expected binary data type in backward migrations."

        "intended_behavior": "While `alter_field` primarily may not be faulty in its current logic, improvements or checks added in the context of handling `BinaryField` migrations might impact this method. Ensuring that any adjustments made to handling defaults or type checks in `effective_default` are consistently applied or recognized in `alter_field` operations. This means that during a schema alteration that involves a `BinaryField`, especially with default value changes, the method should rely on the corrected logic in `effective_default` (or elsewhere if applicable) to prevent type errors. It's about ensuring the `alter_field` method cooperates with the fixed logic for handling default values seamlessly, thus preventing the type error from occurring during migration and rollback scenarios involving binary fields."
