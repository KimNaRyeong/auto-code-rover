        "content": "<issue>SparsePCA incorrectly scales results in .transform()\n#### Description\nWhen using `SparsePCA`, the `transform()` method incorrectly scales the results based on the *number of rows* in the data matrix passed.\n#### Proposed Fix\nI am regrettably unable to do a pull request from where I sit. The issue is with this chunk of code, as of writing this at [line number 179 in sparse_pca.py](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/decomposition/sparse_pca.py#L179):\n```python\nU = ridge_regression(self.components_.T, X.T, ridge_alpha,\nsolver='cholesky')\ns = np.sqrt((U ** 2).sum(axis=0))\ns[s == 0] = 1\nU /= s\nreturn U\n```\nI honestly do not understand the details of the chosen implementation of SparsePCA. Depending on the objectives of the class, making use of the features as significant for unseen examples requires one of two modifications. Either (a) **learn** the scale factor `s` from the training data (i.e., make it an instance attribute like `.scale_factor_`), or (b) use `.mean(axis=0)` instead of `.sum(axis=0)` to remove the number-of-examples dependency.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```python\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import SparsePCA\nimport numpy as np\ndef get_data( count, seed ):\nnp.random.seed(seed)\ncol1 = np.random.random(count)\ncol2 = np.random.random(count)\ndata = np.hstack([ a[:,np.newaxis] for a in [\ncol1 + .01*np.random.random(count),\n-col1 + .01*np.random.random(count),\n2*col1 + col2 + .01*np.random.random(count),\ncol2 + .01*np.random.random(count),\n]])\nreturn data\ntrain = get_data(1000,1)\nspca = SparsePCA(max_iter=20)\nresults_train = spca.fit_transform( train )\ntest = get_data(10,1)\nresults_test = spca.transform( test )\nprint( \"Training statistics:\" )\nprint( \"  mean: %12.3f\" % results_train.mean() )\nprint( \"   max: %12.3f\" % results_train.max() )\nprint( \"   min: %12.3f\" % results_train.min() )\nprint( \"Testing statistics:\" )\nprint( \"  mean: %12.3f\" % results_test.mean() )\nprint( \"   max: %12.3f\" % results_test.max() )\nprint( \"   min: %12.3f\" % results_test.min() )\n```\nOutput:\n```\nTraining statistics:\nmean:       -0.009\nmax:        0.067\nmin:       -0.080\nTesting statistics:\nmean:       -0.107\nmax:        0.260\nmin:       -0.607\n```\n#### Expected Results\nThe test results min/max values are on the same scale as the training results.\n#### Actual Results\nThe test results min/max values are much larger than the training results, because fewer examples were used. It is trivial to repeat this process with various sizes of training and testing data to see the relationship.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context reveals important insights about the `SparsePCA` class, particularly its `transform()` method, and the specific code block of concern.\n\n1. **Functionality of the `transform()` Method in `SparsePCA`**:\n   - The `transform()` method in the `SparsePCA` class is designed to project the input data `X` onto the space spanned by the sparse components found during the `fit()` process. The method takes into account the possibility of under-determined systems by allowing for ridge regularization through the `ridge_alpha` parameter. The issue here revolves around how this projection is computed and scaled. Following steps are performed:\n        - **Ridge Regression**: The method first performs a ridge regression on the transposed input data `X.T` against the sparse components `self.components_.T` using the specified `ridge_alpha`. This results in a matrix `U`.\n        - **Normalization**: It then calculates the Euclidean norm (L2 norm) of the columns of `U`, and normalizes each column by this norm. This is the part of the code where the scaling issue is highlighted.\n\n2. **Relationship to the Bug**:\n   - The issue identified is linked to the normalization step (`s = np.sqrt((U ** 2).sum(axis=0))` and `U /= s`). Specifically, the problem is that the scaling factor `s` is recalculated for each call to `transform()`, depending solely on the number of rows (samples) in the input data `X`. This leads to an inconsistency in the scales of the output when transforming different datasets (e.g., training vs test data), which should not happen as the transformation should ideally be consistent irrespective of the dataset size.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**:\n   - The `transform()` method should project the input data onto the sparse components in a consistent scale, independent of the dataset size. The objective is to adjust the current scaling method to ensure that the scale of projection does not vary with the number of samples in the input dataset. To align with the issue description, there are two proposed solutions:\n        - **Option (a)**: The scaling factor `s` should be learned from the training data and stored as an instance attribute (e.g., `.scale_factor_`). This way, the same scaling can be applied across different datasets, ensuring consistent scaling.\n        - **Option (b)**: Instead of summing over the axis to calculate `s`, using the mean (`.mean(axis=0)`) could help mitigate the dependence on the number of samples, as the mean would naturally account for the dataset size, making the scaling factor more consistent across different dataset sizes.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next step entails revising the `transform()` method implementation to incorporate either of the suggested approaches, considering the broader implications on the class's functionality and consistency with scikit-learn's design principles. Additionally, further investigation into scikit-learn's codebase for handling similar scaling issues in other components might offer valuable insights for aligning the solution with established patterns."

The intended fix would either involve learning the scale factor `s` from the training data and making it an instance attribute or modifying the calculation to reduce dependency on the dataset size. The proposed solutions are:\n       - **Option (a)**: Modify the `fit()` method to compute and store a scale factor `s` based on the training data, and then use this stored scale factor during the `transform()` call. This involves introducing a new instance attribute (e.g., `self.scale_factor_`) that holds the scale factor calculated during training. The scale factor would be calculated similarly (`np.sqrt((U ** 2).sum(axis=0))`), but only during `fit()`, and `transform()` would apply this precomputed scale factor instead of recalculating it.\n       - **Option (b)**: Change the scaling operation in `transform()` to use the mean instead of the sum (`s = np.sqrt((U ** 2).mean(axis=0))`). This ensures the scaling factor accounts for the number of samples, thereby reducing scale variance across different dataset sizes without the need to compute or store any additional data from the training phase.\n  \nEither solution requires careful consideration and testing to ensure it aligns with the overall design and functionality of the SparsePCA implementation and does not introduce side effects, especially considering the broader ecosystem of scikit-learn's transformer classes."
