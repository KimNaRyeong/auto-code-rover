        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `transform()` method's behavior needs adjustment in how it scales the result of the ridge regression. The intended fix would either involve learning the scale factor `s` from the training data and making it an instance attribute or modifying the calculation to reduce dependency on the dataset size. The proposed solutions are:\n      - **Option (a)**: Modify the `fit()` method to compute and store a scale factor `s` based on the training data, and then use this stored scale factor during the `transform()` call. This involves introducing a new instance attribute (e.g., `self.scale_factor_`) that holds the scale factor calculated during training. The scale factor would be calculated similarly (`np.sqrt((U ** 2).sum(axis=0))`), but only during `fit()`, and `transform()` would apply this precomputed scale factor instead of recalculating it.\n      - **Option (b)**: Change the scaling operation in `transform()` to use the mean instead of the sum (`s = np.sqrt((U ** 2).mean(axis=0))`). This ensures the scaling factor accounts for the number of samples, thereby reducing scale variance across different dataset sizes without the need to compute or store any additional data from the training phase."
