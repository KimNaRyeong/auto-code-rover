Here are the search API calls that can be useful:\n\n1. Examine the definition of `LookImage` model to understand how `_order` and `look` fields are implemented and any related configuration that might impact the order_with_respect_to behavior or the indexes.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"LookImage\")\n```\n\n2. Check how migrations specifically related to `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` are handled within the project. This might require looking into the migration files or any custom migration operations if existent.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"AlterOrderWithRespectTo\")\nsearch_method(\"AddIndex\")\n```\n\n3. Since the issue mentions that including `_order` in an index and then attempting an `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation is causing a crash, it will be beneficial to understand how `_order` field is managed or manipulated across the project. This includes checking if there are any explicit definitions or manipulations of `_order` field.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"_order\")\n```\n\nThese calls aim to provide comprehensive details on the model's structure, the interaction between `_order` and indexing within migrations, and any project-specific handling of order with respect to operations that could inform the resolution of the issue."
