        "content": "To gather the necessary code context for resolving the issue regarding the use of window expressions in conditional statements within the SELECT clause, I will perform the following API calls:\n\n1. Since the issue mentions a problem with Django's ORM, particularly with the `annotate` method and how it handles the `Window` function and `Case` function in the given code snippet, it's essential to look at the implementation of these methods. I'll start by finding the file where the `Window` and `Case` classes are defined, and the method that processes these expressions for SQL queries.\n\n2. Given the regression is identified by a commit hash `4edad1ddf6203326e0be4bdb105beecb0fe454c4`, it would be useful to look into the changes made in that commit. However, since direct access to the commit might not be available through these APIs, focusing on relevant classes and methods is the next best step.\n\nHere are the API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"Window\")`: To find the definition of the Window class.\n- `search_class(\"Case\")`: To find the definition and implementation of the Case expression class.\n- `search_method(\"annotate\")`: To locate where the annotate method is defined, as this is a central feature mentioned in the issue.\n- `search_code(\"NotSupportedError\")`: To find where and how `NotSupportedError` is raised in relation to window functions or expressions.\n\nThe outcome of these calls will provide insights into how `Window` expressions and `Case` statements are processed, where the error might be thrown, and the annotations' handling which is critical in understanding how to address the reported issue."
