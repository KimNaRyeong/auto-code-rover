To avoid the issue of an existing directory and to handle the situation more gracefully, the revised script now includes checks and error handling to manage the cloning process more effectively. It will assert the issue when the specific warning message about duplicate terms is detected in the Sphinx build output and cleans up before attempting to clone the repository to avoid a 'directory already exists' error. 

Additionally, based on the feedback, I've added more robust exception handling to capture AssertionError appropriately and provide a clear output based on the assertion condition.

```python
import subprocess
import os
import shutil
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_environment():
    # Ensure the 'phpmyadmin' directory does not exist before cloning
    if os.path.exists('phpmyadmin'):
        shutil.rmtree('phpmyadmin')
    
    # Clone the phpMyAdmin repository
    git_clone_command = ['git', 'clone', '--depth', '1', 'https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin.git']
    subprocess.run(git_clone_command, check=True)

def build_docs():
    os.chdir('phpmyadmin/doc')
    
    # Ensure Sphinx is installed
    subprocess.run(['pip', 'install', 'Sphinx==3.0.0'], check=True)

    # Run the Sphinx build process and capture output
    result = subprocess.run(['make', 'html'], capture_output=True, text=True, check=False)
    
    os.chdir('../..')  # Return to the root directory
    
    return result

def check_for_issue(output):
    warning_text = "duplicate term description of mysql, other instance in glossary"
    return warning_text in output

def main():
    try:
        setup_environment()
        build_result = build_docs()
        assert not check_for_issue(build_result.stderr), "Issue detected: 'MySQL' and 'mysql' treated as duplicate terms."
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version of `reproducer.py` aims to:

- Cleanly setup the environment by removing any pre-existing `phpmyadmin` directory.
- Execute the building of docs and checks for the specified issue.
- Utilize the provided `print_stacktrace` function for detailed error output.
- Ensure an appropriate exit status based on the assertion or unexpected errors.

Before running the script, ensure that Python and the necessary permissions for file creation and deletion in the working directory are set correctly to allow for the removal of directories and installation of packages.
