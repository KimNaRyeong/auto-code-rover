Based on the requirements, I've updated the script to directly address the reproduction of the issue described. This revised script will attempt to detect the specific problem related to the glossary term case sensitivity in Sphinx documentation build process. Please make sure that you're running this in an appropriate environment where `git`, `pip`, and access to the required directories are available.

```python
import subprocess
import sys
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_environment():
    # Avoiding redundancy by checking if the directory exists
    if not os.path.exists('phpmyadmin'):
        # Clone the phpMyAdmin repository
        git_clone_command = ['git', 'clone', '--depth', '1', 'https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin.git']
        subprocess.run(git_clone_command, check=True)
    else:
        print("phpMyAdmin already cloned, skipping...")

    os.chdir('phpmyadmin/doc')

    # Ensure Sphinx is installed specifically for this Python environment
    subprocess.run([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', 'Sphinx'], check=True)

def build_docs():
    try:
        # Attempt to build the docs with Sphinx
        # Note: We're not specifying Sphinx version here, assuming Sphinx needs to be updated as per requirements
        result = subprocess.run(['make', 'html'], capture_output=True, text=True)
        return result
    finally:
        os.chdir('../..')  # Ensuring we move back to the root directory

def check_for_issue(build_result):
    warning_fragment = "duplicate term description of mysql, other instance in glossary"
    if warning_fragment in build_result.stderr:
        raise AssertionError(f"Issue detected: Terms 'MySQL' and 'mysql' are treated as duplicates - {warning_fragment}")

def main():
    try:
        setup_environment()
        build_result = build_docs()
        check_for_issue(build_result)
        print("No issue detected, build completed successfully without errors relating to glossary terms.")
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script aims to:
- Clone the `phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin` repository if not already cloned.
- Install Sphinx via pip, ensuring dependencies are met for building the documentation.
- Build the documentation inside the `phpmyadmin/doc` directory and captures the output.
- Assess the output for the specified issue related to duplicate glossary terms.
- Utilize `print_stacktrace` to provide detailed output if an AssertionError occurs.

IMPORTANT: 
- This script now checks if `phpmyadmin` directory exists to avoid re-cloning. If you need to test with a fresh clone, please manually delete the existing `phpmyadmin` directory beforehand.
- It changes to the `phpmyadmin/doc` directory assuming that is the structure after cloning. If the script fails due to directory not found, please check the cloned directory structure.
- Adjustments might be necessary depending on the actual Python environment and permissions.
