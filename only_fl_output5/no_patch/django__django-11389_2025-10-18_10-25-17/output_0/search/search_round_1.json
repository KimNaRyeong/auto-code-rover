        "content": "Analyzing the collected context sheds light on several aspects relevant to the issue about making the session cookie age dynamic:\n\n1. **SessionStore Classes:**\n   - The `SessionStore` class is implemented across multiple backends in Django (`db.py`, `file.py`, `cached_db.py`, `signed_cookies.py`, and `cache.py`). This indicates that the session handling mechanism can vary depending on the backend used, but they all share a common interface or base class for managing sessions.\n   \n2. **get_expiry_age and get_expiry_date Methods:**\n   - The search did not find the `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date` methods directly within the `SessionStore` class. This suggests either these methods do not explicitly exist within the `SessionStore` class or they are inherited or dynamically generated. The absence could also imply these methods are part of the base class or a mixin that wasn\u2019t directly searched.\n   \n3. **Usage of SESSION_COOKIE_AGE:**\n   - The reference to `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` in various files (`file.py`, `base.py`, `signed_cookies.py`, `global_settings.py`) indicates its role as a configuration setting across different session backends. It\u2019s directly involved in session expiration handling and is likely used as a default or fallback value for the session expiry age.\n   - Particularly, the mention in `base.py` could be critical as this file might contain the base implementation for session backends, including possibly the `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date` methods which were not found when looking in the `SessionStore` class directly.\n\nGiven this analysis, the intended behavior for resolving the issue should involve modifying how `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` is utilized within the session management process to allow for dynamic determination based on session parameters rather than using a static setting.\n\nTo dig deeper, more specific API calls should be made to understand the implementation of the base session backend (likely indicated by references in `base.py`) since this seems to be where the `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` setting is most commonly interacted with, and where the potentially missing `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date` methods might be found.\n\n**Next Steps Based on Analysis:**\n\n1. Investigate `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py`, as it was mentioned in relation to `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` and is likely the place where the session base logic, including expiration handling, is implemented. This could involve looking for the actual implementations of `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date` or any logic directly manipulating `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`.\n\nGiven this understanding, here are specific follow-up API calls that could be made:\n- `search_class_in_file(\"SessionBase\", \"django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py\")`: To get more details about the base class for sessions.\n- `search_method_in_file(\"get_expiry_age\", \"django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py\")`\n- `search_method_in_file(\"get_expiry_date\", \"django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py\")`: These two calls will help in understanding how expiration age and date are managed within session backends and how `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` is applied in this context."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

The method should retain its original functionality of returning a default session expiry age but should be enhanced to evaluate conditions or session attributes that dictate a different expiry age. This approach will allow developers to customize session expiry logic dynamically, based on the current session's characteristics or user attributes.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py`\n  - **Class:** `SessionBase`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Similar to `get_expiry_age`, the `get_expiry_date` method should be reviewed or implemented to dynamically compute the session expiry date based on similar criteria or session parameters. While preserving its original role of providing a fixed expiry date calculated from `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`, it should also factor in the option for dynamic expiry dates. This would support use cases requiring sessions with variable duration beyond the static setting provided by `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`.\n\nThe intention behind both modifications is to maintain backward compatibility with existing Django applications by ensuring that if no dynamic conditions are defined, the session expiration behaves as it currently does, using the `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` setting from the project's settings. However, for applications needing more nuanced session management, developers can override these methods in their session store implementations to provide custom logic for determining session expiration."
