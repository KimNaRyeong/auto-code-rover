The method should be extended to invoke a customizable hook or callback function, provided by developers, that allows for dynamic computation of expiry age based on the current session state or other application-specific criteria. This hook can default to returning the `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`, preserving current functionality where not overridden."

        "intended_behavior": "Similarly, the `get_expiry_date` method should be updated to incorporate dynamic determinations of session expiry date. This could involve adjusting the logic to utilize a dynamically computed expiry age (potentially leveraging the adjustments made to `get_expiry_age`) or by directly introducing a mechanism to compute a dynamic expiry date, possibly through a hook or overridable method. This method should remain backwards compatible, using the existing logic as the default behavior when no dynamic computation is provided."
