Given your request, I'll adjust my previous response to ensure the script `reproducer.py` matches your requirements precisely. Please see the revised version below:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_issue():
    from sympy import Symbol, Range, FiniteSet
    n = Symbol('n', integer=True)
    try:
        result = Range(1).intersect(FiniteSet(n))
        # Since the exact output can vary, we primarily check for the absence of TypeError
        # This line should not be reached if the issue is present
        assert False, "Expected to raise TypeError but didn't."
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Identifying that the expected error occurred.
        print("Issue detected as expected. The test successfully reproduced the problem.")
        return True  # Flag to indicate successful reproduction

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if test_issue():
        exit(0)  # Exiting with 0 to indicate successful reproduction of the issue
    else:
        exit(1)  # Exiting with code 1 as an indicator of test failure or issue resolution
```

This version includes the `print_stacktrace(e: Exception)` function for clear error reporting as described. When `test_issue()` is run:

- It attempts the code operation known to reproduce the issue.
- If the TypeError is caught, it signifies the issue's presence, correctly triggers `print_stacktrace`, and prints a confirmation message. It then exits with code 0, reflecting the scenario where the bug is intentionally reproduced.
- If, however, the operation does not throw `TypeError`, it asserts failure with a message. This behavior might indicate the issue has been resolved or altered in behavior. It then concludes with an exit code 1, indicating the test did not proceed as supposed, either due to resolution or other reasons unaccounted for in this script logic.

Please adjust the exit codes or handling logic as per your specific requirements for success or failure identification in your testing environment.
