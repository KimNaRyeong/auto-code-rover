        "intended_behavior": "The `_contains` method in the `Range` class needs to be modified to handle symbolic parameters safely and return a result that can defer evaluation or provide a symbolic relational response, rather than raising an error. Specifically, when checking if a symbolic value is contained within the range, the method should not attempt a direct comparison that leads to a boolean but rather return a relational expression that symbolically describes the condition under which the symbol is part of the range. This modification ensures that operations involving symbols can be logically consistent without prematurely evaluating to a concrete truth value, preserving the method's existing functionality while extending its applicability to symbolic reasoning."

        "intended_behavior": "Within the `_handle_finite_sets` method, enhancements are needed to gracefully handle cases where the evaluation of element containment leads to indeterminate truth values (i.e., `None` from `fuzzy_and`). This method should maintain its functionality of simplifying finite set intersections while integrating a logic that either disregards symbolic elements from causing premature boolean evaluation or includes these elements in a way that symbolically represents their conditional membership in the resulting intersection. The handling of symbolic elements should allow `Intersection` operations involving both concrete and symbolic members to proceed without error, producing results that accurately reflect the potential for symbolic elements to belong to the intersection under certain conditions."
