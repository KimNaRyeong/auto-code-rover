        "intended_behavior": "This method needs to be modified to include an additional keyword argument that allows users to explicitly request that the contour levels they provide are used exactly as specified, even if all the specified levels do not fall within the current data range. This modification should: - Introduce a new keyword argument (e.g., 'override_autoscale') to the ContourSet initialization method and ensure it is passed down to the '_process_contour_level_args' method. This requires modifications in how ContourSet and possibly 'contour' methods handle their arguments. - Modify the conditional logic within '_process_contour_level_args' to check this 'override_autoscale' flag. Specifically, it should bypass the logic that resets 'self.levels' to '[self.zmin]' if the flag is set, thereby preserving the user-defined levels regardless of the data range. - This addition should maintain backward compatibility by defaulting the 'override_autoscale' flag to 'False', ensuring the current autoscaling behavior remains unchanged unless explicitly overridden by the user. - The solution must ensure that if the 'override_autoscale' flag is set but no levels are explicitly provided by the user (or if the levels are not suitable for plotting for other reasons, e.g., not being in ascending order), appropriate error handling or warnings should still be issued. This balances the request for greater control with the need to inform users of potential issues with their specified contour levels."
