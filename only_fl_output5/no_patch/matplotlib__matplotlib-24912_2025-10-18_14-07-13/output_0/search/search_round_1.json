        "content": "<issue>[ENH]: Allow override of contour level autoscaling\n### Problem\nIn Matplotlib 3, when using a list of values for the `levels` argument in `contour()`, the list of values is overridden in the case that all requested levels fall outside the data range. While this may be desirable for casually browsing data when the user is unfamiliar with the data range, it causes serious problems for batch applications where the user legitimately intends to use their list of levels but does not know whether every input array will produce contours.\nExample:\n```\nmyplot = plt.contour( x , y , data , levels = [100] )\nprint( myplot.levels )\n```\nThe above prints `[0.0]` when `data` is an array of values ranging from 0 to 50 (i.e., the requested contour level of 100 is outside the data range). As a result, the plot contains erroneous contours around near-zero values, presumably due to floating point precision.\nThis is a consequence of the change described here (https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_3.0.0.html?highlight=contour%20levels):\n> Selection of contour levels is now the same for contour and contourf; previously, for contour, levels outside the data range were deleted. **(Exception: if no contour levels are found within the data range, the levels attribute is replaced with a list holding only the minimum of the data range.)**\n### Proposed solution\nAdd a kwarg to `contour()` that overrides the autoscaling behavior. When the kwarg is set, it would trigger a flag in `_process_contour_level_args()` (https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/main/lib/matplotlib/contour.py):\n```\nif not self.filled:\ninside = (self.levels > self.zmin) & (self.levels < self.zmax)\nlevels_in = self.levels[inside]\nif len(levels_in) == 0 and not(OVERRIDE_AUTOSCALE_FLAG):\nself.levels = [self.zmin]\n_api.warn_external(\n\"No contour levels were found within the data range.\")\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides valuable insights into the issue and its potential resolution. Here's a breakdown based on the questions:\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\nThe code within the `_process_contour_level_args` method in the `ContourSet` class, as found in `lib/matplotlib/contour.py`, processes the contour levels provided to a contour plot. It performs several key operations:\n- It establishes contour levels based on the arguments passed to the method. If no levels are provided, a default set of levels is chosen depending on the data type of the input array.\n- It checks if the contour is filled and adjusts the levels accordingly.\n- Critically, for non-filled contours (`if not self.filled:`), it filters the levels to only include those that fall within the data range defined by `self.zmin` and `self.zmax`. If no levels fall within the data range, it defaults to a single level at `self.zmin` and issues a warning that no contour levels were found within the data range.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\nThe identified behavior in this code snippet directly relates to the reported issue. When users specify levels for a contour plot, they may expect those levels to be used regardless of whether they fall within the actual data range. However, this logic overrides user-specified levels if none fall within the data range, setting levels to just `[self.zmin]`. This is undesirable in cases where the user intentionally sets specific levels for comparison across multiple plots or for batch processing scenarios. The code behaves as documented but conflicts with some user expectations or needs for reliability and consistency in automatic plotting processes.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\nThe intended behavior, as suggested by the issue description, is to add a keyword argument (kwarg) that allows users to override the autoscaling behavior. It implies modifying this code block to check for a flag that indicates whether to bypass the current logic that sets `self.levels` to `[self.zmin]` if no user-specified levels fall within the data range. Instead, when the override flag is set, it would retain the user-defined levels, even if they do not all match the current data range. This change would respect the user's explicit request for specific contour levels without automatically adjusting them based on the data.\n\nGiven the context and the proposed solution, the next steps would involve adding a new keyword argument to the interface that controls this behavior, modifying the `_process_contour_level_args` method to check this argument, and adjusting the logic to ensure that user-specified levels are used as-is when the override is requested. This approach would enable both existing behavior for backward compatibility and new behavior for advanced use cases."

This modification should:\n   \n   - Introduce a new keyword argument (e.g., `override_autoscale`) to the `ContourSet` initialization method and ensure it is passed down to the `_process_contour_level_args` method. This requires modifications in how `ContourSet` and possibly `contour` methods handle their arguments.\n   - Modify the conditional logic within `_process_contour_level_args` to check this `override_autoscale` flag. Specifically, it should bypass the logic that resets `self.levels` to `[self.zmin]` if the flag is set, thereby preserving the user-defined levels regardless of the data range.\n   - This addition should maintain backward compatibility by defaulting the `override_autoscale` flag to `False`, ensuring the current autoscaling behavior remains unchanged unless explicitly overridden by the user.\n   - The solution must ensure that if the `override_autoscale` flag is set but no levels are explicitly provided by the user (or if the levels are not suitable for plotting for other reasons, e.g., not being in ascending order), appropriate error handling or warnings should still be issued. This balances the request for greater control with the need to inform users of potential issues with their specified contour levels."
