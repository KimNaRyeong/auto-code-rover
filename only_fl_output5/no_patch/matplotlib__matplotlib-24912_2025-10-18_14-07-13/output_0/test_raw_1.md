To closely align the script with the issue described—where an assertion should be raised when a user-defined contour level is overridden due to all values falling outside the data range—we'll make a minor adjustment. Here's a revised version that explicitly checks for the problematic behavior and raises an `AssertionError` only when the problem manifests (i.e., when matplotlib overrides the user-defined levels with [0.0] or any other value not specified by the user when all levels fall outside the data range). This version will ensure that the script exits with code 0 only if the issue has been fixed (meaning the provided levels are respected regardless of whether they fall within the data range).

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_contour_levels_respect_user_setting():
    # Dummy data setup
    x, y = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-10, 10, 100), np.linspace(-10, 10, 100))
    data = np.sin(x) * np.cos(y)  # Data ranges roughly from -1 to 1

    # Define levels outside of the data range
    levels = [2, 3, 4]  # These levels are outside the data's range

    try:
        # Create a contour plot with specified levels
        myplot = plt.contour(x, y, data, levels=levels)

        # Check if Matplotlib respected the specified levels
        if not np.array_equal(myplot.levels, levels):
            raise AssertionError(f"Expected contour levels to be {levels}, but got {myplot.levels}.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    else:
        print("Issue not present, exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_contour_levels_respect_user_setting()
```

This script provides a more direct approach to reproducing and detecting the issue described, ensuring that an error is raised only under the specific circumstances that indicate the problem (override of user-defined contour levels). If the issue is not reproduced—meaning that matplotlib behaves as expected by not overriding the specified levels—the script acknowledges the absence of the issue and exits gracefully with code 0.
