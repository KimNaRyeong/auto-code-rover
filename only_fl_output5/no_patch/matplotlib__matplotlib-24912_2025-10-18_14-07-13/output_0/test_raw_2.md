Given the requirements and the example you've provided, I'll correct the code to ensure it acts as intended, specifically targeting the described issue where contour levels provided by the user are overridden when they fall outside the data range. Let's create an updated version of `reproducer.py`:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    traceback.print_exc()

def test_contour_levels_override_issue():
    x, y = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-1, 1, 50), np.linspace(-1, 1, 50))
    data = x ** 2 + y ** 2  # Data ranges from 0 to approximately 2

    # Attempt to set contour levels outside the existing data range, which previously would be overridden
    levels = [3, 4, 5]

    try:
        # Generate contour plot with specified levels
        contour_plot = plt.contour(x, y, data, levels=levels)
        
        # Check if the specified levels are correctly used instead of being overridden
        if list(contour_plot.levels) != levels:
            raise AssertionError(f"Contour levels were unexpectedly overridden. Expected levels: {levels}, Found: {list(contour_plot.levels)}")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error status if an exception occurs
    else:
        print("Contour level override issue not detected. Review if Matplotlib behavior has changed as expected.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with success status if the issue is not detected

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_contour_levels_override_issue()
```

This script is designed to:

- Create a simple grid and corresponding data set where the entire range of data values falls below the user-specified contour levels.
- Attempt to plot contour lines at levels that are entirely outside the range of the dataset.
- Verify whether Matplotlib overrides these user-specified levels with auto-generated ones based on the data range.
- Raise an `AssertionError` if Matplotlib does override the specified levels, indicating the presence of the reported issue.
- Print a traceback of the `AssertionError` to clearly indicate the source line in the script.
- Exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed and the user-specified levels are respected, thereby not reproducing the reported issue.

By running this script, you're directly addressing the specific condition that triggers the issue, ensuring a clear, concise reproduction scenario.
