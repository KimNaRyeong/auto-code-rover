The optimization involves deferring the call to timezone.now() until it is certain that the default is a callable that could return a dynamic value, such as the current date or time. This means introducing a check to determine the nature of self.default before deciding whether to fetch the current time. This preserves the method's functionality while improving efficiency."

Identifying these methods involves reviewing each occurrence of _check_fix_default_value in the __init__.py file for all field types that could potentially face the same inefficiency. The intended behavior is the same: preserve the warning functionality about static default times or dates while optimizing the evaluation of timezone.now()."
