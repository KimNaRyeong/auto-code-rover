Here is one of them: \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/fe074c96a343530beea50fbdd0803d3e7b739e8e/django/db/models/fields/__init__.py#L1156-L1167\nFor example, in each of them, timezone.now() is called even when the return value isn't needed / won't be used.\n</issue>"

We'll fetch the code for this specific method as given in the link to understand its current implementation and identify the exact lines where optimization can occur.\n\n2. **Search for similar methods**: Since the issue mentions that there are three ` _check_fix_default_value()` methods that can be optimized, we'll search for all occurrences of this method in the codebase to compare their implementations and identify common patterns or differences. This will help us ensure that the optimization is consistently applied across all relevant instances.\n\n3. **Search for `timezone.now()` usage**: The usage of `timezone.now()` is highlighted as potentially unnecessary or inefficient. We'll search for how `timezone.now()` is used within the `_check_fix_default_value()` methods and in their immediate context to evaluate if there's a better way to structure these calls or delay their execution until necessary.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n- `get_code_around_line(\"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\", 1156, 12)`: This will fetch the method implementation mentioned in the issue to understand its current state.\n\nContinuing with the second step:\n\n- `search_method(\"_check_fix_default_value\")`: This will help us find all occurrences of the `_check_fix_default_value()` method in the codebase.\n\nAnd then the third step:\n\n- `search_code(\"timezone.now()\")`: This will locate where `timezone.now()` is used, especially in the context of `_check_fix_default_value()` methods, to analyze its necessity and if it's being called more times than needed.\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive context to address the issue in the codebase efficiently."
