We need to search for the class or classes that could be related to the functionality like `ds`, which seems to represent a data structure (possibly for datasets). Then, we need to find any existing method that could relate to calculating averages, or at least methods that handle data manipulation in a way that could be extended to include weighted averages.\n\nTo begin resolving the issue, let's perform the following API calls:\n1. search_class(\"ds\")\n2. search_method(\"average\")"
