Given the misunderstanding, let's correct the approach to ensure that the reproducer script accurately identifies the issue described, with care taken to ensure it reproduces the problem correctly. We aim to trigger an `AssertionError` accurately reflecting the issue when the artist's `.axes` attribute remains set after clearing the axes with `cla()`. Here's an adjusted version of the script:

```python
# reproducer.py

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_artist_after_axes_clear():
    try:
        # First case: testing direct removal of the artist
        f, a = plt.subplots()
        l, = a.plot([1, 2])
        l.remove()

        assert l.axes is None, "After removal, the artist's `.axes` attribute should be None"

        # Second case: testing clearing of the axes with cla()
        f, a = plt.subplots()
        l, = a.plot([1, 2])
        a.cla()

        # The issue as described would pass this check if it is NOT fixed
        assert l.axes is None, "After clearing the axes with cla(), the artist's `.axes` attribute should be None"

        # If no AssertionError was raised, the issue is considered fixed
        print("Issue is fixed!")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate failure

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_artist_after_axes_clear()
    exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 if the script runs to completion without exceptions
```

This script now correctly assesses the presence of the issue: it checks if the `.axes` attribute of an artist (here, a line returned by `plot()`) is correctly unset (`None`) after:

1. The artist is removed directly using `remove()`.
2. The axes are cleared using `cla()`.

If the issue is present—meaning `cla()` does not unset the `.axes` attribute—an `AssertionError` is raised, detailing the extent of the issue. Conversely, should both conditions pass without error (meaning the `.axes` attribute is `None` in both scenarios), the issue is considered fixed, and the script will exit with a status code of 0, indicating success.
