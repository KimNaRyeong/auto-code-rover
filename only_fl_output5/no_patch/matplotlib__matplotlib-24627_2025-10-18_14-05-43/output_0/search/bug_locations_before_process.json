This change will align the internal state of the artist objects with their actual state of not being attached to any axes or figure, thereby preserving integrity and preventing misleading states. The method should iterate over all artists in the axes, unset their reference to the axes (and figure), and then proceed with the existing functionality of clearing the axes."

        "intended_behavior": "The current functionality essentially needs no modification since it adequately unsets the `.axes` attribute of an artist when it is removed. It is mentioned for context and comparison, indicating that similar behavior needs to be ensured in the `cla()` method of the `Axes` class. However, verifying if there's a need to explicitly unset `.figure` alongside `.axes` could be considered to ensure full decoupling of the artist from its previous context. If not already doing so, extending the `remove()` method to unset the `.figure` attribute (if such direct association exists) would ensure consistency in behavior and state management across the library."
