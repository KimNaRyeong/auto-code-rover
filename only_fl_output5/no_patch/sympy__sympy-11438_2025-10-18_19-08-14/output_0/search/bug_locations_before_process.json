        "intended_behavior": "This method should include an additional verification step when classifying equations as general_sum_of_even_powers. Specifically, it should ensure that all terms with even powers have the same degree. This additional check would prevent the misclassification of equations with terms of different even powers. The code should only classify an equation under general_sum_of_even_powers if this uniformity condition is met, ensuring that the solving procedure invoked is appropriate for the equation's actual structure."
