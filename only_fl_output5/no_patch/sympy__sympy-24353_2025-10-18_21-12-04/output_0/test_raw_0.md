        exit(1)  # Exit with error code if the AssertionError is due to an unexpected condition

```

This script attempts to import the problematic module, expecting an `ImportError` to confirm the issue's presence. The `print_stacktrace` function will clearly show the raised exception's stack trace if the issue persists. It asserts that the expected `ImportError` is raised; otherwise, it indicates that either the issue has been fixed or another exception occurred.

Remember to adjust the script based on the actual project structure or Python version specifics if necessary.
