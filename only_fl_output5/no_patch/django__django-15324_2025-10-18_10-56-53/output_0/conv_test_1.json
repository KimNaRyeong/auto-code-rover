However, the handling might need adjustment based on the actual implementation of the fix in your Django application.\n- Ensure that the server is correctly set up to handle POST requests and that any required CSRF token handling or session authentication is appropriately configured for this test to work. This example uses `@csrf_exempt` to bypass CSRF token verification for simplicity, but in a real-world scenario, CSRF protection should not be disabled."
