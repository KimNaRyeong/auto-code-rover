Given the updated requirements and clarifications, below is a corrected version of the `reproducer.py` script. This Python script is designed to meet your specifications and test for the reported issue by attempting to upload a file with null bytes in its extension to a Django server. Import statements are adjusted, and missing imports are added to ensure the script can be run standalone as you requested. Please ensure your Django server is running and accessible at `http://localhost:8000/` before executing this script.

```python
import requests
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def send_malformed_file_request():
    contents = "." * (1024 * 1024 * 3)  # Adjust file size as needed to exceed 2.5MB
    # Using BytesIO and 'rb' mode since StringIO does not support binary modes and we need to include a null byte.
    files = {'docfile': ('bogus.txt\x00', contents.encode(), 'text/plain')}  # Injecting null byte in filename
    try:
        response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/", files=files)
        # Assuming 500 Internal Server Error indicates the problem still exists
        if response.status_code == 500:
            raise AssertionError("Server error likely related to the issue: Status 500")
        else:
            print("No error from server, issue may be fixed. Status code:", response.status_code)
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print("Failed to make request. Check if the server is running.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    send_malformed_file_request()
```

This script is designed to reproduce the described issue by sending a file upload request to a Django server where the filename contains a null byte. If the server returns a 500 status code, it presumes the issue exists and prints a stack trace. If another status code is returned, it suggests that the issue might not exist under the test conditions or has been fixed. Make sure to run this script in an environment where the `requests` library is installed and your Django server is up and running at the specified address.
