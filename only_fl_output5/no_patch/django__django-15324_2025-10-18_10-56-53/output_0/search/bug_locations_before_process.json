If a filename with null bytes is detected, the method should raise a validation error or sanitize the filename by removing null bytes. This validation should happen before any file operations to prevent the server from crashing. The existing functionality of saving the form data should be preserved while ensuring that filenames with null bytes are handled appropriately."

        "intended_behavior": "In the `generate_filename` method, there should be a check to ensure that the filename does not contain null bytes. If null bytes are found, the method should either sanitize the filename by removing the null bytes or generate an error. This step is crucial since it directly impacts the file's storage path and potentially the temporary file creation process that leads to the ValueError. This enhancement will prevent the system from attempting to use or create files with invalid names, thereby preserving the integrity of the upload process."
