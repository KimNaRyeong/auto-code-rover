Given the specifics of your requirements and the corrections, here is an updated standalone Python script `reproducer.py`. This version properly constructs the file with a null byte in the filename, simulating the erroneous behavior and ensuring that the script follows the correct approach to trigger the issue related to Django's handling of uploaded files with null bytes in their filenames. If the issue exists, it will attempt to show a detailed stack trace including the `AssertionError`, otherwise, it concludes the problem has been addressed.

```python
import requests
import io

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def send_malformed_file_request():
    # Adjusting the earlier mistake - using bytes-like object for file content to allow null bytes
    contents = io.BytesIO(b"." * (1024 * 1024 * 2 + 500 * 1024))  # Creating a >2.5MB file
    files = {"docfile": ("bogus.txt\x00pdf", contents, "text/plain")}  # Inserting null byte within the file extension
    try:
        response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/", files=files)
        # If we got here, either the server didn't crash or it somehow handled the request gracefully.
        # Assuming a 500 status code for crash which might not be universal.
        if response.status_code != 500:
            print("Issue likely fixed, received status code:", response.status_code)
            sys.exit(0)
        else:
            raise AssertionError("Received 500 status, indicating a server error likely due to the issue.")
    except requests.ConnectionError as e:
        print("Error connecting to the server. Make sure the Django server is running on http://localhost:8000/")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    send_malformed_file_request()
```

Ensure to execute this script with the Django development server running. This script assumes that an endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/` is available to receive the file upload POST request. Adjust the URL as necessary to match your Django application's actual running location.

The correct approach is critical to the `files` construction in the POST request, ensuring the filename contains a null byte. Remember, this script's effectiveness in triggering or not triggering an `AssertionError` depends on how your Django application handles such malformed filenames and whether the underlying issue has been addressed.
