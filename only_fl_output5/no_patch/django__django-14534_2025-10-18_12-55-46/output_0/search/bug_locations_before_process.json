        "intended_behavior": "The `id_for_label` method in the `BoundWidget` class should be modified to check if there's an `id` specified in the `attrs` of the widget data it is handling. If an `id` is explicitly set in the widget's attributes, this `id` should be used as the return value for the `id_for_label` method. This adjustment ensures that when labels are rendered for widgets, particularly for subwidgets in cases like `CheckboxSelectMultiple`, the explicitly provided `id` attributes are honored, allowing for correct association between labels and input fields. This change aims to preserve the existing functionality where an `id` is not explicitly set, falling back to the auto-generated `id` by the original implementation in such cases. This modification ensures consistency with the `BoundField.id_for_label` functionality and addresses the discrepancy highlighted in the issue, which results in unexpected behavior when rendering labels for subwidgets, ensuring the framework handles widget `id`s in a predictable and overrideable manner."
