To do so, I've needed to switch to `importlib` for the `import-mode` and re-organize the tests to avoid import errors on the tests.\nYet even after working around these issues, the tests are failing when the effect of `core.initialize()` doesn't seem to have had any effect.\nInvestigating deeper, I see that initializer is executed and performs its actions (setting a class variable `pmxbot.logging.Logger.store`), but when that happens, there are two different versions of `pmxbot.logging` present, one in `sys.modules` and another found in `tests.unit.test_commands.logging`:\n```\n=========================================================================== test session starts ===========================================================================\nplatform darwin -- Python 3.11.1, pytest-7.2.0, pluggy-1.0.0\ncachedir: .tox/python/.pytest_cache\nrootdir: /Users/jaraco/code/pmxbot/pmxbot, configfile: pytest.ini\nplugins: black-0.3.12, mypy-0.10.3, jaraco.test-5.3.0, checkdocs-2.9.0, flake8-1.1.1, enabler-2.0.0, jaraco.mongodb-11.2.1, pmxbot-1122.14.3.dev13+g7f189ad\ncollected 421 items / 180 deselected / 241 selected\nrun-last-failure: rerun previous 240 failures (skipped 14 files)\ntests/unit/test_commands.py E\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> traceback >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\ncls = <class 'tests.unit.test_commands.TestCommands'>\n@classmethod\ndef setup_class(cls):\npath = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\nconfigfile = os.path.join(path, 'testconf.yaml')\nconfig = pmxbot.dictlib.ConfigDict.from_yaml(configfile)\ncls.bot = core.initialize(config)\n>       logging.Logger.store.message(\"logged\", \"testrunner\", \"some text\")\nE       AttributeError: type object 'Logger' has no attribute 'store'\ntests/unit/test_commands.py:37: AttributeError\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> entering PDB >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> PDB post_mortem (IO-capturing turned off) >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n> /Users/jaraco/code/pmxbot/pmxbot/tests/unit/test_commands.py(37)setup_class()\n-> logging.Logger.store.message(\"logged\", \"testrunner\", \"some text\")\n(Pdb) logging.Logger\n<class 'pmxbot.logging.Logger'>\n(Pdb) logging\n<module 'pmxbot.logging' from '/Users/jaraco/code/pmxbot/pmxbot/pmxbot/logging.py'>\n(Pdb) import sys\n(Pdb) sys.modules['pmxbot.logging']\n<module 'pmxbot.logging' from '/Users/jaraco/code/pmxbot/pmxbot/pmxbot/logging.py'>\n(Pdb) sys.modules['pmxbot.logging'] is logging\nFalse\n```\nI haven't yet made a minimal reproducer, but I wanted to first capture this condition.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue, we will need to conduct several search operations focusing on key elements mentioned in the issue description. Specifically, we will look into the `Logger` class, the `initialize` method from the `core` module, and occurrences of the `pmxbot.logging` import to understand how they are structured and interact with each other. Additionally, considering the mention of a configuration file and its significance in the initialization process could be relevant.\n\nHere are the targeted API calls to make:\n\n1. Search for the `Logger` class definition to understand its structure and the missing `store` attribute.\n2. Search for the `initialize` method within the `core` module to see how it interacts with the `Logger` class and other components, potentially leading to the module's double import or incorrect configuration loading.\n3. Search for imports of `pmxbot.logging` across the codebase to identify any inconsistencies or anomalies that could lead to the module being loaded twice.\n4. Explore how the configuration file (`testconf.yaml`) is processed, though the specific API call for this will depend on the method's name that processes this file, which is not directly mentioned. A general search for this file's reference might be the initial approach.\n\nLet's start with these specific API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"Logger\")`\n- `search_method(\"initialize\")`\n- `search_code(\"import pmxbot.logging\")`\n- `search_code(\"ConfigDict.from_yaml\")` (assuming `from_yaml` is a method related to config processing based on the issue description)."
