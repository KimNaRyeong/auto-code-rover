        "intended_behavior": "The `run` method, which prepares and executes the Django development server with optional autoreloader, needs to be updated to correctly handle module specifications using `-m` for dotted paths. It should ensure that when a module is specified with a dotted path (e.g., `foo.bar.baz`), it accurately maintains the full module path for the autoreloader to monitor for changes. This involves ensuring the command that restarts the server retains the full module path, not truncating it to a parent package. This will likely require parsing the command-line argument more accurately and passing the full dotted path to the autoreloading mechanism."

        "file": "django/__main__.py",
        "intended_behavior": "While this file functions correctly for invoking Django commands via `python -m django`, it should ensure that other modules specified in a similar manner are correctly passed along to the Django management command being executed, especially for the autoreload mechanism in development mode. This may involve adjustments in how this entry point handles arguments to ensure proper behavior of the `-m` option, aligning it with Python's module execution expectations."
