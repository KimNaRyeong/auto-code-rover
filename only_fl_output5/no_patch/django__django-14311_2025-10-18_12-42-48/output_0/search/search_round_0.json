To understand how the autoreloader is implemented and interacts with modules specified using `-m`, we need to look at the changes made in the specified commit. Since the commit URL mentions Django, we can infer the fix was related to Django's autoreloading technique. However, we need actual context from the Django codebase, specifically the autoreloader's current implementation which could be in files like `django/utils/autoreload.py` or similarly named files. Unfortunately, without direct access to browse the repository, I can't specify the exact file name here. Yet, given the information, we can start by looking at the utility or components that might have been affected based on the commit and the issue description.\n\n2. Search for an autoreloader implementation and any recent changes or logic that handles module execution using `-m`. This logic might reside in a class or method responsible for restarting the server in a development environment when code changes are detected.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will make the following API calls:\n\n- `search_code(\"autoreloader\")`\n- `search_method(\"runserver\")`\n- `search_code(\"__main__.py\")`\n- `search_code(\"python -m\")` \n\nThese searches aim to find relevant code snippets and method implementations related to the issue of autoreloading modules specified with `-m`."
