This could mean that the class name might not be exactly `FormSet` or it's part of a module or a subclass not addressed directly by its name. Given the context of Django, `BaseFormSet` could be the correct class to look into, which is likely located in `django/forms/formsets.py`. Since `FormSet` does not exist directly, it's possible that the information needs to be obtained from a conceptually similar or parent class.\n\n2. **InlineFormSet Factory**: The `inlineformset_factory` function found in `django/forms/models.py` helps in creating inline formsets tied to a model via a foreign key. This is likely related to the issue, as overriding error messages for forms created through this factory would require understanding of how it works. The presence of `error_messages` in its parameters indicates that it already supports custom error messages for the inline formsets it produces. This directly relates to the issue since the intention is to allow overriding specific error messages about the number of forms in a similar manner.\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior of parts of the code dealing with `error_messages` would be:\n- To allow developers to pass custom error messages that override the default error messages related to the quantity of forms in a formset. This could be for the cases when there are too many or too few forms submitted.\n- In the case of `inlineformset_factory`, it already accepts an `error_messages` parameter, suggesting that a mechanism for overriding error messages might already be in place. However, the specific concern here would be ensuring these overrides are possible at a level affecting formsets in a broader sense, not just inline formsets.\n\nGiven these insights, the next steps could involve:\n- Investigating how `BaseFormSet` in `django/forms/formsets.py` manages its error messages, specifically looking into how it uses `default_error_messages` and how these messages can be overridden.\n- Looking more closely at the code surrounding the `error_messages` parameter in the `inlineformset_factory` function may provide clues on implementing similar functionality or ensuring it works for the general use case mentioned in the issue.\n\nHence, relevant API calls might now include:\n- search_code_in_file(\"`BaseFormSet`\", \"django/forms/formsets.py\") to understand the implementation of formsets.\n- search_code_in_file(\"`default_error_messages`\", \"django/forms/formsets.py\") to see how default error messages are defined and managed.\n- This would help in creating a clear strategy for enabling the desired behavior of overriding specific error messages."

This attribute should map keys such as `too_many_forms` and `too_few_forms` to their respective default messages. The instantiation process should then merge any provided `error_messages` with these defaults, allowing for easy overriding without changing the global defaults. This enhancement will enable developers to specify custom error messages for too many or too few forms directly when creating a `FormSet`, thus addressing the issue's requirement.\n\n- **Location 2**:  \n  **File**: django/forms/models.py  \n  **Function**: inlineformset_factory  \n  **Intended Behavior**: The `inlineformset_factory` function should explicitly document and handle the `error_messages` parameter, ensuring it's passed down to the `BaseFormSet` properly. While the function already supports an `error_messages` argument, the handling and documentation around this parameter might need clarification or adjustment to ensure that it supports overriding messages about the number of forms. This might not require a code change if it's already supported but ensuring the documentation is clear about this capability is crucial to address the user's issue.\n\nThese adjustments would preserve the existing functionality by maintaining the conventional behavior of formset error handling while adding the flexibility to override error messages for specific instances of formsets, including those generated by the `inlineformset_factory`."

Here's an analysis based on the provided code snippets and the original issue:\n\n### Analysis of the BaseFormSet Class and default_error_messages\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - **BaseFormSet Class**: Defined as a collection of instances of the same Form class, `BaseFormSet` orchestrates how multiple forms of the same type are processed and validated together. It includes behavior for rendering, validating, cleaning, and managing a set of forms.\n   - **default_error_messages in BaseFormSet**: This is a dictionary that specifies error messages for common formset errors, such as when the management form data is missing or has been tampered with. It acts as a central repository for error messages that might be raised during the formset's lifecycle.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue describes a need to override the error messages related to the count of forms in a formset, specifically for the case when there are too many or too few forms. The found references to `default_error_messages` indicate that error message definitions for formsets are housed within the `BaseFormSet` class but don't directly mention overriding messages about the count of forms. However, the mechanism for updating error messages (`messages.update(getattr(cls, \"default_error_messages\", {}))` and the subsequent update with `error_messages` if provided) shows how custom error messages could be merged with or override the default ones.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would involve expanding the `default_error_messages` to include keys for \"too many forms\" and \"too few forms\" errors, offering a default message that can be overridden when a formset is instantiated or through a factory function like `inlineformset_factory`. The merging mechanism seen in `__init__` should then allow these custom messages to replace the default ones when specified, offering more flexibility in error messaging.\n   - Ideally, extending `default_error_messages` within `BaseFormSet` and ensuring these new messages are considered in the validation process where the number of forms is assessed would directly address the issue. Developers could then specify their custom messages for these scenarios explicitly during formset instantiation or through configurations in factory functions.\n\nGiven this analysis, we've pinpointed the parts of the code that are directly related to the issue and identified how they could be modified to achieve the desired functionality. The key to resolving the issue lies in both expanding the `default_error_messages` and leveraging the existing override mechanism to allow custom messages for form count errors."

This is in preparation for enabling these messages to be overridden more intuitively. The implementation should ensure these new keys are used in the validation logic that checks form counts against the set limits (min_num and max_num), thus providing feedback when these conditions are not met. This approach allows developers to customize error messages related to the number of forms more effectively without altering the existing functionality.\n\n- **Location 2**:  \n  **File**: django/forms/formsets.py  \n  **Class**: BaseFormSet  \n  **Method**: `__init__`  \n  **Intended Behavior**: While the `__init__` method already merges the `default_error_messages` with any provided `error_messages`, ensuring this process includes our newly introduced messages (`too_many_forms` and `too_few_forms`) allows for their customization at instantiation. Clarification in the class documentation about how to override these (and potentially other) error messages would be helpful for developers, preserving the functionality of error message customization while enhancing its usability for more specific formset validations.\n\nThese proposed changes directly address the issue by allowing developers to specify custom error messages for \"too many forms\" and \"too few forms\" scenarios, providing a clearer and more flexible way to communicate formset requirements to end users."
