        "intended_behavior": "Extend the `default_error_messages` dictionary within `BaseFormSet` to include two new keys: `too_many_forms` and `too_few_forms`, with sensible default messages. This is in preparation for enabling these messages to be overridden more intuitively. The implementation should ensure these new keys are used in the validation logic that checks form counts against the set limits (min_num and max_num), thus providing feedback when these conditions are not met. This approach allows developers to customize error messages related to the number of forms more effectively without altering the existing functionality."

        "intended_behavior": "While the `__init__` method already merges the `default_error_messages` with any provided `error_messages`, ensuring this process includes our newly introduced messages (`too_many_forms` and `too_few_forms`) allows for their customization at instantiation. Clarification in the class documentation about how to override these (and potentially other) error messages would be helpful for developers, preserving the functionality of error message customization while enhancing its usability for more specific formset validations."
