        "intended_behavior": "The `Round` class needs to be modified to support an optional precision argument. This involves adjusting the class to accept a second argument (precision) and ensuring that this argument is appropriately included in the SQL expression when the `Round` function is translated to SQL. This could be achieved by overriding the `__init__` method to accept an additional argument and modifying how the `as_sql` method constructs the SQL to include the precision argument if provided. The existing functionality must remain unaffected when the precision argument is not passed, defaulting to rounding to the nearest integer."
