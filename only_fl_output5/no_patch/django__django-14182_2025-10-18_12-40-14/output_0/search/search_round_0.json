        "content": "To address the issue effectively, let's consider the steps and API calls needed for gathering the right context. Given the description of the issue, we know it's related to enhancing the `Round` function in Django to support a precision argument. This function is likely part of the Django's database functions or expression API, which is used to create SQL expressions.\n\n1. **Search for the `Round` Class**: Since the issue mentions a `Round` class that currently does not support a precision argument, the first step would be to find this class in the Django codebase.\n   \n   `search_class(\"Round\")`\n\n2. **Search for `Func` Class**: Given that the workaround involves creating a custom `Func` class, this suggests that `Round` may either inherit from `Func` or closely interact with it. It would be useful to understand how `Func` is implemented.\n   \n   `search_class(\"Func\")`\n\n3. **Search for Current Implementation of `Round`**: To see how the `Round` function is currently implemented without the precision support, we need to find any method definitions or usage within the `Round` class.\n   \n   `search_method_in_class(\"function\", \"Round\")`\n   `search_method_in_class(\"arity\", \"Round\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point by giving us the current implementation details of the `Round` function, and showing how functions are generally created and used in Django. This information is crucial for understanding how to extend `Round` to support a precision argument."
