To locate the handling of the `--fixtures` option, we can search for a method or code snippet that deals with command-line options, possibly in a command-line parser or configuration setup.\n\n2. To understand the fixture scope implementation, we'll look for where fixtures are defined or registered, which might involve searching for methods or classes related to fixture management.\n\nBased on this, let's start with:\n\n- `search_method(\"parse_options\")`\n- `search_code(\"def pytest_addoption\")`\n- `search_class(\"FixtureDef\")`\n\nThese calls aim to uncover how `--fixtures` is parsed, where command-line options are added (often in a function like `pytest_addoption`), and how fixture definitions are handled in the codebase."
