        "content": "Analyzing the results from our API calls gives us some useful insights into the pytest codebase, especially concerning the fixture mechanism and command-line option handling.\n\n### `def pytest_addoption`\n\nThe presence of `def pytest_addoption` across multiple files in the pytest codebase tells us that this function is a common way to add command-line options to various pytest plugins and components. Its widespread usage suggests a modular approach to configuring pytest behavior\u2014including, but not limited to, command-line options processing.\n\n#### Analysis:\n1. **Functionality**: This function is used to add custom command-line options to pytest. The appearances in multiple files suggest that plugins or core components can define their own options.\n2. **Relation to the Issue**: One of these `pytest_addoption` occurrences likely involves the registration of the `--fixtures` option and its description. Modification to this part is necessary to implement the feature of displaying fixture scopes along with the fixture documentation, as requested in the issue.\n3. **Intended Behavior**: For the issue at hand, the intended behavior would involve extending the configuration done in `pytest_addoption` to allow for the display of fixture scopes when the `--fixtures` argument is used.\n\n### `FixtureDef` Class\n\nThe `FixtureDef` class in `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` manages fixture definitions, including their scope, which is exactly the information we need to display. The class attributes and methods indicate it plays a crucial role in managing fixtures' lifecycle, from instantiation to finalization.\n\n#### Analysis:\n1. **Functionality**: This class encapsulates the definition of a fixture, covering aspects such as the fixture's scope, the function implementing the fixture, and setup/teardown behaviors. It essentially defines how fixtures are structured internally.\n2. **Relation to the Issue**: Since the issue requires displaying the scope of fixtures, the `FixtureDef` class is directly related. It contains the scope information as part of its initialization parameters, which means any modification to display fixture scopes could leverage this existing attribute.\n3. **Intended Behavior**: In relation to the issue, the intended enhancement would extract the `scope` attribute of fixtures from instances of `FixtureDef` during the processing of the `--fixtures` command-line option, to include the scope information in the output presented to the user.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the above analysis, further steps would include:\n\n- Investigating where and how the `--fixtures` command-line argument is processed and linked to the output of fixture documentation. This might necessitate a closer look at the file(s) where `pytest_addoption` is related to fixture handling. Since `src/_pytest/python.py` was mentioned in relation to fixtures, that might be a good start.\n- Determining the exact point in the codebase where the list of fixtures is prepared for output when the `--fixtures` argument is used. With this information, we could augment the output to include the scope of each fixture.\n\nTo dive deeper based on our analysis, the following API calls could be beneficial:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"--fixtures\", \"src/_pytest/python.py\")`\n- `search_method_in_file(\"pytest_report_collectionfinish\", \"src/_pytest/terminal.py\")`\n\nThese calls are aimed at uncovering how fixtures are listed with the `--fixtures` argument, and possibly, where to plug in the enhancement for displaying fixture scopes."

This extension should preserve the current functionality of listing available fixtures but additionally display each fixture's scope (e.g., function, class, module, package, or session) alongside its name and docstring in the output.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `src/_pytest/fixtures.py`\n  - **Class:** `FixtureDef`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** While the `FixtureDef` class may not require a bug fix per se, any enhancements to support the new feature (displaying fixture scopes) would likely involve accessing the `scope` attribute of this class's instances. The modification would ensure that wherever fixture details are being prepared for the `--fixtures` output, the scope is included by retrieving it from the `FixtureDef` instances corresponding to each fixture.\n\nThese locations are identified based on the understanding that to include fixture scopes in the `pytest --fixtures` output, modifications are necessary where fixtures are listed and where fixtures' metadata (such as scope) is managed."
