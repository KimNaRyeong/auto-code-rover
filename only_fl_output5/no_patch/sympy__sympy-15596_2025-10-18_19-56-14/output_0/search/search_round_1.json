The user expects SymPy to either correctly return the degree of a rational function or to report an inability to handle rational functions, rather than providing a misleading result.\n\nFrom the search results, the most relevant appearances of the `degree` method are likely within the `sympy/polys/polytools.py` file, considering `polytools.py` is a part of the polynomials module in SymPy, and polynomial degree computation would logically be a functionality of this module. The `degree` function in this context is expected to calculate the degree of a polynomial expression with respect to a given variable, but its behavior with rational functions (quotients of two polynomials) needs to be clarified or modified to handle such cases appropriately.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\n1. **Review Implementation in polytools.py**: Given that the user's experience suggests a potentially incorrect or incomplete implementation for rational functions, the first step should involve examining the `degree` function within `polytools.py`. This would help understand its current handling of rational functions.\n\n2. **Understand Degree Calculation Logic**: It's important to understand how the degree is being calculated and why the method returns `1` when given a rational function, as in the user's example. Is the method mistakenly treating the numerator and denominator separately? Or is it not designed to handle rational functions at all?\n\n3. **Rational Function Handling**: Ideally, the function should either correctly calculate the degree of both the numerator and denominator and compute the difference (or another appropriate measure) for rational functions or explicitly signal that rational function degree calculation is not supported.\n\nTo proceed, we need to examine the code for the `degree` method within `polytools.py`. This requires the content and implementation details of this specific instance of `degree`.\n\n- search_method_in_file(\"degree\", \"sympy/polys/polytools.py\")"

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).
