        "intended_behavior": "The `degree` function should extend its capability to handle rational functions correctly. Currently, it seems to process input expressions either directly as polynomials or attempts to convert them to polynomial form for degree calculation, without special considerations for rational functions. To resolve the issue, the function should: 1. Detect Rational Functions: Introduce a check to determine if the input expression `f` is a rational function. This could involve detecting if `f` is expressed as a division between two polynomials. 2. Separate Handling for Rational Functions: Once a rational function is detected, calculate the degrees of the numerator and denominator separately. The degree of a rational function could then be defined in a manner consistent with mathematical conventions, such as subtracting the degree of the denominator from the numerator. 3. Error Handling or Warning: If the concept of degree is not well-defined or not implemented for the given input (e.g., in cases more complex than polynomials or rational functions), the function should either explicitly fail with an informative error message or provide a warning about the limitation, advising on possible alternatives. 4. Preserve Existing Functionality: Ensure that any new logic for handling rational functions does not interfere with the current handling of polynomial expressions or other types of inputs. This could be achieved by inserting the new logic in a way that it complements rather than overrides the existing polynomial-degree calculation process."
