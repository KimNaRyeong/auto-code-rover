The simplest example I created to illustrate the problem is as follows:\n```\n>>import sympy\n>>print('Sympy version: ', sympy.__version__)\nSympy version: 1.2\n>> from sympy import *\n>> x = symbols('x')\n>> q = Quaternion(cos(x/2), sin(x/2), 0, 0)\n>> trigsimp(q.to_rotation_matrix())\nMatrix([\n[1,      0,      0],\n[0, cos(x), sin(x)],\n[0, sin(x), cos(x)]])\n```\nOne of the `sin(x)` functions should be negative.  What was the reference of the original equations?\n</issue>"

Let's perform the following searches based on the information provided in the issue:\n\n1. **Search for the Quaternion class implementation to understand its structure and related methods.**\n   - `search_class(\"Quaternion\")`\n\n2. **Search specifically for the to_rotation_matrix method within the Quaternion class to understand its current implementation.**\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"to_rotation_matrix\", \"Quaternion\")`\n\n3. **Look for the method implementation in the specific file mentioned in the issue to ensure we are looking at the correct version.**\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"to_rotation_matrix\", \"sympy/algebras/quaternion.py\")`\n\n4. **Since there's a mention of the rotation matrix output being incorrect, we should also look for any reference or documentation mention in the code snippet about the expected mathematical form of the rotation matrix from a quaternion, as this might provide clues to the correct implementation or the nature of the mistake.**\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"rotation matrix\", \"sympy/algebras/quaternion.py\")`\n\nThese actions should provide enough context to start working on understanding the bug and how the current implementation might be differing from the expected mathematical formula, specifically in terms of the sign of `sin(x)` in the matrix."
