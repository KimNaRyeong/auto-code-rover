This works fine in Firefox etc.\nWith requests, I get the following error (Python 3.4 with Requests 2.7.0 on a Japanese Ubuntu 15.04):\n```\n'<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN\">\\n<html><head>\\n<title>404 Not Found</title>\\n</head><body>\\n<h1>Not Found</h1>\\n<p>The requested URL /\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x83\u00c2\\x96\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x83\u00c2\\xad\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x82\u00c2\u00b0/ was not found on this server.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<address>Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS) Server at test.xn--q9jyb4c Port 80</address>\\n</body></html>\\n'\n```\nSo I guess the request lib gets a redirect from a server with Japanese characters, but then fails to convert the characters correctly. If I do `requests.get(http://test.\u307f\u3093\u306a/\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0)` directly it works, only the redirect does not.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Let's analyze the collected context based on the results from the API calls:\n\n### Analysis of `parse_url` from `requests/packages/urllib3/util/url.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `parse_url` method is designed to decompose a URL into its constituent components, such as scheme, host, port, path, query, and fragment. It's tailored for flexibility, attempting to extract as much information as possible from potentially incomplete URLs and is specifically optimized for performance in CPython.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Given that the issue arises during redirection, which inherently involves URL parsing and possibly reconstruction, the way URLs are parsed could directly influence how effectively redirection URLs are constructed or interpreted, especially when those URLs include non-ASCII characters like Japanese characters. However, from the information provided in `parse_url`, there\u2019s no explicit handling of internationalized domain names (IDN) or Unicode character encoding within URLs, which might be the crux of the issue. \n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Ideally, this function should correctly parse and handle URLs that contain Unicode characters, ensuring that the extracted components such as the host and path maintain their Unicode representation or are appropriately encoded for subsequent operations, such as HTTP redirections.\n\n### Analysis of `prepare_url` in `requests/models.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - This snippet shows how the host part of a URL is encoded to IDNA (Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications) format within the `prepare_url` method of what seems to be a Request's model. This is crucial for normalizing the domain part of a URL to ensure compatibility with DNS standards, which do not natively support Unicode characters.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The bug is related to encoding issues with non-ASCII characters during redirection, and this piece of code directly takes charge of how non-ASCII domain names are converted to a standard format (IDNA/Punycode) that can be used on the internet. This suggests that the application may handle domain names correctly, but potentially overlooks paths that contain non-ASCII characters, leading to improper handling during redirections.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - For the issue at hand, the intended behavior would be to ensure not only that the domain names are correctly encoded to IDNA format but also that the paths, including non-ASCII characters, are handled in a way that preserves their integrity throughout the redirection process. This could involve encoding paths in a way that web servers and clients can accurately interpret and navigate to the intended destination.\n\nGiven the above analysis, it appears we need to investigate further into how non-ASCII paths are encoded or decoded during redirections, as the issue might stem from how paths are handled versus how the domains are treated. It could be helpful to look closer into:\n- How the `parse_url` method interacts with redirections and if there\u2019s another layer that handles the construction or encoding of redirection URLs.\n- Any custom logic around the Apache `.htaccess` file manipulation or redirection handling that might not be standard in the Requests library or its dependencies.\n\nAdditionally, since the `encode_url` and `redirect` methods were not found, and given the specific nature of the issue, it might be beneficial to explore:\n- How the project constructs and responds to HTTP redirect requests and if it employs custom logic that could affect the encoding.\n- The possibility of custom error handling or logging mechanisms that could provide more insight into the failure point or misinterpretation of the URL path portions containing non-ASCII characters."

        "content": "1. **do we need more context**\n\nSince the initial investigation suggests potential gaps in our understanding, particularly around how the application deals with redirection URLs that contain paths with non-ASCII characters, further context could indeed be beneficial. We did not find explicit handling for redirect paths that contain non-ASCII characters in the provided code snippets. Therefore, the following API calls could help:\n\n- `search_method(\"prepare_url\")` - Further examination of this method might reveal how URLs are fully prepared and could indicate if path encoding is considered alongside domain encoding.\n- `search_code(\"redirect\")` - Although an initial search did not yield results, searching for related terms might give insight. Maybe searching for \"HTTPResponseRedirect\" or \"redirect\" in a broader context could help.\n- `search_code(\"htaccess\")` - It's a long shot since the previous search for `.htaccess` specific handlers returned no results, but broader or related searches might uncover indirect handling mechanisms.\n\n2. **where are bug locations**\n\nGiven the information we have so far, we can pinpoint a likely location needing attention:\n\n- **File:** `requests/models.py`\n  - **Class/Method:** `PreparedRequest/prepare_url`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** In addition to encoding the host using IDNA standards, this method should ensure that the path component of the URL, especially when containing non-ASCII characters, is appropriately encoded for web transmission. This involves not just encoding spaces or special characters but also possibly considering percent-encoding for Unicode characters in paths. This would preserve existing functionality by still preparing URLs correctly for requests while also addressing the inability to follow redirects to paths with non-ASCII characters. \n\nIt's noted that `parse_url` in `requests/packages/urllib3/util/url.py` could also be relevant, but without specific evidence of its mismanagement of non-ASCII paths, the main focus should be on how prepared URLs are handled. The intended modifications should not alter the primary responsibilities of the `prepare_url` method but extend its capability to better handle diverse character sets in URLs, closing the gap identified in the issue description."

        "content": "With the additional information gathered, let's delve into the analysis:\n\n### Analysis of `prepare_url` from `requests/models.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `prepare_url` method in the `requests` library prepares a URL for a request by decoding bytes to UTF-8 if necessary, ensuring string format, stripping whitespace, and handling only HTTP/HTTPS schemes specifically. It parses the URL into components, applies IDNA encoding to the host for internationalized domain names, and reconstructs the URL with any provided parameters. This method aims to produce a well-formed URL string that is valid for HTTP requests.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue involves a failure to correctly handle redirects to non-ASCII folder names, showing an encoding problem with the path part of the URL during redirections. `prepare_url` handles various aspects of URL preparation, including encoding, but the reported bug suggests that while the domain part (IDNA encoding) is handled correctly, the path, which includes non-ASCII characters, may not be managed appropriately in redirection scenarios. This indicates a potential improvement area in how `prepare_url` handles or encodes the path component.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would involve ensuring that the path component of the URL, especially when containing non-ASCII characters, is correctly handled during the preparation of the URL. This may involve encoding these characters in a manner that's compliant with URL standards, ensuring they are preserved and correctly recognized upon redirection. The method should ensure that paths containing characters in scripts other than Latin (e.g., Japanese) are encoded properly, preserving the original intended path without resulting in a 404 error due to encoding mishaps.\n\n### Analysis of `redirect` occurrences in various files\n\nThe `redirect` occurrences across multiple files potentially relate to how redirects are handled throughout the `requests` library and its dependencies. Given the nature and breadth of these references, several areas may impact how redirected URLs, specifically with non-ASCII path components, are managed:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - These references likely cover a range of functionality, including generating redirect responses, handling incoming redirects, setting policies for automatic redirects, and managing redirection limits. They likely involve both high-level request handling and lower-level HTTP protocol specifics.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Given the bug is particularly about redirects to URLs with non-ASCII characters in their paths, the handling of redirects in these areas could directly impact the success or failure of such operations. There may be mishandling or insufficient handling of encoding when reconstructing URLs during the redirect process.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Ideally, whenever a redirect occurs, the involved components should ensure that the URL, especially its path with non-ASCII characters, is preserved correctly through encoding strategies that maintain the characters' integrity. This means implementing or ensuring compliance with URL encoding standards that allow these characters to be sent and received accurately over HTTP.\n\nGiven the detailed insights, further exploration and adjustments in `prepare_url` for handling non-ASCII characters in paths correctly seem essential to addressing the bug. Additionally, examining how redirection is managed across the `requests` library could reveal areas where encoding policies need reinforcement or clarification to prevent similar issues."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

While the domain part of the URL is properly encoded to IDNA, the method should also ensure characters in the path are percent-encoded as per RFC 3986. This includes characters in scripts other than Latin, such as Japanese, ensuring they are preserved correctly in the URL and not misrepresented, leading to 404 errors. The enhancement should maintain the current functionality for ASCII paths, only applying additional encoding steps where necessary for non-ASCII characters.\n\nThe intended enhancement to the `prepare_url` method would directly address the inability to follow redirects to URLs with non-ASCII characters in their paths. This adjustment should focus on ensuring the integrity and usability of the URL throughout the request and redirect process, preserving the original characters through appropriate encoding strategies."
