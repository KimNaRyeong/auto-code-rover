        "content": "<issue>.htaccesss redirect to non ASCII folder does not work\nHello,\nI have the following setup on a shared hoster:\n- Apache 2.2.15\n- A Japanese language .\u307f\u3093\u306a (.minna; xn--q9jyb4c) IDN domain.\n- A blog which is in the subfolder \u30d6\u30ed\u30b0 (blog)\n- A redirect in the .htaccess file like this: `Redirect /index.html /\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0/`\nSo I usually open the domain http://test.\u307f\u3093\u306a and the server redirects to http://test.\u307f\u3093\u306a/\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0. This works fine in Firefox etc.\nWith requests, I get the following error (Python 3.4 with Requests 2.7.0 on a Japanese Ubuntu 15.04):\n```\n'<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN\">\\n<html><head>\\n<title>404 Not Found</title>\\n</head><body>\\n<h1>Not Found</h1>\\n<p>The requested URL /\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x83\u00c2\\x96\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x83\u00c2\\xad\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x82\u00c2\u00b0/ was not found on this server.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<address>Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS) Server at test.xn--q9jyb4c Port 80</address>\\n</body></html>\\n'\n```\nSo I guess the request lib gets a redirect from a server with Japanese characters, but then fails to convert the characters correctly. If I do `requests.get(http://test.\u307f\u3093\u306a/\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0)` directly it works, only the redirect does not.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue of `.htaccess` redirects not working with non-ASCII (specifically Japanese) characters, we first need to understand how Apache handles `.htaccess` redirects, how the project handles URLs (especially those containing Unicode or IDN domains), and if there's specific handling for redirects in the project code (whether through a custom handler or configuration). Given these considerations, here are the relevant API calls that would help us gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for any Apache configuration or `.htaccess` handling classes in the project:\n   - `search_class(\"ApacheConfig\")`\n   - `search_class(\".htaccess\")` - Given this might not directly translate to a class, it's more exploratory to see if there's any direct reference.\n\n2. Look for URL or redirect handling, which might parse or encode URLs:\n   - `search_method(\"parse_url\")`\n   - `search_method(\"encode_url\")`\n   - `search_method(\"redirect\")`\n\n3. Since the issue might be connected to how the project handles non-ASCII characters:\n   - `search_code(\"IDN\")` - To check how Internationalized Domain Names are handled.\n   - `search_code(\"Punycode\")` - Since IDNs are often converted to Punycode for compatibility.\n\nThese API calls could provide insight into how redirects are managed within the project and how it interacts with Apache's `.htaccess` files or how it handles Unicode/IDN domains, which is relevant for the issue at hand."
