        "intended_behavior": "The method should be enhanced to ensure that the path component of a URL, when containing non-ASCII characters, is properly encoded to prevent issues during redirects. While the domain part of the URL is properly encoded to IDNA, the method should also ensure characters in the path are percent-encoded as per RFC 3986. This includes characters in scripts other than Latin, such as Japanese, ensuring they are preserved correctly in the URL and not misrepresented, leading to 404 errors. The enhancement should maintain the current functionality for ASCII paths, only applying additional encoding steps where necessary for non-ASCII characters."
