This could involve adjusting the method to check for an `exp` argument and format the LaTeX output to display the function raised to this power appropriately. The method should preserve its current functionality of printing `LambertW` while adding the capability to handle cases where it is part of an expression involving a power."

        "intended_behavior": "This method may need a minor adjustment to ensure that when it delegates the printing of base expressions like `LambertW` to their respective printing methods, it does so in a way that is compatible with those methods' expected parameters. Specifically, if a special handling or forwarding of the `exp` parameter is necessary for functions that do not natively handle it, `_print_Pow` should conditionally format its request based on the base expression's type. This behavior would ensure that `LambertW` or similar functions raised to a power are printed correctly without causing a `TypeError`."
