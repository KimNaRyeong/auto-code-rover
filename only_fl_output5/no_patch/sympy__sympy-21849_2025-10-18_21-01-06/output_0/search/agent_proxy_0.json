            "content": "To effectively address the issue described, we need to investigate how the `LambertW` function and its LaTeX representation are implemented and also understand how powers of such functions are handled, particularly in the context of LaTeX printing. Since the error indicates a problem with an unexpected keyword argument 'exp' in `_print_LambertW`, it appears that the method handling the LaTeX printing of `LambertW` does not properly account for exponents.\n\nGiven the traceback, several key elements and files are mentioned, but without specific filenames, we need to focus on the classes and methods directly related to the issue:\n\n1. The `TypeError` originates from `_print_LambertW()`, which is likely a method designed to handle the printing of the `LambertW` function in LaTeX form.\n2. We see references to `_print_Pow()` in `sympy\\printing\\latex.py`, which handles the LaTeX representation of power expressions.\n3. The error seems to occur when `_print_Pow()` tries to pass an `exp` keyword argument to `_print_LambertW()`, which does not accept it.\n\nWe do not have the filenames directly from the issue description, but we can infer from the traceback that `latex.py` in the `sympy\\printing` directory is involved. The file paths are not explicitly provided, but based on standard conventions in the `sympy` library, we can make educated guesses about where to look.\n\nLet's start with these API calls to gather more context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"_print_LambertW\")` - To find where this method is defined, which will help us understand how `LambertW` is printed in LaTeX.\n2. `search_method(\"_print_Pow\")` - To understand how the power function is printed and why it might be causing an error when interacting with `LambertW`.\n\nThese initial searches should provide a good starting point for understanding the source of the problem and how these two methods interact."
