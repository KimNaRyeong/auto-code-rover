        "content": "To effectively address the issue described, we need to investigate how the `LambertW` function and its LaTeX representation are implemented and also understand how powers of such functions are handled, particularly in the context of LaTeX printing. Since the error indicates a problem with an unexpected keyword argument 'exp' in `_print_LambertW`, it appears that the method handling the LaTeX printing of `LambertW` does not properly account for exponents.\n\nGiven the traceback, several key elements and files are mentioned, but without specific filenames, we need to focus on the classes and methods directly related to the issue:\n\n1. The `TypeError` originates from `_print_LambertW()`, which is likely a method designed to handle the printing of the `LambertW` function in LaTeX form.\n2. We see references to `_print_Pow()` in `sympy\\printing\\latex.py`, which handles the LaTeX representation of power expressions.\n3. The error seems to occur when `_print_Pow()` tries to pass an `exp` keyword argument to `_print_LambertW()`, which does not accept it.\n\nWe do not have the filenames directly from the issue description, but we can infer from the traceback that `latex.py` in the `sympy\\printing` directory is involved. The file paths are not explicitly provided, but based on standard conventions in the `sympy` library, we can make educated guesses about where to look.\n\nLet's start with these API calls to gather more context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"_print_LambertW\")` - To find where this method is defined, which will help us understand how `LambertW` is printed in LaTeX.\n2. `search_method(\"_print_Pow\")` - To understand how the power function is printed and why it might be causing an error when interacting with `LambertW`.\n\nThese initial searches should provide a good starting point for understanding the source of the problem and how these two methods interact."

        "content": "Given the results from the API calls, let's analyze the context and consider our next steps:\n\n1. **_print_LambertW Method:**\n   - Found in `sympy/printing/latex.py` and other files, but for the issue at hand, the relevant file is `latex.py` because the error traceback involves LaTeX printing.\n   - **Analysis:** This method is responsible for rendering the `LambertW` function in LaTeX format. Given its presence in the stack trace, it's clear that the issue arises when this function is called with an unexpected keyword argument `exp`.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Ideally, this method should correctly interpret the `LambertW` function, possibly including any powers it's raised to, and convert it into a valid LaTeX string for display in JupyterLab. The bug indicates that it does not handle cases where `LambertW` is part of a power expression (`Pow`) correctly.\n\n2. **_print_Pow Method:**\n   - Found in `sympy/printing/latex.py` among other locations. This specific implementation is of interest because it deals with rendering power expressions in LaTeX, which is directly related to the issue.\n   - **Analysis:** `_print_Pow` is designed to handle expressions where one element is raised to the power of another. The error suggests that when it encounters a `LambertW` function as the base of a power expression, it attempts to pass an `exp` argument to `_print_LambertW`, which is not expecting this argument.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** The method should be able to print any expression, including functions like `LambertW`, raised to any power, in LaTeX format correctly. It implies that there needs to be seamless handling or a special case for functions that might not directly accept an `exp` parameter in their print method.\n\nGiven these analyses, it appears the issue arises due to a mismatch in expectations between `_print_Pow` and `_print_LambertW`, where the latter does not handle an `exp` argument that the former tries to provide in the case of rendering power expressions involving the Lambert function.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we may need to see the exact implementations of these methods in `sympy/printing/latex.py` to understand how they currently handle expressions and how `_print_LambertW` can be modified to accommodate the `exp` parameter or how `_print_Pow` can adapt its behavior when dealing with `LambertW`.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"_print_LambertW\", \"sympy/printing/latex.py\")` - This will provide the implementation details of the `_print_LambertW` method, specifically how it is currently set up to handle inputs and why it might not accept an `exp` argument.\n2. `search_method_in_file(\"_print_Pow\", \"sympy/printing/latex.py\")` - To see how power expressions are handled and why an `exp` keyword is being passed to `_print_LambertW`.\n\nThis analysis should offer a clearer direction on how to approach fixing the bug, focusing on modifying one or both methods to ensure compatibility and correct handling of power expressions involving the `LambertW` function."

This could involve adjusting the method to check for an `exp` argument and format the LaTeX output to display the function raised to this power appropriately. The method should preserve its current functionality of printing `LambertW` while adding the capability to handle cases where it is part of an expression involving a power.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `sympy/printing/latex.py`\n  - **Class:** Same as above, likely the `LatexPrinter` class.\n  - **Method:** `_print_Pow`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** This method may need a minor adjustment to ensure that when it delegates the printing of base expressions like `LambertW` to their respective printing methods (in this case, `_print_LambertW`), it does so in a way that is compatible with those methods' expected parameters. Specifically, if a special handling or forwarding of the `exp` parameter is necessary for functions that do not natively handle it, `_print_Pow` should conditionally format its request based on the base expression's type. This behavior would ensure that `LambertW` or similar functions raised to a power are printed correctly without causing a `TypeError`.\n\nThe resolution involves ensuring these two methods work together harmoniously to print expressions involving `LambertW` raised to powers, without introducing a breaking change or a conflict with the handling of other types of expressions."
