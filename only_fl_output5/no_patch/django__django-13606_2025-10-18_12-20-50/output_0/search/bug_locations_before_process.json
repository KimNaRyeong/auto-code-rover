        "intended_behavior": "The `split_exclude` method in the `Query` class currently constructs a subquery using a `NOT IN` SQL clause to exclude records linked through multi-valued relationships. The intended behavior is to modify this method to use a `NOT EXISTS` SQL clause instead. This change aims to improve performance and address potential issues with `NULL` values that can arise with the `NOT IN` approach.\n\nTo preserve existing functionality while implementing this change, the method must still:\n\n- Accurately exclude the intended records based on the provided filter expression.\n- Handle `NULL` values correctly, such that the presence of `NULL` does not incorrectly affect the exclusion logic.\n- Maintain performance, or preferably improve it, by leveraging `NOT EXISTS` in a way that database query planners can more efficiently optimize.\n\nSpecifically, the modification should:\n\n- Replace the current construct of generating a subquery for `NOT IN` with a `NOT EXISTS` clause that includes the same filtering criteria within its subquery.\n- Ensure that the `NOT EXISTS` check integrates seamlessly with the outer query, adequately applying the exclusion criteria without introducing inefficiencies or changing the semantic meaning of the query.\n- Retain compatibility with Django's support for multiple database backends, ensuring that the change is applicable and optimized across different SQL dialects.\n\nThis change would directly address the issue's concern regarding optimization difficulties and the handling of `NULL` values by `NOT IN`, ultimately leading to more reliable and potentially faster query execution in the ORM's handling of exclude operations involving multi-valued relationships."
