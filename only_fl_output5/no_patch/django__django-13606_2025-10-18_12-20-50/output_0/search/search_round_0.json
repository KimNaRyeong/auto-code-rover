        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue regarding the use of `EXISTS` to exclude multi-valued relationships instead of using `NOT IN`, we should start by identifying the specific method and possibly the class where this logic is implemented. According to the issue description, the logic in question is part of `sql.Query.split_exclude`. This information suggests that we need to look into the `Query` class for a method named `split_exclude`. Let's start our search with these targets:\n\n1. Search for the `Query` class in the entire codebase to find the file it resides in.\n2. Search for the method `split_exclude` within the `Query` class to locate its implementation.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Query\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"split_exclude\", \"Query\")\n```"
