The autodetector should then ensure that this dependency is explicitly declared in the generated migration file, ensuring that related models are migrated in the correct order to maintain referential integrity. Specifically, upon detecting the change type, the system should insert a corresponding dependency statement in the migration file pointing to the necessary `App2` migration if it's not already present."

        "intended_behavior": "Ensure that dependencies declared by changes in model relations are correctly serialized into the migration file. This includes the scenario where a `ForeignKey` is introduced. The migration system should verify that the target model (`App2` in this case) is fully recognized and any migration involving the target model is treated as a dependency, thus preventing the `ValueError` by ensuring `App2` is resolved before applying changes to `App1`."
