To understand how models `App1` and `App2` are defined and interact in the project.\n   - `search_class(\"App1\")`\n   - `search_class(\"App2\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a problem with migrations after changing a field, it's essential to examine the migration files or scripts related to these changes.\n   - `search_code(\"Migration\")`\n\n3. To diagnose the issue related to dependencies not being created correctly in the migration, insights into how the ForeignKey relation is established in the code will be crucial.\n   - `search_code(\"ForeignKey(App2, null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, verbose_name=_('another app'))\")`\n\n4. Given the mention of a test resulting in a `ValueError`, understanding the test setup might offer some clues.\n   - `search_code(\"ValueError: Related model 'testapp2.App2' cannot be resolved\")` \n\nThese calls aim to provide a comprehensive view of the migration issue, examine how foreign key relationships are crafted and referenced in the models, and explore possible reasons for the migration not recognizing dependencies as expected."
