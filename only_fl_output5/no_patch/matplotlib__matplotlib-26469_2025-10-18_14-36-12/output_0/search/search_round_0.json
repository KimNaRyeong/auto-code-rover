        "content": "<issue>Change PdfPages to default to keep_empty=False and eventually deprecate keep_empty\nPdfPages has an option, `keep_empty`, that sets whether a PdfPages object with *zero* figures is written to the disk at all or not.  This was introduced in #2453; previously PdfPages behaved as if `keep_empty=True` (and this was left the default to maintain backcompat).\nIn fact, a pdf file with zero pages is simply not a valid pdf document.  See e.g. the pdf standard (https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf) p. 33: \"A PDF document consists of a collection of objects that together describe the appearance of *one or more pages*...\" (emphasis mine).  Or one can simply check that the empty file created by `PdfPages(\"/tmp/foo.pdf\").close()` is indeed deemed invalid (error-on-open) by at least Acrobat, mupdf, and xpdf.\nThus I propose to eventually stop generating such invalid files at all via switching the default value to `keep_empty=False` and eventually killing the kwarg (deprecation strategy TBD, perhaps warn (with a suppress_warning kwarg) if such a file would have been created, yada yada).\n(Apparently multipage support in mplcairo is getting used, and cairo cannot generate zero-page pdfs, so that's how I found out about this...)\n</issue>"

Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"PdfPages\")` - This will help us identify in which files the `PdfPages` class is defined.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"close\", \"PdfPages\")` - Since the issue specifically mentions the effect of calling `close()` on a `PdfPages` object, it's important to understand the implementation of this method.\n3. `search_code(\"keep_empty=True\")` - To understand how and where `keep_empty` is set to its default value and how it's used throughout the project.\n4. `search_method(\"PdfPages\")` - This will give context on how `PdfPages` is instantiated across the codebase, which could reveal additional places where the `keep_empty` parameter is being used or set."
