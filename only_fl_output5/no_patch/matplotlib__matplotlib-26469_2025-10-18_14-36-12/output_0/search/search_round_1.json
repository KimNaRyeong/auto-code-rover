This was introduced in #2453; previously PdfPages behaved as if `keep_empty=True` (and this was left the default to maintain backcompat).\nIn fact, a pdf file with zero pages is simply not a valid pdf document.  See e.g. the pdf standard (https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf) p. 33: \"A PDF document consists of a collection of objects that together describe the appearance of *one or more pages*...\" (emphasis mine).  Or one can simply check that the empty file created by `PdfPages(\"/tmp/foo.pdf\").close()` is indeed deemed invalid (error-on-open) by at least Acrobat, mupdf, and xpdf.\nThus I propose to eventually stop generating such invalid files at all via switching the default value to `keep_empty=False` and eventually killing the kwarg (deprecation strategy TBD, perhaps warn (with a suppress_warning kwarg) if such a file would have been created, yada yada).\n(Apparently multipage support in mplcairo is getting used, and cairo cannot generate zero-page pdfs, so that's how I found out about this...)\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context in light of the issue regarding changing the default behavior of the `keep_empty` option in the `PdfPages` class, and contemplating on deprecating this option, let's delve into each part of the gathered information:\n\n### Analysis of PdfPages class definitions\n- **Files Involved**: The `PdfPages` class is defined in two files: `backend_pdf.py` and `backend_pgf.py`. This indicates that the issue affects multiple backends within the project, likely impacting both PDF and PGF outputs.\n- **Key Points**: Both class definitions include the `keep_empty` parameter in their `__init__` methods, defaulting to `True`. This aligns with the issue's detail on `keep_empty` currently defaulting to maintaining backward compatibility but suggesting a change towards defaulting to `False`.\n\n### Analysis of `close` method in `PdfPages`\n- **Functionality**:\n  1. **backend_pdf.py**: The `close` method finalizes the PDF file, and if `keep_empty` is `False` and no pages have been added, it removes the generated file. This directly relates to the issue as it determines the condition under which an empty PDF might be removed or retained.\n  2. **backend_pgf.py**: This `close` method behaves differently; it either runs LaTeX or creates an empty file if `keep_empty` is `True`, regardless of the number of figures.\n- **Relevance to Issue**: The current implementation in `backend_pdf.py` attempts to address the problem of invalid empty PDFs by offering the option to avoid writing them to disk. The PGF backend's approach highlights a conditional handling of empty files. Changing the default behavior of `keep_empty` would directly impact these sections, making them critical to solving the issue.\n\n### Analysis of `keep_empty=True` default setting\n- **Location and Impact**: The default setting is confirmed in the initialization methods (`__init__`) of `PdfPages` in both affected files. This setting is the crux of the issue, as it leads to the creation of potentially invalid empty PDF documents by default.\n- **Intended Change**: Given the issue description, the intended behavior would shift this default to `False`, meaning the system should, by default, not generate or keep empty PDFs, thereby aligning with the PDF specification and reducing the generation of invalid files.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\nGiven the insights from the analysis:\n- **Immediate Task**: Propose changing the default value of `keep_empty` to `False` in both `__init__` methods within `backend_pdf.py` and `backend_pgf.py`. This entails modifying the function definitions to reflect the new default.\n- **Long-term Task**: Plan for the deprecation of `keep_empty` by first introducing warnings when files would not be created due to this setting. This requires an addition to the logic in the `close` method to inform users when their expected output may be suppressed due to the new default behavior.\n\n### Additional Necessary Context\nWhile the analysis covered the directly related code snippets and functionalities, understanding how `PdfPages` objects are instantiated throughout the codebase is critical for assessing the impact of these changes. Given that no results were returned for searching the method `\"PdfPages\"`, it would be beneficial to identify calls to the `PdfPages` constructor. A more correct approach would be to search for instances where `PdfPages` is instantiated (`new PdfPages`) across the codebase. Thus, additional API call(s) should be made:\n\n- `search_code(\"new PdfPages\")` - This would ideally find instantiation occurrences, but given the mistake in the initial query (method search instead of code or constructor search), this could provide insight into how `PdfPages` is used across the project.\n\nThis step is crucial for ensuring that changing the default `keep_empty` behavior does not unexpectedly affect other parts of the project."

This change will ensure that by default, `PdfPages` does not generate an empty PDF file if no figures are added. This behavior aligns with the PDF specification, which suggests that a valid PDF document should contain one or more pages.\n  \n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File**: lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pgf.py\n  - **Class**: PdfPages\n  - **Method**: __init__\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Similar to the change in `backend_pdf.py`, update the `__init__` method to default `keep_empty` to `False`. This ensures consistency across different backends in handling the creation of potentially empty PDF files.\n  \n- **Location 3:**\n  - **File**: lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py\n  - **Class**: PdfPages\n  - **Method**: close\n  - **Intended Behavior**: With `keep_empty` defaulting to `False`, the logic in `close` that checks whether to delete the file (if it has zero pages and `keep_empty` is `False`) will work as intended without modification. However, consider adding logging or warnings to notify users about the suppression of empty PDF file generation based on the `keep_empty` flag. This can aid in the transition and inform users of the change in behavior.\n  \n- **Location 4:**\n  - **File**: lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pgf.py\n  - **Class**: PdfPages\n  - **Method**: close\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Ensure that with the new default behavior (`keep_empty=False`), the method respects this setting and does not create an empty file unless explicitly overridden by the user. This may involve additional checks or logic to ensure that an empty PDF file is only created if `keep_empty` is explicitly set to `True` by the user, thus preventing the generation of invalid PDF documents.\n\nThese changes collectively aim to shift the default behavior towards not generating empty PDF files, which would otherwise be invalid according to the PDF specification. Additionally, these modifications preserve the ability for users to opt-in to keep empty PDFs if they choose, allowing for backward compatibility through explicit configuration."
