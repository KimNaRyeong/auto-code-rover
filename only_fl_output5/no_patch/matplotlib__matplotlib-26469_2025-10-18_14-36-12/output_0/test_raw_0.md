This script aims to recreate the issue described, involving the `keep_empty` parameter default behavior of the `PdfPages` object from the `matplotlib` library. The script:

- Imports necessary modules.
- Defines a function `print_stacktrace` to print exception stack traces explicitly.
- Tries to create a `PdfPages` object without adding any figures to it, then closes it.
- It then checks if an empty PDF file is created by asserting the non-existence of the file. If the PDF file exists, it means `keep_empty` defaulted to `True`, thus raising an `AssertionError`.
- If the issue is patched (i.e., `keep_empty=False` becomes the default), the PDF file without any pages should not exist, and the script will not raise an assertion error.

It's important to run this script in an environment where `matplotlib` is installed, as it relies on the `PdfPages` class from that package.
