This was introduced in #2453; previously PdfPages behaved as if `keep_empty=True` (and this was left the default to maintain backcompat).\r\n\r\nIn fact, a pdf file with zero pages is simply not a valid pdf document.  See e.g. the pdf standard (https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf) p. 33: \"A PDF document consists of a collection of objects that together describe the appearance of *one or more pages*...\" (emphasis mine).  Or one can simply check that the empty file created by `PdfPages(\"/tmp/foo.pdf\").close()` is indeed deemed invalid (error-on-open) by at least Acrobat, mupdf, and xpdf.\r\n\r\nThus I propose to eventually stop generating such invalid files at all via switching the default value to `keep_empty=False` and eventually killing the kwarg (deprecation strategy TBD, perhaps warn (with a suppress_warning kwarg) if such a file would have been created, yada yada).\r\n\r\n(Apparently multipage support in mplcairo is getting used, and cairo cannot generate zero-page pdfs, so that's how I found out about this...)\n"

The script:\n\n- Imports necessary modules.\n- Defines a function `print_stacktrace` to print exception stack traces explicitly.\n- Tries to create a `PdfPages` object without adding any figures to it, then closes it.\n- It then checks if an empty PDF file is created by asserting the non-existence of the file. If the PDF file exists, it means `keep_empty` defaulted to `True`, thus raising an `AssertionError`.\n- If the issue is patched (i.e., `keep_empty=False` becomes the default), the PDF file without any pages should not exist, and the script will not raise an assertion error.\n\nIt's important to run this script in an environment where `matplotlib` is installed, as it relies on the `PdfPages` class from that package."
