This was introduced in #2453; previously PdfPages behaved as if `keep_empty=True` (and this was left the default to maintain backcompat).\r\n\r\nIn fact, a pdf file with zero pages is simply not a valid pdf document.  See e.g. the pdf standard (https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf) p. 33: \"A PDF document consists of a collection of objects that together describe the appearance of *one or more pages*...\" (emphasis mine).  Or one can simply check that the empty file created by `PdfPages(\"/tmp/foo.pdf\").close()` is indeed deemed invalid (error-on-open) by at least Acrobat, mupdf, and xpdf.\r\n\r\nThus I propose to eventually stop generating such invalid files at all via switching the default value to `keep_empty=False` and eventually killing the kwarg (deprecation strategy TBD, perhaps warn (with a suppress_warning kwarg) if such a file would have been created, yada yada).\r\n\r\n(Apparently multipage support in mplcairo is getting used, and cairo cannot generate zero-page pdfs, so that's how I found out about this...)\n"

        "content": "Given your request, let's adjust the reproducibility script to directly reflect the nature of the issue, acknowledging that the initial script version did not clearly demonstrate the problem relative to the stated requirements. \n\nWe'll modify the script so it more directly checks the `keep_empty` parameter's impact and confirms the actual creation of an invalid PDF (zero pages). The expectation is that, when `keep_empty` defaults to `True` (which is the current behavior causing the issue), the PDF file is created even without any figures being added, which is contrary to the PDF standard. With `keep_empty=False` being the desired default, the script should ideally not find any file once this change is implemented correctly, satisfying the assertion and resolving the issue.\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf import PdfPages\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef test_keep_empty_default_behavior():\n    filepath = \"/tmp/test_empty.pdf\"\n    \n    try:\n        with PdfPages(filepath) as pdf:\n            # No figures are added to the PdfPages object, it is closed immediately\n            pass\n\n        # Check if the file exists to determine if keep_empty defaults to True incorrectly\n        file_exists = os.path.exists(filepath)\n        assert not file_exists, \"PDF file was created despite keep_empty should default to False, indicating an issue.\"\n        \n        if file_exists:\n            os.remove(filepath)  # Cleanup if file was incorrectly created\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_keep_empty_default_behavior()\n```\n\nThis version of the script specifically checks for the creation of an unwanted empty PDF file, which should not happen if `keep_empty=False` is properly set as the default behavior. The script will raise an `AssertionError` if the PDF file is found, echoing that the default behavior is not as desired (thus, the issue is present). Otherwise, if no file is created (indicating `keep_empty` behaves as `False` by default), the script should exit normally, signifying the absence (or resolution) of the issue."
