Understanding your requirements, let's craft a Python script that reproduces the issue with `PdfPages` “keep_empty” behavior, adhering to the conditions you've specified. This script will attempt to create a PDF with no pages and then assess the validity of that file regarding the `keep_empty` option's current functionality. This demonstration aims to raise an `AssertionError` under the current behavior (if `keep_empty=True` allows for an empty file creation, thus demonstrating the issue) and exit normally if the behavior is corrected (`keep_empty=False` as default, preventing empty PDF creation).

```python
import os
from matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf import PdfPages

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    pdf_path = "/tmp/test_pdfpages.pdf"

    # Attempt to create a PDF file with no content under the assumption keep_empty is True by default.
    try:
        with PdfPages(pdf_path) as pdf:
            pass  # No pages added intentionally.

        # Assess whether the PDF file exists, indicative of keep_empty=True being the default.
        if os.path.exists(pdf_path):
            raise AssertionError("PdfPages allows creation of an invalid (empty) PDF file. This behavior is against PDF standards and should be corrected by defaulting keep_empty to False.")

        print("The issue does not exist; PdfPages behaves correctly by not saving an empty PDF file.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    finally:
        # Cleanup; remove the file if it was created.
        if os.path.exists(pdf_path):
            os.remove(pdf_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script directly targets the issue of creating an invalid, empty PDF file when the `keep_empty` option incorrectly defaults to `True`. The assertion specifically fails if an empty file is created, printing the stack trace to detail the execution path leading to this outcome, thus illustrating the problematic behavior. Conversely, if the file is not created, it indicates adherence to the PDF standard and correct handling by `PdfPages`, demonstrating the expected or corrected behavior (e.g., when `keep_empty=False` becomes the default).
