        "intended_behavior": "In the `OneMatrix` class, the method (or methods) for integrating with SymPy's printing subsystem\u2014particularly for `pretty`, `latex`, and `MathML` presentation\u2014need to correctly implement the formatting of a `OneMatrix` instance. These methods should ensure that a `OneMatrix` is represented using the appropriate symbols or tags depending on the context (e.g., Unicode double-struck characters for pretty printing, LaTeX commands for LaTeX printing, and MathML tags for MathML output). The addition of such methods would allow `OneMatrix` to be printed consistently with other matrix types like `ZeroMatrix` and `Identity`, enhancing the library's usability for displaying these special matrices."

This enhancement requires modifying or ensuring that the pretty print method in this class accurately reflects the identity matrix in a visually intuitive manner to users, consistently across different outputs including unicode, LaTeX, and MathML, without altering the fundamental printing architecture of SymPy."
