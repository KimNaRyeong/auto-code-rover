These methods are essential for any cache backend, allowing for the retrieval and removal of cached data.\n    - In the `__init__` method, there's a specific mention and handling of different behavior between `python-memcached` versions, which is directly related to how non-existent keys are treated by the `incr/decr` methods.\n\n2. **Relation to the Issue**:\n    - The issue at hand is about deprecating the `MemcachedCache` due to the lack of maintenance on the `python-memcached` library (which `MemcachedCache` relies on) and the existence of an alternative in the form of a `pymemcache` backend.\n    - The initialization code of this class directly imports and uses the `memcache` module from `python-memcached`, which underscores the dependency on this unmaintained library.\n    - The comments in the code about handling different versions of `python-memcached` demonstrate potential complications in maintaining compatibility or addressing issues due to these dependencies.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior with Respect to the Issue**:\n    - Since the proposal is to deprecate `MemcachedCache`, the intended behavior moving forward would be to prevent or warn against its new usage in favor of the alternative `pymemcache` backend.\n    - A deprecation involves not only modifying or annotating the class to indicate its deprecated status but also ensuring that documentation, examples, and possibly runtime warnings guide developers towards the alternative.\n    - Considering the constructor's specific mention of `python-memcached`, part of the deprecation might include advising on or providing migration tips for projects moving from `python-memcached` to `pymemcache`.\n\nGiven this analysis, further steps might include identifying documentation or configuration entries that reference `MemcachedCache` to ensure they are updated with deprecation notices. Additionally, looking for any system tests or examples that instantiate `MemcachedCache` might be crucial to fully understand the impact of this deprecation on current and future projects using Django."

The intended behavior here, to address the issue, is to mark the `MemcachedCache` class as deprecated. This could involve adding a deprecation warning within the `__init__` method that alerts users when an instance of `MemcachedCache` is initialized, advising them to switch to the recommended alternative. Direct references to `python-memcached` should be accompanied by comments or documentation updates explaining the deprecation status and suggesting the migration path to `pymemcache`.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** django/core/cache/backends/memcached.py\n  - **Documentation or Comments related to `MemcachedCache`**\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Update all related documentation within this file, and possibly across the entire Django project, that mentions `MemcachedCache`. This includes class-level comments, method-level docstrings, and any inline comments that might guide users towards using `MemcachedCache`. The documentation should clearly state that `MemcachedCache` is deprecated starting from Django 3.2 and will be removed in Django 4.1. Concise instructions or a reference link should be provided to guide users towards migrating to the `pymemcache` backend.\n\nThese locations and intended modifications aim not only to deprecate `MemcachedCache` in a manner that\u2019s clear and helpful to developers but also to maintain the integrity and functionality of projects currently relying on `MemcachedCache` until they can migrate to the newer alternative."
