        "intended_behavior": "The `floatformat` method should be able to gracefully handle a case when the precision argument (`arg`) is `0`, without throwing a `ValueError: valid range for prec is [1, MAX_PREC]`. Currently, the method fails because it does not anticipate or correctly handle a precision value of `0`, which is a valid user expectation for rounding to a whole number. The calculation and application of the `prec` variable need to be adjusted such that:\n\n- When `arg == 0`, the method should round the input number to the nearest whole number and output it without any decimal places or cause a ValueError due to invalid `prec` range.\n- The fix should preserve all existing functionality, including handling of positive and negative precision arguments, locale-specific formatting, and handling special cases such as infinity or NaN.\n\nThis adjustment will require a review and potentially a modification of the section where `prec` is calculated and used, ensuring that a `prec` value of `0` is validly handled while maintaining the overall behavior and features of the `floatformat` function."
