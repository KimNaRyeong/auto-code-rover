Here's how we can approach it:\n\n1. Since the issue occurs within Django's templating system, specifically with the `floatformat` filter, finding where this method is defined is our first step.\n2. Understand how `floatformat` processes the precision argument, as the error message suggests an issue with handling the range of acceptable values for `prec`.\n\nGiven the information from the issue, let's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n- search_method(\"floatformat\")\n- search_code(\"def floatformat\")"
