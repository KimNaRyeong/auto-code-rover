        "content": "To gather sufficient context to understand why pylint outputs different results when running with `--jobs=1` and `--jobs=2`, we need to investigate how pylint manages parallel execution and how it collects and outputs linting results. Based on the issue description, we should look into the implementation details related to the multiprocessing or parallel execution logic in pylint, as well as how it gathers and prints linting messages. Given the information, here are potential API calls that can help us gather the relevant context:\n\n1. **Search for code related to handling of `--jobs` argument**: This will likely be in the CLI parsing section or configuration setup of pylint.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"--jobs\")\n```\n\n2. **Search for the implementation of parallel execution**: This might involve looking for specific classes or methods that manage the execution of linting tasks in parallel, which could be named in ways that reference multiprocessing, parallel, jobs, or similar.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Parallel\")\nsearch_method(\"execute_parallel\")\n```\n\n3. **Search for how pylint collects and aggregates lint messages**: Identifying how pylint aggregates linting messages from different files or modules in both single and multiple job modes could be crucial.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"collect_messages\")\nsearch_method(\"aggregate_results\")\n```\n\n4. **Search for any known issues in message printing or ordering in parallel mode**: There might be utility functions or methods involved in printing or ordering the lint messages that could behave differently when in parallel mode.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"print_messages\")\nsearch_code(\"sort_messages\")\n```\n\nThese API calls are aimed at pinpointing areas in the pylint codebase that could be responsible for differing outputs when changing the number of jobs."
