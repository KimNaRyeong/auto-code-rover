The intended behavior here would be to ensure that tasks are distributed and executed in a way that results collected from each process are complete and consistent, regardless of the number of jobs specified. An improvement or bug fix in this area might involve ensuring that each process receives a full and correct context for its linting tasks, and that there's a robust collection and aggregation process for the results from each job."

The intended behavior would involve ensuring that results from all jobs are accounted for without loss or duplication and are aggregated in a manner that does not depend on the order of completion of the jobs. This may require reviewing and potentially adjusting the logic that initializes, monitors, and concludes the parallel processes, specifically ensuring that there\u2019s an accurate and consistent method of collating results from multiple processes into the final output."
