Given the provided details and the request to create a script that can reproduce the issue of differing outputs from `pylint` when run with different `--jobs` settings, I will construct a simple script. This script will run `pylint` on a sample Python file using two different `--jobs` settings and compare their outputs. If the outputs differ, it will print a stack trace of the issue using the provided stack trace printing function. 

For this scenario, I'm assuming you have some familiarity with your environment and that `pylint` is accessible in your environment's PATH. Should the environment issues persist (as mentioned in your previous attempt), ensure that `pylint` is correctly installed and accessible.

Here's the `reproducer.py`:

```python
import subprocess
import tempfile
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def run_pylint(jobs):
    """
    Run pylint with the specified number of jobs on a temporary file and return the output.
    """
    # Creating a temporary Python file with some content that would generate pylint output
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=".py", mode="w+") as temp_py_file:
        temp_py_file.write("import os\nprint(os.getcwd())\n")
        temp_py_file.flush()
        
        # Running pylint on the temporary file
        try:
            result = subprocess.run(["pylint", f"--jobs={jobs}", temp_py_file.name],
                                    capture_output=True, text=True)
            return result.stdout + result.stderr
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(1)

def compare_outputs(output_1, output_2):
    """Compare the outputs of two pylint runs. Raise AssertionError if they differ."""
    if output_1 != output_2:
        raise AssertionError("Mismatch in pylint outputs detected.")

def main():
    output_1 = run_pylint(1)
    output_2 = run_pylint(2)

    try:
        compare_outputs(output_1, output_2)
        print("No issue detected: Outputs are consistent across job settings.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exiting with code 0 when the issue is not detected
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Raise an exception to highlight the issue is present

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script:
- Creates a temporary Python file with some dummy content.
- Runs `pylint` on this file with `--jobs=1` and `--jobs=2`.
- Compares the outputs and checks for discrepancies.
- Uses the provided `print_stacktrace` function if there's an exception or assertion error due to differing outputs.

Ensure you have executed `pip install pylint` or have `pylint` available in your environment before running this script. You should replace the dummy Python content with specific code patterns or structures you suspect are causing the discrepancy in `pylint` outputs when run with different `--jobs` settings if needed.
