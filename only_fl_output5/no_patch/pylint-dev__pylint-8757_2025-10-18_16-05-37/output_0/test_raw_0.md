Here is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that attempts to replicate the reported issue of differing outputs when running `pylint` with different `--jobs` settings. This script runs `pylint` on a test directory or files with both single and multiple jobs, compares their outputs disregarding the order since that's expected to differ, and raises an `AssertionError` if the actual findings (errors/warnings) differ in content, not just in order.

```python
import subprocess
import sys
import tempfile
from pathlib import Path

def run_pylint(jobs: int, target: str) -> str:
    """
    Run pylint on the given target with the specified number of jobs.
    Returns the stdout and stderr combined as a single string.
    """
    result = subprocess.run(
        ['pylint', f'--jobs={jobs}', target],
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,
        text=True
    )
    return result.stdout

def compare_pylint_outputs(output1: str, output2: str):
    """
    Compare two pylint outputs, ignoring the order of the lines.
    Raise an AssertionError if they differ in content.
    """
    set1 = set(output1.strip().split("\n"))
    set2 = set(output2.strip().split("\n"))
    if set1 != set2:
        raise AssertionError("Different outputs detected")

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    """
    Print a stack trace from an exception object with clearer line numbers
    and code context.
    """
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Temporary directory to hold dummy Python files for linting
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
        tmpdir_path = Path(tmpdir)
        # Creating a dummy python file to replicate the issue
        test_file = tmpdir_path / "test.py"
        test_file.write_text("import os\n\nos.system('echo Hello world')\n")
        
        try:
            output1 = run_pylint(1, str(test_file))
            output2 = run_pylint(2, str(test_file))

            compare_pylint_outputs(output1, output2)
            print("No issue detected: Outputs are consistent across job settings.")

        except AssertionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(1)
        except Exception as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script works as follows:
- It creates a temporary Python file that is expected to trigger at least one `pylint` warning/error when linted, in order to have a minimal, reproducible test case.
- It runs `pylint` on this file once with `--jobs=1` and once with `--jobs=2`, capturing the outputs of each run.
- It then compares these outputs, checking if they differ beyond just the order of warnings/errors (which is expected due to the inherent nature of parallel processing).
- If the content of the findings differs (indicating a real issue where parallel processing alters the results beyond order), the script raises an `AssertionError`.
- If an error occurs during the process, the script prints a stack trace before exiting.

Note: This script assumes `pylint` is installed and accessible in the environment where the script runs. Adjustments might be needed based on the specific setup or requirements of the project being linted.
