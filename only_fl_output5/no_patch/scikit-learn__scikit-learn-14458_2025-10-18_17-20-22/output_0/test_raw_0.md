This script attempts to fit a `Ridge` model using the SAG solver with data from the `fetch_openml` method. It specifically looks for an issue related to non-C-contiguous arrays leading to a `ValueError`. If the `ValueError` is caught and matches the expected message about the array not being C-contiguous, it prints the stack trace for that exception and exits with code 0, indicating the presence of this specific issue. The script uses an assertion to ensure that the error message matches the expected one about C-contiguity, which helps confirm that the issue is precisely the one described.
