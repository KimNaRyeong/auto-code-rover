The error message suggests that `scikit-learn` has not been built correctly or is not properly installed in your environment. \n\nHowever, to adhere to the objective of creating a reproducible example for the original issue, I've adjusted the script to encapsulate the original intent. This revised script should be executed under the assumption that `scikit-learn` is correctly installed and built in your environment. Make sure `scikit-learn` is properly installed by running `pip install -U scikit-learn` or by following the official installation instructions. \n\nHere is a revised standalone script that directly addresses reproducing the originally mentioned issue involving `Ridge` regression with the SAG solver. This script includes handling for the specific error scenario discussed:\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\nimport sys\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Ridge\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef fit_model():\n    census = fetch_openml(data_id=534, as_frame=True)\n    X, y = census.data, census.target\n    numerical_cols = ['AGE', 'EDUCATION', 'EXPERIENCE']\n    try:\n        # To ensure the expected failure, we force the conversion to a numpy array that is not C-contiguous\n        X_forced_non_c_contiguous = np.asfortranarray(X[numerical_cols])\n        model = Ridge(solver='sag').fit(X_forced_non_c_contiguous, y)\n        print(\"No issue detected. Model fitted successfully.\")\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        # We expect a 'ndarray is not C-contiguous' error\n        assert \"ndarray is not C-contiguous\" in str(e), \"Error does not match expected 'ndarray is not C-contiguous'\"\n        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with 0 if the assert passes, indicating the issue is present as expected\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        fit_model()\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print(\"AssertionError indicating a different issue was encountered.\", file=sys.stderr)\n        print(str(e), file=sys.stderr)\n        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with 1 to indicate the script did not find the specific expected error\n```\n\nBefore running the `reproducer.py`, make sure your `scikit-learn` package is properly installed and built to avoid the initial error you encountered. This script is prepared to encounter the 'ndarray is not C-contiguous' error and will handle it by printing the stack trace and asserting the presence of the error, according to your specification."
