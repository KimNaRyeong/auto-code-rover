Certainly! Here's a modified version of the standalone Python script named `reproducer.py`, crafted to reproduce the issue noted in your request. This version of the script closely follows the instructions, aiming to detect specifically the 'ndarray is not C-contiguous' error when using the Ridge regression with the SAG solver from scikit-learn. 

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
import sys
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        census = fetch_openml(data_id=534, as_frame=True)
        X, y = census.data, census.target
        numerical_cols = ['AGE', 'EDUCATION', 'EXPERIENCE']
        
        # Fetch data and ensure it is not C-contiguous to replicate the issue
        X_selected = X[numerical_cols]
        X_selected_non_c = np.asfortranarray(X_selected)
        assert not X_selected_non_c.flags['C_CONTIGUOUS'], "Array unexpectedly C-contiguous"
        
        model = Ridge(solver='sag')
        model.fit(X_selected_non_c, y)
        
        print("Test passed: Issue not present or has been fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate no error
    
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        if "ndarray is not C-contiguous" in str(e):
            print("Issue reproduced successfully.")
        else:
            print("Unexpected error encountered.")
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 for errors

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script specifically checks if the 'ndarray is not C-contiguous' error occurs when attempting to fit a model with an array that is deliberately made non-C-contiguous. The `main` function outlines the process for reproducing the issue:

1. Fetches the `census` dataset using `fetch_openml`.
2. Selects specified numerical columns.
3. Converts the data to a Fortran-style array to ensure it's not C-contiguous.
4. Tries to fit a `Ridge` model using the SAG solver with this data.
5. Catches any exceptions, checks the error message, and exits accordingly.

If you encounter an `ImportError` or a build-related issue, ensure that your scikit-learn installation is correct and that all dependencies are properly installed. If using a development version of scikit-learn, ensure that it has been built correctly from source.
