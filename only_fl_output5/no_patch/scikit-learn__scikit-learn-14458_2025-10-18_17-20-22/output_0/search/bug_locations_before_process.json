        "intended_behavior": "Prior to passing the `X` numpy array to the `ArrayDataset64` or `ArrayDataset32` constructor in the `make_dataset` function, the code should ensure that `X` is C-contiguous. This can be achieved by checking the contiguity of `X` and, if necessary, converting `X` to C-contiguous format using `numpy.ascontiguousarray(X)` (or a similar method deemed appropriate within the context of scikit-learn's practices). This step ensures that when `ArrayDataset64` or `ArrayDataset32` receives the `X` array, it meets the internal requirement for being C-contiguous, thereby preventing the `ValueError: ndarray is not C-contiguous` from occurring. This addition preserves the existing functionality for handling both sparse and dense data inputs. For dense inputs, it adds a necessary pre-processing step to align with the expected input format of `ArrayDataset64` or `ArrayDataset32`, thus avoiding the generation of errors related to data contiguity. This change must be carefully implemented to ensure that it doesn't unintentionally affect performance or data integrity, especially considering the implications of copying large datasets to satisfy contiguity requirements."
