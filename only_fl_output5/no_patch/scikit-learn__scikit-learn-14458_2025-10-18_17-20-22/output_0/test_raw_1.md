Given the specific instructions and the error message shown in your provided log, it seems the error encountered is related to the installation or build process of `scikit-learn`, not directly to the code attempting to reproduce the originally described issue. The error message suggests that `scikit-learn` has not been built correctly or is not properly installed in your environment. 

However, to adhere to the objective of creating a reproducible example for the original issue, I've adjusted the script to encapsulate the original intent. This revised script should be executed under the assumption that `scikit-learn` is correctly installed and built in your environment. Make sure `scikit-learn` is properly installed by running `pip install -U scikit-learn` or by following the official installation instructions. 

Here is a revised standalone script that directly addresses reproducing the originally mentioned issue involving `Ridge` regression with the SAG solver. This script includes handling for the specific error scenario discussed:

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def fit_model():
    census = fetch_openml(data_id=534, as_frame=True)
    X, y = census.data, census.target
    numerical_cols = ['AGE', 'EDUCATION', 'EXPERIENCE']
    try:
        # To ensure the expected failure, we force the conversion to a numpy array that is not C-contiguous
        X_forced_non_c_contiguous = np.asfortranarray(X[numerical_cols])
        model = Ridge(solver='sag').fit(X_forced_non_c_contiguous, y)
        print("No issue detected. Model fitted successfully.")
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # We expect a 'ndarray is not C-contiguous' error
        assert "ndarray is not C-contiguous" in str(e), "Error does not match expected 'ndarray is not C-contiguous'"
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with 0 if the assert passes, indicating the issue is present as expected

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        fit_model()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("AssertionError indicating a different issue was encountered.", file=sys.stderr)
        print(str(e), file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with 1 to indicate the script did not find the specific expected error
```

Before running the `reproducer.py`, make sure your `scikit-learn` package is properly installed and built to avoid the initial error you encountered. This script is prepared to encounter the 'ndarray is not C-contiguous' error and will handle it by printing the stack trace and asserting the presence of the error, according to your specification.
