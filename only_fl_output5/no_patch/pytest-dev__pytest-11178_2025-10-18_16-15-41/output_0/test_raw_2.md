Given the objective to directly reproduce the issue as initially reported within a standalone Python script, Iâ€™ll provide an approach that incorporates the pytest framework functionality into a script context. However, it's crucial to remember that pytest's assertions and utilities such as `approx` are primarily designed to work within the pytest test execution environment. To script a reproducible condition for the reported error and use pytest appropriately, the execution will simulate a test environment context within the standalone script. This involves a somewhat unconventional setup for invoking pytest programmatically to execute a test that demonstrates the issue.

Please find below an adjusted version of `reproducer.py`, which captures the essence of the reported issue within a pytest test, executed programmatically from within a standalone Python script:

```python
import pytest
import sys


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def test_pytest_none_approx():
    actual_result = {"a": 1.2}
    expected_result = {"a": None}
    try:
        approx_expected_result = pytest.approx(expected_result)
        assert approx_expected_result == actual_result
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Exiting with code 0 to indicate that the script behaved as expected (reproducing the issue)
        sys.exit(0)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Programmatically running pytest to execute the specific test function that demonstrates the issue
    errors = pytest.main(["-v", "-k test_pytest_none_approx", __file__])
    if errors:
        sys.exit(errors)
```

**Important Considerations:**

1. This script uses `pytest.main()` to run a test function defined within the script. It specifically targets the test demonstrating the issue by using `-k` to filter tests by name.

2. Error handling within the test captures the `TypeError` and uses the provided `print_stacktrace` function to display details of the error. This is intended to meet the requirement of showing the stack trace for the reported issue.

3. The script exits with code `0` if it successfully reproduces the issue (i.e., catching the `TypeError` as expected). Note that the `pytest.main()` call may introduce additional complexity in interpreting exit codes since it uses its system of exit codes to signal various outcomes of the test suite execution (not just test failures/successes).

This arrangement provides a way to encapsulate the pytest-dependent behavior within a standalone execution context while still adhering to the conditions of the reported issue.
