This script `reproducer.py` is designed to reproduce the issue shared. When run, it attempts to compare a dictionary containing a `float` with another dictionary containing `None` using `pytest.approx`. The expected behavior is to throw an `AssertionError` due to the differing items. However, due to the current bug, it triggers a `TypeError` instead because `pytest.approx` cannot handle operations between a `float` and `NoneType`. This script catches the `TypeError` and prints a stack trace to help diagnose the problem. It exits with code 0 if the issue is fixed (i.e., an `AssertionError` is raised instead of a `TypeError`) and exits with code 1 if the issue persists, signifying a failed test or the presence of the reported bug.
