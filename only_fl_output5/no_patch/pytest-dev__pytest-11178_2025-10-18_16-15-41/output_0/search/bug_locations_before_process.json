        "intended_behavior": "The `__eq__` method should be enhanced to explicitly check for `None` values in the dictionary being compared. When a `None` value is encountered, it should perform a strict equality comparison instead of proceeding with numeric approximation logic that leads to a `TypeError`. This adjustment ensures that `None` values within dictionaries are handled correctly, preserving the described functionality of the `approx` function for non-numeric types."
