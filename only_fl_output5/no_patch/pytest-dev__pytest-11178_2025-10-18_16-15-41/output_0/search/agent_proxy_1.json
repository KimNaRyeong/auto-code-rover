When a `None` value is encountered, it should perform a strict equality comparison instead of proceeding with numeric approximation logic that leads to a `TypeError`. This adjustment ensures that `None` values within dictionaries are handled correctly, preserving the described functionality of the `approx` function for non-numeric types.\n\nThis enhancement would involve modifying the `__eq__` method to iterate over the dictionary values and, if a `None` value is detected, switch to a strict equality comparison for that specific value, rather than the default approximate comparison that assumes numeric types. This change respects the existing `approx` functionality of supporting strict equality for non-numeric types and addresses the issue when `None` is part of a dictionary being compared."
