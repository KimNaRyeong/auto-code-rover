        "method": "Initialization of offset text color within the `_init` method.",
        "intended_behavior": "The `_init` method should assign the color of the offset text based on `xtick.labelcolor`, falling back to `xtick.color` if `xtick.labelcolor` is set to 'inherit' or is not set. This ensures that the offset text, which is part of the axis ticks' labeling, respects the users' customization preferences for label colors specifically rather than defaulting to the general tick color. This would involve modifying the line that sets the color attribute (`color=mpl.rcParams['xtick.color']`) to conditionally check for `xtick.labelcolor`'s value first."

        "method": "Initialization of offset text color within the `_init` method.",
        "intended_behavior": "Similar to the `XAxis`, for the `YAxis`, the initialization of the offset text color should correctly apply the `ytick.labelcolor` setting if available, defaulting to `ytick.color` only if `ytick.labelcolor` is 'inherit' or not set. This ensures consistency in coloring labels and related text across the library and adheres to user-set preferences in `rcParams`."
