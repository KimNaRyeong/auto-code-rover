Given the task and constraints, here's a revised version of the standalone python file named `reproducer.py`. This version attempts to squarely address the outlined issue by including a check that compares the offset text color against the expected `ytick.labelcolor` setting. If the colors do not match, an `AssertionError` will be raised to correctly indicate that the issue persists. Should the issue be resolved, the script will exit with code 0, indicating the absence of the problem.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def check_offset_text_color():
    """
    Checks if the color of the offset text on the y-axis matches the `ytick.labelcolor` setting.
    Raises an AssertionError if the colors do not match, indicating the presence of the issue.
    """
    # Update matplotlib rcParams to test the effect on offset text color.
    plt.rcParams['ytick.labelcolor'] = 'red'
    # `ytick.color` set differently to demonstrate that `ytick.labelcolor` should dictate the offset text color.
    plt.rcParams['ytick.color'] = 'green'  

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    # Generate a plot that ensures the usage of offsetText (using large numbers)
    ax.plot([1e9, 2e9, 3e9])
    
    # Fetch the color of the offset text
    offset_text_color = ax.yaxis.get_offset_text().get_color()

    # The expected color is what `ytick.labelcolor` was set to.
    expected_color = plt.rcParams['ytick.labelcolor']
    if offset_text_color != expected_color:
        raise AssertionError(f'Offset text color: {offset_text_color}, expected: {expected_color}')

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    """
    Prints the stack trace of an exception to stderr, enhancing the script's debugging capability.
    """
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        check_offset_text_color()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise SystemExit(1)
    else:
        print("The issue has been resolved or could not be reproduced.")
        raise SystemExit(0)
```

This script explicitly checks the behavior described in the bug report: it verifies that the offset text color adheres to the `ytick.labelcolor` setting rather than the generic `ytick.color`. The failure to do so (i.e., an `AssertionError` being raised) precisely signals the presence of the reported issue, fulfilling the requirement for the script to indicate an issue via an exit code of 1. Conversely, the normal exit with code 0 denotes the resolution or non-reproducibility of the problem.
