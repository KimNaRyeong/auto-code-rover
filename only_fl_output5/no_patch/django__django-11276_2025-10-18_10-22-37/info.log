This preserves the functionality of encoding special HTML characters but leverages the optimized and community-supported implementation found in the Python standard library. Additionally, the replacement should handle the minor difference in apostrophe encoding (`&#x27;` by `html.escape()` instead of `&#39;` as currently) without causing significant backward compatibility issues, acknowledging this change in the documentation or migration guides if necessary. This adjustment aims to improve performance, as reflected in the benchmark provided in the issue description, without altering the function's external behavior."
