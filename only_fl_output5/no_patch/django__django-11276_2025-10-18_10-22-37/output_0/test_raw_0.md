This Python script attempts to reproduce the issue mentioned by switching the use of `django.utils.html.escape()` to the Python standard library's `html.escape()`. It checks for two main aspects:

1. **Performance**: Using `timeit` to measure and compare the execution speed of escaping a string in both the Django custom `escape` function and the standard library's version. The assertion ensures that the standard library's version should be faster.

2. **Output Equivalence**: Since there's a noted concern about the slight difference in the output (`'` becomes `&#x27;` in `html.escape()` as opposed to `&#39;` in `django.utils.html.escape()`), the script also checks if the outputs are exactly the same. This is critical for applications depending on exact character sequences for functionality (though for HTML rendering, both entities are equivalent).

The script uses a custom `print_stacktrace` function that prints out a formatted stack trace when an `AssertionError` is raised, clearly indicating what went wrong and where. This is crucial for debugging and understanding the behavior in different environments or Django versions. It exits with code `1` to signal that the issue is present when the assertion fails and with code `0` when all assertions pass without issues, indicating the problem is fixed or not present.
