We can replace this duplication with wider community developed version.\nhtml.escape() has been available since Python 3.2:\n\u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#html.escape\nThis function is also faster than Django's. As Python bug \u200bhttps://bugs.python.org/issue18020 concludes, using .replace() can be faster than .translate(). This function gets called numerous times when rendering templates. After making the change locally, I saw the following improvement:\nmaster:\n$ python -m timeit -s 'from django.utils.html import escape' 'escape(copyright)'\n50000 loops, best of 5: 4.03 usec per loop\nbranch:\n$ python -m timeit -s 'from django.utils.html import escape' 'escape(copyright)'\n100000 loops, best of 5: 2.45 usec per loop\nOne small concern, html.escape() converts ' to &#x27 rather than &#39. These values are functionally equivalent HTML, but I'll mention it as a backwards incompatible change as the literal text has changed\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, let's address each point raised by the results:\n\n1. **Result from `search_method(\"escape\")` in `django/utils/html.py`:**\n\n   - **What does this part of the code do?**\n     The `escape` function in `django/utils/html.py` is responsible for encoding ampersands, quotes, and angle brackets for use in HTML, ensuring that any text passed to it is safe for inclusion in an HTML document. It uses the `translate` method with a predefined mapping (`_html_escapes`) to replace the characters.\n\n   - **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n     This function is the direct subject of the proposed optimization in the issue. The issue suggests replacing its custom implementation with Python's standard library function `html.escape()` to improve performance and potentially benefit from wider community support and optimization.\n\n   - **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n     The intended behavior, post-change, is to continue providing the same functionality\u2014sanitizing text for safe HTML use\u2014but doing so more efficiently through the standard library's implementation. The function should still encode specific characters but may use a different mechanism (`html.escape()` instead of `str.translate()`) to achieve this. Also, there is acknowledgment of a minor discrepancy in how apostrophes are encoded, which is considered acceptable and noted for its backwards incompatibility.\n\n2. **The absence of results from `search_code(\"django.utils.html.escape\")`:**\n\n   This outcome suggests that either the literal string `\"django.utils.html.escape\"` is not being directly referenced in a manner that the search API could detect, or it could imply tight encapsulation within the `django/utils/html.py` module itself. Given this, an alternative approach could involve searching for usages of the `escape` function without the module prefix or exploring how templates and views in Django leverage escaping, possibly via utilities or filters.\n\n3. **Results from `search_code_in_file(\"escape()\", \"django/utils/html.py\")`:**\n\n   These results point out several critical usages within the same file, such as `conditional_escape`, `format_html`, `format_html_join`, `linebreaks`, and `urlize`. Each of these methods relies on the `escape` function for safely encoding text for HTML. Such usages underscore the importance of the `escape` method in the broader context of HTML generation and sanitization in Django, indicating the widespread impact any modification will have.\n\n   - **For these methods:**\n     The intended behavior should remain unchanged in terms of the ultimate outcome (encoding for HTML safety), but there will be changes beneath the hood in terms of the implementation. Assessing each method\u2019s reliance on `escape` can inform the necessary tests and checks to ensure that substituting `escape` with `html.escape()` does not introduce regressions or alter expected outcomes, especially considering edge cases like the one mentioned for apostrophe encoding differences.\n\nGiven these analyses, the next steps involve planning modifications to the `escape` function to use `html.escape()` while ensuring compatibility with existing usages within `django/utils/html.py`. This includes verifying that the behavior aligns closely with the current expectations of all utility functions depending on `escape` and preparing for any implications of the minor backward incompatibility mentioned."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

To resolve the issue, the custom implementation currently in use should be replaced with Python's standard library function `html.escape()`. This preserves the functionality of encoding special HTML characters but leverages the optimized and community-supported implementation found in the Python standard library. Additionally, the replacement should handle the minor difference in apostrophe encoding (`&#x27;` by `html.escape()` instead of `&#39;` as currently) without causing significant backward compatibility issues, acknowledging this change in the documentation or migration guides if necessary. This adjustment aims to improve performance, as reflected in the benchmark provided in the issue description, without altering the function's external behavior."
