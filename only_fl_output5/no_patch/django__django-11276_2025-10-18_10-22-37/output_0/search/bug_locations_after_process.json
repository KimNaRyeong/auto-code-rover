        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior of the `escape` method is to safely encode text for HTML usage, converting characters such as ampersands, angle brackets, and quotes into their corresponding HTML entity forms. To resolve the issue, the custom implementation currently in use should be replaced with Python's standard library function `html.escape()`. This preserves the functionality of encoding special HTML characters but leverages the optimized and community-supported implementation found in the Python standard library. Additionally, the replacement should handle the minor difference in apostrophe encoding (`&#x27;` by `html.escape()` instead of `&#39;` as currently) without causing significant backward compatibility issues, acknowledging this change in the documentation or migration guides if necessary. This adjustment aims to improve performance, as reflected in the benchmark provided in the issue description, without altering the function's external behavior."
