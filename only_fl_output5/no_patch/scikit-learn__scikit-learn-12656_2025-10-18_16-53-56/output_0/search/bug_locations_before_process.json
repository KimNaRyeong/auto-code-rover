        "intended_behavior": "The `hamming_loss` method's intended behavior after resolving the issue will no longer include the `labels` parameter. Any reference to `labels` within the method, such as the calculation that uses `len(labels)`, will be replaced by a direct reference to `y_true.shape[1]` for determining the number of labels in multilabel classification scenarios. This change aligns with the described aim of simplifying the function usage in multilabel contexts by assuming labels are to be derived from `y_true` directly, thus removing redundancies and focusing on the function\u2019s primary use case."
