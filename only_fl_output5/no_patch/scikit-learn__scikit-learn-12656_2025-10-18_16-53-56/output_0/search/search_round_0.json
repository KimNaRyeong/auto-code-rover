Given the issue's description, I will perform the following API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"hamming_loss\")`: This will help to identify in which file or files the `hamming_loss` function is implemented.\n- `search_code(\"len(labels)\")`: Since the issue mentions the removal of `len(labels)` and replacing it with `y_true.shape[1]`, searching for instances of `len(labels)` will help us understand where the modification needs to be applied.\n- `search_code(\"labels parameter in hamming_loss\")`: This will help find the definition and usage of the `labels` parameter within the `hamming_loss` function to ensure it's correctly removed."
