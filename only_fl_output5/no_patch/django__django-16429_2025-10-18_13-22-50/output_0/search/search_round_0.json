Adding 0, d.tzinfo arguments to the datetime.datetime call seems to fix this.\nHappy to send a PR.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to `timesince()` raising a `TypeError` when `USE_TZ=True` and the interval is greater than 1 month, we need to look into a few specific aspects of the codebase based on the information provided in the issue. The following API calls will help us gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Checking the implementation of `timesince()` method to understand how it's handling datetime objects, especially in relation to timezone awareness. Since the issue describes a problem within the `timesince()` function, it's crucial to examine its current implementation.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"timesince\")\n```\n\n2. Inspecting the implementation of the `test_long_interval_with_tz` test case to see how it is set up and executes the scenario described in the issue. This test case directly relates to the bug and could provide insights into how the datetime objects are being compared in the presence of different timezone settings.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"test_long_interval_with_tz\")\n```\n\n3. Understanding how the datetime object's timezone information is currently being handled within the `timesince()` implementation based on the suggestion to add `0, d.tzinfo` arguments to a `datetime.datetime` call. This insight will be invaluable for proposing a patch, but without direct access to the line number or the snippet, we'll first focus on the method and surrounding context.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"datetime.datetime\")\n```\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a thorough understanding of the problem area within the Django codebase, focusing specifically on timezone handling in datetime comparisons and the `timesince()` function's behavior."
