        "intended_behavior": "The function `timesince` should correctly handle both offset-aware and offset-naive datetime objects without raising a `TypeError`. This involves explicitly considering an object's timezone information when performing operations that compare or subtract datetime objects, especially when Django's `USE_TZ=True` setting is in effect. \n\nTo resolve the issue, here's the specific intended adjustment within the method:\n- When constructing the `pivot` datetime object (lines 93-100), instead of simply using the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second from the `d` object, the function should also incorporate `d`'s timezone information (if any). This can be achieved by adding `tzinfo=d.tzinfo` to the `datetime.datetime()` call that creates the `pivot`.\n  \nThis adjustment ensures that when `timesince` performs subtraction operations (e.g., `now - pivot` or `now - d`), both operands are either offset-aware or offset-naive, thus avoiding a `TypeError` due to mixing different types of datetime objects.\n\n- The change preserves the existing functionality of the `timesince` method by maintaining its ability to return a human-readable string that represents the time between two datetime objects. Additionally, this change ensures that `timesince` becomes more robust and compatible with Django's timezone handling features, eliminating errors related to timezone awareness inconsistencies.\n\nThis adjustment directly addresses the described issue without altering the core functionality or output of the `timesince` method, ensuring it remains compatible with various use cases within Django applications that rely on accurate time differences."
