Given the information provided, the necessary steps to collect sufficient code context involve:\n\n1. Locating the `model_to_dict()` function definition to understand its parameter handling and the condition that needs to be updated.\n2. Inspecting the specific condition mentioned in the issue (`if fields and f.name not in fields:`) within the function to evaluate the proposed change's impact.\n\nFor the first step, we should look for the definition of the `model_to_dict()` function across the Django codebase. Then, it would be beneficial to inspect the current condition handling `fields` to track down the exact location for potential modification.\n\nHere are the specific API calls to execute these steps:\n\n- `search_method(\"model_to_dict\")`: This will help us find where the `model_to_dict()` function is defined within the Django project.\n- `search_code(\"if fields and f.name not in fields:\")`: This will help locate the exact line or block where the condition check occurs, which according to the issue, is the problematic point needing modification."
