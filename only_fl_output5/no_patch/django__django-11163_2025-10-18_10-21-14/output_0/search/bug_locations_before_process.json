        "intended_behavior": "model_to_dict should interpret an empty list provided to the `fields` parameter as a request to exclude all fields from the resulting dictionary. This means adjusting the conditional check to distinguish between `fields=None` (include all fields by default) and `fields=[]` (include no fields). The condition `if fields and f.name not in fields:` should be modified to `if fields is not None and f.name not in fields:`. This change ensures that when `fields` is explicitly set to an empty list, the function returns an empty dictionary as expected while preserving its existing functionality for all other cases."
