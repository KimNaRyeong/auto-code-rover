nicer printing of Permutation (and others)
Perhaps Partition's args print with FiniteSet because the args were made to be SymPy types. But the printing need not be so verbose. 

```python
>>> Partition([1,2])
Partition(FiniteSet(1, 2))
>>> Partition({1,2})
Partition(FiniteSet(1, 2))
```
Printing of its (and other combinatoric funcs as pertinent) args can be done with lists, tuples or sets as community preferences dictate, e.g. `Partition([1,2])` or `Partition({1,2})`, the latter more suggestive that the parts of the Partition are subsets of the set from which they were taken.
