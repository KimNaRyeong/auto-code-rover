This script checks if the issue with verbose printing of the `Partition` constructor arguments in SymPy is present. It raises an `AssertionError` if the current behavior matches the issue description (i.e., arguments are printed with `FiniteSet`), which is unwanted verbosity as per the issue.

The script also includes the mechanism to raise an `AssertionError` if the fix has not been applied, based on the assumption that a fix would involve making the printing of `Partition` instances less verbose and not include `FiniteSet` unless necessary.

Please note that the targeted behavior (how `Partition` should print its arguments post-fix) is assumed based on the issue description and might need to be adjusted based on the actual desired outcome from the SymPy community or development decisions.
