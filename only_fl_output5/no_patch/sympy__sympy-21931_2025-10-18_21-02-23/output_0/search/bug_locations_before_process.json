        "method": "__str__,__repr__",
        "intended_behavior": "The solution involves adding __str__ and possibly __repr__ methods to the Partition class. These methods should be designed to convert a Partition instance into a string format that reflects a more intuitive and less verbose representation of the partition. Specifically, when converting a Partition object to a string: The __str__ method should produce an output that is easily understandable and directly indicative of the partition's contents, favoring Pythonic notations such as lists, tuples, or sets. For instance, transforming Partition(FiniteSet(1, 2)) into Partition([1, 2]) or Partition({1, 2}), depending on whether order or uniqueness (or both) is significant in the context of partitions. This new method would not only address the issue raised but also ensure that the functionality of the Partition class remains unchanged while improving its interface for users. This convenience feature provides a better interaction experience with the SymPy library, making the mathematical concepts it handles more accessible and intuitive to work with."
