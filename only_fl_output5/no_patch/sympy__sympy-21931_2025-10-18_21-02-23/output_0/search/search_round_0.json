        "content": "To address the issue effectively and gather appropriate context, we can start by investigating where the `Partition` class is defined and how its instances are being printed. This will likely involve looking into both the class definition itself and potentially any `__str__` or `__repr__` methods that control its string representation. Since the issue also mentions the printing of `FiniteSet` as part of the problem, it might be worth looking into how `FiniteSet` is integrated into the `Partition` class printing mechanism.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls would be useful:\n\n1. Search for the class definition of `Partition` to understand its structure:\n   - `search_class(\"Partition\")`\n\n2. Search for the class definition of `FiniteSet` as it is closely related to the issue at hand. It might give insight into how `Partition` is utilizing it for its args:\n   - `search_class(\"FiniteSet\")`\n\n3. Once we have the file locations for these classes, we can look for any methods that might be responsible for printing or representing instances of these classes, typically `__str__` or `__repr__`:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__str__\", \"Partition\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__repr__\", \"Partition\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__str__\", \"FiniteSet\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__repr__\", \"FiniteSet\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a solid foundation to understand how `Partition` and `FiniteSet` classes are implemented and how they handle their string representation, which is central to resolving the issue mentioned."
