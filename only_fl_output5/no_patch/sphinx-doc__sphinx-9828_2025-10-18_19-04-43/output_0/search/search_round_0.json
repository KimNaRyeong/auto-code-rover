The original source language is used instead of the translated language. Fuzzy translations are translations that in general need to be reviewed by a translator. For example all machine translations could be marked as fuzzy. It would be desirable to let the user decide whether to include these fuzzy translations in the generated documentation.\nProposed solution\n------------------\nAdd a new configuration parameter \"use_fuzzy_translations\".\nChange in line 72 of the file sphinx/sphinx/util/i18n.py\nwrite_mo(file_mo, po)\nto\nwrite_mo(file_mo, po, use_fuzzy_translations)\nWriting mo files with fuzzy translations is supported by the babel package, as can be seen in the documentation:\nhttp://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/api/messages/mofile.html\n</issue>"

This will help us understand the surrounding logic and any potential impacts of the proposed change.\n\n3. `search_method_in_file(\"write_mo\", \"sphinx/sphinx/util/i18n.py\")` - This call is to find the definition or any mention of the `write_mo` method within the `i18n.py` file to see how it's currently implemented.\n\n4. `search_code(\"use_fuzzy_translations\")` - Since we need to add a new configuration parameter `use_fuzzy_translations`, this search will help us find if this parameter is already defined or used elsewhere in the codebase.\n\nThese calls are targeted to understand how `write_mo` function is used, the surrounding context in `i18n.py`, and to check the usage of the new configuration parameter across the project."
