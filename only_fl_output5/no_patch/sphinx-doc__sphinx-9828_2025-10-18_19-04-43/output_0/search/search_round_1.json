The original source language is used instead of the translated language. Fuzzy translations are translations that in general need to be reviewed by a translator. For example all machine translations could be marked as fuzzy. It would be desirable to let the user decide whether to include these fuzzy translations in the generated documentation.\nProposed solution\n------------------\nAdd a new configuration parameter \"use_fuzzy_translations\".\nChange in line 72 of the file sphinx/sphinx/util/i18n.py\nwrite_mo(file_mo, po)\nto\nwrite_mo(file_mo, po, use_fuzzy_translations)\nWriting mo files with fuzzy translations is supported by the babel package, as can be seen in the documentation:\nhttp://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/api/messages/mofile.html\n</issue>"

The correct file needs to be identified, likely involved in the internationalization (i18n) process of Sphinx documentation.\n\n**Class/Method:** The method of interest is `write_mo`, which is responsible for generating \"mo\" files from \"po\" files. The exact location (file, class) of this method is not identified due to the file not being found. The `write_mo` function's intended behavior should be modified to:\n\n- Accept an additional parameter `use_fuzzy_translations` (a boolean value).\n- Utilize this parameter to decide whether to include entries marked as \"fuzzy\" in the generated \"mo\" files or not. \n\nThis behavior alteration ensures that if `use_fuzzy_translations` is set to True, the \"fuzzy\" translations are still compiled into the \"mo\" files, allowing users or developers to decide whether to use these translations potentially needing review.\n\n**Configuration Parameter:** Additionally, a new configuration parameter `use_fuzzy_translations` should be introduced within the Sphinx configuration management system. This parameter allows users to opt in or out of using fuzzy translations in their documentation. This involves:\n\n- Modifying or extending the configuration loading mechanism to recognize and load the new `use_fuzzy_translations` parameter.\n- Ensuring that this parameter's value is appropriately passed down to wherever the `write_mo` function is invoked in regards to generating \"mo\" files from \"po\" files.\n\nWithout direct access to specific code snippets or file locations, these recommendations are based on the generic understanding of the issue's requirement and proposed solution. The first step towards a fix must involve locating the correct file and function (`write_mo`) within the Sphinx project's actual codebase."
