        "intended_behavior": "For both __getitem__ and __iter__, before delegating these operations to the wrapped object via new_method_proxy, the LazyObject should check if the wrapped object actually supports these methods. This could be achieved by implementing a more intelligent proxy or wrapper function that first checks for the existence of the method in the wrapped object and then decides to either call the method on the wrapped object or raise a more informative error. The behavior must ensure that: - If the wrapped object supports the operation, the operation is smoothly delegated without changing the existing flow. - If the wrapped object does not support the operation, a clear and informative error is raised, highlighting the absence of the method in the wrapped object. This avoids misleading TypeError exceptions that don't accurately describe the root cause of the error (i.e., missing method on the wrapped object, not on the LazyObject itself)."
