        "intended_behavior": "The `build_instance` method should ensure that during the deserialization process, when it tries to look up an instance by its natural key to fill in a missing primary key, it must correctly handle references in non-default databases. This involves two main adjustments: 1. Ensure that the database parameter (`db`) passed to `build_instance` is consistently used throughout the method, especially when fetching related objects by their natural keys. This means the `db_manager(db)` call should be correctly applied not just in singular instance lookups, but also needs to be verified if it correctly considers the database context when resolving foreign key dependencies using natural keys. 2. Include additional error handling or checking mechanisms to ensure that when related objects are not found in the specified database, the system provides a clearer error or handles the case more gracefully, possibly with detailed logging or suggestions for resolving the issue. The existing behavior should be preserved for the default database, while enhancing support for non-default databases."
