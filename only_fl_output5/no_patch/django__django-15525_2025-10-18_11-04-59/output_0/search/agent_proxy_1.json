This involves two main adjustments:\n   - Ensure that the database parameter (`db`) passed to `build_instance` is consistently used throughout the method, especially when fetching related objects by their natural keys. This means the `db_manager(db)` call should be correctly applied not just in singular instance lookups, but also needs to be verified if it correctly considers the database context when resolving foreign key dependencies using natural keys.\n   - Include additional error handling or checking mechanisms to ensure that when related objects are not found in the specified database, the system provides a clearer error or handles the case more gracefully, possibly with detailed logging or suggestions for resolving the issue. The existing behavior should be preserved for the default database, while enhancing support for non-default databases.\n\nThese adjustments aim to maintain the general functionality of `build_instance` while improving its compatibility with Django's multi-database support, particularly ensuring that natural keys and foreign key dependencies are handled correctly for model instances during load operations into non-default databases."
