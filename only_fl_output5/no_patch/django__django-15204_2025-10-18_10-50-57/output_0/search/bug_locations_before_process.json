It should gracefully handle malformed strings that do not match the expected duration format, preventing server errors and instead informing the caller of the specific formatting issue. This change will ensure that malformed inputs like 'P3(3D' are acknowledged as incorrect by the application logic, enabling it to respond appropriately (e.g., through form validation feedback to the user) rather than causing an internal error."

In particular, it should catch and convert raised ValidationErrors into the format expected by Django form validation mechanisms, ensuring that users receive helpful and actionable feedback on input errors. The method should maintain its existing functionality with an added layer of robustness against malformed input, seamlessly integrating with Django's form validation workflow."
