        "content": "To analyze the issue with `DurationField.clean` failing due to an inability to handle broken data, we need more context around the affected parts of the Django project based on the trace provided. Here's a structured approach to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. **Understanding `DurationField.clean` Method**: Since the traceback mentions `DurationField.clean`, we need to look into this method to understand how it processes input.\n\n2. **Inspect `to_python` Method in `DurationField`**: As the exception moves from `clean` to `to_python`, it's crucial to examine the `to_python` implementation to see how it handles the conversion that fails.\n\n3. **Dig into `parse_duration` Util Method**: The exception originates from `parse_duration`. This utility method seems to be critical in handling the conversion process, which eventually fails due to the provided input string 'P3(3D'.\n\n4. **Error Handling in `parse_duration`**: Given the nature of the exception (`ValueError: could not convert string to float: '3(3'`), understanding how `parse_duration` validates and processes the input will help in identifying whether additional error handling or input sanitization is needed.\n\nBased on these requirements, the following API calls will help gather the necessary context:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"clean\", \"django/forms/fields.py\")`: This will help understand how `clean` processes or forwards the input for `DurationField`.\n- `search_method_in_file(\"to_python\", \"django/forms/fields.py\")`: This will provide insights into how `to_python` is implemented for `DurationField` and potentially locate where the faulty conversion starts.\n- `search_method(\"parse_duration\")`: Since `parse_duration` might be used in other parts of Django beyond just `DurationField`, this will help understand its implementation and how it's intended to be used across the project.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive overview of where and how the issue occurs, setting the stage for devising a solution."
