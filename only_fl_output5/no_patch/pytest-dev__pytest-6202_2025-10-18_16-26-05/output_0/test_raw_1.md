The following standalone Python file, `reproducer.py`, is designed to reproduce the issue. This script operates on the assumption that it's run in an environment where the pytest framework is installed and this bug exists due to the way pytest formats test descriptions.

The file executes a minimal pytest test case that should trigger the described issue when run. If the issue exists (pytest's mishandling of test descriptions including "`.["` leading to incorrect representation as `"[")`, the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace of the error. Conversely, if the issue is fixed, it will exit cleanly with code 0.

```python
import pytest
import subprocess
import tempfile
import os


def check_issue():
    # Create a temporary directory to store a minimal pytest test file
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdirname:
        test_file_path = os.path.join(tmpdirname, "test_bug.py")
        # Define a minimal pytest case that should manifest the issue
        test_content = """
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("a", ["..["])
def test_boo(a):
    assert 0
"""

        # Write the test case to the file
        with open(test_file_path, "w") as f:
            f.write(test_content)

        # Execute pytest with the created test file
        result = subprocess.run(["pytest", test_file_path], capture_output=True, text=True)

        # Check if the result contains the modified test description
        if "test_boo[.[]" in result.stdout:
            raise AssertionError("The issue is present; '.[' is incorrectly replaced with '[' in the test description.")

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    check_issue()
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code if the issue is present
else:
    print("Issue fixed or not present.")
    sys.exit(0)
```

This script works by dynamically creating a Python file with a pytest test case designed to specifically exhibit the problematic behavior described, then running pytest against this file and searching the output for signs of the issue. If the issue is detected, it raises an `AssertionError` and utilizes the provided `print_stacktrace` function to deliver a clear, navigable report of the exception's origin, fulfilling the requirement to exit with code 0 if the issue is resolved and offering direct insight otherwise.
