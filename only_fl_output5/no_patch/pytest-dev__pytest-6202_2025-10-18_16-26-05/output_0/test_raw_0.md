To address your request, we'll create a Python script named `reproducer.py` that reproduces the described issue regarding pytest's handling of test names. This script will programmatically execute a pytest test function that is expected to produce the naming issue. Then, it will check the output for the malformation and raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, otherwise it will exit normally indicating the issue is fixed.

Here's an example of how this could be implemented. This script includes setting up a temporary pytest test file and capturing its output for analysis:

```python
import subprocess
import os
import tempfile


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def create_test_file(test_code: str, directory: str) -> str:
    test_file_path = os.path.join(directory, 'test_bug.py')
    with open(test_file_path, 'w') as test_file:
        test_file.write(test_code)
    return test_file_path


def check_issue_present(output: str) -> bool:
    # This checks if the output is as expected when the issue is present
    if '.[' in output:  # Change this condition based on what incorrect output indicates the issue
        return False
    return True


def main():
    test_code = """
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("a", ["..["])
def test_boo(a):
    assert 0
"""
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp_dir:
        test_file = create_test_file(test_code, tmp_dir)
        try:
            result = subprocess.run(['pytest', test_file, '-v'], text=True, capture_output=True)
            if check_issue_present(result.stdout):
                print("Test passed: Issue seems to be fixed")
            else:
                raise AssertionError("Issue reproduced: Test name malformation detected")
        except Exception as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Remember, for this script to work, you need to have pytest installed in your environment. You can install pytest using pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

This script:
- Dynamically creates a temporary pytest file with the problematic test case.
- Runs this test case using `subprocess.run` to capture the output.
- Analyzes the output to check if the issue (incorrect test name formatting) is present.
- Uses the `print_stacktrace` function to print a detailed traceback if an error (assertion related to the issue) occurs. 

If you need to adjust the condition in the `check_issue_present` function to more accurately detect the issue based on the output, make sure it matches the specific output signature that indicates the problem is present.
