        "intended_behavior": "The `select_related` method should ensure that any new `QuerySet` derived from an existing one, through chaining `select_related`, is fully independent of its predecessor. This involves ensuring that the copying mechanism (through `_clone` or `_chain`) duplicates the execution plan (`query` attribute) in such a way that modifications to the derived `QuerySet` do not impact the original. The intent is for `select_related` to always return a new `QuerySet` instance that is safe to modify without affecting the original instance from which it was cloned. An audit of how `_chain` is used within `select_related` may be necessary to guarantee this isolation."

        "intended_behavior": "The `_clone` method's objective is to create a functional duplicate of a `QuerySet` that is separate from the original, to the extent that changes in the duplicate's query composition do not affect the original `QuerySet`. This behavior is crucial to preserving the immutability principle of `QuerySet`s in Django ORM operations. Any fix should ensure that all components of the `QuerySet`, especially those tied to database query configurations like `select_related` directives, are cloned in a manner that enforces this separation. The method might require adjustments to ensure deep cloning of properties that directly affect query output, ensuring that derivatives are completely independent in terms of data fetching logic."
