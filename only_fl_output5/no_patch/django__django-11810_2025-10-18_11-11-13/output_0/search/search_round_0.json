The two queries are the same !!!\\n')\noutput\nQUERY 1: SELECT \"foobar_modelc\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\", \"foobar_modela\".\"id\" FROM \"foobar_modelc\" INNER JOIN \"foobar_modela\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\" = \"foobar_modela\".\"id\")\nQUERY 2: SELECT \"foobar_modelc\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\", \"foobar_modela\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelb\".\"id\" FROM \"foobar_modelc\" INNER JOIN \"foobar_modela\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\" = \"foobar_modela\".\"id\") INNER JOIN \"foobar_modelb\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\" = \"foobar_modelb\".\"id\")\nQUERY 1: SELECT \"foobar_modelc\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\", \"foobar_modela\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelb\".\"id\" FROM \"foobar_modelc\" INNER JOIN \"foobar_modela\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\" = \"foobar_modela\".\"id\") INNER JOIN \"foobar_modelb\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\" = \"foobar_modelb\".\"id\")\n!!! The two queries are the same !!!\nThe expectation is that the original QuerySet is not mutated, and the two queries are different. This behavior also happens with 'prefetch_related'.\nSince the QuerySet methods call 'self._clone()', and state that they return 'a new QuerySet instance', this behavior does not seem correct.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To accurately address the issue regarding the mutation of the original QuerySet when `select_related` or `prefetch_related` is used on a Django model, we need to gather more context about how these methods work internally in Django. Specifically, we need to analyze the implementation of `select_related` and `_clone` methods, as well as the overall behavior of QuerySets. Here are the API calls necessary to gather the needed context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"select_related\")`: This will help us understand how `select_related` is implemented across the Django codebase, which is crucial for understanding how the method should behave when chaining QuerySets.\n\n2. `search_method(\"_clone\")`: Since the issue mentions that the `select_related` method calls `self._clone()` and expects to return a new QuerySet instance, understanding the implementation of `_clone` will provide insights into how QuerySet cloning is meant to work and whether it should indeed result in a completely separate QuerySet that does not affect the original.\n\n3. `search_class(\"QuerySet\")`: By examining the `QuerySet` class, we can gain a better understanding of how QuerySets are designed to work in Django, including the internal mechanisms that could affect how methods like `select_related` and `_clone` interact with the QuerySet's state.\n\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"select_related\", \"QuerySet\")`: This call will give us specific information on how `select_related` is implemented within the `QuerySet` class, if available.\n\n5. `search_method_in_class(\"_clone\", \"QuerySet\")`: This will provide detailed insights into the `_clone` method inside the `QuerySet` class, which is directly mentioned in the issue as potentially not behaving as expected.\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms at play in the reported issue and help in determining why the original QuerySet is being mutated when `select_related` is chained, contrary to the expectation of immutable behavior."
