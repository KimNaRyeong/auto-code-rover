Seeing as the place where these files are stored is different on different machines I have the following:\nimport os\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nclass LocalFiles(models.Model):\n\tname = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n\tfile = models.FilePathField(path=os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir'))\nNow when running manage.py makemigrations it will resolve the path based on the machine it is being run on. Eg: /home/<username>/server_files/example_dir\nI had to manually change the migration to include the os.path.join() part to not break this when running the migration on production/other machine.\n"

This exactly mirrors the scenario described in the issue.\n\nDue to the scripting nature of the replicator and the temporary settings configuration, it bypasses typical Django project structure constraints. The script directly integrates with Django's command-line interface to attempt migrations (in dry run mode to prevent actual database changes), which is the phase where the issue initially appears.\n\nIf Django's handling of `FilePathField` with a callable for the `path` changes to accept such use, this script should exit with code 0, indicating the resolution of the issue. Conversely, if the issue persists, it should result in an error traceback representing the failure point, demonstrating that the problem still exists under the current conditions."
