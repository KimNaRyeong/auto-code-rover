To accurately reproduce the issue based on the description provided and ensure `AssertionError` is raised when the issue is present (i.e., `FilePathField` not being able to accept a callable as its `path` argument), we need a script that attempts to dynamically assign a path to `FilePathField` through a callable. This script will simulate the described scenario and assert against the expected functionality.

This script simulates creating a Django `FilePathField` and checks if a callable can be used to dynamically define its path. If the `FilePathField` (or `MockFilePathField` in our makeshift scenario) fails to properly evaluate or store the path returned by the callable, then it does not meet the requirement as described in the issue. 

This script is simplified and does not rely on a full Django environment setup since it focuses on the logic of accepting a callable for a field argument. It's tailored to showcase the problem at hand without the overhead of setting up a Django application or dealing with migrations, which are not directly executable or testable through simple scripts without invoking Django commands and a whole Django project setup.
