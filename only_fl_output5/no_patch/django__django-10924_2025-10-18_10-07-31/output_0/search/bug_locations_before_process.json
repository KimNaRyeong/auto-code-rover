This method needs to be updated to check if path is a callable and, if so, invoke it to get the actual path string when required, instead of during the initialization phase. This change must preserve the existing functionality for cases where a string is provided, ensuring backward compatibility."

This involves ensuring that the callable's reference is serialized in a way that it can be reconstructed accurately during migrations. The intended behavior should accurately handle both cases: when path is a simple string and when it's a callable, ensuring that migrations remain consistent and do not break due to the dynamic nature of the path."
