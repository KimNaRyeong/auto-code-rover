Seeing as the place where these files are stored is different on different machines I have the following:\nimport os\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nclass LocalFiles(models.Model):\nname = models.CharField(max_length=255)\nfile = models.FilePathField(path=os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir'))\nNow when running manage.py makemigrations it will resolve the path based on the machine it is being run on. Eg: /home/<username>/server_files/example_dir\nI had to manually change the migration to include the os.path.join() part to not break this when running the migration on production/other machine.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, understanding where `FilePathField` is defined and used within Django's codebase is key. Since the issue revolves around enhancing `FilePathField` to accept a callable for its `path` argument, it's necessary to examine the implementation details of `FilePathField` and potentially the migration system as it needs to handle the callable during migration generation. Here are the appropriate API calls to make:\n\n1. **Search for the `FilePathField` class to understand its current implementation.**\n   - `search_class(\"FilePathField\")`\n\n2. **Search for how migrations handle `FilePathField` instances, focusing on how the `path` attribute is processed.**\n   - This could involve finding the code that serializes model fields for migrations. Let's start by searching for a likely method name in the migration module.\n   - `search_method(\"deconstruct\")`\n   \n3. **Since `makemigrations` is mentioned, it's also relevant to understand how this command interacts with models and their fields.**\n   - Let's search for the implementation of `makemigrations` to see how it treats `FilePathField`.\n   - `search_method(\"makemigrations\")`\n\nExecuting these API calls should provide a solid foundation for examining the feasibility of the requested feature and pinpointing the necessary modifications in Django's codebase."
