Based on the feedback, it seems there was a confusion arising from the execution environment or an unrelated error message, rather than a direct response to the original task of reproducing a specific issue related to in-place addition of `xarray.DataArray` objects with different coordinate orders. Let's ensure the standalone Python script itself is correct and doesn't rely on specific environment setups which might differ. Please find an updated script tailored for the reproducibility of the initially described issue:

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    n = 5

    # Ensure reproducibility
    np.random.seed(0)

    d1 = np.arange(n)
    np.random.shuffle(d1)
    A = xr.DataArray(np.ones(n), coords=[('dim', d1)])

    d2 = np.arange(n)
    np.random.shuffle(d2)
    B = xr.DataArray(np.ones(n), coords=[('dim', d2)])

    try:
        print("Non-in-place addition result:", A + B)
        A += B  # This is where the issue arises
        print("In-place addition succeeded without errors.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("In-place addition failed due to a MergeError.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

This script will attempt to reproduce the issue concerning in-place addition of `xarray.DataArray` objects with mismatched coordinate orders, as described. If the issue occurs, it should raise an `AssertionError` and print the stack trace. If the issue is resolved (in a future version of xarray or if the conditions do not trigger the problem), it will terminate normally, confirming that the in-place addition succeeded.
