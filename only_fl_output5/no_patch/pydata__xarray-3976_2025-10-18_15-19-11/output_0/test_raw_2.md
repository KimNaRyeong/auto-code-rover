In this scenario, to ensure the correct execution flow and effective demonstration of the in-place addition issue with `xarray.DataArray` objects having the same coordinates in different order, we can refine the previous `reproducer.py` script. Notably, our updates must ensure any exceptions related to the issue are captured accurately, triggering an `AssertionError` with an appropriate message and providing a clear stack trace for diagnostic purposes.

Here's an updated version of the `reproducer.py` script to meet this specification:

```python
# reproduducer.py
import numpy as np
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    n = 5

    # Ensure consistent random shuffling
    np.random.seed(42)

    d1 = np.arange(n)
    np.random.shuffle(d1)
    A = xr.DataArray(np.ones(n), coords=[('dim', d1)])

    d2 = np.arange(n)
    np.random.shuffle(d2)
    B = xr.DataArray(np.ones(n), coords=[('dim', d2)])

    try:
        non_in_place_result = A + B
        print("Non-in-place addition result:", non_in_place_result)
        A += B # Expect an issue here for in-place addition
        print("In-place addition succeeded without errors.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit gracefully indicating no issue was encountered
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with an error code indicating the issue was reproduced

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Ensures an error code is returned if AssertionError is raised
```

With this setup, the script aims to directly replicate the specific issue involving coordinate orders during in-place addition of `xarray.DataArray` objects. It includes a systematic approach for error handling and tracing:

- **Error Handling**: It captures and handles exceptions that may occur during the operation, particularly focusing on the in-place addition where the issue is anticipated.
- **Stack Trace Printing**: Upon catching an exception, it utilizes your provided `print_stacktrace` function to output a detailed stack trace, facilitating easier diagnosis of the problem.
- **Exit Codes**: The script exits with code `0` if no issue is found (implying a successful in-place addition without errors), or exits with code `1` if the issue is reproduced, indicating the presence of the problem as initially described.

This script, therefore, acts as a standalone utility for replicating the described issue, adhering to your requirements and aiding in the investigation of the specific `xarray` behavior in question.
