The stack trace points to various methods and classes related to array operations and coordinates merging. Accordingly, I'll focus the search on related classes and methods:\n\n- The error originates from an in-place addition operation, which implies modifications within the `DataArray` class, so we should start by exploring this class.\n- The stack trace specifically mentions `merge_coordinates_without_align` and `merge_collected` functions as part of the error path, so we will also look into these to understand how coordinates are being merged and where the error might be coming from.\n- Since the issue involves coordinate merging failing due to different index orders, understanding the implementation of `_merge_inplace` within the `Coordinates` class is also crucial.\n\nBased on these points, here are the search API calls we should make:\n\n1. search_class(\"DataArray\")\n2. search_method(\"merge_coordinates_without_align\")\n3. search_method(\"merge_collected\")\n4. search_class(\"Coordinates\")\n5. search_method_in_class(\"_merge_inplace\", \"Coordinates\")"
