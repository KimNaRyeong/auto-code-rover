        "intended_behavior": "The method `_reverse_with_prefix` is responsible for assembling a candidate URL pattern by matching given view names or URL patterns with provided arguments. The intended behavior should include handling a situation where the `to_url` method of a custom converter raises a `ValueError` to indicate that the value provided does not match what the converter expects for URL generation. To resolve the issue, `_reverse_with_prefix` should be modified to catch `ValueError` exceptions thrown by `to_url`. Upon catching such an exception, the resolution mechanism should proceed to the next possible URL pattern instead of failing outright. This would allow multiple named routes to attempt to match provided arguments until one that successfully generates a URL is found or all possibilities are exhausted, at which point the existing error handling (e.g., raising a `NoReverseMatch`) would be appropriate. This modification would preserve the existing functionality of URL resolution within Django, while adding the desired flexibility for URL converters to decline matches based on the ability or inability of the `to_url` method to process a given value. This approach aligns with how the `to_python` method's `ValueError` is interpreted as a no-match during URL pattern matching, thereby providing a consistent behavior between these two conversion directions."
