        "content": "<issue>Feature/docs: how should url converters decline to match for a named route?\nDescription\nIt is sometimes convenient to have multiple instances of a named route, where the correct one is chosen based on whether the URL converters to_url call succeeds. For example, the attached file has routes like this:\npath('export/foo/<foo:obj>', index, name='export'),\npath('export/bar/<bar:obj>', index, name='export'),\nI then wanted to put {% url \"export\" some_foo_or_bar %} in a generic export template and have the correct URL inserted.\nMy first attempt to do this was to raise ValueError in to_url for non-matching values, hoping that it would work the same as to_python where the docs specify that \"A ValueError is interpreted as no match.\"\nThat didn't work -- nothing catches the ValueError in to_url -- so I found the workaround demonstrated in the attachment: if to_url returns an empty string (or some string that doesn't match the converter's regex), then the later regex check in _reverse_with_prefix will detect the non-match and everything seems to work out.\nSo this is either a feature request or a documentation check. I'm thinking either:\n_reverse_with_prefix could be updated so to_url works the same as to_python, and a ValueError indicates no match (which I think just means wrapping try: ... except ValueError: continue around the appropriate line), or\nthe docs could be updated to indicate that, in to_url, a converter should return a non-regex-matching string such as the empty string in order to decline a match.\n</issue>"

The issue discusses the behavior of URL converters in a Django project, particularly focusing on how to correctly decline to match a URL pattern for a named route using custom path converters.\n\n1. We should start by understanding how custom URL converters are defined and used within the Django project. The issue mentions custom converters `foo:obj` and `bar:obj`. Search for the definition and usage of these converters.\n   \n2. Next, it's important to look at the framework code handling URL resolution, specifically the behavior of `_reverse_with_prefix` which is mentioned as potentially needing updates. This might involve internal Django URL dispatcher logic.\n\nGiven these points, here are the API calls that will help gather the necessary context:\n\n- `search_code(\"class BaseConverter\")`: To find out how the base URL converter class is implemented, assuming custom converters extend from a base class.\n- `search_code(\"def to_url(self, value)\")`: This searches for the `to_url` method that the issue discusses, likely found in the URL converter class definitions.\n- `search_code(\"def to_python(self, value)\")`: To compare the implementation of `to_python` with `to_url`, as the issue suggests they behave differently.\n- `search_method(\"_reverse_with_prefix\")`: To find where this method is defined and understand its current logic related to URL resolution and how it handles exceptions or returns from `to_url`.\n\nThese calls should provide a broad overview of the involved components necessary to work towards a resolution."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the API calls regarding the Django URL converters issue provides us with some valuable insights into how URL resolution is handled and how converters are implemented and used within the Django framework. Let's address the questions based on the results:\n\n### Analysis of `BaseConverter` Class\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n- The `BaseConverter` class definition snippet does not show methods related to URL conversion (`to_python` or `to_url`), but it establishes that there is a base class for converters in Django, which likely defines a common interface for URL conversion.\n\n**Relationship to the bug**\n- While the exact relationship is not clear due to the absence of `to_url` in the provided snippet, knowing there's a base class suggests that custom converters (like `foo:obj` and `bar:obj` mentioned in the issue) would inherit from this base class and override methods like `to_url` and `to_python` to achieve desired conversion behavior.\n\n### Analysis of `to_url` Method Snippets\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n- The `to_url` method implementations in `django/urls/converters.py` show how different types of values (integers, strings, UUIDs) are converted to URL-friendly strings. These methods are straightforward, converting the input value to a string format that can be embedded in a URL.\n\n**Relationship to the bug**\n- Since the issue involves the `to_url` method not behaving as expected when a value does not match the expected format, these snippets illustrate where changes or enhancements might be needed to allow converters to indicate non-matches in a way that Django's URL resolver understands.\n\n### Analysis of `_reverse_with_prefix` Method\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n- This method is responsible for reversing URLs: it takes a view name or URL pattern and arguments and tries to find a matching URL pattern to construct a URL. Importantly, it iterates over possible matches, converts argument values to their URL representation using `converters[k].to_url(v)`, and assembles these into a candidate URL pattern.\n\n**Relationship to the bug**\n- The issue revolves around how Django's URL resolver should handle cases where the `to_url` method of a converter is unable to convert a given value to a URL component. The current implementation does not explicitly handle a scenario where `to_url` either fails or indicates a non-match situation. Since `_reverse_with_prefix` is where `to_url` is used to generate URLs, modifications here could potentially address the issue by introducing error handling or a mechanism to recognize and skip non-matching conversions.\n\n### Intended Behavior and Next Steps\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior would be for `_reverse_with_prefix` (or the system that invokes `to_url`) to gracefully handle cases where a converter determines that a provided value is not suitable for conversion into a URL component. Ideally, throwing a `ValueError` (or another mechanism) within `to_url` should signal that this particular converter cannot handle the value, allowing the URL resolver to continue trying other possibilities without causing an error.\n\nTo move closer to a resolution, it may be useful to:\n- Examine how exceptions are caught or managed within `_reverse_with_prefix` or the calling code, to see if there's a straightforward place to handle `ValueError` emanating from `to_url`.\n- Consider whether any documentation or Django enhancement proposals (DEPs) address similar issues or suggest changes in URL conversion error handling.\n- Look for instances in the Django project's issue tracker or mailing lists where similar behavior has been discussed to gather consensus on the desired handling of such cases.\n\nThis analysis points towards a solution involving modifications to `_reverse_with_prefix` for enhanced error handling and possibly augmenting the documentation to clarify how converters should signal non-matches in `to_url`."

The intended behavior should include handling a situation where the `to_url` method of a custom converter raises a `ValueError` to indicate that the value provided does not match what the converter expects for URL generation.\n- To resolve the issue, `_reverse_with_prefix` should be modified to catch `ValueError` exceptions thrown by `to_url`. Upon catching such an exception, the resolution mechanism should proceed to the next possible URL pattern instead of failing outright. This would allow multiple named routes to attempt to match provided arguments until one that successfully generates a URL is found or all possibilities are exhausted, at which point the existing error handling (e.g., raising a `NoReverseMatch`) would be appropriate.\n- This modification would preserve the existing functionality of URL resolution within Django, while adding the desired flexibility for URL converters to decline matches based on the ability or inability of the `to_url` method to process a given value. This approach aligns with how the `to_python` method's `ValueError` is interpreted as a no-match during URL pattern matching, thereby providing a consistent behavior between these two conversion directions."
