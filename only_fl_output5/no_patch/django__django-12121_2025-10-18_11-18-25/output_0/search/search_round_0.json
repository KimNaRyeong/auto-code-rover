        "content": "<issue>Feature/docs: how should url converters decline to match for a named route?\nDescription\nIt is sometimes convenient to have multiple instances of a named route, where the correct one is chosen based on whether the URL converters to_url call succeeds. For example, the attached file has routes like this:\npath('export/foo/<foo:obj>', index, name='export'),\npath('export/bar/<bar:obj>', index, name='export'),\nI then wanted to put {% url \"export\" some_foo_or_bar %} in a generic export template and have the correct URL inserted.\nMy first attempt to do this was to raise ValueError in to_url for non-matching values, hoping that it would work the same as to_python where the docs specify that \"A ValueError is interpreted as no match.\"\nThat didn't work -- nothing catches the ValueError in to_url -- so I found the workaround demonstrated in the attachment: if to_url returns an empty string (or some string that doesn't match the converter's regex), then the later regex check in _reverse_with_prefix will detect the non-match and everything seems to work out.\nSo this is either a feature request or a documentation check. I'm thinking either:\n_reverse_with_prefix could be updated so to_url works the same as to_python, and a ValueError indicates no match (which I think just means wrapping try: ... except ValueError: continue around the appropriate line), or\nthe docs could be updated to indicate that, in to_url, a converter should return a non-regex-matching string such as the empty string in order to decline a match.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To properly address the issue and gather sufficient context for resolving it, I'll need to make a series of targeted API calls. The issue discusses the behavior of URL converters in a Django project, particularly focusing on how to correctly decline to match a URL pattern for a named route using custom path converters.\n\n1. We should start by understanding how custom URL converters are defined and used within the Django project. The issue mentions custom converters `foo:obj` and `bar:obj`. Search for the definition and usage of these converters.\n   \n2. Next, it's important to look at the framework code handling URL resolution, specifically the behavior of `_reverse_with_prefix` which is mentioned as potentially needing updates. This might involve internal Django URL dispatcher logic.\n\nGiven these points, here are the API calls that will help gather the necessary context:\n\n- `search_code(\"class BaseConverter\")`: To find out how the base URL converter class is implemented, assuming custom converters extend from a base class.\n- `search_code(\"def to_url(self, value)\")`: This searches for the `to_url` method that the issue discusses, likely found in the URL converter class definitions.\n- `search_code(\"def to_python(self, value)\")`: To compare the implementation of `to_python` with `to_url`, as the issue suggests they behave differently.\n- `search_method(\"_reverse_with_prefix\")`: To find where this method is defined and understand its current logic related to URL resolution and how it handles exceptions or returns from `to_url`.\n\nThese calls should provide a broad overview of the involved components necessary to work towards a resolution."
