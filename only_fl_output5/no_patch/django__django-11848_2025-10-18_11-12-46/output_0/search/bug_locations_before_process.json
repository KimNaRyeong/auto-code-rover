        "intended_behavior": "This method should interpret two-digit years in a manner consistent with RFC 7231. Instead of using hardcoded year ranges (0-69 for 2000-2069, and 70-99 for 1970-1999), the method needs to dynamically adjust two-digit years based on the current year. If a two-digit year, when interpreted as being in the future, appears to be more than 50 years ahead, it should instead be adjusted to represent the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits."
