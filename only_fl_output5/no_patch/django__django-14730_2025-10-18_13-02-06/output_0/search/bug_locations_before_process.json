        "intended_behavior": "Inside the `check` method, add a new validation function to the series of checks (possibly named `_check_symmetrical_related_name`). This new check should validate that if the `symmetrical` attribute is `True`, then `related_name` must not be provided (or must be `None`). If `related_name` is provided under these conditions, the method should add a new error to the list of errors that `check` returns, indicating that specifying `related_name` for a symmetrical `ManyToManyField` is not allowed. This new validation step will ensure developers are immediately made aware of the misuse of `related_name` in symmetrical relationships, preventing confusion and maintaining the integrity of model relationships. This validation should preserve all existing functionality of the code while adding the new behavior to prevent the specified issue."
