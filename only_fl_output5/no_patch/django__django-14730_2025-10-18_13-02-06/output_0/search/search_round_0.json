However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship.

        "content": "To resolve the issue related to `ManyToManyField` and `symmetrical` argument along with `related_name`, we need to understand how `ManyToManyField` is defined and where the logic for processing the `symmetrical` and `related_name` arguments is implemented.\n\nLet's perform the following API calls for gathering the required information:\n\n1. Search for the `ManyToManyField` class to see its definition and any relevant methods that might handle the `symmetrical` and `related_name` arguments. This will provide an overview of how `ManyToManyField` is structured.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"ManyToManyField\")\n   ```\n\n2. Search for methods within the `ManyToManyField` class that are likely responsible for processing or validating the fields' arguments, like constructors or initialization methods where `related_name` and `symmetrical` checks could be implemented.\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"ManyToManyField\")\n   ```\n\n3. Since the issue mentions that an error should be raised when a developer passes in a `related_name` for a symmetrical `ManyToManyField`, we should also look for existing validation methods or any method that might be related to error handling or argument checking in the `ManyToManyField` class. This could help us identify where to integrate the new validation logic.\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"check\", \"ManyToManyField\")\n   ```\n\n4. Finally, to ensure we understand how the `ManyToManyField` class is used within the rest of the framework, especially regarding the handling of the `related_name` and `symmetrical` arguments, let's search for code snippets that instantiate `ManyToManyField` with these arguments.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"ManyToManyField(related_name=\")\n   search_code(\"ManyToManyField(symmetrical=\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls aim to gather comprehensive context around how `ManyToManyField` operates, specifically how it deals with its arguments, which will be critical in addressing the issue effectively."
