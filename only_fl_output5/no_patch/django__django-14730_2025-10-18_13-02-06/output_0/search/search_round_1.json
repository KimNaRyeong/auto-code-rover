        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n### `ManyToManyField` class definition\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThe `ManyToManyField` class is defined in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` and appears to be a fundamental part of Django's ORM for defining many-to-many relationships between models. The `__init__` method takes various parameters including `to`, `related_name`, `related_query_name`, `limit_choices_to`, `symmetrical`, `through`, and others, establishing the configuration for the many-to-many relationship. \n\nThe `check` method aggregates a list of checks by invoking several internal checking methods like `_check_unique`, `_check_relationship_model`, `_check_ignored_options`, and `_check_table_uniqueness`. These checks likely validate the field\u2019s configuration and relationships.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\nThe existence of parameters like `symmetrical` and `related_name` within the `__init__` method directly relates to our issue. The issue involves the inappropriate or misunderstood use of the `related_name` parameter when `symmetrical` is true, particularly in self-referential many-to-many relationships where `related_name` should not be specified since the relation is symmetrical.\n\nThe `check` method seems to be a suitable place to add our validation because it performs various validation checks on the `ManyToManyField` configuration, indicating it is involved in field validation processes.\n\n- **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\nGiven the issue, we'd expect that during the initialization or checking of a `ManyToManyField` instance, there should be a validation step that raises an error if `related_name` is provided while `symmetrical` is set to True, indicating a user misunderstanding about how symmetrical relationships are supposed to work.\n\n### Inability to find examples in the codebase\n\n- **What API calls can you make to get more context?**\n\nSince no direct usages of `ManyToManyField` with explicit `symmetrical` and `related_name` arguments were found, it might be helpful to expand the search to look for subclass definitions or more complex usages, considering that such configurations might be defined in a non-direct manner or within subclasses of `ManyToManyField`. However, given the explicit framework level nature of this issue, the absence of direct hits on the search for usage examples might not significantly impact our ability to propose a fix.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nBased on the information gathered:\n\n1. To address the issue, one could extend the `check` method in the `ManyToManyField` class to include a new check that ensures `related_name` is not provided if `symmetrical` is set to True, leveraging the pattern already used for other validations within this method.\n\n2. It may also be valuable to dig into how subclasses or instances of `ManyToManyField` are utilized and validated across the framework or by developers to better understand potential impacts or additional locations for implementing the validation. This could involve searching more about how Django's model validation process integrates with `ManyToManyField` instances during application startup or schema migrations."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

        "content": "1. \n\n2. **Bug Location 1**: \n   - **File**: `django/db/models/fields/related.py`\n   - **Class**: `ManyToManyField`\n   - **Method**: `check`\n   - **Intended behavior**: Inside the `check` method, add a new validation function to the series of checks (possibly named `_check_symmetrical_related_name`). This new check should validate that if the `symmetrical` attribute is `True`, then `related_name` must not be provided (or must be `None`). If `related_name` is provided under these conditions, the method should add a new error to the list of errors that `check` returns, indicating that specifying `related_name` for a symmetrical `ManyToManyField` is not allowed. This new validation step will ensure developers are immediately made aware of the misuse of `related_name` in symmetrical relationships, preventing confusion and maintaining the integrity of model relationships. This validation should preserve all existing functionality of the code while adding the new behavior to prevent the specified issue.\n   \n**Example Implementation**:\n\nGiven the structure of Django model field checks, the new validation method (`_check_symmetrical_related_name`) would likely resemble the following pseudocode, to be called inside the `check` method:\n\n```python\ndef _check_symmetrical_related_name(self, **kwargs):\n    errors = []\n    if self.symmetrical and self.related_name is not None:\n        errors.append(\n            checks.Error(\n                \"Defining 'related_name' is not allowed in symmetrical ManyToManyField.\",\n                hint=\"Remove 'related_name' argument or set symmetrical=False.\",\n                obj=self,\n                id='fields.E###',  # Placeholder for actual error code\n            )\n        )\n    return errors\n```\n\nAnd then in the `check` method:\n\n```python\ndef check(self, **kwargs):\n    return [\n        *super().check(**kwargs),\n        *self._check_unique(**kwargs),\n        *self._check_relationship_model(**kwargs),\n        *self._check_ignored_options(**kwargs),\n        *self._check_table_uniqueness(**kwargs),\n        *self._check_symmetrical_related_name(**kwargs),  # Added validation call\n    ]\n```\n\nThis approach aligns with Django's design philosophy of providing clear, actionable errors and guidance for model configurations, ensuring developers have all necessary information for correctly implementing model relationships."
