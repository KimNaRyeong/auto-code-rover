        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `When` method to automatically recognize and correctly handle `Exists` expressions as valid arguments without requiring them to be wrapped in a `Q` object. This could involve adjusting the method's argument parsing to treat `Exists` similarly to how `filter` expressions are treated, ensuring that `Exists` can be passed directly as a condition. This change must not disrupt the existing functionality, which allows `Q` objects, boolean expressions, and lookups as conditions."
