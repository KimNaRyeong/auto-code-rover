        "content": "<issue>Cannot mix Exists expression with keyword arguments to When\nDescription\n(last modified by Ryan Heard)\nI don't seem to be able to provide an Exists expression to When alongside keyword arguments like you can with filter. For instance, consider:\nclass State(models.Model):\npass\nclass County(models.Model):\nname = CharField(max_length=50)\nstate = ForeignKey(State, related_name='counties')\nI can execute the following query just fine:\nCounty.objects.filter(\nExists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")),\nname=\"Dallas\",\n)\nBut a similar query using When does not work:\n>>> County.objects.annotate(\nstatus=Case(\nWhen(Exists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")), name=\"Dallas\", then=Value(\"DALLAS COUNTY\")),\ndefault=Value(\"ELSEWHERE\"),\n))\nTypeError: When() supports a Q object, a boolean expression, or lookups as a condition.\nInstead the arguments must be wrapped in a Q object:\n>>> County.objects.annotate(\nstatus=Case(\nWhen(Q(Exists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")), name=\"Dallas\"), then=Value(\"DALLAS COUNTY\")),\ndefault=Value(\"ELSEWHERE\"),\n))\nThis is inconvenient and inconsistent with how filter works, as shown.\nWhen's init method can be modified to allow similar input as filter. \u200bCode is in a branch in my repo, but as this is my first time contributing to Django, I want to make sure I open a ticket and get feedback first.\nAlso I wasn't sure how to classify this. I wasn't sure if it was a bug, as I wasn't sure if it was designed this way.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue, we need to collect code context around the mentioned classes (`State`, `County`), methods (such as `filter`, `annotate`), and specific code statements or usage patterns mentioned in the issue description. Accordingly, the following API calls would be necessary:\n\n1. Search for the `State` class to understand its structure and potential relationships that could be relevant to the issue:\n   - `search_class(\"State\")`\n\n2. Search for the `County` class, as it's directly involved in the reported bug and its relationship with `State` is central to the issue:\n   - `search_class(\"County\")`\n\n3. Since the issue mentions a problem with using `Exists` within a `When` clause, it would be helpful to look at the implementation or usage of these methods to understand the expected and current behavior:\n   - `search_method(\"Exists\")`\n   - `search_method(\"When\")`\n\n4. The error message \"TypeError: When() supports a Q object, a boolean expression, or lookups as a condition.\" suggests that understanding how `When` is implemented, and how it processes conditions, might be key to resolving the issue. It might be helpful to look at the `When` method's implementation in more detail:\n   - `search_method(\"When\")` (again, because the first search is to find its usage or mentions, and this one focuses on digging deeper into its implementation.)\n\n5. Lastly, since the issue involves annotating `County` objects and the error relates to how arguments are passed to `When`, examining the code for `annotate` and how it interacts with `When` could provide insight:\n   - `search_method(\"annotate\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive context for understanding the problem and formulating a solution."
