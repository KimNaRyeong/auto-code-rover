Given the feedback and the requirements to effectively handle Django's environment within a standalone script, we must ensure Django's settings are configured before defining any models or attempting any database operations. Below is an updated approach that should properly configure Django settings and attempt to reproduce the described issue. This script is intended to be executed in a Django project environment where Django is already installed.

```python
# reproducer.py
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models, migrations
from django.db.models import Case, When, Value, Exists, OuterRef, Q

def setup_django():
    settings.configure(
        DEBUG=True,
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': ':memory:',
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=(
            '__main__',  # This assumes '__main__' as an app for simplicity
        ),
        USE_TZ=True,
    )
    django.setup()

    from django.core.management import call_command
    call_command('makemigrations', '__main__', name='initial', empty=True)
    call_command('migrate')

def define_models():
    class State(models.Model):
        class Meta:
            app_label = '__main__'

    class County(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        state = models.ForeignKey(State, related_name='counties', on_delete=models.CASCADE)

        class Meta:
            app_label = '__main__'
            
    return State, County

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue(State, County):
    # Attempt to use `When` with `Exists` and a keyword argument without using `Q`
    try:
        County.objects.annotate(
            status=Case(
                When(Q(Exists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name="Texas")), name="Dallas"), then=Value("DALLAS COUNTY")),
                default=Value("ELSEWHERE"),
            )
        ).first()
    except AssertionError as e:
        # Expected failure if issue is present
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except TypeError as e:
        # The specific error we want to catch and show
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    else:
        # Should reach this only when issue is not present (or not reproduceable)
        print("No error occurred, issue might be fixed.")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    setup_django()
    State, County = define_models()
    reproduce_issue(State, County)
```

This script sets up an in-memory SQLite database for Django, which is suitable for testing purposes. It dynamically defines two models (`State` and `County`) and attempts to annotate `County` objects with a `status` field based on conditions that would trigger the issue if present. Keep in mind that this script should be run in an environment where Django is installed. If you encounter `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured` errors, ensure Django is properly installed in your environment and that this script is executed within a virtual environment where Django is accessible.
