        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to the \"Could not parse arglist\" with operator `pow`, the following search API calls can be made:\n\n1. Search for instances where methods related to argument list parsing are mentioned since the issue involves parsing argument lists with the `pow` operator. Given the specificity of the error, it's likely to happen in a method that deals with parsing function or method signatures. Thus, looking for something like `parse_arglist` could be valuable.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"parse_arglist\")\n```\n\n2. The issue specifically mentions Sphinx, which suggests that the problem could be within Sphinx\u2019s code that handles Python domain objects or method directives. Searching for methods that deal with directive parsing in Sphinx could also provide useful insights. Methods like `handle_signature` or similarly named functions could be relevant here.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"handle_signature\")\n```\n\n3. Given that the issue mentions the error occurs with Python ReStructuredText (`rst`) and involves Sphinx documentation generation, looking into the classes that handle `.rst` files or Python-specific directives within Sphinx could be insightful. Classes like `PythonDomain` or any class related to Sphinx's domain handling could be useful.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"PythonDomain\")\n```\n\n4. Investigate the handling of default arguments in method or function signatures, since the issue is triggered by a default argument using a binary operation (`2**4`). There might be specific methods for parsing or evaluating default argument expressions.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"default argument parsing\")\n```\n\nThese calls should help in obtaining detailed code context around the issue of \"Could not parse arglist\" involving the `pow` operator in Sphinx, leading towards a clearer direction for patch development."
