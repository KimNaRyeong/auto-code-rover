Given the requirements and the initial scripting attempt, if the script did not reproduce the issue as planned, it could be due to an environment discrepancy, missed configuration details, or perhaps the issue is not reliably reproduced through the previously outlined approach. This time, let's directly invoke the Sphinx API, assuming the problem lies within its domain of parsing RST files for Python documentation.

This revised script will more directly try to simulate what Sphinx does internally when it tries to parse the given Python functions' argument lists in reStructuredText (rst) format. It includes creating a minimal Sphinx environment programmatically, attempting to parse a specific piece of rst content that we know should trigger the "could not parse arglist" warning if the issue is present.

**Important:**
- This approach assumes Sphinx and its dependencies are correctly installed in your Python environment.
- The script now tries to interact with Sphinx's internals to mimic the parsing process of the argument lists directly. This is closer to unit testing specific functionalities within Sphinx.

```python
import os
import sys
from io import StringIO

# Define a function to mimic the capturing of Sphinx's output.
def capture_sphinx_output():
    """Redirects stdout and stderr to StringIO objects, returning them."""
    new_stdout, new_stderr = StringIO(), StringIO()
    _stdout, _stderr = sys.stdout, sys.stderr
    sys.stdout, sys.stderr = new_stdout, new_stderr
    return new_stdout, new_stderr, _stdout, _stderr

# Restore original stdout and stderr
def restore_stdout_stderr(_stdout, _stderr):
    sys.stdout, sys.stderr = _stdout, _stderr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_sphinx_arglist_parsing():
    from sphinx.application import Sphinx

    # Create a minimal Sphinx environment
    os.mkdir('temp_test')
    os.mkdir('temp_test/source')
    os.mkdir('temp_test/build')

    with open('temp_test/source/conf.py', 'w') as f:
        f.write("")

    with open('temp_test/source/index.rst', 'w') as f:
        f.write(".. py:method:: f(*, a=2**4)\n.. py:method:: g(a=2**4)\n")

    captured_out, captured_err, original_stdout, original_stderr = capture_sphinx_output()

    try:
        app = Sphinx(
            srcdir='temp_test/source',
            confdir='temp_test/source',
            outdir='temp_test/build',
            doctreedir='temp_test/doctree',
            buildername='html'
        )
        app.build(force_all=True)
        output = captured_out.getvalue() + captured_err.getvalue()
        if "WARNING: could not parse arglist" in output:
            raise AssertionError("Sphinx failed to parse arglist")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    finally:
        restore_stdout_stderr(original_stdout, original_stderr)
        import shutil
        shutil.rmtree('temp_test', ignore_errors=True)

    print("Successfully parsed arglists, no issues detected.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_sphinx_arglist_parsing()
```

This script attempts to directly utilize the Sphinx API to programmatically create a basic Sphinx documentation project, incorporating the specific `.rst` content that is known to cause parsing issues. The script captures the output during the Sphinx build process to inspect for known warning messages indicating a failure in parsing the argument list as described. If the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError`, attempting to catch it and print a stack trace for debugging purposes. If the script exits with code 0, it indicates that the issue could not be replicated with the current environment and Sphinx version, suggesting that the problem might be resolved or requires a different approach to reproduce.
