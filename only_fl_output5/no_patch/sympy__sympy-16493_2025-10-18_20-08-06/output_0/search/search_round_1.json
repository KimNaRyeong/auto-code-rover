This method's primary function is to replace tensorial expressions with arrays according to a provided replacement dictionary and an order of indices.\n\nAnalyzing the collected context, here's a breakdown:\n\n### What does this part of the code do?\n\n1. **Replacement Process**: The method takes a `replacement_dict`, where tensor expressions are mapped to their array representations. It also requires `indices` that define the order in which the final array will be read and interpreted.\n   \n2. **Construction and Validation**: The method converts the tensors in `replacement_dict` into `Array` objects. It validates these arrays to ensure their dimensions match the expected shapes derived from the tensors and their index types.\n\n3. **Data Extraction and Matching**: Through `_extract_data` and `_match_indices_with_other_tensor`, it aligns the replacement arrays with the specified `indices`, arranging the arrays' elements in the desired order.\n\n4. **Return Value**: Ultimately, it returns the modified array, which is the tensorial expression replaced with numerical or symbolic arrays in the specified order.\n\n### Relationship to the Bug\n\nThe issue reports the necessity of making the `indices` parameter optional in the `.replace_with_arrays` method. Currently, the method signature demands `indices` as a mandatory argument (`def replace_with_arrays(self, replacement_dict, indices):`). This requirement restricts usage scenarios where the order of indices may not matter, or users may want the method to operate without explicitly specifying index order.\n\n### Intended Behavior\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior would be for the `replace_with_arrays` method to treat the `indices` parameter as optional. This change implies that if `indices` are not provided, the method should have a default behavior that does not depend on the ordering of indices, or it follows a standard ordering convention inferred from the tensor structure.\n\nTo make `indices` optional, the method signature needs to be adjusted to something like `def replace_with_arrays(self, replacement_dict, indices=None):`, and the method's logic should be adapted to handle cases where `indices` is `None`. This might involve defaulting to a natural ordering of the tensor's indices or leveraging the order present within the `replacement_dict` tensors.\n\nImplementing this change would improve the method's flexibility and usability, accommodating a wider range of tensor replacement scenarios without requiring the caller to always specify the indices order."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This can be achieved by modifying the method's signature to include a default value of `None` for `indices`. Furthermore, the method's logic must be adapted to handle cases when `indices` is not provided. This could involve:\n   \n   - Using a default ordering inferred from the tensor's structure or the keys of the `replacement_dict` when `indices` is `None`.\n   - Ensuring that the rest of the method's logic, which depends on `indices`, either uses this default ordering or executes alternative logic that does not require explicit indexing.\n   \n   This change allows callers of `replace_with_arrays` to optionally omit the `indices` parameter for scenarios where the ordering of elements is either determined by the context or not crucial, therefore, enhancing usability and flexibility of this method. Existing functionality must be preserved for callers that still specify the `indices` parameter explicitly."
