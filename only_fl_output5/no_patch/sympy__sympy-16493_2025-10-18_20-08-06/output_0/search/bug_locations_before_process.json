        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the replace_with_arrays method should be updated to make the indices parameter optional. This can be achieved by modifying the method's signature to include a default value of None for indices. Furthermore, the method's logic must be adapted to handle cases when indices is not provided. This could involve:\n\n- Using a default ordering inferred from the tensor's structure or the keys of the replacement_dict when indices is None.\n- Ensuring that the rest of the method's logic, which depends on indices, either uses this default ordering or executes alternative logic that does not require explicit indexing.\n\nThis change allows callers of replace_with_arrays to optionally omit the indices parameter for scenarios where the ordering of elements is either determined by the context or not crucial, therefore, enhancing usability and flexibility of this method. Existing functionality must be preserved for callers that still specify the indices parameter explicitly."
