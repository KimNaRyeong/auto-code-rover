Based on your requirement and the results from the test execution you've shared, I'll refine the `reproducer.py` script to properly handle and report on the encountered issue, specifically targeting the `NameError` that was raised instead of the initially expected `SympifyError`.

Let's update the script to assert the presence of a `NameError` for the specific scenario, which indicates the actual issue encountered during your test execution.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_sympify_greek_letter():
    from sympy import sympify
    try:
        result = sympify("α")
        # If the sympify operation does not raise an exception,
        # it means the issue is possibly fixed or different than expected.
        print("The issue might have been resolved or is different than expected. sympify(\"α\") did not raise NameError.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        if isinstance(e, NameError):
            # This confirms the specific issue encountered during execution
            print_stacktrace(e)
            assert "name 'α' is not defined" in str(e), "The error raised is not the one expected."
            print("Assertion failed: The specific NameError issue is present.")
            exit(1)
        else:
            # This condition captures any other exception that is not a NameError
            # and prints its stack trace for further investigation.
            print_stacktrace(e)
            print("Unexpected exception encountered.")
            exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_sympify_greek_letter()
```

This script specifically targets and checks for a `NameError`, which was observed in your test output rather than the initially anticipated `SympifyError`. It exits with code 0 if the error is resolved or different from what was expected, thereby providing a clearer outcome based on the actual issue encountered (`NameError` indicating the Greek letter `α` was not recognized as defined).
