        "method": "sympify",
        "intended_behavior": "The sympify method should include enhanced parsing logic for handling Greek letters as inputs. When encountering a string that consists of a single Greek character or possibly a known mathematical symbol (like '\u03b1'), it should be capable of converting this directly into the corresponding Symbol within SymPy (e.g., '\u03b1' to Symbol('alpha')). This enhancement would ensure that expressions and symbols commonly used in mathematical notation, especially those that are represented by Greek letters and are expected to be recognized as such by users familiar with SymPy's pretty printing capabilities, are parsed correctly and can be used directly in symbolic computations without raising a SympifyError. This approach preserves existing functionality by maintaining the method's ability to handle a wide range of input types, including numeric types, strings representing numbers or expressions, and collections thereof, while improving its robustness in handling symbolic representations more intuitively."
