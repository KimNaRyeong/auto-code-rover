        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue about `sympify(u\"\u03b1\")` not working, here are the API calls we need to make:\n\n1. Search for the `sympify` function in the codebase to understand its implementation and the possible place where the bug might occur. This will help us to see how `sympify` handles different types of input and might give us hints on why Greek characters are not being parsed correctly.\n2. Search for the `parse_expr` method within the `ast_parser.py` file, as the stack trace indicates a failure in parsing the expression. Understanding its implementation will be crucial to resolving the issue.\n3. We should also look into how Greek symbols are handled within SymPy, starting with how the `Symbol` class works, especially how it deals with Greek letters. This might not be directly related to the bug, but it gives us context on how SymPy represents symbols, which could be related to how they should be parsed.\n\nBased on these considerations, the specific API calls would be:\n\n- `search_method('sympify')`: To get more context on how sympify works overall.\n- `search_method_in_file('parse_expr', 'sympy/core/ast_parser.py')`: To understand how the parsing of expressions is managed and why it might fail for Greek letters.\n- `search_class('Symbol')`: To see how symbols, especially Greek letters, are represented in SymPy."
