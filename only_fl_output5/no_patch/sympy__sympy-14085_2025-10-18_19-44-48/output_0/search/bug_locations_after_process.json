This can be useful in cooperation\n83     with SAGE.\n84 \n85     It currently accepts as arguments:\n86        - any object defined in sympy\n87        - standard numeric python types: int, long, float, Decimal\n88        - strings (like \"0.09\" or \"2e-19\")\n89        - booleans, including ``None`` (will leave ``None`` unchanged)\n90        - lists, sets or tuples containing any of the above\n91 \n92     .. warning::\n93         Note that this function uses ``eval``, and thus shouldn't be used on\n94         unsanitized input.\n95 \n96     If the argument is already a type that SymPy understands, it will do\n97     nothing but return that value. This can be used at the beginning of a\n98     function to ensure you are working with the correct type.\n99 \n100     >>> from sympy import sympify\n101 \n102     >>> sympify(2).is_integer\n103     True\n104     >>> sympify(2).is_real\n105     True\n106 \n107     >>> sympify(2.0).is_real\n108     True\n109     >>> sympify(\"2.0\").is_real\n110     True\n111     >>> sympify(\"2e-45\").is_real\n112     True\n113 \n114     If the expression could not be converted, a SympifyError is raised.\n115 \n116     >>> sympify(\"x***2\")\n117     Traceback (most recent call last):\n118     ...\n119     SympifyError: SympifyError: \"could not parse u'x***2'\"\n120 \n121     Locals\n122     ------\n123 \n124     The sympification happens with access to everything that is loaded\n125     by ``from sympy import *``; anything used in a string that is not\n126     defined by that import will be converted to a symbol. In the following,\n127     the ``bitcount`` function is treated as a symbol and the ``O`` is\n128     interpreted as the Order object (used with series) and it raises\n129     an error when used improperly:\n130 \n131     >>> s = 'bitcount(42)'\n132     >>> sympify(s)\n133     bitcount(42)\n134     >>> sympify(\"O(x)\")\n135     O(x)\n136     >>> sympify(\"O + 1\")\n137     Traceback (most recent call last):\n138     ...\n139     TypeError: unbound method...\n140 \n141     In order to have ``bitcount`` be recognized it can be imported into a\n142     namespace dictionary and passed as locals:\n143 \n144     >>> from sympy.core.compatibility import exec_\n145     >>> ns = {}\n146     >>> exec_('from sympy.core.evalf import bitcount', ns)\n147     >>> sympify(s, locals=ns)\n148     6\n149 \n150     In order to have the ``O`` interpreted as a Symbol, identify it as such\n151     in the namespace dictionary. This can be done in a variety of ways; all\n152     three of the following are possibilities:\n153 \n154     >>> from sympy import Symbol\n155     >>> ns[\"O\"] = Symbol(\"O\")  # method 1\n156     >>> exec_('from sympy.abc import O', ns)  # method 2\n157     >>> ns.update(dict(O=Symbol(\"O\")))  # method 3\n158     >>> sympify(\"O + 1\", locals=ns)\n159     O + 1\n160 \n161     If you want *all* single-letter and Greek-letter variables to be symbols\n162     then you can use the clashing-symbols dictionaries that have been defined\n163     there as private variables: _clash1 (single-letter variables), _clash2\n164     (the multi-letter Greek names) or _clash (both single and multi-letter\n165     names that are defined in abc).\n166 \n167     >>> from sympy.abc import _clash1\n168     >>> _clash1\n169     {'C': C, 'E': E, 'I': I, 'N': N, 'O': O, 'Q': Q, 'S': S}\n170     >>> sympify('I & Q', _clash1)\n171     I & Q\n172 \n173     Strict\n174     ------\n175 \n176     If the option ``strict`` is set to ``True``, only the types for which an\n177     explicit conversion has been defined are converted. In the other\n178     cases, a SympifyError is raised.\n179 \n180     >>> print(sympify(None))\n181     None\n182     >>> sympify(None, strict=True)\n183     Traceback (most recent call last):\n184     ...\n185     SympifyError: SympifyError: None\n186 \n187     Evaluation\n188     ----------\n189 \n190     If the option ``evaluate`` is set to ``False``, then arithmetic and\n191     operators will be converted into their SymPy equivalents and the\n192     ``evaluate=False`` option will be added. Nested ``Add`` or ``Mul`` will\n193     be denested first. This is done via an AST transformation that replaces\n194     operators with their SymPy equivalents, so if an operand redefines any\n195     of those operations, the redefined operators will not be used.\n196 \n197     >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5')\n198     19/3\n199     >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5', evaluate=False)\n200     2**2/3 + 5\n201 \n202     Extending\n203     ---------\n204 \n205     To extend ``sympify`` to convert custom objects (not derived from ``Basic``),\n206     just define a ``_sympy_`` method to your class. You can do that even to\n207     classes that you do not own by subclassing or adding the method at runtime.\n208 \n209     >>> from sympy import Matrix\n210     >>> class MyList1(object):\n211     ...     def __iter__(self):\n212     ...         yield 1\n213     ...         yield 2\n214     ...         return\n215     ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n216     ...     def _sympy_(self): return Matrix(self)\n217     >>> sympify(MyList1())\n218     Matrix([\n219     [1],\n220     [2]])\n221 \n222     If you do not have control over the class definition you could also use the\n223     ``converter`` global dictionary. The key is the class and the value is a\n224     function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy\n225     object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.\n226 \n227     >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!\n228     ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!\n229     ...         yield 1\n230     ...         yield 2\n231     ...         return\n232     ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n233     >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter\n234     >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)\n235     >>> sympify(MyList2())\n236     Matrix([\n237     [1],\n238     [2]])\n239 \n240     Notes\n241     =====\n242 \n243     Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions\n244     that are very different in structure than what was entered. Until such\n245     autosimplification is no longer done, the ``kernS`` function might be of\n246     some use. In the example below you can see how an expression reduces to\n247     -1 by autosimplification, but does not do so when ``kernS`` is used.\n248 \n249     >>> from sympy.core.sympify import kernS\n250     >>> from sympy.abc import x\n251     >>> -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n252     -1\n253     >>> s = '-2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1'\n254     >>> sympify(s)\n255     -1\n256     >>> kernS(s)\n257     -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n258 \n259     \"\"\"\n260     if evaluate is None:\n261         if global_evaluate[0] is False:\n262             evaluate = global_evaluate[0]\n263         else:\n264             evaluate = True\n265     try:\n266         if a in sympy_classes:\n267             return a\n268     except TypeError: # Type of a is unhashable\n269         pass\n270     try:\n271         cls = a.__class__\n272     except AttributeError:  # a is probably an old-style class object\n273         cls = type(a)\n274     if cls in sympy_classes:\n275         return a\n276     if cls is type(None):\n277         if strict:\n278             raise SympifyError(a)\n279         else:\n280             return a\n281 \n282     # Support for basic numpy datatypes\n283     # Note that this check exists to avoid importing NumPy when not necessary\n284     if type(a).__module__ == 'numpy':\n285         import numpy as np\n286         if np.isscalar(a):\n287             return _convert_numpy_types(a)\n288 \n289     try:\n290         return converter[cls](a)\n291     except KeyError:\n292         for superclass in getmro(cls):\n293             try:\n294                 return converter[superclass](a)\n295             except KeyError:\n296                 continue\n297 \n298     if isinstance(a, CantSympify):\n299         raise SympifyError(a)\n300 \n301     try:\n302         return a._sympy_()\n303     except AttributeError:\n304         pass\n305 \n306     if not strict:\n307         # Put numpy array conversion _before_ float/int, see\n308         # <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/13924>.\n309         try:\n310             from ..tensor.array import Array\n311             return Array(a.flat, a.shape)  # works with e.g. NumPy arrays\n312         except AttributeError:\n313             pass\n314 \n315     if not isinstance(a, string_types):\n316         for coerce in (float, int):\n317             try:\n318                 return sympify(coerce(a))\n319             except (TypeError, ValueError, AttributeError, SympifyError):\n320                 continue\n321 \n322     if strict:\n323         raise SympifyError(a)\n324 \n325     if iterable(a):\n326         try:\n327             return type(a)([sympify(x, locals=locals, convert_xor=convert_xor,\n328                 rational=rational) for x in a])\n329         except TypeError:\n330             # Not all iterables are rebuildable with their type.\n331             pass\n332     if isinstance(a, dict):\n333         try:\n334             return type(a)([sympify(x, locals=locals, convert_xor=convert_xor,\n335                 rational=rational) for x in a.items()])\n336         except TypeError:\n337             # Not all iterables are rebuildable with their type.\n338             pass\n339 \n340     # At this point we were given an arbitrary expression\n341     # which does not inherit from Basic and doesn't implement\n342     # _sympy_ (which is a canonical and robust way to convert\n343     # anything to SymPy expression).\n344     #\n345     # As a last chance, we try to take \"a\"'s normal form via unicode()\n346     # and try to parse it.

        "intended_behavior": "The sympify method should include enhanced parsing logic for handling Greek letters as inputs. When encountering a string that consists of a single Greek character or possibly a known mathematical symbol (like '\u03b1'), it should be capable of converting this directly into the corresponding Symbol within SymPy (e.g., '\u03b1' to Symbol('alpha')). This enhancement would ensure that expressions and symbols commonly used in mathematical notation, especially those that are represented by Greek letters and are expected to be recognized as such by users familiar with SymPy's pretty printing capabilities, are parsed correctly and can be used directly in symbolic computations without raising a SympifyError. This approach preserves existing functionality by maintaining the method's ability to handle a wide range of input types, including numeric types, strings representing numbers or expressions, and collections thereof, while improving its robustness in handling symbolic representations more intuitively."
