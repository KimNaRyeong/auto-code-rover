This script aims to reproduce an issue where the `sympify` function is unable to parse the Greek letter "α" correctly, leading to a `SympifyError`. The `print_stacktrace` function ensures detailed error output, capturing the exact location and nature of the issue.

Please note, the behavior that leads to the `AssertionError` message `"AssertionError: The issue is present."` is technically the expected behavior as per the script when the issue being tested for exists; the terminology reflects that it is verifying the presence of the reported issue rather than indicating a failed assertion in the conventional sense. If this script does not produce an `AssertionError` and exits cleanly, it indicates that the bug has potentially been resolved.
