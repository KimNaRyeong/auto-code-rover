        "intended_behavior": "The `Chr` class should be capable of handling numeric inputs directly, converting them into their ASCII character equivalents without raising a `ValueError`. This implies that if a `Value` expression is passed into `Chr`, and the underlying literal value can be interpreted as a valid integer, `Chr` should process this input correctly, yielding the character representation. Additionally, setting `output_field = CharField()` by default for the `Chr` class can ensure that the output is always treated as a string/character data type, which aligns with the expected output of an ASCII conversion function. This modification would preserve the existing functionality while also preventing type-related errors when `Chr` is used in annotations or queries, aligning with Django's dynamic and flexible nature."
