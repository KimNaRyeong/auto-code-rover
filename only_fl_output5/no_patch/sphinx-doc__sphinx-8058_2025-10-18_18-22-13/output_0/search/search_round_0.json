        "content": "To address the issue reported regarding allowing more compaction in gettext builder, particularly for the use case of merging all generated message catalogs into a single file for upload, we need to gather more context about the gettext builder mechanism within the Sphinx project. Here are the API calls we should perform:\n\n1. Search for any references to a class or function directly responsible for gettext compaction within the Sphinx codebase. Since the issue does not specify a class or method name, we'll start with a broad search related to gettext functionality:\n   - `search_code(\"gettext_compact\")`\n\n2. Given the reference to the OKFN repository's Makefile for merging message catalogs, we need to understand how Sphinx's gettext builders handle compaction and if there's an existing feature or option related to `gettext_compact` that can be extended or modified:\n   - `search_code(\"message catalog\")`\n\n3. The issue implies modifications to the builder, so it's also valuable to identify any existing methods or features in the Sphinx builders that deal with the building or compaction of message files. This would provide a starting point for understanding the current capabilities and how they can be extended. Therefore, we should search for builder classes or relevant methods:\n   - `search_class(\"Builder\")`\n   - `search_method(\"gettext\")`\n\nThese searches aim to collect necessary information from the Sphinx project to understand how the gettext compaction is currently handled and how it might be extended or modified to support merging message catalogs into a single file as reported in the issue."
