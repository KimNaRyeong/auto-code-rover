However, migrations serializer doesn't have any special facilities for ensuring stable output for sets and this is what causes annoying diffs for us all the time.\nI suggest to add a trivial serializer specifically for unordered sequences which ensures stable output no matter the iteration order. Stability can be achieved by sorting elements in the set by their string representation. This only affects the writer output, and doesn't interfere with the rest of Django in any way, so this change only improves developer experience, but has no effect on the performance and/or reliability.\nI hope that even though it's apparently not a major problem for most users you would still accept the fix to ensure stable migration writer output for the rest of us.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary code context for resolving the issue, we should focus on identifying the locations within the Django framework that handle migration serialization, especially the parts that deal with unique_together or index_together constraints. The issue is likely located in the serializers or components that generate migration files. We'll need to find where the models' state is serialized, particularly for sets that represent constraints like unique_together. Therefore, the following API calls will be useful:\n\n1. **Search for the migration serializer class or method**: This might involve looking for a serializer class or method that deals specifically with serializing model states or constraints in migrations. \n   - `search_class(\"MigrationSerializer\")` or `search_method(\"serialize\")`.\n\n2. **Search for unique_together and index_together handling in migrations**: Since the issue description mentions these, it would be beneficial to identify how they are currently handled.\n   - `search_code(\"unique_together\")`\n   - `search_code(\"index_together\")`\n\n3. **Search for ModelState related serialization**: Since the issue description mentions normalization to sets occurs in the ModelState, it is necessary to understand how ModelState handles serialization.\n   - `search_class(\"ModelState\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"serialize\", \"ModelState\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point to understand how Django's migration system is currently handling the serialization of sets, and where the improvement for deterministic order can be implemented."
