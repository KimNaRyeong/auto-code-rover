This could be achieved by sorting the elements of the set by their string representation before serialization. This change should preserve the semantics of the constraints while eliminating nondeterministic order in the migration files."

Ensure that any manipulation or preparation of these constraints for serialization purposes respects a deterministic ordering, potentially by converting sets to sorted lists or similar structures where the order is preserved. Note that we are assuming there might be indirect influence; further inspection might be needed to validate this assumption and identify specific methods, if any, that require changes."
