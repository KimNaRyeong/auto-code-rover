This involves a correct and consistent output of all permutations of solutions for the given variables, regardless of their order in the `syms` parameter. To resolve the issue, the method should correctly manage the permutation logic in such a way that it accounts for the variable ordering specified by the user without omitting valid permutations. This may involve reviewing and potentially revising the logic around lines 181-185 where it deals with the `syms` parameter to reorder the solutions and ensuring that this reordering does not incorrectly filter out valid permutations of the solution. The solution set should be exhaustive and reflect all permutations, respecting the variable order as dictated by `syms`, when `permute` is True. This fix must preserve the existing functionality for cases where `permute` is False or when `syms` is not provided, ensuring that the method returns accurate solutions for Diophantine equations in a manner consistent with user expectations and mathematical correctness."
