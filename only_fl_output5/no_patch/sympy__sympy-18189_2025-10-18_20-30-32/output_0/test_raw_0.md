Explanation:
- This script attempts to reproduce a consistency issue with the `diophantine` function from the `sympy` library. The issue occurs when the order of symbols passed to the function affects the completeness of the result set despite the `permute=True` flag, which theoretically should explore all permutations of the results.
- The `reproduce_issue` function defines the problem, executes the `diophantine` function twice with swapped symbol orders, and asserts the results should be identical.
- If the assertion fails, indicating the issue is present, the script prints a detailed stack trace using the `print_stacktrace` function, which helps in diagnosing the issue by showing exactly where the failure occurred.
- The `SystemExit(1)` is raised to indicate an error condition when executed in an environment where the exit code might be relevant (e.g., Continuous Integration systems, automated testing setups).
- The script exits normally (`exit code 0`) and prints "No issue detected." when the assertion doesn't fail, suggesting that the issue has been resolved or is not present.
