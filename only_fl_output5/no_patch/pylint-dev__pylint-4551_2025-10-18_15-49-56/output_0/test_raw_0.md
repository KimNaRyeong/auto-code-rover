This script attempts to use `pyreverse` from within a Python script by emulating command-line execution to generate a UML diagram for its own codebase. It specifically looks for the inclusion of type hints in the UML output. The `CustomDiagramWriter` is a subclass of `DiagramWriter` from `pyreverse`, designed to intercept and check the output for the presence of type hints. If the expected type hint is not found in the UML representation, it asserts an error indicating the issue is present. The script is self-referential in that it's meant to generate a UML diagram of itself, expecting that the definition of class `C` (not included in this script directly but implied to exist for the reproduction of the described issue) and its constructor with a type-hinted argument `a: str = None` will be correctly reflected in the UML generation output.
