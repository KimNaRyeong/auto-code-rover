        "intended_behavior": "The `set_printer` method initializes the writer for a UML graph. To address the issue, this method (or related methods within the class responsible for organizing and formatting output) should be augmented to consider type hints when generating diagrams. This involves ensuring that when class attributes and methods are processed, their type annotations are retrieved and included in the output. Importantly, this integration should not alter the existing functionality for users not requiring type hints in their UML diagrams; it could perhaps be controlled via a configuration option."

        "method": "get_values",
        "intended_behavior": "The method `get_values` should be enhanced to include type hint information alongside attribute and method information within the UML diagram representation. This may involve extending the logic to calculate box widths to account for the possibly longer labels (due to the inclusion of type hints) and ensuring that the type information is formatted clearly and concisely. This enhancement should maintain the current diagram style and clarity, introducing type hints as an integrated part of the attributes and method signatures rather than as an afterthought."
