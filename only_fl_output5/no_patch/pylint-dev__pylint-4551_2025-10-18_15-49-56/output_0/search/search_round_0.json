        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue about adding Python type hints support in UML generation by pyreverse, we'll need to locate where pyreverse handles class parsing and where it generates the output for UML. Given the information from the issue, we'll target the following:\n\n1. Locate the implementation of `pyreverse` to understand how it currently parses classes.\n2. Identify how pyreverse generates its UML diagram output, particularly how it handles class attributes.\n3. Examine the `__init__` method handling to see how default values and type hints are processed.\n\nHere are the search API calls to execute based on the objectives:\n\n1. `search_code(\"class pyreverse\")` - To find if there's a specific class handling pyreverse logic where we could start our investigation.\n2. `search_method(\"parse_classes\")` - Assuming pyreverse parses classes somehow, this method name might give us insight into where and how it's done.\n3. `search_method(\"generate_output\")` - This would help us find where pyreverse generates UML output to investigate how attributes and their types are being processed.\n\nLet's proceed with executing these calls."
