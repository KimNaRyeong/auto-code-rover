        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue described, we'll need to investigate how the `QTable` class, along with the `group_by` method, handles quantities and grouping keys. The mentioned behavior suggests that there might be an issue in either the `group_by` implementation or the way quantities (and their units) are represented in table keys. Given the details, we could start by:\n\n1. Searching for the `QTable` class to understand its structure and any relevant methods that might affect grouping.\n2. Searching for the `group_by` method either within the `QTable` class or in its parent classes, if `QTable` inherits from a class where `group_by` is defined.\n3. Investigating how quantities and units are handled within grouped tables, which could involve looking at any utility functions or methods that convert quantities to keys.\n\nLet's start with the following API calls to get the necessary code context:\n\n- `search_class(\"QTable\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"group_by\", \"QTable\")`\n- `search_code(\"group_by\")`"
