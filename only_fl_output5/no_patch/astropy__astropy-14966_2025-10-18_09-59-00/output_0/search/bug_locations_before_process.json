This means adjusting the grouping logic to check if a column involved in grouping is a quantity and ensuring that the resulting key retains both the value and the unit. This process would involve modifying or extending existing grouping logic to treat quantities differently from plain numerical or other types of columns, ensuring that units are not stripped away during key generation."

        "intended_behavior": "Even though the direct issue may not lie within the `Table` class's `group_by` method itself, as `QTable` inherits from `Table`, ensuring that quantities are fully supported in grouping operations might require adjustments here or ensuring that `QTable` overrides this behavior correctly. The method should ideally check if `QTable` specifics are being honored, particularly regarding quantity handling. If `group_by` in `Table` directly impacts `QTable` behavior, ensuring compatibility with quantity columns may involve refining how `Table`'s `group_by` handles or delegates work for subclasses dealing with quantities, or providing clear extension points for `QTable` to customize this behavior."
