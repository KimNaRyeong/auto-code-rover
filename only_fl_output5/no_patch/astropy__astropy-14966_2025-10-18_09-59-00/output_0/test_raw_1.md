Based on your request and the provided details, it appears there was a misunderstanding in how the `reproducer.py` script is being used and interpreted. The issue described initially is not about the script's ability to run or import modules but about the behavior of the Astropy library when grouping `QTable` objects with quantity columns. 

Let's rewrite the `reproducer.py` with clear instructions, ensuring that it's suitable for detecting the reported issue related to group keys not retaining units in `QTable` objects. 

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from astropy.table import QTable
    import astropy.units as u

    # Create a table with units.
    tbl = QTable({"length": [1., 1., 2., 3., 1., 2.] * u.m})

    # Group the table by the 'length' column.
    gtbl = tbl.group_by('length')

    # Check each key in the grouped table for unit preservation.
    for cols in gtbl.groups.keys:
        length_with_unit = cols['length']
        # Verifying it's a quantity and has the correct unit
        if not hasattr(length_with_unit, 'unit') or length_with_unit.unit != u.m:
            raise AssertionError("Group keys lost the unit or have incorrect unit")

try:
    main()
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise SystemExit(1)
else:
    print("Issue is fixed, exiting with code 0.")
    raise SystemExit(0)
```

This script checks if the behavior of grouping a `QTable` with a quantity column retains the unit in the group keys. If the units are lost or incorrect, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace. If the issue is resolved, it will exit with code 0, indicating that the expected functionality is achieved.
