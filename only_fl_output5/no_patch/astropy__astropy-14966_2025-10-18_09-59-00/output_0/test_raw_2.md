To create a `reproducer.py` that correctly represents your request, we will adjust the implementation specifically to verify if the group keys in the `QTable` contain the unit alongside their values. In the event the unit is missing (thus reproducing the reported issue), the script will raise an `AssertionError`. Otherwise, if the keys properly include the unit, indicating that the issue has been resolved, the script will exit with code 0 without any exception.

Here is how the `reproducer.py` should look:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from astropy.table import QTable
    import astropy.units as u

    tbl = QTable({"length": [1., 1., 2., 3., 1., 2.] * u.m})
    gtbl = tbl.group_by('length')

    try:
        # Ensure all keys in the grouped table have their units preserved
        for cols in gtbl.groups.keys:
            # Extract the value and unit for comparison
            value, unit = cols.as_void()[0], cols.unit[0]

            if not hasattr(value, 'unit') or unit is None:
                raise AssertionError("Group keys lost the unit.")
            print(f"{value} {unit}")  # For visual verification; can be removed if not needed

    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        raise SystemExit(1)

try:
    main()
except Exception as general_exception:
    print_stacktrace(general_exception)
    raise SystemExit(1)
else:
    print("Issue is fixed, exiting with code 0.")
    SystemExit(0)

```

This script starts by importing necessary modules and defining two functions. The `print_stacktrace` function is for detailed error reporting, and the `main` function contains the logic to check for the reported issue. This script reproduces the scenario where grouping by a `QTable` column with quantities could result in group keys lacking units. If this situation is detected, it raises an `AssertionError`. Upon catching this, or any other `Exception`, the script will print a detailed stack trace designed to assist in debugging. If no exception arises, implying the units are preserved correctly within the group keys, the script concludes that the issue is resolved, indicating success with an exit code of 0.
