        "content": "To address the issue reported, we need to gather more context on how symbols are processed and indexed into different sections within the HTML output. The reported issue involves handling of special characters (_@_, _\u00a3_, _\u2190_) in index entries and the subsequent generation of duplicate \"Symbols\" sections with improper anchoring. This implies that specific segments of the codebase are responsible for indexing entries, generating HTML output, and perhaps categorizing symbols separately from alphanumeric characters.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, the following API calls could provide the necessary context for resolving the issue:\n\n1. **Search for classes or methods that handle index entries**: Since the issue involves handling special characters in index entries, it's likely there are dedicated mechanisms or classes for parsing and categorizing these entries. Therefore, calls to look for classes or methods with names suggesting manipulation or categorization of index entries would be beneficial.\n   \n2. **Search for code related to HTML output generation**: The issue also mentions the generation of HTML output and anchor links, suggesting that there is specific logic handling the output format and the creation of sections in the HTML document.\n   \nBased on this preliminary analysis, I recommend the following specific API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"handleIndexEntries\")`\n- `search_method(\"categorizeEntries\")`\n- `search_method(\"generateHtmlOutput\")`\n- `search_code(\"Symbols in index\")`\n- `search_code(\"_@_\")`\n- `search_code(\"_\u00a3_\")`\n- `search_code(\"_\u2190_\")`\n\nThese calls are structured to find methods that likely handle index entry processing, categorization of symbols versus alphanumeric characters, and the generation of HTML output. The search calls for specific symbols (_@_, _\u00a3_, _\u2190_) aim to locate how these characters are specifically handled or mishandled, leading to the bug."
