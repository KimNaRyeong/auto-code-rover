This will prevent the duplication of 'Symbols' sections in the HTML output. Specifically, any function within this file that handles the organization or categorization of symbols into sections should be updated to ensure all symbols are uniformly recognized and placed within the same category, regardless of their position in the Unicode table or their ASCII representation. This may involve enhancing the sorting logic to prioritize the grouping of all non-alphanumeric characters into a single index rather than segregating them based on their character value."

        "intended_behavior": "In a file or class responsible for translating index entries into HTML elements, ensure that the logic recognizing and creating sections for 'Symbols' is capable of identifying and consolidating all symbol entries into one section. This might involve adjusting how sections are defined and anchored in the HTML document to prevent duplication. For instance, a method responsible for generating section headers or anchors for the HTML output needs validation to ensure that symbols are not creating additional unintended sections. This validation might include a pre-check on index categories to ensure uniqueness and consolidation of symbol entries, or a post-processing step to merge sections that are erroneously divided."
