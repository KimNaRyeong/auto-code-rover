Similarly, this adjustment ensures username validation adheres strictly to the match from the start to the end of the string, excluding the possibility of trailing newlines. It continues to allow alphanumeric and specific special characters under Unicode processing, fully aligning with the intent but excluding usernames ending with newline characters."
