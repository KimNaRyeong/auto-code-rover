However, a little known quirk of Python regexes is that $ will also match a trailing newline. Therefore, the user name validators will accept usernames which end with a newline. You can avoid this behavior by instead using \\A and \\Z to terminate regexes. For example, the validator regex could be changed to\nr'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\nin order to reject usernames that end with a newline.\nI am not sure how to officially post a patch, but the required change is trivial - using the regex above in the two validators in contrib.auth.validators.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results for `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`, here is what we've found:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - Both validator classes, `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`, extend the `validators.RegexValidator` class in Django, using a regex pattern `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to validate usernames. `ASCIIUsernameValidator` uses the `re.ASCII` flag to match against ASCII characters only, while `UnicodeUsernameValidator` does not specify flags, allowing for Unicode character matching. This design aims to validate usernames by ensuring they contain only specific characters (alphanumeric characters, plus \".\", \"@\", \"+\", \"-\", and \"_\").\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The bug is directly related to these validators. Both use the `$` symbol in their regex patterns to denote the end of the string; however, this symbol also matches a position before the newline at the end of a string. This behavior permits usernames ending with a newline character to pass validation, which is not intended. The issue requests a change to use `\\A` and `\\Z` in the regex pattern to match only at the beginning and end of the string, respectively, without matching a position before the newline, thus addressing the quirk with `$`.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior of these validators is to strictly validate usernames without allowing trailing newlines. Modifying the regex to use `\\A` and `\\Z` would enforce this stricter validation, ensuring that usernames start (`\\A`) and end (`\\Z`) exactly with the characters detailed in the regex pattern, without mistakenly allowing a newline character at the end.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next step toward crafting a patch would involve updating the regex patterns in both validator classes to replace `'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` with `'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`. However, before proceeding with preparing the patch, it might be beneficial to check if there are any tests specifically targeting these validators, to understand their existing test coverage and assess whether additional tests reflecting the change in regex patterns are necessary. A potential API call to locate tests would be beneficial, but considering the instructions not to worry about test files or writing tests, we will focus solely on preparing the information for the patch."
