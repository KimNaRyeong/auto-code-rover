        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior is to mark the `is_ajax` method for deprecation in a manner that notifies developers of its upcoming removal and advises them on alternative approaches that align with current web development standards. While this method technically does not have a 'bug' in its traditional sense, the deprecation process involves:\n\n- Adding a deprecation warning that informs developers when the `is_ajax` method is used in their projects. This warning should indicate that the method will be removed in a future Django release and suggest that developers use alternative methods for detecting AJAX requests, such as inspecting the `Accept` header.\n\n- Updating the documentation to reflect the deprecation status of `is_ajax`, offering guidance on modern practices for request handling, and explicitly suggesting how to perform similar checks with the `Accept` header or other modern techniques that follow HTTP standards more closely.\n\nThe preservation of existing functionality is not the goal here, as the method will be phased out. Instead, the focus is on informing developers about the change and guiding them toward more sustainable and standard-compliant approaches."
