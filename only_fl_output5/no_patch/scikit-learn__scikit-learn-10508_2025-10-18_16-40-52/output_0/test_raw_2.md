Given the stated requirements and to specifically reproduce the issue outlined as per your instructions for a scenario where the `LabelEncoder`'s `transform()` method fails with empty lists under certain conditions, please find below a standalone python script named `reproducer.py`. This script is designed to encapsulate the scenario depicted, check for the success or failure of transforming empty lists, and correctly use the provided function to print a stack trace if an exception is caught.

```python
# reproducer.py
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
import numpy as np
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    le = LabelEncoder()
    # First case with integers
    try:
        le.fit([1, 2])
        result = le.transform([])
    except Exception as e1:
        print("Failed to transform an empty list after fitting with integer labels.")
        print_stacktrace(e1)
        raise AssertionError("Should have returned an empty array but raised an exception instead.")

    # Second case with strings
    try:
        le.fit(["a", "b"])
        result = le.transform([])
    except Exception as e2:
        print("Failed to transform an empty list after fitting with string labels.")
        print_stacktrace(e2)
        # Raising an AssertionError to indicate the presence of the issue.
        # If the execution flow gets here, it means the issue as described is reproduced.
        raise AssertionError("Should have returned an empty array but raised an exception instead.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
        # Exiting with code 0 to indicate the issue has been fixed if no AssertionError is raised.
        sys.exit(0)
    except AssertionError as main_error:
        # Exiting with code 1 to indicate the presence of the issue.
        sys.exit(1)
```

This script:
- Tries to fit and transform using `LabelEncoder` with both integers and strings.
- Expects no exception when transforming an empty list after fitting.
- Uses `print_stacktrace` to display the stack trace should an exception occur.
- Explicitly exits with a code of `0` when the test passes, indicating the specific issue has been resolved.
- Exits with a code of `1` if an `AssertionError` is raised, showing the issue persists.

Note: The described behavior is based on the issue's specifications, and the outcome is contingent upon the accurate reflection of the bug as described.
