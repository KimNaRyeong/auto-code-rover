Given the clarification and the previous misunderstanding, let's provide a corrected version of `reproducer.py`. This script should adequately reproduce the specific issue with transforming empty lists using `LabelEncoder` in scikit-learn, and demonstrate the expected behavior versus the problematic behavior. This new iteration of the script includes a proper setup to catch and assert the different outcomes depending on whether an empty array is properly returned following a transformation request with an empty list.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
import numpy as np
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    le = LabelEncoder()
    try:
        le.fit([1, 2])
        assert np.array_equal(le.transform([]), np.array([], dtype=int)), "Failure on integer labels"
        
        le.fit(["a", "b"])
        le.transform([])  # This line is expected to pass without errors
        print("Issue not found for string labels.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An issue is present with transforming empty lists.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError:
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 if the issue is detected to indicate failure
    else:
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 if no issues are detected
```

This script will attempt to transform an empty list after fitting `LabelEncoder` with both integer and string labels, respectively. The expected outcome is that an empty array is returned in both scenarios without raising an exception. However, if the issue described is encountered, it will raise an `AssertionError`, print a stack trace for debugging purposes, and exit with code 1. If the script runs successfully without encountering the issue, it means the problem has been resolved, and the script will exit with code 0.
