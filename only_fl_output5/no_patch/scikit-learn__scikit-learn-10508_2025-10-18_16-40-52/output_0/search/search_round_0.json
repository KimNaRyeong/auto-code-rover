It'd also be beneficial to check if there's specific handling or an explicit check for the datatype of the input that could cause the discrepancy in handling empty lists.\n\nLet's make the following API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"LabelEncoder\")`: This will give us an overview of where the `LabelEncoder` class is defined in the codebase.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"LabelEncoder\")`: This will help us understand how the `LabelEncoder` is fitted with different data types and if there's any datatype conversion that could lead to issues during transform.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"transform\", \"LabelEncoder\")`: This will provide details on how the transform method works and why it might fail for empty lists after fitting with a certain datatype.\n- `search_code(\"np.searchsorted(self.classes_, y)\")`: Since the error trace points to the use of `np.searchsorted` in the transform method, looking at its usage context will also be helpful."
