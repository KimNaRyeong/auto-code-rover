        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `transform` method should be updated to specifically handle empty input lists or arrays. Prior to executing logic that could lead to dtype incompatibility (specifically the `np.searchsorted` call), the method should check if `y` is empty. If so, it should return an empty array that has the same dtype as `self.classes_`. This change ensures that transforming an empty list after the encoder has been fitted with any type of labels (be it strings, integers, or any other type) will consistently result in an empty array of a compatible dtype, thus preserving the expected functionality while resolving the reported issue. This modification maintains the existing functionality for non-empty inputs, ensuring backward compatibility and adherence to the method's original contract."
