This Python script sets up a minimal Django environment to reproduce the issue described. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

- It first configures a minimal set of Django settings necessary to run, indicating that it should use an SQLite database for simplicity.
- It defines a single Django model, `OrderItem`, in the global namespace because the script isnâ€™t part of an actual Django project/app with a dedicated models module.
- The script contains a function to print an exception's stack trace for debugging purposes.
- The core of the script (`main` function) demonstrates the issue by attempting to aggregate over an empty and non-empty set of model instances using the `Coalesce` function to provide a default value when no rows are matched. It specifically looks for the behaviour difference when filtering with an empty list, which is expected to produce an aggregative zero result (`Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0))`) but instead results in `None` due to the `EmptyResultSet` issue.
- Assertions are used to enforce the expected behavior, and the script exits with a status code based on the outcome of these assertions.

To run this script, make sure Django is installed in your environment (`pip install django`), and then execute it with Python 3. If the issue is present, the script will exit with code 1 and will print the stack trace of the assertion error. Once the issue is fixed in Django, this script should exit with code 0, indicating everything is working as expected.
