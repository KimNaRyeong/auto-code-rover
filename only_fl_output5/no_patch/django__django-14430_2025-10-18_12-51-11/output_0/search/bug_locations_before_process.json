        "method": "get_aggregation",
        "intended_behavior": "The core of the fix involves modifying how `get_aggregation` handles cases where an `EmptyResultSet` would occur, particularly when dealing with `Coalesce` functions in an aggregation. When facing an empty queryset (e.g., `pk__in=[]` leading to no matching rows), rather than propagating `None` for aggregates, the method should respect the fallback/default value provided by `Coalesce`. This would ensure that instead of returning `{'test': None}` for an empty queryset, it would return `{'test': 0}` when specified `Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0))`. This change should specifically check for `Coalesce` instances in the annotations and ensure they produce the fallback value even in empty result set scenarios, while preserving all other existing functionality for different types of aggregate and annotation operations."
