See below:\n# Test with matched Queryset. Sum will return 50\nOrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[1]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))\n>>>{'test': 50}\n# Test with unmatched Queryset. Sum will return 0\nOrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[-1]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))\n>>> {'test':0}\n# Test with unmatched Queryset (using empty list). EmptyResultSet returned because of empty list. Sum will return NONE\nOrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))\n>>> {'test': None}\nSimon Charette on django-users suggested the following:\nFrom what I understand the ORM simply doesn't perform any query in this case\nas the pk__in lookup cannot match any OrderItem and result in an\nEmptyResultSet exception[1].\nThis exception is caught in the Query.get_aggregation() method where all\naggregates are converted to None[2].\nI suppose we should alter the except EmptyResultSet clause to account for\nouter_query.annotation_select items that are Coalesce() instances used with\nValue() but I'm unsure about how it should be done.\n[1] \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/2e0cd26ffb29189add1e0435913fd1490f52b20d/django/db/models/lookups.py#L221-L223\n[2] \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/2e0cd26ffb29189add1e0435913fd1490f52b20d/django/db/models/sql/query.py#L439-L445\nSee full discussion here:\n\u200bhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/django-users/HGD3Vv3IerA\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary code context for resolving the issue described, we will focus on understanding how the Django ORM handles `EmptyResultSet` in aggregation queries and specifically how it impacts the `Coalesce` function within an aggregation when the queryset is empty (`pk__in=[]`). The issue describes that for an empty queryset, instead of returning 0, a `None` value is returned when it should coalesce to 0. We'll start by examining the related code segments and classes mentioned in the issue description.\n\n1. We need to examine the `EmptyResultSet` exception handling within the lookup mechanism to understand how it's raised when `pk__in=[]` is used. This is highlighted in the `lookups.py` file.\n2. We also need to understand how aggregates are handled when an `EmptyResultSet` exception is caught, particularly focusing on the `Query.get_aggregation()` method in the `query.py` file, to see how aggregates are converted into `None`.\n\nGiven the paths provided in the issue description, let's make specific API calls to inspect these parts of the codebase:\n\n- **Lookup `EmptyResultSet` handling**: The file and line numbers for where `EmptyResultSet` exception is raised can be directly inspected since the mention gives us a precise location within `lookups.py`.\n    ```python\n    get_code_around_line('django/db/models/lookups.py', 222, 5)\n    ```\n\n- **Examine `Query.get_aggregation()` method**: Since the exact lines of this method in `query.py` are discussed in the context, we'll focus on understanding how this method processes aggregations, especially when encountering an `EmptyResultSet`.\n    ```python\n    search_method_in_file('get_aggregation', 'django/db/models/sql/query.py')\n    ```\n\nThese API calls should provide the required code context regarding how the Django ORM currently handles cases leading to the `EmptyResultSet` for an empty queryset during aggregation operations and will be key to devising a fix."
