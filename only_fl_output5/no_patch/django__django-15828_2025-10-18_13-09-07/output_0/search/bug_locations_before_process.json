        "intended_behavior": "An `__eq__` method should be added to the `BaseConstraint` class to enable equality comparison between two instances of the class. This new method should consider both the `name` and `violation_error_message` attributes in its equality check. The existence of this method is crucial to ensure that Django can accurately assess the equality of constraints, especially considering custom violation error messages which might differentiate otherwise identical constraints. This will prevent issues in migration and constraint checks where the lack of this distinction could lead to erroneous behavior."
