This ensures consistency regardless of the temporary storage mechanism used (`MemoryUploadedFile` or `TemporaryUploadedFile`). The existing functionality of `_save`, which includes handling file saving and integrity checks, should remain intact. After moving a file using `os.rename` or any similar method, an additional step should be added to enforce the permissions as specified."

        "intended_behavior": "Wherever `os.rename` is used for moving the uploaded file from temporary to permanent storage, the operation should be followed up by setting the file permissions explicitly to maintain the permissions consistency. If permissions are not actively managed post `os.rename`, there should be a mechanism or wrapper around `os.rename` to ensure file permissions are set according to the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting or default to `0o644` immediately following the move. This adjustment will prevent the permissions from being inadvertently restricted due to the defaults applied by `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` and maintained by `os.rename`."
