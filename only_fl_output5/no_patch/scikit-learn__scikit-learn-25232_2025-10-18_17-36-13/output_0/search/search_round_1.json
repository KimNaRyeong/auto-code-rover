From its [docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.IterativeImputer.html):\n> **initial_strategy {\u2018mean\u2019, \u2018median\u2019, \u2018most_frequent\u2019, \u2018constant\u2019}, default=\u2019mean\u2019**\n> Which strategy to use to initialize the missing values. Same as the strategy parameter in SimpleImputer.\nI have set the initial strategy to `\"constant\"`. However, I want to define this constant myself. So, as I look at the parameters for `SimpleImputer` I find `fill_value`:\n>When strategy == \u201cconstant\u201d, fill_value is used to replace all occurrences of missing_values. If left to the default, fill_value will be 0 when imputing numerical data and \u201cmissing_value\u201d for strings or object data types.\nBased on this information, one would assume that `IterativeImputer` also has the parameter `fill_value`, but it does not.\n### Describe your proposed solution\nThe parameter `fill_value` needs to be added to `IterativeImputer` for when `initial_strategy` is set to `\"constant\"`. If this parameter is added, please also allow `np.nan` as `fill_value`, for optimal compatibility with decision tree-based estimators.\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the provided code segments for both `IterativeImputer` and `SimpleImputer`, we can break down the context, parts of the code, and their relationship to the reported issue.\n\n### IterativeImputer\n- **Initialization Parameters**: The constructor (`__init__`) of `IterativeImputer` includes an `initial_strategy` parameter but lacks a `fill_value` parameter. The `initial_strategy` parameter can be set to \"mean\", \"median\", \"most_frequent\", or \"constant\", which decides how initial missing values are estimated before iterative imputation begins.\n- **Potential Modification Area for Issue Resolution**: Given the issue description, the addition of a `fill_value` parameter would be expected here to specify the constant value to use when `initial_strategy` is set to \"constant\". This change would make the interface and behavior more consistent with `SimpleImputer`, enhancing the flexibility of `IterativeImputer` in handling initial missing value estimations.\n\n### SimpleImputer\n- **Initialization Parameters**: The constructor of `SimpleImputer` already contains a `fill_value` parameter, which is used in conjunction with the `strategy=\"constant\"` to replace all occurrences of missing values.\n- **Existing Behavior and Model Reference**: Given that `SimpleImputer` serves as a model for handling the `fill_value` with a \"constant\" strategy, this demonstrates an already established pattern for managing imputation that `IterativeImputer` could benefit from adopting.\n\n### Relationship with the Bug/Feature Request\nThe feature request is to implement behavior in `IterativeImputer` that allows a user to define a custom constant value to initialize missing values, akin to the `fill_value` functionality in `SimpleImputer`. This behavior is currently not supported by `IterativeImputer` since it does not have a `fill_value` parameter. The intended behavior, therefore, would allow setting a custom value for initial imputation, enhancing the imputer's consistency and flexibility, especially in cases where the default strategies (\"mean\", \"median\", \"most_frequent\") do not provide suitable initial approximations.\n\n### Intended Behavior\n- When the `initial_strategy` is set to \"constant\", `IterativeImputer` should utilize the `fill_value` parameter (once implemented) to determine the value with which to initialize missing values. This behavior should also support `np.nan` as a value, ensuring compatibility with data types and other estimators, particularly decision tree-based models which can naturally handle `np.nan` values.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo fully prepare for implementing this feature, we need to further analyze how `IterativeImputer` currently handles its `initial_strategy` parameter specifically in the `_initial_imputation` method where the initial filling likely occurs. Given this context, the next steps would involve:\n\n1. Exploring how `initial_strategy=\"constant\"` is currently being processed within `IterativeImputer`, likely within the initialization or a method dedicated to handling initial imputation.\n2. Understanding how `SimpleImputer` utilizes `fill_value` internally, especially how it's used in conjunction to its strategy parameter during imputation, to replicate a similar mechanism gracefully within `IterativeImputer`.\n\nThis entails investigating certain methods within both classes to better understand their internals related to this feature request."

This parameter should support a wide range of types including `np.nan`, to ensure compatibility with various types of data, including numerical and categorical. The implementation should ensure that the existing functionality and default behaviors are preserved when the `fill_value` parameter is not explicitly set by the user, retaining backward compatibility.\n  \n- Location 2: File: sklearn/impute/_iterative.py, Class: IterativeImputer, Method: _initial_imputation\n\n  **Intended Behavior**: Modify the `_initial_imputation` method to utilize the `fill_value` parameter when the `initial_strategy` is set to \"constant\". This modification needs to ensure that if `initial_strategy=\"constant\"`, the specified `fill_value` is used as the initial value for missing data imputation. The implementation should gracefully degrade to the existing default behavior for other `initial_strategy` values and should ensure that the handling of `fill_value` is compatible with both numerical and categorical data, including the capability to handle `np.nan` effectively. The change must preserve the integrity and expected outcomes of the iterative imputation process, maintaining existing functionality for all other aspects of the `IterativeImputer` operation."
