The documentation should be updated accordingly to describe the new parameter, specifically mentioning its use when `initial_strategy=\"constant\"` for setting the initial fill value for missing values. This addition should not alter the existing default behavior when `fill_value` is not specified by users, ensuring the integrity of current implementations remains intact."

        "intended_behavior": "Adjust this method to pass the new `fill_value` parameter to the `SimpleImputer` instance created within it. This involves checking the `initial_strategy` parameter; if it's \"constant\", the method should ensure that `fill_value` is utilized accordingly for the initial imputation round. This modification must ensure that all existing functionality is preserved for settings of `initial_strategy` other than \"constant\". It is crucial that this implementation allows for the use of `np.nan` as a `fill_value`, especially considering the issue's emphasis on compatibility with decision tree-based estimators."
