Save this code snippet as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project. Running `python3 reproducer.py` should reproduce the noted issue if it exists, or print "No issue encountered!" followed by an exit with code 0 once fixed.

The script attempts to create a `QTable` from the given data and prints it. The first two entries in the dataset are "bad" events with zero-length array cells in attribute "C", which leads to the printing issue. This reproducer will display a stack trace of the IndexError when executed with an affected version of the software and raise an `AssertionError` if the problem persists.
