Given the context that the previous attempt to execute the script did not work due to the absence of the `numpy` package, it is clear that the `numpy` package is a dependency for the reproduction script to execute successfully. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that the environment where the script is being executed has `numpy` and `astropy` installed, as they are both utilized in the reproduction of the issue.

If those packages aren't installed in the environment, they can be installed using pip with the following commands before running the `reproducer.py` script:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install astropy
```

Please make sure these dependencies are correctly set up, then use the `reproducer.py` script provided previously. This script is designed to replicate the issue if it exists in the environment it is executed in, assuming all necessary dependencies are installed.

If the previous environment setup issue persists because of missing packages, make sure to install them prior to executing the script. The script itself remains a valid and effective way to reproduce the described issue with `astropy` tables, under the condition that the necessary packages (`numpy` and `astropy`) are available in your Python environment.
