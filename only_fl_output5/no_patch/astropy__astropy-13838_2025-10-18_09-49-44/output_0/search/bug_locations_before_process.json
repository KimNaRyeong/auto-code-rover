The method should check for the length of arrays and, if 0, provide a suitable placeholder representation (e.g., an empty string or a specific marker indicating no data). This change should preserve the method's existing functionality for non-0-length arrays while ensuring that 0-length arrays do not lead to IndexError."

        "intended_behavior": "While `_pformat_table` primarily orchestrates the table formatting process, scrutinizing its operation in relation to handling columns with 0-length arrays could identify if improvements are needed to support the handling outlined for `_pformat_col`. Specifically, ensuring that the overall table formatting process respects the handling of 0-length arrays by any column formatter involved. This might not require a direct change if `_pformat_col`\u2019s handling suffices, but should be considered to guarantee comprehensive support for 0-length array columns within tables."
