I understand you're asking for a modified version of the `reproducer.py` that could potentially highlight the error condition more accurately given the provided stack trace function. Given your requirements, here is a revised Python script to meet those needs:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn import datasets
    from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor

    try:
        # Load the dataset
        boston = datasets.load_boston()
        X, Y = boston.data, boston.target

        n_estimators = 720  # Setup number of estimators
        # Note: From problem description, the sum of importances begins to deviate at around this number of estimators

        params = {
            'n_estimators': n_estimators,
            'max_depth': 6,
            'learning_rate': 0.1
        }

        clf = GradientBoostingRegressor(**params)
        clf.fit(X, Y)

        feature_importance_sum = np.sum(clf.feature_importances_)

        # Ensure the sum of feature importances is approximately equal to 1
        assert np.isclose(feature_importance_sum, 1, atol=1e-4), \
            f"At n_estimators = {n_estimators}, feature importance sum = {feature_importance_sum}"

        # Check if the condition fails for individual trees
        for i, tree in enumerate(clf.estimators_):
            tree_feature_sum = np.sum(tree[0].feature_importances_)
            # Adjust tolerance with atol as needed based on observed behavior
            assert np.isclose(tree_feature_sum, 1, atol=1e-4), \
                f"At n_estimators = {i}, tree feature importance sum = {tree_feature_sum}"

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Ensure non-zero exit code to signal failure in reproducing the issue
    else:
        print("Issue not reproduced, feature importance sums are as expected.")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script attempts to address the issue related to feature importances not summing up to 1 in a Gradient Boosting model by evaluating both the overall feature importances after model fitting and the feature importances of each tree. 

- If the issue is reproduced (i.e., the assertion is triggered), it will print a stack trace detailing where the error occurred and exit with code 1.
- If the issue does not occur (i.e., the feature importances behave as expected), it will exit with code 0, indicating no error.

This script also incorporates an assertion with a tolerance level for floating-point arithmetic (`np.isclose` with `atol=1e-4`), considering numerical stability issues might cause minor deviations in sums especially when dealing with large numbers of calculations.
