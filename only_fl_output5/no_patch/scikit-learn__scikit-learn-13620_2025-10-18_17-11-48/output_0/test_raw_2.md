Given the request and the need to ensure the script raises an AssertionError when the issue is present and prints a clear stack trace of the issue, below is a revised standalone Python file named `reproducer.py`. This file is intended to be executed in an environment where the issue described (feature importances not summing up to 1 in certain conditions when using Gradient Boosting or similar tree ensemble methods from scikit-learn) could occur.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn import datasets
    from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor

    try:
        boston = datasets.load_boston()
        X, Y = boston.data, boston.target

        n_estimators = 720
        params = {'n_estimators': n_estimators, 'max_depth': 6, 'learning_rate': 0.1}
        clf = GradientBoostingRegressor(**params)
        clf.fit(X, Y)

        feature_importance_sum = np.sum(clf.feature_importances_)
        if not np.isclose(feature_importance_sum, 1.0, atol=1e-4):
            raise AssertionError(f"Feature importances sum {feature_importance_sum} != 1 at n_estimators = {n_estimators}")

        for i, tree in enumerate(clf.estimators_):
            tree_feature_importance_sum = np.sum(tree[0].feature_importances_)
            if not np.isclose(tree_feature_importance_sum, 1.0, atol=1e-4):
                raise AssertionError(f"At n_estimators = {i}, tree feature importance sum {tree_feature_importance_sum} != 1")
        
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exits with code 1 if the assertion fails, indicating issue presence.
    else:
        print("No issue detected, feature importance sums are as expected.")
        exit(0)  # Exits with code 0 if no issue is detected, indicating issue resolution.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script checks the sum of feature importances both for the overall model and for individual estimators within the Gradient Boosting model. A predefined function `print_stacktrace` is used to handle exceptions and print detailed stack traces when an AssertionError is raised, thus clearly indicating an inconsistency in feature importance sums compared to the expected behavior.
