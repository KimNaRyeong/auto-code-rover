        "content": "<issue>Bug in Gradient Boosting: Feature Importances do not sum to 1\n#### Description\nI found conditions when Feature Importance values do not add up to 1 in ensemble tree methods, like Gradient Boosting Trees or AdaBoost Trees.\nThis error occurs once the ensemble reaches a large number of estimators.  The exact conditions depend variously.  For example, the error shows up sooner with a smaller amount of training samples.  Or, if the depth of the tree is large.\nWhen this error appears, the predicted value seems to have converged.  But it\u2019s unclear if the error is causing the predicted value not to change with more estimators.  In fact, the feature importance sum goes lower and lower with more estimators thereafter.\nConsequently, it's questionable if the tree ensemble code is functioning as expected.\nHere's sample code to reproduce this:\n``` python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import datasets\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor\nboston = datasets.load_boston()\nX, Y = (boston.data, boston.target)\nn_estimators = 720\n# Note: From 712 onwards, the feature importance sum is less than 1\nparams = {'n_estimators': n_estimators, 'max_depth': 6, 'learning_rate': 0.1}\nclf = GradientBoostingRegressor(**params)\nclf.fit(X, Y)\nfeature_importance_sum = np.sum(clf.feature_importances_)\nprint(\"At n_estimators = %i, feature importance sum = %f\" % (n_estimators , feature_importance_sum))\n```\n_Output:_\n```\nAt n_estimators = 720, feature importance sum = 0.987500\n```\nIn fact, if we examine the tree at each staged prediction, we'll see that the feature importance goes to 0 after we hit a certain number of estimators.  (For the code above, it's 712.)\nHere's code to describe what I mean:\n``` python\nfor i, tree in enumerate(clf.estimators_):\nfeature_importance_sum = np.sum(tree[0].feature_importances_)\nprint(\"At n_estimators = %i, feature importance sum = %f\" % (i , feature_importance_sum))\n```\n_Output:_\n```\n...\nAt n_estimators = 707, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 708, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 709, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 710, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 711, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 712, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 713, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 714, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 715, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 716, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 717, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 718, feature importance sum = 0.000000\n...\n```\nI wonder if we\u2019re hitting some floating point calculation error.\nBTW, I've posted this issue on the mailing list [Link](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/scikit-learn/2016-September/000508.html).  There aren't a lot of discussion, but others seem to think there's a bug here too.\nHope we can get this fixed or clarified.\nThank you!\n-Doug\n#### Versions\nWindows-7;'Python', '2.7.9 ;'NumPy', '1.9.2';'SciPy', '0.15.1';'Scikit-Learn', '0.16.1'\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the described issue effectively, we need to gather context from several areas of the project related to Gradient Boosting Trees (or similar ensemble tree methods) and specific mechanisms like calculating feature importances. Based on the details provided in the issue, let's outline our API calls as follows:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the implementation of the `GradientBoostingRegressor` class, as this is where the problem is observed.\n2. Investigate how feature importances are calculated in ensemble tree methods. This might involve looking at methods within the `GradientBoostingRegressor` class or potentially in a superclass if the functionality is inherited.\n3. Given the additional information about sum being correct until a specific number of estimators, inspecting the method that adds estimators to the model could be useful. This could involve finding how trees are added during the fitting process.\n4. The issue mentions a sudden drop to 0 in feature importance sums after a certain number of estimators. It would be beneficial to examine any related calculation or method that aggregates or computes feature importances per tree within the ensemble.\n\nGiven these points, the necessary API calls are:\n\n1. ```python\nsearch_class(\"GradientBoostingRegressor\")\n```\n2. We should explore how feature importances are calculated. Since the specific method name for calculating feature importances is not provided directly, we can infer it might be named something relevant to \"feature_importances_\" or a method that calculates them.\n    ```python\n    search_method_in_class(\"feature_importances_\", \"GradientBoostingRegressor\")\n    ```\n3. Because the issue mentioned the problem occurs with increasing number of estimators, it's relevant to look at how these estimators are added or managed during the boosting process. This might be tied to the fitting process or a method that manages estimator addition.\n    ```python\n    search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"GradientBoostingRegressor\")\n    search_method_in_class(\"add_estimator\", \"GradientBoostingRegressor\")\n    ```\n    Since \"add_estimator\" is a guess about what the method could be named (as it might not actually exist with that exact name), the search might need to be adjusted based on the actual method names related to estimator management.\n\n4. Lastly, checking the calculation that leads to the summed feature importances going to 0 could involve inspecting operations within either the loop over `clf.estimators_` in the example code or directly in how each tree's feature importances are aggregated.\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"np.sum(tree[0].feature_importances_)\")\n    ```\n\nThese API calls should provide us with a good starting point for understanding the nature of the bug and where in the codebase the issue might be addressed."
