        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior should ensure that the feature importances, when calculated, should always sum up to 1 across all features. This might involve reviewing and potentially revising the logic within the method that aggregates feature importance scores from each estimator in the ensemble. The fix should ensure that no floating-point arithmetic issue or logic flaw causes the importance sum to drift from 1, especially as the number of estimators increases. An audit of the calculation process is necessary, ensuring that normalization occurs correctly and consistently, considering large numbers of estimators and edge cases possible with varying tree depths and dataset sizes."
