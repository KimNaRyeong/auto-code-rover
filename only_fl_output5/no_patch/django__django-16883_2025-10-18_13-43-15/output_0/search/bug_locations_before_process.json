This change should ensure the original simplicity and effectiveness of the table2model method is preserved for users not needing custom behavior. A possible approach could be to extract the conversion logic into a separate, overridable method that can be customized in subclasses of the Command class. This method should maintain compatibility with existing database schemas and naming conventions, ensuring a seamless transition for users relying on the current behavior while providing flexibility for those requiring custom conversion logic."
