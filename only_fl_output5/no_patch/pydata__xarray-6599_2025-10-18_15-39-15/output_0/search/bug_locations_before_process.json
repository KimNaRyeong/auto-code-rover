        "intended_behavior": "The `polyval` method should handle `timedelta64` coordinate inputs correctly by ensuring that: - Any type conversion or arithmetic operation inside the `polyval` method maintains the integrity and precision of `timedelta64` data. This might involve ensuring that the conversion of `timedelta64` data to a numeric type for the polynomial evaluation (possibly happening internally or before arithmetic operations) does not result in loss of information or incorrect scaling. - The Horner's method implementation (especially lines 1912-1915) should correctly factor in `timedelta64` data characteristics, ensuring that operations like multiplication and addition are correctly applied. This might require special handling or adjustment for `timedelta64` data types. - Potential issues with coefficient handling (lines 1905-1907) and other parts of the method that involve operations on the coefficients or coordinates should be reviewed to ensure they correctly support `timedelta64` types. - The function should remain backward compatible, ensuring that fixes or enhancements do not negatively impact its behavior for other data types or use cases."
