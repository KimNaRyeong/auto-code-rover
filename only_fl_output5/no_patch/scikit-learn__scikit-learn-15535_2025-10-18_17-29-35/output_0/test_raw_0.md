The `reproducer.py` script is designed to test the regression in input validation of clustering metrics as described. It checks two scenarios:
1. When the input to `mutual_info_score` has been explicitly cast to `object` type, it expects to reproduce a `ValueError`. The script should catch this error and print the stack trace to indicate successful reproduction of the issue.
2. In the second test, the input is not cast to `object` type. This scenario expects to complete without raising an exception, ideally with a warning as mentioned (though the script does not explicitly capture or display warnings).

To execute this script, save it to the root directory of your project and run it using Python 3. Expectations are as follows:
- If the regression issue exists, the script will produce a stack trace for the first scenario and an assertion error for the second scenario won't be raised.
- If the issue does not exist (indicating a fix or incorrect issue report), the first scenario should raise an `AssertionError` instead of reproducing the error as expected.
