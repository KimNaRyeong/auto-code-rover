        "content": "Based on the given requirements, we aim to create a Python script that reproduces the issue with `mutual_info_score` when dealing with inputs of type object. The script will check for a regression in input validation since in version 0.21.1, the behavior was different.\n\nGiven the context, it seems we are dealing with a library-specific issue, potentially introduced in a version following 0.21.1. It's essential to note that the nature of the problem involves handling non-numeric (categorical) data with `mutual_info_score`, which appears to have regressed in terms of input type validation or handling.\n\nBelow is a standalone `reproducer.py` script structured to address these testing phases and conditions:\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef test_mutual_info_score_regression():\n    from sklearn.metrics.cluster import mutual_info_score\n    import numpy as np\n\n    print(\"Testing mutual_info_score with dtype=object...\")\n\n    # Attempt with dtype=object, expecting ValueError in case of regression\n    try:\n        x = np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20).astype(object)\n        mutual_info_score(x, x)\n        assert False, \"This line should not be reached if regression is present.\"\n    except ValueError as ve:\n        print(\"ExpectedError: Issue reproduced successfully with dtype=object.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        assert False, f\"Unexpected error occurred: {e}\"\n\n    print(\"Testing mutual_info_score with default dtype...\")\n\n    # Attempt with default dtype, expecting a warning or successful execution\n    try:\n        x = np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20)  # Default dtype=float\n        score = mutual_info_score(x, x)\n        print(f\"Success: mutual_info_score executed without error. Score: {score}\")\n    except ValueError as ve:\n        print_stacktrace(ve)\n        assert False, \"ValueError raised unexpectedly with default dtype.\"\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        assert False, \"An unexpected error occurred.\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_mutual_info_score_regression()\n    print(\"If no AssertionError was raised, the checks passed as expected.\")\n```\n\nThis script introduces a structured approach to reproduce the issue about `mutual_info_score` behavior with inputs of type object. It outlines:\n- A method to print the stack trace for exceptions in a readable format.\n- Two testing scenarios:\n  - _First scenario:_ Inputs are explicitly cast to `object` type, where we expect a `ValueError` as a representation of the regression. This catch is for early detection if the issue does not reproduce as expected.\n  - _Second scenario:_ Inputs maintain their default type, assumed to be comparable to the conditions pre-regression (e.g., in version 0.21.1, where the behavior did not raise an exception).\n\nFollowing these steps, when executed (`python3 reproducer.py`), the script simulates the issue environment and validates the regression presence. It aims to exit with code 0 when the issue does not occur, signaling no regression, and reports comprehensively otherwise."
