        "intended_behavior": "The function should be modified to gracefully handle inputs of type object, especially when these inputs are strings that represent categorical data. This involves either pre-processing the inputs to convert them to a form that can be handled by the mathematical operations (for instance, encoding string labels to integer labels) or updating the utility functions it relies on (such as `check_clusterings` and `contingency_matrix`) to support object type inputs more robustly. The modification should ensure that if inputs are of type object and can be interpreted as categorical data, they are processed in such a way that does not lead to a `ValueError` about being unable to convert string to float. Furthermore, the documentation should be updated to clearly state how object types are handled, and if necessary, warnings should be emitted to inform the user about automatic type conversions or potential issues with the given input types. This update aims to restore the behavior consistent with version 0.21.1, where such inputs did not result in errors."
