        "content": "To analyze and address the reported regression in input validation of clustering metrics, specifically the `mutual_info_score` function from `sklearn.metrics.cluster`, and its behavior difference when handling inputs of object type versus not specifying type, I will need more context about the function and any related code or changes. To do so, here are the API calls I'll make:\n\n1. **Search for the `mutual_info_score` method**: Since the issue is directly related to this method's behavior, finding its implementation and any recent changes will be crucial. This can help understand how it processes input types differently now compared to version 0.21.1.\n   - `search_method(\"mutual_info_score\")`\n\n2. **Search for code that handles input validation in `mutual_info_score`**: Since the error involves a type conversion failure, identifying where `mutual_info_score` validates or transforms its inputs will be important. This may not be directly within `mutual_info_score` but could be in a utility function it uses.\n   - `search_code(\"input validation\")`\n   - `search_code(\"convert string to float\")`\n\n3. **Review recent changes in input handling or type conversion logic**: It may be helpful to identify if there were any recent commits or changes related to input handling, type conversion, or warnings within the clustering metrics functionality. While the exact API calls to retrieve this information aren't specified here, a hypothetical API for searching commit messages or change logs could be useful if available. For our purposes, focusing on code search related to `mutual_info_score` and its input handling is the best approximation.\n   - `search_code(\"astype(object)\")`\n   - `search_code(\"np.random.choice\")` within the context of `mutual_info_score` to see if specific handling exists for numpy arrays or types.\n\nThese API calls are designed to collect comprehensive context around the `mutual_info_score` function, input validation processes, and any recent adjustments in handling inputs of various types. This information will be crucial for identifying the root cause of the regression and formulating a patch."
