Given your request and focusing on the need for clarity and specificity in reproducing the identified issue effectively, I've refined the previous Python script. This version is designed to directly address the conditions around the observed regression in `mutual_info_score` handling of object-typed inputs, asserting an `AssertionError` if the regression is accurately reproduced and aiming to exit with status code 0 upon issue resolution.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sklearn.metrics.cluster import mutual_info_score
    import numpy as np

    try:
        # Generate sample data with object type labels
        x = np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20).astype(object)
        # Attempt to calculate mutual information score which
        # should not raise ValueError if regression is fixed
        mutual_info_score(x, x)

        # If the calculation succeeds, no regression is present
        print("No regression detected: mutual_info_score handled object input as expected.")
    except ValueError as e:
        # Expected failure mode if regression persists
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "Regression detected: mutual_info_score cannot process object input."
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "An unexpected issue occurred."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script, when placed in the root directory and executed with `python3 reproducer.py`, aims to specifically test the functioning of `mutual_info_score` with respect to handling inputs of object type, which, based on your description, should not raise a `ValueError` if the regression is resolved.

The principal changes and considerations introduced in this focused reproducer include:

- Ensuring the script encapsulates the scenario linked to the regression: The use of `np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20).astype(object)` for generating object-typed input data directly targets the issue's crux.
- Utilizing the `print_stacktrace` function provided to output stack trace details if an exception occurs, thereby enabling better issue tracking and visibility into the execution flow leading to the error.
- Adding clear, concise comments to guide understanding and maintain the context of the issue being tested, helping discern the expected normal versus abnormal (regressive) behavior.
