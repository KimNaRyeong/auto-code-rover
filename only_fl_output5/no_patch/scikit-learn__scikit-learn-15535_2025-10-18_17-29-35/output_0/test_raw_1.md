Based on the given requirements, we aim to create a Python script that reproduces the issue with `mutual_info_score` when dealing with inputs of type object. The script will check for a regression in input validation since in version 0.21.1, the behavior was different.

Given the context, it seems we are dealing with a library-specific issue, potentially introduced in a version following 0.21.1. It's essential to note that the nature of the problem involves handling non-numeric (categorical) data with `mutual_info_score`, which appears to have regressed in terms of input type validation or handling.

Below is a standalone `reproducer.py` script structured to address these testing phases and conditions:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_mutual_info_score_regression():
    from sklearn.metrics.cluster import mutual_info_score
    import numpy as np

    print("Testing mutual_info_score with dtype=object...")

    # Attempt with dtype=object, expecting ValueError in case of regression
    try:
        x = np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20).astype(object)
        mutual_info_score(x, x)
        assert False, "This line should not be reached if regression is present."
    except ValueError as ve:
        print("ExpectedError: Issue reproduced successfully with dtype=object.")
    except Exception as e:
        assert False, f"Unexpected error occurred: {e}"

    print("Testing mutual_info_score with default dtype...")

    # Attempt with default dtype, expecting a warning or successful execution
    try:
        x = np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20)  # Default dtype=float
        score = mutual_info_score(x, x)
        print(f"Success: mutual_info_score executed without error. Score: {score}")
    except ValueError as ve:
        print_stacktrace(ve)
        assert False, "ValueError raised unexpectedly with default dtype."
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "An unexpected error occurred."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_mutual_info_score_regression()
    print("If no AssertionError was raised, the checks passed as expected.")
```

This script introduces a structured approach to reproduce the issue about `mutual_info_score` behavior with inputs of type object. It outlines:
- A method to print the stack trace for exceptions in a readable format.
- Two testing scenarios:
  - _First scenario:_ Inputs are explicitly cast to `object` type, where we expect a `ValueError` as a representation of the regression. This catch is for early detection if the issue does not reproduce as expected.
  - _Second scenario:_ Inputs maintain their default type, assumed to be comparable to the conditions pre-regression (e.g., in version 0.21.1, where the behavior did not raise an exception).

Following these steps, when executed (`python3 reproducer.py`), the script simulates the issue environment and validates the regression presence. It aims to exit with code 0 when the issue does not occur, signaling no regression, and reports comprehensively otherwise.
