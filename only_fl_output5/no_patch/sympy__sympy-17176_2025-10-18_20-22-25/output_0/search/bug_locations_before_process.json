Currently, it seems to fail in distinguishing between different `Xor` configurations that are logically distinct. A possible resolution involves refining how fingerprints are computed to capture the essence of `Xor`\u2014not just based on the occurrence counts and nesting of symbols but also their logical function within the `Xor`. This could involve adding specific handling for `Xor` expressions in the fingerprinting process, ensuring that unique logical structures yield unique fingerprints."

        "intended_behavior": "The `bool_map` function's handling of expressions involving the `Xor` function needs to account for potential shortcomings in the `_finger` function's current approach to fingerprinting. The intended behavior here would require `bool_map` to correctly identify when two `Xor` based expressions are logically equivalent or not, taking into consideration corrections or enhancements made to `_finger`. Validation logic could be added to `bool_map` to specifically check for cases where `_finger` might fall short, especially regarding complex boolean expressions involving `Xor`."
