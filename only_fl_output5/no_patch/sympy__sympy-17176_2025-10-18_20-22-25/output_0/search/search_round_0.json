        "content": "To effectively address the issue described, I will need to perform several search API calls to understand how `Xor`, `bool_map`, and the `_finger` function are implemented and interact within the Sympy codebase. Specifically, I aim to understand the logical flaw mentioned in computing the fingerprint for boolean expressions which seems to affect the correctness of `bool_map`'s behavior when dealing with expressions involving the `Xor` function.\n\n1. To locate the implementation of `Xor` and understand its structure:\n   - `search_class(\"Xor\")`\n\n2. To find the implementation of the `bool_map` function to see how it is supposed to work with boolean expressions like those involving `Xor`:\n   - `search_method(\"bool_map\")`\n\n3. To locate the implementation and usage of `_finger` function to understand how it computes fingerprints and why it might be producing identical output for different expressions:\n   - `search_method(\"_finger\")`\n\n4. Finally, to understand the context in which `_finger` is used within the codebase, especially in relation to `Xor` and `bool_map`:\n   - `search_code(\"_finger((A1 & A2 & A3) | (~A1 & ~A2 & A3) | (A1 & ~A2 & ~A3) | (~A1 & A2 & ~A3))\")`\n   - `search_code(\"_finger((A1 & A2 & ~A3) | (~A1 & ~A2 & ~A3) | (A1 & ~A2 & A3) | (~A1 & A2 & A3))\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive understanding of how `Xor`, `bool_map`, and `_finger` are implemented and interact, pinpointing where the logical flaw might lie in handling boolean expressions with `Xor`."
