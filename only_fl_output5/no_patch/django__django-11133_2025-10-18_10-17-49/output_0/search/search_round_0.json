When the database is Sqlite this works correctly, but Postgresql returns the contents of the field as a memoryview object and it seems like current Django doesn't like this combination:\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse\n# String content\nresponse = HttpResponse(\"My Content\")\nresponse.content\n# Out: b'My Content'\n# This is correct\n# Bytes content\nresponse = HttpResponse(b\"My Content\")\nresponse.content\n# Out: b'My Content'\n# This is also correct\n# memoryview content\nresponse = HttpResponse(memoryview(b\"My Content\"))\nresponse.content\n# Out: b'<memory at 0x7fcc47ab2648>'\n# This is not correct, I am expecting b'My Content'\n</issue>"

Here are the necessary API calls to gather the required context:\n\n- `search_class(\"HttpResponse\")`: This will help us find where the `HttpResponse` class is defined in the Django project.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"HttpResponse\")`: To understand how the response content is initially set, examining the constructor of `HttpResponse` might give us clues about its handling of different types of content.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"content\", \"HttpResponse\")`: Since accessing `response.content` leads to incorrect output for memoryview objects, we need to see how this property is implemented."
