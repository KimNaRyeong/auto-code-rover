It sets the content directly by assigning it to `self.content`, which triggers the content setter.\n- **Relationship with the bug**: Since the issue arises when a `memoryview` object is passed as content, the way `__init__` and the content setter handle the passed content is crucial. Specifically, it's the content setter's handling of different types of inputs that needs to be scrutinized in relation to the bug.\n- **Intended behavior**: When content is passed to an `HttpResponse` object, regardless of its type (`bytes`, `str`, or `memoryview`), the intended behavior would be to convert or handle this input in such a way that `response.content` returns the expected byte representation of the content.\n\n### 2. `content` Property Getter and Setter\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  - **Getter (`def content(self)`):** Returns the content of the response by joining all elements found in `_container`.\n  - **Setter (`def content(self, value)`):** Handles the assignment to the content property. If `value` is an iterable (other than `bytes` or `str`), it attempts to join all iterable elements into bytes. This conversion iterates over the value, converting each chunk into bytes using `make_bytes` method, and assigns the result to `_container`.\n- **Relationship with the bug**: The issue described involves the inability of `HttpResponse` to properly handle `memoryview` objects as expected. The setter does check if the value has an `__iter__` attribute, aiming to handle iterable types. However, since `memoryview` objects are not being handled as expected, the bug likely lies in the process of converting these `memoryview` objects into byte strings within the setter.\n- **Intended behavior**: For `memoryview` objects, which can essentially be viewed as byte-like objects, the intended behavior would be to either directly convert them into bytes (if not being handled correctly by the current iterable condition) or ensure that the iterable handling logic correctly interprets and processes `memoryview` objects into the expected byte string representation.\n\nGiven this analysis, a closer look into how different types of content (especially `memoryview`) are converted into bytes seems necessary. It might be useful to examine the `make_bytes` method mentioned in the setter. This method appears to be responsible for converting chunks of the passed content into bytes, which is a critical part of handling various content types correctly."

This means potentially adjusting the condition within the setter to add special handling for `memoryview` types, or ensuring `make_bytes` (should its context reveal it's involved in this process) correctly processes `memoryview` objects into bytes. The goal is to preserve the existing functionality (i.e., correctly handling strings, bytes, and iterables) while extending the capability to include `memoryview` objects, ensuring they are converted into a byte string (`b'My Content'`) instead of being incorrectly serialized or represented."
