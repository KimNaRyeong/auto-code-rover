        "intended_behavior": "The method should include a check to handle `memoryview` objects explicitly, converting them into bytes in a manner that preserves the binary content directly, without first converting to a string. Before any checks for string types or subsequent string-to-byte conversion, the method should first check if the `value` is an instance of `memoryview`. If so, it should return `bytes(value)` directly. This change ensures that when a `memoryview` object is passed into `HttpResponse` as content, it is correctly handled and converted into its proper byte representation, preserving the expected functionality for strings, bytes, and now properly for `memoryview` objects."
