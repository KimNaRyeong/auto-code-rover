Given your instructions, here is the standalone Python script, `reproducer.py`, which aims to reproduce the mentioned issue related to `HttpResponse` not correctly handling `memoryview` objects. The script will attempt to use a memoryview object as the content for a `HttpResponse` and verify whether the content matches the expected bytes. If not, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace. This script should work within a Django environment.

```python
import os
import sys
from django.http import HttpResponse

def setup_django_environment():
    # Setup minimal Django settings required for testing
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'reproducer_settings')
    settings_module = """
SECRET_KEY = 'fake-key-for-testing-purposes-only'
INSTALLED_APPS = []
"""
    with open('reproducer_settings.py', 'w') as f:
        f.write(settings_module)
    
    from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
    execute_from_command_line(['django-admin', 'check'])

    # Cleanup by removing the temporary settings module after use
    os.remove('reproducer_settings.py')

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Ensure Django environment is correctly set up
        setup_django_environment()
        
        # Test HttpResponse with memoryview
        response = HttpResponse(memoryview(b"My Content"))
        assert response.content == b"My Content", "HttpResponse did not correctly handle memoryview object"

        # If the assertion passes, exit with code 0 signaling issue is fixed or not present
        print("Issue not present, successfully handled memoryview object.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # If an error occurs, indicate failure to handle memoryview objects correctly
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Instructions for use:
1. Place this script at the root directory of your Django project.
2. Ensure Django is installed in your environment. If not, install it using `pip install django`.
3. Run the script using `python3 reproducer.py`.

### Expected behavior:
- The script sets up a minimal Django environment for testing, thus avoiding the need to alter your project's settings.
- If the `HttpResponse` correctly handles the `memoryview` object, the script will exit with code `0` and print a success message.
- If an `AssertionError` is raised due to incorrect handling of the `memoryview` object (`response.content` does not match the expected bytes), a detailed stack trace will be printed, and the script will exit with code `1`. 

This approach ensures that the script is self-contained and does not rely on external Django project settings, simplifying the reproduction of the issue.
