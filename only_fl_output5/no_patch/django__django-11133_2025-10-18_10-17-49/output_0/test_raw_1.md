To address the issue with module finding due to the direct reference to a Django settings module and to ensure the script works in a standalone manner without depending on Django's complicated settings setup, you might consider the following approach:

1. For demonstration purposes, I will create a self-contained Django environment within the script. This includes dynamically creating necessary Django settings within the script itself.
2. The script will not rely on an external `settings.py` file or a full Django project setup.

This approach sidesteps the complexity of setting up a full Django project and focuses directly on testing the behavior of `HttpResponse` with a `memoryview` object.

Here is a revised version of `reproducer.py`:

```python
import os
import sys

# Setup Django environment
os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = '__main__'

SETTINGS = {
    'DEBUG': True,
    'DATABASES': {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    },
    'INSTALLED_APPS': (
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
    ),
    'SECRET_KEY': 'fake-key',
}

def setup_django_environment():
    from django.conf import settings
    settings.configure(**SETTINGS)
    import django
    django.setup()

setup_django_environment()

from django.http import HttpResponse

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_memoryview_handling():
    try:
        # Creating HttpResponse with memoryview content
        response = HttpResponse(memoryview(b"My Content"))
        content = response.content
        # Check if the output is as expected
        assert content == b"My Content", f"Expected b'My Content', got {content}"
        print("Issue not present, exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:  # Catching a general exception to also include potential Django errors
        print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_memoryview_handling()
```

In this script:
- A minimal in-memory Django environment is configured and set up at the beginning of the script.
- The `settings` dictionary provides the required settings to initialize Django. This is a minimal setup primarily for running the script without a fully-fledged Django project.
- It addresses the original issue description regarding `HttpResponse` and attempts to reproduce the issue with handling `memoryview` objects.
- If there's an exception or the content does not match the expected output, a stack trace is printed.

This approach should circumvent the original problem of Django not finding the `settings.py` module and allows for a direct test of the problem described.
