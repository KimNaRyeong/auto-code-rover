        "content": "To resolve the issue described, we need to investigate the logic around the handling of `min_count` in the context of a multi-dimensional sum operation within the `xarray` project. Specifically, the focus is on how the number of valid elements is calculated which is crucial for operations with the `min_count` parameter.\n\nGiven the information from the issue, the following API calls are necessary to gather the required context:\n\n1. **Search for the specific code snippet indicated in the issue description**: This will provide a direct look into the current implementation and the surrounding code, which might offer insights into why the error occurs with more than one dimension and how to implement the suggested fix.\n   \n   `search_code_in_file(\"mask.shape[axis]\", \"xarray/core/nanops.py\")`\n   \n2. **Get more context around the suggested fix** by examining the part of the code that needs to be modified according to the issue description. This code context is important for understanding the expected behavior of the proposed solution.\n   \n   `get_code_around_line(\"xarray/core/nanops.py\", 35, 10)`\n\n3. **Understand how `sum` is implemented**, especially when dealing with multiple dimensions and the `min_count` parameter. This requires looking into the method that handles the sum operation across dimensions.\n   \n   `search_method(\"sum\")`\n\nBy analyzing the results from these API calls, we should be able to gather enough context on how `sum` is implemented with respect to multi-dimensional arrays and `min_count`, identify the section of the code that leads to the error, and conceptualize how the proposed change might resolve the issue."
