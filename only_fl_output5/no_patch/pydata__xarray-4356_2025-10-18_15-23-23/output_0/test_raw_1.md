Based on the issue described, let's refine the approach to properly reproduce the problem and check whether it has been fixed or not. This involves the use of `xarray` to attempt a summation over multiple dimensions with a `min_count` specified. The script will catch the pertinent exception if it occurs and handle it using the provided `print_stacktrace` function to display relevant information. Otherwise, it will confirm the absence of the reported issue by completing successfully without errors.

Here's how you could structure `reproducer.py` considering these points:

```python
import xarray as xr
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        da = xr.DataArray([[1., 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
        # Attempt the operation that is expected to raise an issue
        da.sum(["dim_0", "dim_1"], min_count=1)
    except ValueError as e:
        # Check if the specific issue is hit and raise AssertionError if not
        if "min_count is not available for reduction with more than one dimensions" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(1)  # Exit indicating the issue is present
        else:
            raise AssertionError("A different issue occurred") from e
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error for any other exceptions
    else:
        print("Issue is fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit indicating the issue has been resolved

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script effectively targets the specific issue mentioned, attempting to reproduce it with an appropriate `try-except` block to handle errors as expected. If the `ValueError` matching the issue's description is caught, it will print the stack trace and exit with an error code. If the operation succeeds without raising an exception, it will indicate that the issue has been resolved, exiting successfully.
