It seems to work consistently once on a file, but multiple changes to the same file will not necessarily trigger a reload. It's definitely a change in the behavior to previous versions of Django (up to 2.1.7)\nI'm not using watchman.\nI'm running runserver in a python 3.7 slim docker container like ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001\nAs a workaround I have tried to add an edit a different .py -- that doesn't seem to help consistently. I've also noticed that the problem seems to sometimes go away by itself -- perhaps there is some change to the timing of the autoreloader which is not clear? For example and ignore interval of a certain duration.\n</issue>"

It checks if the provided path is absolute and logs the action of watching this file. This suggests that Django's autoreload mechanism can monitor additional files beyond the default set, likely to trigger reloads when changes are detected in these files.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   Given the issue's description, the inconsistency in the autoreloader's behavior could be related to how files are being monitored. If the autoreloader intermittently fails to detect changes in certain `.py` files, it could be an issue with how the `watch_file` functionality is implemented or used. The problem might stem from the mechanism that decides which files to watch or how change detection is executed for watched files.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   Ideally, the `watch_file` method should ensure that any modifications to watched files reliably trigger the autoreload process. Every change to a `.py` file within the project's scope, especially when repeatedly editing the same file, should prompt the Django development server to reload, reflecting the changes immediately.\n\nSince we're not seeing changes consistently trigger reloads, but the method itself seems straightforward, the issue may not lie within `watch_file` directly. However, how Django determines which files to watch or how the list of \"extra files\" is managed could be areas worth investigating. Given this, further context is needed around the autoreloading mechanism, particularly regarding how files are added to the monitoring set and how changes are detected.\n\nNext Steps for Context Gathering:\n- Investigate if there's a larger mechanism managing file monitoring to which `watch_file` contributes, potentially a method or class handling the overall setup of file watching.\n- Look into how Django's autoreloader decides which files to monitor by default and how changes are detected and propagated to trigger reloads.\n\nWe could try looking for:\n- A class or method that initializes or manages the autoreloading mechanism. Perhaps a method like `start_reloader` or similar.\n- More details on how Django detects file changes, possibly in the same `autoreload.py` file, to understand the overall logic and where it might be failing.\n\nLet's proceed with additional API calls based on these steps:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"BaseReloader\")\nsearch_method_in_file(\"start_reloader\", \"django/utils/autoreload.py\")\nsearch_code_in_file(\"changes detected\", \"django/utils/autoreload.py\")\n```"

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

The issue might not be directly within the `watch_file` method but how and when it's called or the mechanism that checks for modifications in these watched files. The intended behavior is to enhance the reliability of detecting changes in `.py` files under different conditions, such as multiple edits to the same file in a short period, which seems to be problematic based on the issue description. Ensuring that this method accommodates for filesystem idiosyncrasies or timing-related issues that could occur in a Docker environment would help in resolving the reported intermittent autoreload failures. This could involve looking into how file modification dates are polled or if inotify events (or equivalent) are properly caught in the containerized environment.\n\nWithout additional context or identified specific points of failure beyond the `watch_file` method, a targeted fix remains speculative. However, the general direction would be to improve the robustness and sensitivity of the file change detection mechanism that triggers reloads, ensuring it works consistently across diverse development environments including Docker."
