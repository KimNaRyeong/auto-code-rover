        "intended_behavior": "This method needs to ensure that all relevant .py files are consistently monitored for changes to trigger the autoreloader. The issue might not be directly within the 'watch_file' method but how and when it's called or the mechanism that checks for modifications in these watched files. The intended behavior is to enhance the reliability of detecting changes in .py files under different conditions, such as multiple edits to the same file in a short period, which seems to be problematic based on the issue description. Ensuring that this method accommodates for filesystem idiosyncrasies or timing-related issues that could occur in a Docker environment would help in resolving the reported intermittent autoreload failures. This could involve looking into how file modification dates are polled or if inotify events (or equivalent) are properly caught in the containerized environment."
