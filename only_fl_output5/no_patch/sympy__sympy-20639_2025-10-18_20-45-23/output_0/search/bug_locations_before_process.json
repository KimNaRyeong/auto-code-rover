        "intended_behavior": "The code responsible for pretty-printing power expressions should be verified or updated to ensure that expressions where symbols or constants (like \u03c0) are raised to powers that are themselves symbolic expressions or constants (such as 1/E) are rendered accurately. This means that instead of simplifying or altering these expressions into a form that misrepresents the intended mathematical relationship (e.g., rendering pi**(1/E) as \u2572\u2571 \u03c0), it should maintain a display that clearly shows the base (pi) and the exponent (1/E) in their correct relation. This could possibly involve adjusting the logic that decides when to simplify or alter the representation of power expressions to add exceptions or refine the handling for cases involving key symbolic constants."
