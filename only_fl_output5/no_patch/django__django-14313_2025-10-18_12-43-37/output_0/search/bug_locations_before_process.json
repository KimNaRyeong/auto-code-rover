One approach could involve conditionally applying `.distinct()` only when it's certain that the following operation is not deletion. Alternatively, before deletion, clone the queryset without `.distinct()` if its presence is detected."

        "intended_behavior": "Before the actual deletion operation, check if the queryset has been altered by `.distinct()`, and if so, reconstruct the queryset from the primary keys of the current queryset's results. This will ensure that the deletion operation proceeds on a queryset that is compatible with deletion. Code modifications might involve a pre-deletion check that explicitly handles or warns about issues arising from attempting deletion on querysets with `.distinct()`. This pre-check could offer a pathway to handle such cases more gracefully, possibly by re-fetching objects based on their IDs alone for deletion."
