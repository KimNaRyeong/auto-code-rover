        "content": "To gather enough context for resolving the issue, we need to look into specific parts of the project that are directly related to the problem described. The error originates in the admin page when attempting to delete a post that has been found through a search involving a many-to-many field. As such, we'll focus on examining the relevant model, admin configuration, and underlying deletion mechanism. Here are the API calls I'd make based on the mentioned error and setup:\n\n1. **Explore the `Post` Model**: Since the error seems to originate from an operation involving the `Post` model, especially with its `authors` many-to-many field to `User`, getting the context of this model will help.\n   - `search_class(\"Post\")`\n   - `search_class(\"User\")`\n\n2. **Examine the Admin Configuration for `Post`**: The admin configuration for `Post` influences how objects are displayed, searched, and actions performed on them, especially since `search_fields` and a delete action are mentioned.\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"PostAdmin\", \"admin.py\")`\n\n3. **Check Implementation of the Delete Operation**: The error mentions a failure upon attempting to delete selected posts. Inspecting how the deletion is handled, especially if there's any custom logic involved, will be crucial.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"delete_queryset\", \"PostAdmin\")`\n   - `search_method(\"delete_selected\")`\n\n4. **Investigate the Search Mechanism**: Given the problem occurs after a search operation, understanding how searches are performed might reveal why a `.distinct()` call is made before attempting deletion.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"changelist_view\", \"PostAdmin\")`\n   - `search_method(\"get_queryset\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide us with a comprehensive context surrounding the models involved, the admin configuration for handling posts, and the specific methods where the error is triggered, giving insight into the bug's source and potential fixes."
