To create a standalone script that reproduces the issue outlined, we need to follow several steps:

1. Setting up a minimal Django environment within the script.
2. Defining the necessary Django models and admin configuration.
3. Simulating the admin action that leads to the error.

Here is the `reproducer.py` script designed for this purpose:

```python
import os
import sys
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

# Define a function to print stack traces
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Minimal Django settings
settings.configure(
    INSTALLED_APPS=[
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        '__main__',  # Makes this file an app for Django
    ],
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        }
    },
    USE_TZ=True,
    SECRET_KEY='justasecretkeythatishouldnotcommit',
    ROOT_URLCONF='__main__',  # Makes this file the root URLconf
)

django.setup()

# Import after setting up Django to avoid import errors
from django.db import models
from django.contrib import admin

# Define models as per issue description
class User(models.Model):
    email = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    authors = models.ManyToManyField(User)

# Register models to admin
@admin.register(User)
class UserAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    pass

@admin.register(Post)
class PostAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    search_fields = ("title", "authors__email")

# Necessary to avoid "AppRegistryNotReady" error
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Adding a URLConf dynamically
    from django.urls import path
    from django.contrib import admin as django_admin

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', django_admin.site.urls),
    ]

    # 1. Create necessary table schema
    execute_from_command_line(['manage.py', 'migrate'])

    # 2. Create a user and post to perform the search and delete action on
    user = User(email="user@example.com")
    user.save()
    post = Post(title="Test Post")
    post.save()
    post.authors.add(user)

    try:
        # Reproducing the steps that lead to the error
        # Note: In a real scenario, these actions would be performed through HTTP requests to the admin view.
        # However, our aim here is to execute the same underlying logic that leads to the error,
        # not to simulate the complete HTTP request/response cycle.
        PostAdmin(Post, admin.site).delete_queryset(None, Post.objects.filter(title__startswith='Te'))
        print("Successfully deleted the post. The issue seems to be fixed.")
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code to indicate the issue is present
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Handle unexpected errors
```

**Explanation:**

- The script starts by setting up a minimal Django environment, including necessary settings and model definitions.
- It configures a SQLite database for simplicity. You can modify this to use PostgreSQL to more closely match the original issue environment.
- Next, it defines the `User` and `Post` models, along with a basic admin configuration to reproduce the issue.
- The script dynamically adds URL configurations, necessary for the admin site setup, even if it doesn't perform actual HTTP requests.
- After performing migrations to set up the database schema, it creates test data and attempts to delete a `Post` object in a way that would trigger the issue.
- If the error is encountered, it prints the stack trace and exits with an error code, signaling the presence of the issue.

**Note:** This script simplifies the process by directly invoking admin actions, which differs from how interactions would occur through the web interface. However, it aims to replicate the underlying logic that leads to the reported issue.
