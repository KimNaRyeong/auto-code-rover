Given the feedback, it seems I previously misinterpreted the requirement for the admin configuration. Let me provide a correct version that should properly reproduce the issue described, by embedding the `search_fields` into a custom admin class definition inside the script and setting up Django correctly to reproduce and assert the problem.

```python
# Standalone script `reproducer.py`
import os
import sys
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.contrib import admin
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
from django.core.exceptions import ImproperlyConfigured

# Helpers
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Settings configuration
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={'default': {'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3', 'NAME': ':memory:'}},
    INSTALLED_APPS=('django.contrib.admin', 'django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', '__main__',),
    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES=[],
    ROOT_URLCONF='__main__',
    SECRET_KEY='abcde12345',
)

django.setup()

# Models definition
class User(models.Model):
    email = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    authors = models.ManyToManyField(User)

# Admin site configuration
class PostAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    search_fields = ('title', 'authors__email',)

try:
    admin.site.register(User)
    admin.site.register(Post, PostAdmin)

    # Mimicking the admin's action that leads to the issue
    user = User.objects.create(email="user@example.com")
    post = Post.objects.create(title="Sample Post")
    post.authors.add(user)

    # Attempt to delete a post to reproduce the bug
    Post.objects.all().delete()
    
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    # Exit with non-zero to indicate failure in reproducing or handling the issue
    sys.exit(1)

print("Script executed successfully, no issues detected.")
# Exit with zero to indicate success
sys.exit(0)
```

This script simplifies the initial setup, correctly configures a minimal Django environment, defines models and their admin registration with `search_fields`, and then tries to delete an instance to replicate the scenario that would trigger the bug. If the issue is present, it should capture and print the stack trace using the provided function.

**Important Notes**:

- Ensure Django is installed in your environment (`pip install django`).
- Save this script as `reproducer.py` in the root of your project.
- Run the script using `python3 reproduducer.py`.
- The script attempts to closely mimic the operational environment where the issue can be triggered, specifically within Django's admin with a ManyToMany field being involved in the `search_fields`.
- If there's no issue or Django handles the operation correctly, it will print a success message and exit with code 0.
- Any exception caught that is related to the deletion attempt after filtering based on the `search_fields` will cause the script to print the stack trace and exit with a non-zero code, indicating an error or issue presence.
