You can modify this to use PostgreSQL to more closely match the original issue environment.\n- Next, it defines the `User` and `Post` models, along with a basic admin configuration to reproduce the issue.\n- The script dynamically adds URL configurations, necessary for the admin site setup, even if it doesn't perform actual HTTP requests.\n- After performing migrations to set up the database schema, it creates test data and attempts to delete a `Post` object in a way that would trigger the issue.\n- If the error is encountered, it prints the stack trace and exits with an error code, signaling the presence of the issue.\n\n**Note:** This script simplifies the process by directly invoking admin actions, which differs from how interactions would occur through the web interface. However, it aims to replicate the underlying logic that leads to the reported issue."
