        "content": "To resolve the reported issue, let's focus on collecting the necessary context surrounding the implementation and usage of `ExpressionWrapper`, as well as the query construction mechanism that handles grouping and aggregate functions within the Django project's ORM layer. Here are the API calls we will use to gather this context:\n\n1. Search for the `ExpressionWrapper` class to understand its structure and any relevant methods that might contribute to the behavior described in the issue:\n   ```\n   search_class(\"ExpressionWrapper\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since `ExpressionWrapper` is part of constructing a query, it is also important to look at how Django's ORM constructs queries, particularly those involving group by clauses. The `annotate()` and `values()` methods are central to this functionality, so we'll search for these methods in the codebase:\n   ```\n   search_method(\"annotate\")\n   search_method(\"values\")\n   ```\n\n3. The error description suggests there's a difference in how constant expressions are handled when directly used versus when wrapped with an `ExpressionWrapper`. As such, investigating the `Value` class, which is used for constant expressions, might provide insights:\n   ```\n   search_class(\"Value\")\n   ```\n\n4. Lastly, the problem might also be related to how the SQL is generated, especially the part that constructs the `GROUP BY` clause. If there's a specific method responsible for generating the `GROUP BY` segment of a query, understanding its logic could be crucial. If we don't have a specific method name, looking into the code related to SQL generation in the ORM might help. We'll start with a broad search for a method that might be responsible for this, knowing \"GROUP BY\" might not directly lead us to a method name but it's a start:\n   ```\n   search_code(\"GROUP BY\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches aim to provide a wide enough scope to understand the issue's context while being specific enough to target areas most likely affected by the bug described."
