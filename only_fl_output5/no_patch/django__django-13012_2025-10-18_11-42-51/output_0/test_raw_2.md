Certainly! Given your requirement, I'll craft a standalone Python script that attempts to reproduce the specific issue regarding Django's handling of `ExpressionWrapper` with constant expressions in a PostgreSQL database context. This script will be designed to execute procedural logic to simulate the described problem, ensuring to raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is indeed present, and also to capture and output a detailed stack trace for debugging purposes.

Before running this script, ensure you have a Django environment set up with access to a PostgreSQL database, and that you've installed all necessary packages (`django` and `psycopg2` for database access). Replace the database settings within the script with your actual PostgreSQL settings.

Below is the `reproducer.py` script tailored to your instructions:

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run():
    # Django setup
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project.settings')
    import django
    django.setup()

    # Verify your Django model and database setup matches this example
    from django.db import models
    from django.db.models import Sum, Value, ExpressionWrapper, IntegerField
    from django.db.utils import ProgrammingError

    # Assuming `Model` is an actual model in your Django project
    class Model(models.Model):
        column_a = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        column_b = models.IntegerField()

        class Meta:
            app_label = 'your_app_label'  # Change to your app label

    def execQuery(expr):
        expr = ExpressionWrapper(expr, output_field=IntegerField())
        return Model.objects.annotate(expr_res=expr).values('expr_res', 'column_a').annotate(sum=Sum('column_b'))

    # Attempt to reproduce the issue
    try:
        expr = Value(3)  # This should reproduce the issue as described
        query = execQuery(expr)
        print(query.query)  # For debugging, to see the generated SQL query
        query.count()  # Trigger actual SQL query execution
    except ProgrammingError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Detected issue with constant expressions in GROUP BY clause.") from e
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e  # Re-raise unexpected exceptions

    print("Test completed successfully. The issue appears to be resolved.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

Few important notes:
1. **Settings Module**: Replace `'your_project.settings'` with the path to your Django project settings module.
2. **Model and App Definition**: Ensure the `Model` class and the `app_label` match what you have in your actual Django application. This script assumes the existence of a model named `Model` that has at least two fields: `column_a` and `column_b`.
3. **Database Configuration**: This script assumes your Django settings are properly configured to connect to a PostgreSQL database.
4. **Dependencies**: Ensure Django and psycopg2 are installed in your environment (`pip install django psycopg2`).

Run this script from your project root directory (where `manage.py` resides) using `python3 reproducer.py`. If the issue is present, the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace. If the issue is no longer present, it will exit with code 0.
