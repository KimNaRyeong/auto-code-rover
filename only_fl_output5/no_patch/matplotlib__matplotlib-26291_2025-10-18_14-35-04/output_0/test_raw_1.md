Given the feedback and requirements for a revisited script that should explicitly check for the presence of an issue by raising an `AssertionError` when the issue is present or exit with code 0 when it's fixed, the revised version of the `reproducer.py` would look like this:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_inset_axes_functionality():
    try:
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.inset_locator import inset_axes

        fig, (ax, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=[5.5, 2.8])
        axins = inset_axes(ax, width="30%", height="40%", loc="upper left")
        plt.show()
        # Expecting an error specific to the described issue, if not raise AssertionError
        raise AssertionError("Expected issue did not occur.")
    except AttributeError as e:
        # If the specific AttributeError occurs, it means the issue is reproduced.
        # Printing stack trace for the specific error captured
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as general_error:
        # If an unexpected error occurs, raising an AssertionError to indicate a different problem
        print_stacktrace(general_error)
        raise AssertionError("An unexpected error occurred, indicating a different issue might be present.") from general_error
    else:
        # If no error occurs, it means the issue is fixed, and we exit with code 0.
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_inset_axes_functionality()
```

It's important to modify the test script to specifically check for the occurrence of the `AttributeError` that indicates the presence of the issue discussed. If that error does not occur, the script will exit with code 0, indicating the issue has been resolved. If an unexpected error occurs, it raises a new `AssertionError` to indicate that a different problem might be present, which is a safer approach when testing for specific issues.
