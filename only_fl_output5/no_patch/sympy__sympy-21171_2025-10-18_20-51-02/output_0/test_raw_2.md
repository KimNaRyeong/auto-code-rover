Given the requirements, the script needs to directly reproduce the issue mentioned. The last attempt might have failed due to an environment difference, incorrect exception handling, or code that might not trigger the error as described in the original scenario. Hereâ€™s another approach that more meticulously attempts to replicate the issue, employing the `print_stacktrace` function as instructed:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    from sympy import symbols, latex
    from sympy.physics.continuum_mechanics.beam import Beam

    # Define symbols
    E, L, F, B, H = symbols("E L F B H")
    I = B * H**3 / 12

    # Create beam object
    b2 = Beam(L, E, I)
    b2.apply_load(-F, L / 2, -1)
    b2.apply_support(0, "fixed")

    R0, M0 = symbols("R_0 M_0")
    b2.solve_for_reaction_loads(R0, M0)

    # Trigger error: Attempt to produce shear force that previously caused issues.
    shear_force = b2.shear_force()
    
    # If assuming this would fail and it doesn't, we must not be ready to catch an AssertionError.
    # Error generation for assertion to ensure we're in the exception-catching logic.
    try:
        latex(shear_force)  # Try to convert to latex, which is where the error was happening.
    except TypeError as te:
        # If this part is reached, the expected error occurred.
        raise AssertionError("Issue successfully reproduced.") from te

    # No error occurred, likely due to a fix in the related library or code.
    print("Issue not reproduced: no error was raised during operation.")
    exit(0)

except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    # If any other exceptions do occur, raise an AssertionError
    raise AssertionError("An unexpected issue occurred.")
```

This script explicitly tries to reproduce the problem as described by making use of the `latex` function directly, which was implicated in the traceback provided. The aim is to precisely encounter a `TypeError` during the process, which would confirm that the described bug is indeed present. If such an error is caught, it raises an `AssertionError` containing the relevant message and stack trace. If the operation completes without incident, the script acknowledges that the issue was not reproduced and exits normally.
