Each function would have its way of formatting the `SingularityFunction` to align with the output medium's standards.\n\n   **Relationship to the bug?**\n   - The bug is related to the LaTeX representation of some expressions involving `SingularityFunction`, where an unexpected keyword argument `exp` is passed. The implementation in `latex.py` is directly related to this error.\n\n   **Intended behavior?**\n   - It should correctly interpret or handle the `SingularityFunction` (and potentially its exponent, if that's a part of the mathematical expression it's trying to render) without throwing a TypeError due to unexpected arguments.\n\n2. **_print_Pow method in `latex.py`**:\n\n   **What does this part of the code do?** \n   - `_print_Pow` is responsible for converting expressions with powers (exponentiation) into LaTeX format. When dealing with exponentiation, it likely factors in how the base and the exponent should be formatted in LaTeX.\n\n   **Relationship to the bug?**\n   - The traceback shows that the error occurs when attempting to render a power expression into LaTeX, implying the method may incorrectly handle cases where the base is a `SingularityFunction`, possibly trying to pass an `exp` argument that the `_print_SingularityFunction` method does not expect or handle.\n\n   **Intended behavior?**\n   - The method should either correctly pass only supported arguments to `_print_SingularityFunction` or ensure that any exponentiation involving `SingularityFunction` objects is handled in a way that doesn't lead to such errors.\n\n3. **Usage of `SingularityFunction` in the codebase**:\n\n   **What does this part of the code do?** \n   - The `SingularityFunction` appears extensively, especially in mechanics (beam analysis), and is crucial for representing singularities in mathematical expressions. Its conversion to LaTeX is critical for displaying these expressions correctly in rich text environments like Jupyter Notebooks.\n\n   **Relationship to the bug?**\n   - Given the widespread use of `SingularityFunction` in mathematical and physical calculations, correct LaTeX rendering is essential. The bug inhibits this capability, affecting users' ability to visualize and work with expressions involving singularities.\n\n   **Intended behavior?**\n   - Users should be able to visualize expressions involving `SingularityFunction` in LaTeX without encountering errors, meaning that handling of these functions, especially when rendered as part of expressions with powers, should be seamless.\n\nBased on this analysis, it's likely that the solution involves adjusting `_print_Pow` in `latex.py` to handle `SingularityFunction` expressions correctly, ensuring that no unsupported arguments are passed to `_print_SingularityFunction`. This may require a patch in `latex.py` to check if the base of a power expression is a `SingularityFunction` and handle it appropriately, perhaps by managing or avoiding the `exp` argument in such cases."
