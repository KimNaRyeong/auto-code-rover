        "intended_behavior": "This method should correctly handle SingularityFunction expressions, especially when they are part of exponentiation. The method's handling of arguments when calling _print_SingularityFunction must be reviewed. Specifically, it should not pass the exp argument to _print_SingularityFunction unless it is explicitly supported. A check should be implemented within _print_Pow to detect when the base of the exponentiation is a SingularityFunction and ensure that any processing or argument passing aligns with what _print_SingularityFunction expects. This adjustment ensures that expressions involving SingularityFunction are correctly converted to LaTeX, preserving the functionality for displaying mathematical expressions in environments that utilize LaTeX rendering, such as Jupyter Notebooks."
