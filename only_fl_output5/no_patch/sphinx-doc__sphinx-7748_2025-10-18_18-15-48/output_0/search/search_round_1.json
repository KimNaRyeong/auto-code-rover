To refine our approach and gather more relevant context, we can attempt broader or more generalized searches that don't rely on possibly project-specific terminology. Here are some alternative strategies:\n\n1. **Search for Documentation or Docstring Processing Functions**: Since the issue is related to the processing of docstrings, we can look for functions, classes, or modules responsible for handling docstrings in general, not just those explicitly tied to SWIG or overloaded methods.\n   - `search_code(\"parse docstring\")`\n   - `search_code(\"process docstring\")`\n   - `search_code(\"docstring\")` \n\n2. **Inspect Code Related to Method Processing**: Since the specific problem involves overloaded methods, exploring how methods (especially metadata including docstrings) are processed might provide insights. This can include how methods are registered, invoked, or documented within the project.\n   - `search_code(\"method registration\")`\n   - `search_code(\"method parsing\")`\n\n3. **Search for SWIG Integration Points**: Although the initial search for SWIG-specific docstrings yielded no results, it might be beneficial to search for SWIG integration more broadly. This can help us identify how SWIG-wrapped classes and methods are handled.\n   - `search_code(\"SWIG interface\")`\n   - `search_code(\"SWIG python\")`\n\n4. **Look for Code Handling Overloading**: Since the ability to detect or document overloaded methods is central to the issue, identifying any existing mechanisms for handling method overloads might provide a lead.\n   - `search_code(\"overload detection\")`\n   - `search_code(\"handle overloaded\")`\n\nThese searches are aimed at covering broader aspects of the issue and can potentially identify relevant parts of the codebase dealing with docstrings, SWIG, or method handling that the initial queries did not catch."
