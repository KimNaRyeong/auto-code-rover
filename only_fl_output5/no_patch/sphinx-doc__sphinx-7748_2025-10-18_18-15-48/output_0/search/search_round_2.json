This can include how methods are registered, invoked, or documented within the project.\n   - `search_code(\"method registration\")`\n   - `search_code(\"method parsing\")`\n\n3. **Search for SWIG Integration Points**: Although the initial search for SWIG-specific docstrings yielded no results, it might be beneficial to search for SWIG integration more broadly.

Let's analyze the results in relation to the original issue about `autodoc_docstring_signature` failing to pick up all signatures of overloaded methods in SWIG-wrapped C++ classes for Python:\n\n### Analyzing `process_doc` method in `Documenter` class\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**  \n   The `process_doc` method allows for the pre-processing of docstrings before they are added to the documentation. Specifically, it emits an event (`autodoc-process-docstring`) that can be hooked into by Sphinx extensions to modify docstrings.\n   \n2. **Relationship to the bug:**  \n   This method is directly related to the handling of docstrings, which is the crux of the submitted issue. However, the issue points to the initial parsing and recognition of multiple signatures in docstrings, which might not be directly handled by this part of the code.\n\n3. **Intended behavior in relation to the issue:**  \n   Although this method deals with processing docstrings, enhancements or adjustments to initially capture all overloaded method signatures from SWIG-wrapped C++ classes might need to take place either before this processing step or within a connected component that emits or handles the `autodoc-process-docstring` event specifically for overloaded methods.\n\n### Insights from Search Results on \"docstring\"\nThe broad reference to \"docstring\" across multiple files indicates extensive handling and utility around documentation strings within Sphinx. However, the absence of specific code snippets in the brief overview doesn't immediately point to the solution but emphasizes the complexity of docstring handling within the project.\n\n### Potential Bug Locations and Intended Behavior\nGiven the absence of direct references to the handling of overloaded methods or SWIG integration, the following are hypothesized locations and enhancements that could resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Bug Location**: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`, possibly within classes or methods responsible for initially fetching or parsing docstrings.\n   \n   **Intended Behavior**: Enhancement to support recognizing and parsing multiple signatures within a single docstring for overloaded methods. This could involve extending the logic in either an existing method (like `process_doc`) or adding new functionality to specifically detect and separate overloaded method signatures before they are processed individually.\n\n2. **Further Analysis Needed**: Given the complexity of the problem, additional code investigations are required to precisely pinpoint where overloaded methods are initially documented and how these are parsed and stored. This could potentially involve more detailed inspection of:\n   - How Sphinx extensions (like `napoleon` for Google and NumPy style docstrings) handle formatting and could influence parsing strategies.\n   - Whether there's already infrastructure within Sphinx to handle method overloading in Python, which could be extended or adapted for SWIG-wrapped C++ classes.\n\n3. **Potential Enhancement Area**: Implementing or extending a mechanism (potentially within `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`) that can:\n   - Accurately parse and retain multiple signatures from a single docstring comment.\n   - Ensure that these signatures are correctly reflected in the generated documentation, potentially involving changes to the `autodoc-process-docstring` event handling to accommodate multiple signatures.\n\n### Conclusion\nAlthough we've identified possible areas of interest and hypotheses for addressing the issue, further detailed exploration within the `sphinx/ext/autodoc` module, and an understanding of how Sphinx currently parses and processes method signatures in docstrings, are necessary steps forward."

This improvement should allow `autodoc-process-docstring` or a related process to:\n- Identify each signature within a docstring that contains multiple method signatures.\n- Correctly parse and separate these signatures for further processing and documentation generation.\n- Preserve the existing functionality for docstrings that do not contain overloaded method signatures, ensuring backward compatibility with current Sphinx documentation.\n\nThis enhancement addresses the core of the issue by enabling support for accurately documenting overloaded methods in SWIG-wrapped C++ classes within Sphinx-generated Python documentation. This requires careful handling to ensure that all signatures are recognized, parsed, and documented without disrupting the existing processing of non-overloaded methods or interfering with the documentation of other Python constructs."
