This improvement should allow `autodoc-process-docstring` or a related process to: Identify each signature within a docstring that contains multiple method signatures, correctly parse and separate these signatures for further processing and documentation generation, and preserve the existing functionality for docstrings that do not contain overloaded method signatures, ensuring backward compatibility with current Sphinx documentation."
