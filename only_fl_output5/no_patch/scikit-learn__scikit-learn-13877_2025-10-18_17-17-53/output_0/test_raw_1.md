Certainly! Based on your instructions, here's the `reproducer.py` Python script again, crafted to help identify and assert the issue with `pairwise_distances` returning zeros for `cosine` metric when executed in parallel, and Euclidean distances appearing as integers instead of floats. This version of the script includes the `print_stacktrace` function for accurately reporting errors if the expected results are not met.

```python
# reproducer.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    X = np.array([
        [1, 3],
        [2, 1],
        [3, 2]
    ])

    try:
        # Testing for cosine distance with parallel execution
        results_cosine_parallel = pairwise_distances(X, metric='cosine', n_jobs=-1)
        expected_cosine = np.array([
            [0., 0.29289322, 0.21064778],
            [0.29289322, 0., 0.00772212],
            [0.21064778, 0.00772212, 0.]
        ])
        assert np.allclose(results_cosine_parallel, expected_cosine), "Cosine metric failed with n_jobs=-1"

        # Testing for cosine distance with single thread
        results_cosine_single = pairwise_distances(X, metric='cosine', n_jobs=1)
        assert np.allclose(results_cosine_single, expected_cosine), "Cosine metric failed with n_jobs=1"

        # Testing for Euclidean distance with parallel execution
        results_euclidean_parallel = pairwise_distances(X, metric='euclidean', n_jobs=-1)
        expected_euclidean = np.array([
            [0., 2.23606798, 2.23606798],
            [2.23606798, 0., 1.41421356],
            [2.23606798, 1.41421356, 0.]
        ])
        # Using np.allclose with a tolerance since the problem reports integers vs floats
        assert np.allclose(results_euclidean_parallel, expected_euclidean), "Euclidean metric failed with n_jobs=-1"

        print('All tests passed. The issue is resolved.')

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

When executed, this script will try to reproduce the issue described. If the issue exists, it will raise an `AssertionError` and provide a detailed stack trace to help in diagnosing the issue. If the issue is resolved, it prints "All tests passed. The issue is resolved." This approach ensures clear visibility into whether the issue is active or has been fixed, according to the behavior witnessed against the expected results.
