        "intended_behavior": "Ensure that the `pairwise_distances` function handles parallel computations correctly for all metrics, particularly `cosine` and `euclidean`. The aggregation of results from parallel jobs should maintain high precision and accuracy, reflecting the correct computation of distances. Specifically, for the `cosine` metric, ensure that the normalization and computation of dot products are accurately carried out across data chunks and correctly aggregated to form the final matrix. For the `euclidean` metric, ensure that the sum of squares and square root operations retain their precision during parallel computation and aggregation phases. Furthermore, any concurrency issues that might lead to data being overwritten or incorrectly aggregated should be addressed."

        "intended_behavior": "The `_parallel_pairwise` method (if it exists, inferred from the description of handling parallel computation in `pairwise_distances`) should ensure the accurate and precise aggregation of distance matrices computed in parallel. The intended behavior is to fine-tune this aggregation process to prevent any loss of information or precision, particularly when dealing with the `cosine` and `euclidean` metrics. This might involve enhancing the way intermediate results from parallel jobs are merged, ensuring that the aggregation logic faithfully represents the combined outcome of these computations without introducing zeros (for `cosine`) or converting float distances into integers (for `euclidean`) due to rounding or type conversion issues."
