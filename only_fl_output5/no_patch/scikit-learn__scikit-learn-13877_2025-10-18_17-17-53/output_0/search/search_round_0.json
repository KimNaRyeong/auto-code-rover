Using `n_jobs=1` calculates the expected results.\nUsing the metric `euclidean` returns non-zero results, but the values seem to be integers instead of floats.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances\nX = np.array([\n[1, 3],\n[2, 1],\n[3, 2]\n])\npairwise_distances(X, metric='cosine', n_jobs=-1)\n```\n#### Expected Results\n```\n[[0.         0.29289322 0.21064778]\n[0.29289322 0.         0.00772212]\n[0.21064778 0.00772212 0.        ]]\n```\n#### Actual Results\n```\n[[0 0 0]\n[0 0 0]\n[0 0 0]]\n```\n#### Details\nI executed `pairwise_distances` with different values for `metric` and `n_jobs`. The outputs were as follows:\n```\nX:\n[[1 3]\n[2 1]\n[3 2]]\nmetric=cosine, n_jobs=-1:\n[[0 0 0]\n[0 0 0]\n[0 0 0]]\nmetric=cosine, n_jobs=1:\n[[0.         0.29289322 0.21064778]\n[0.29289322 0.         0.00772212]\n[0.21064778 0.00772212 0.        ]]\nmetric=cosine, n_jobs=2:\n[[0 0 0]\n[0 0 0]\n[0 0 0]]\nmetric=euclidean, n_jobs=-1:\n[[0 2 2]\n[2 0 1]\n[2 1 0]]\nmetric=euclidean, n_jobs=1:\n[[0.         2.23606798 2.23606798]\n[2.23606798 0.         1.41421356]\n[2.23606798 1.41421356 0.        ]]\nmetric=euclidean, n_jobs=2:\n[[0 2 2]\n[2 0 1]\n[2 1 0]]\n```\n#### Versions\n```\nSystem:\npython: 3.6.7 (default, Nov 21 2018, 09:28:58)  [GCC 8.2.1 20180831]\nexecutable: /home/lennart/tool-playground/jupyter/.venv-3.6/bin/python3.6\nmachine: Linux-5.0.9-2-MANJARO-x86_64-with-arch-Manjaro-Linux\nBLAS:\nmacros: NO_ATLAS_INFO=1\nlib_dirs: /usr/lib64\ncblas_libs: cblas\nPython deps:\npip: 19.0.3\nsetuptools: 39.0.1\nsklearn: 0.21.0\nnumpy: 1.16.2\nscipy: 1.2.1\nCython: None\npandas: 0.24.1\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue in the `pairwise_distances` function related to the `cosine` metric returning zeros and `euclidean` metric resulting in integers instead of floats when executed in parallel, we should focus on investigating the implementation details of `pairwise_distances` and how parallelization is handled within. We also need to explore any relevant methods for the `cosine` and `euclidean` metrics. Given the reported behavior is dependent on `n_jobs`, it's crucial to understand how this parameter influences the computations. Here are the specific API calls we should make:\n\n1. Search for the `pairwise_distances` method to understand its parameter handling, especially `n_jobs`, and how it switches between different metrics and parallelization.\n   \n   `search_method(\"pairwise_distances\")`\n\n2. Given that the issue is likely related to how the `cosine` and `euclidean` metrics are computed in parallel, we should investigate the implementation details of these metrics within the context of `pairwise_distances`. \n\n    - Since the method might delegate to a different function for parallel processing, searching for the code snippets where `n_jobs` is used or checks for different metric types could provide insights.\n   \n    `search_code(\"n_jobs\")`\n   \n    - Additionally, since the issue might be tied to a specific code path handling parallel execution for metrics, looking for `cosine` and `euclidean` within the codebase could shed light on any special implementations or optimizations that are applied.\n   \n    `search_code(\"cosine\")`\n    `search_code(\"euclidean\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to gather a comprehensive context around the functionalities and code paths invoked when `pairwise_distances` is used with different `n_jobs` settings and metrics, which should help in diagnosing the root cause of the issue and developing an appropriate fix."
