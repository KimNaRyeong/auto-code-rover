        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to the \"TypeError: cannot pickle\" when applying the | operator to a Q object in Django, here are the necessary API calls:\n\n1. To understand how Q objects handle their operands, especially with the | operator, it's vital to look into the implementation of the Q class itself.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Q\")\n```\n\n2. Since the issue describes a problem with the `|` operator, we should look for the method responsible for this operation within the Q class. In Python, the `|` operator is implemented through the `__or__` magic method.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"__or__\", \"Q\")\n```\n\n3. The issue mentions that the problem arises when trying to use a non-pickleable object like `dict_keys` as part of a Q object. To understand how Q objects are serialized (a process that involves pickling), it would be helpful to investigate any custom pickling logic in the Q class, which typically involves the `__reduce__` method.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"__reduce__\", \"Q\")\n```\n\n4. Since there's a mention of TypeError during pickling, it might also be useful to look into any custom pickling logic related to Q objects that could be in other parts of the code, not just within the Q class.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"__reduce__\")\n```\n\n5. Finally, understanding how Q objects are constructed (especially with conditions involving `x__in`) can provide insights into how these conditions are stored and why they might cause issues during pickling.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"Q\")\n```\n\nThese API calls are aimed at getting a comprehensive understanding of the Q class, its interaction with Python's pickling mechanisms, and specifically how it handles the `|` operator and initialization that might relate to the issue described."
