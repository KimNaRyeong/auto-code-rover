        "intended_behavior": "Implement a new '__reduce__' method within the 'Q' class to handle serialization, especially for non-pickleable objects. This method should ensure that all operands within a 'Q' instance, such as 'dict_keys', are converted to a pickleable format (e.g., converting 'dict_keys' to a list) before serialization. The goal is to preserve the existing functionality while allowing 'Q' objects containing non-pickleable types to be serialized without raising a 'TypeError'. This will involve iterating over the parameters of the 'Q' object and ensuring they are in a format that can be pickled, especially focusing on maintaining logical operations integrity like '|' and '&'."

This preemptive conversion can eliminate serialization issues when using operators like '|' and '&'. This change must not affect the query building capabilities and performance of 'Q' objects under normal use cases. It should be done in a way that is transparent to the developers, preserving the existing API while safeguarding against serialization issues tied to specific data types."
