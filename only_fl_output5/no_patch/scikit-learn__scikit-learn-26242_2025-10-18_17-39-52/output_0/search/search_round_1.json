Because there are also validators in place, old code that explicitly defined `base_estimator=None` stopped working.\nA solution that fixes the deprecation is to add a possible `None` to a list allowed values in `_parameter_constraints`; I will do that in a PR.\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier\nclf = AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator=None)\nclf.fit([[1]], [0])\n```\n### Expected Results\nNo error is thrown.\n### Actual Results\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\nFile \"/Users/marko/opt/miniconda3/envs/orange310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sklearn/ensemble/_weight_boosting.py\", line 124, in fit\nself._validate_params()\nFile \"/Users/marko/opt/miniconda3/envs/orange310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sklearn/base.py\", line 600, in _validate_params\nvalidate_parameter_constraints(\nFile \"/Users/marko/opt/miniconda3/envs/orange310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sklearn/utils/_param_validation.py\", line 97, in validate_parameter_constraints\nraise InvalidParameterError(\nsklearn.utils._param_validation.InvalidParameterError: The 'base_estimator' parameter of AdaBoostClassifier must be an object implementing 'fit' and 'predict' or a str among {'deprecated'}.

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. AdaBoostClassifier Implementation\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThis part of the code provides the definition for the `AdaBoostClassifier` class, including its constructor (`__init__` method) and various other methods responsible for its behavior. The constructor shows that the `estimator` parameter is the new parameter meant to replace `base_estimator`, which is now deprecated and defaults to \"deprecated\". This suggests the class is in a transition phase from using `base_estimator` to `estimator`.\n\n**What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\nThe bug is directly related to this transition phase. The issue arises when `base_estimator=None` is passed by the user, which is a case not properly handled in the current deprecation strategy. The constructor does indicate handling for deprecation (`base_estimator=\"deprecated\"`) but does not specify what happens when `base_estimator=None`.\n\n**What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\nThe intended behavior would likely involve accepting `base_estimator=None` seamlessly, mirroring the behavior before the parameter was deprecated. This would entail either redirecting `base_estimator=None` to `estimator=None` or explicitly handling the `None` value within the deprecation mechanism to prevent the exception from being raised.\n\n#### 2. Lack of _validate_params Method in AdaBoostClassifier\n\nGiven that `_validate_params` could not be found directly within `AdaBoostClassifier`, this suggests that parameter validation may be inherited or performed in a more generic way that is not exclusive to `AdaBoostClassifier`. This method, or its functionality, could be part of base class methods or handled through another mechanism, possibly through the mentioned `validate_parameter_constraints` function.\n\n#### 3. validate_parameter_constraints\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n\nAlthough the detailed content of these snippets was not provided, the mention of `validate_parameter_constraints` in both `sklearn/base.py` and `sklearn/utils/_param_validation.py` indicates it's a utility function or method likely used across multiple estimator classes in scikit-learn for parameter validation. \n\n**What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\nThe bug's stack trace mentioned `validate_parameter_constraints`, indicating that the exception is thrown from within this validation logic. This function is likely where the check fails for `base_estimator=None`.\n\n**What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior should likely allow `None` as a permissible value for `base_estimator` during the deprecation period, ensuring backward compatibility for code that explicitly sets `base_estimator=None`. \n\n### Next Steps for Further Context\n\nGiven the analysis, additional steps to get more context could involve:\n\n- Investigating `validate_parameter_constraints` in more detail to understand its validation rules and how they're applied to `AdaBoostClassifier`. Specifically, looking into how it validates that a parameter must be an object implementing 'fit' and 'predict' could reveal insights into handling `None` values.\n  \n  - `search_method_in_file(\"validate_parameter_constraints\", \"sklearn/utils/_param_validation.py\")`\n  - `search_method_in_file(\"validate_parameter_constraints\", \"sklearn/base.py\")`\n\n- Understanding how `base_estimator=None` is being treated as it transitions through the constructor to parameter validation. Since `_validate_params` was not found directly in `AdaBoostClassifier`, checking parent classes or base class implementations for parameter validation might be necessary.\n\n  - `search_method(\"BaseWeightBoosting\")` \u2013 To see if `_validate_params` or similar validation logic exists in the base class.\n\nThese steps will help in framing a comprehensive solution that respects the deprecating mechanism while ensuring backward compatibility."

Presently, setting `base_estimator=None` isn't correctly processed under the deprecation strategy. The intended behavior would allow users to set `base_estimator=None` without encountering validation errors. This could be managed by adding a check at the start of the `__init__` method (or within the deprecation handling logic) that treats `base_estimator=None` equivalently to not setting `base_estimator` at all or directly mapping it to the new `estimator` parameter as `None`. Additionally, documentation and deprecation warnings should be updated accordingly to inform users about the correct usage and the deprecation plan.\n\n   - **Location 2:**\n     - **File:** Likely within `sklearn/utils/_param_validation.py` or `sklearn/base.py`\n     - **Method:** Likely within how `validate_parameter_constraints` is called or defined\n     - **Intended Behavior:** To solve the issue, wherever `validate_parameter_constraints` is applied to `AdaBoostClassifier`'s parameters, the validation logic should be updated to handle `None` as a valid value for `base_estimator` during its deprecation period. The code should explicitly allow `None` for `base_estimator` without throwing a validation exception if the parameter is in a deprecation phase. The validation logic should include a conditional check to see if `base_estimator` is deprecated, and if so, allow `None` as a valid value alongside any current checks for `fit` and `predict` methods (or the 'deprecated' string). This exception should be clearly documented in the code to aid future maintainers.\n\n**Note:** The exact modifications for these locations depend on further inspection of `validate_parameter_constraints` and any related validation logic, which would reveal how to best integrate the handling of `None` for a deprecated parameter."
