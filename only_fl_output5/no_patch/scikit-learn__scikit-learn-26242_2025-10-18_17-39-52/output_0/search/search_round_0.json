        "content": "<issue>AdaBoost: deprecation of \"base_estimator\" does not handle \"base_estimator=None\" setting properly\n### Describe the bug\nScikit-learn 1.2 deprecated `AdaBoostClassifier` 's `base_estimator` in favour of `estimator` (see #23819). Because there are also validators in place, old code that explicitly defined `base_estimator=None` stopped working.\nA solution that fixes the deprecation is to add a possible `None` to a list allowed values in `_parameter_constraints`; I will do that in a PR.\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier\nclf = AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator=None)\nclf.fit([[1]], [0])\n```\n### Expected Results\nNo error is thrown.\n### Actual Results\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\nFile \"/Users/marko/opt/miniconda3/envs/orange310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sklearn/ensemble/_weight_boosting.py\", line 124, in fit\nself._validate_params()\nFile \"/Users/marko/opt/miniconda3/envs/orange310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sklearn/base.py\", line 600, in _validate_params\nvalidate_parameter_constraints(\nFile \"/Users/marko/opt/miniconda3/envs/orange310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sklearn/utils/_param_validation.py\", line 97, in validate_parameter_constraints\nraise InvalidParameterError(\nsklearn.utils._param_validation.InvalidParameterError: The 'base_estimator' parameter of AdaBoostClassifier must be an object implementing 'fit' and 'predict' or a str among {'deprecated'}.

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather context around the key components and functionality mentioned in the bug report. Specifically, we are looking at the AdaBoostClassifier class, how it handles its `base_estimator` parameter, especially in light of the recent deprecation in favor of the `estimator` parameter, and the validation logic that causes the exception when `base_estimator=None` is passed. \n\nLet's break down the necessary API calls into focused areas:\n\n1. **AdaBoostClassifier Implementation**: Understanding how `AdaBoostClassifier` is implemented, especially the parts where `base_estimator` and potentially the new `estimator` parameter are handled.\n\n2. **Parameter Validation Logic**: Given the traceback, it's clear that the parameter validation happens in `_validate_params`, which is likely a method within `AdaBoostClassifier` or in its parent classes, and the actual validation call taking place in `validate_parameter_constraints` from `_param_validation.py`. \n\n3. **Deprecation Handling**: The issue mentions a deprecation which has introduced a bug, suggesting that there's specific code attempting to manage backward compatibility or provide deprecation warnings that might not be handling `None` correctly.\n\nBased on these areas, the following API calls will help us gather the necessary context to resolve the issue:\n\n- search_class(\"AdaBoostClassifier\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"_validate_params\", \"AdaBoostClassifier\")\n- search_code(\"validate_parameter_constraints\")\n- search_code(\"`base_estimator` parameter of AdaBoostClassifier\")\n\nThese calls aim to gather a comprehensive understanding of how `AdaBoostClassifier` is structured, specifically regarding parameter handling and validation, and where the deprecation of `base_estimator` is addressed in the code."
