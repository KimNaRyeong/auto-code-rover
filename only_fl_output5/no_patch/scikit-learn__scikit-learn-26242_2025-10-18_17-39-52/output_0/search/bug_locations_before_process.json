Presently, setting `base_estimator=None` isn't correctly processed under the deprecation strategy. The intended behavior would allow users to set `base_estimator=None` without encountering validation errors. This could be managed by adding a check at the start of the `__init__` method (or within the deprecation handling logic) that treats `base_estimator=None` equivalently to not setting `base_estimator` at all or directly mapping it to the new `estimator` parameter as `None`. Additionally, documentation and deprecation warnings should be updated accordingly to inform users about the correct usage and the deprecation plan."

        "intended_behavior": "To solve the issue, wherever `validate_parameter_constraints` is applied to `AdaBoostClassifier`'s parameters, the validation logic should be updated to handle `None` as a valid value for `base_estimator` during its deprecation period. The code should explicitly allow `None` for `base_estimator` without throwing a validation exception if the parameter is in a deprecation phase. The validation logic should include a conditional check to see if `base_estimator` is deprecated, and if so, allow `None` as a valid value alongside any current checks for `fit` and `predict` methods (or the 'deprecated' string). This exception should be clearly documented in the code to aid future maintainers."
