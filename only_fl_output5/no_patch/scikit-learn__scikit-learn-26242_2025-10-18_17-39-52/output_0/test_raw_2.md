Based on your request, here's a Python script designed to run in your environment and check specifically for the issue regarding `AdaBoostClassifier` with `base_estimator=None`. This script will raise an `AssertionError` if it encounters the issue, printing the traceback with the `print_stacktrace` function provided:

```python
# reproducerer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_adaboost_base_estimator_none_issue():
    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
    try:
        clf = AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator=None)
        clf.fit([[1]], [0])
        print("No error, the issue with 'base_estimator=None' is presumably fixed.")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    issue_fixed = check_adaboost_base_estimator_none_issue()
    if not issue_fixed:
        raise AssertionError("Detected the issue with 'base_estimator=None' in AdaBoostClassifier.")
```

To use this script, you would save it as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project and execute it with Python 3. The logic in the script attempts to instantiate an `AdaBoostClassifier` with `base_estimator=None` and fit it with some dummy data. If this process raises an exception, the script catches this exception and prints a detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. If there's no exception, it prints a message indicating that no error occurred, suggesting that the issue might have been fixed.

This should help you verify the presence of the issue with AdaBoost's handling of `base_estimator=None` and provide clear output to assist in debugging or reporting the issue further.
