I understand you are looking for a revised version of the Python script named `reproducer.py` that will adhere to your request to capture a specific error, print its stack trace as defined, and handle assertions related to the encountered issue. However, it seems there was a misunderstanding about the actual cause of the issue you faced. What you experienced was not directly related to the originally described issue about `AdaBoostClassifier` but an import error due to Scikit-learn not being properly installed or built in the environment where the script was run. 

Given that, and focusing strictly on the described `AdaBoostClassifier` issue about handling `base_estimator=None` correctly, the revised script below checks for this specific issue and handles exceptions as requested:

```python
# reproducer.py
def main():
    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
    try:
        # Attempts to create AdaBoostClassifier with base_estimator set to None
        clf = AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator=None)
        clf.fit([[1]], [0])
        # If no errors, it's assumed the issue is fixed
        print("No error, issue is fixed.")
    except Exception as e:
        # If an exception is caught, prints the formatted stacktrace
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Raising AssertionError to indicate the presence of the issue
        raise AssertionError("Issue is present") from e

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script specifically checks whether the issue regarding `AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator=None)` raising an unexpected error has been addressed or not. If the initialization and fitting of the classifier do not raise an error, it's assumed that the issue is fixed, otherwise, the script will raise an `AssertionError` indicating the problem exists and prints the stack trace of the exception for debugging purposes.

Remember, this script is intended to be run in an environment where Scikit-learn is properly installed or built, which seemed to be the root cause of the failure in your last attempt. Ensure your environment is correctly set up and that the correct version of Scikit-learn is installed before running this script again.
