        "intended_behavior": "The method `get_supported_language_variant` should be modified to correctly handle language codes that include both a language variation (e.g., `zh-Hant`) and a regional designation (e.g., `HK` in `zh-Hant-HK`). Specifically, when presented with a specific language code that includes a script and region (like `zh-Hant-HK`), the method should prioritize this specific language code over its more generic variant (`zh-hans` or `zh-hant`) if both are present in the `settings.LANGUAGES`. The preservation of existing functionality is crucial, meaning the method still needs to perform its current function of selecting the best match for the provided language code from the list of available languages. This includes handling fallbacks and generic language codes as it currently does but with added logic to properly assess and prioritize language codes that offer a more precise match due to the inclusion of regional codes."
