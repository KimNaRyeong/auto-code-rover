        "intended_behavior": "This method should be modified so that if `T_cmb` is not explicitly provided, instead of directly using `Planck15.Tcmb0`, it should use the temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background (`Tcmb0`) from the current default cosmology, similar to how `H0` is dynamically fetched in `with_H0`. This would involve importing the default cosmology similarly (`from .. import cosmology`) and then accessing `T_cmb` using `cosmology.default_cosmology.get().Tcmb0`. This change ensures consistency in using default cosmologies across different equivalencies while preserving the functionality of determining thermodynamic temperature equivalencies using a standardized cosmological background temperature."

        "intended_behavior": "No change is necessary for this method based on the current issue. It already dynamically fetches `H0` from the current default cosmology, aligning with the suggested approach for uniformity. However, it is referenced here for clarity regarding the comparison to `thermodynamic_temperature` and its alignment with the issue's resolution goals. The method correctly uses `cosmology.default_cosmology.get().H0`, demonstrating the intended dynamic approach for accessing default cosmological parameters."
