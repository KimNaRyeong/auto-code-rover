        "intended_behavior": "The `symbols` function should be adjusted to correctly handle inputs when the `cls` argument is specified and ensures that tuple inputs are properly deconstructed and used to create instances of the specified class (e.g., `Function`) rather than defaulting to `Symbol`. The modification should ensure that the function distinguishes between single and multiple symbol requests, particularly when dealing with tuple inputs or otherwise structured inputs that are meant to result in multiple function instances. This likely involves refining the logic that interprets the tuple structure of the input in relation to the `cls` argument, ensuring that tuple inputs can seamlessly result in the creation of multiple instances of the specified class without incorrectly falling back to creating `Symbol` instances. This fix should be carefully integrated into the existing function logic to avoid disrupting the current behavior for cases where the `cls` argument is not used or where inputs do not involve additional layers of parentheses, thereby preserving the function's flexibility and utility for a wide range of symbolic math needs. Specifically, the parsing and instantiation logic around line 743 and onwards, where symbols are instantiated based on the `cls` argument, should be examined. Additional logic may be required here to properly handle cases where the input is a tuple meant to specify multiple instances of a class designated by `cls`."
