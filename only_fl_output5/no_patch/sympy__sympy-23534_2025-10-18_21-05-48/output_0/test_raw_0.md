```python
import sympy as smp

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    q, u = smp.symbols(('q:2', 'u:2'), cls=smp.Function)
    # Check if the type of q[0] is not what's expected
    assert isinstance(q[0], smp.core.function.UndefinedFunction), f"Type of q[0] is {type(q[0])}, expected sympy.core.function.UndefinedFunction"

except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise e
```

Please note that the script above checks for the type of `q[0]` against `smp.core.function.UndefinedFunction`. However, since `q[0]` and `u[0]` created by `symbols` are supposed to return instances of the `Function` class when correctly working, and `UndefinedFunction` is more specifically what one might expect as a type from using `cls=smp.Function`, the comparison in the `assert` statement might require adjustment based on the exact class hierarchy in SymPy and the anticipated behavior. The provided script directly follows the description as written, ensuring that an `AssertionError` is raised with the expected output when the issue described occurs.
