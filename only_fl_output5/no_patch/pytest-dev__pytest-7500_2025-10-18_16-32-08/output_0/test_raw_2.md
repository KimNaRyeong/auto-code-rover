Creating a Python script that purposefully triggers a `PermissionError` when Python attempts to delete directories (as described in the *pytest* issue) can be challenging due to the unpredictable nature of file system locks and the specific conditions under which Windows might refuse deletion of a file or directory. However, understanding that the issue arises from timing and permission issues when *pytest* tries to cleanup temporary directories, we can attempt to artificially create a scenario where such an issue is likely to occur. 

Please note, the success of reproducing the issue might still depend on the specifics of your environment and the current load on your system, as well as the precise timing of file operations. The following script intentionally creates and locks a file in a temporary directory to mimic the condition where Windows might prevent the deletion of the directory, hence raising a `PermissionError`.

```python
import os
import shutil
import tempfile
import threading

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def lock_file_in_temp_dir(base_temp_dir):
    """Create and 'lock' a file in a temporary directory to simulate permission error."""
    temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp(dir=base_temp_dir)
    locked_file_path = os.path.join(temp_dir, "locked_file.txt")
    # Simulate a lock by opening a file and keeping it open in a separate thread
    def file_locker(path):
        with open(path, "w") as f:
            f.write("This file is locked")
            f.flush()
            # Wait for an external event to close the file, simulating a lock
            os.path.os.wait()
    threading.Thread(target=file_locker, args=(locked_file_path,), daemon=True).start()

def cleanup_temp_directories(base_temp_dir):
    """Attempt to cleanup, expecting a PermissionError."""
    try:
        shutil.rmtree(base_temp_dir)
        print("Cleanup succeeded unexpectedly.")
        exit(1)
    except PermissionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("Caught expected PermissionError. Test successful.")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    base_temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    try:
        lock_file_in_temp_dir(base_temp_dir)
        # Introduce a short delay to ensure the file locker thread has started
        import time
        time.sleep(1)
        cleanup_temp_directories(base_temp_dir)
    finally:
        shutil.rmtree(base_temp_dir, ignore_errors=True)
```

This script attempts to mimic the situation where a file within a temporary directory is being used or locked at the time Python attempts its deletion, triggering a `PermissionError`. It involves creating a temporary directory, intentionally 'locking' a file by opening it in a separate thread without closing it, and then attempting to delete the entire directory.

Remember, due to the inherent race conditions and the specifics of the file system and OS behavior, this script may not reliably reproduce the issue on all systems or under all conditions. It's tailored to create a scenario similar to the one described, aiming to trigger the same error under controlled conditions.
