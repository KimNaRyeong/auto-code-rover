Certainly! Below is a standalone Python script aimed at reproducing the described `PermissionError` issue when *pytest* tries to clean up temporary directories under certain conditions on Windows. This script mimics the scenario by creating and then attempting to clean up temporary directories in a similar manner to *pytest*'s cleanup process. 

Note: This reproducer attempts to simulate the described behavior as closely as possible based on the information provided. However, direct interaction with *pytest* and its cleanup mechanism might involve more intricate details not captured here.

```python
import os
import tempfile
import shutil
import time

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_temp_directories(base_temp_dir, num_dirs=5):
    for _ in range(num_dirs):
        temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp(dir=base_temp_dir)
        temp_file_path = os.path.join(temp_dir, "temp_file.txt")
        with open(temp_file_path, 'w') as temp_file:
            temp_file.write("This is a temporary file.")

def simulate_pytest_cleanup(base_temp_dir):
    """

    """
    dirs_to_delete = sorted([os.path.join(base_temp_dir, d) for d in os.listdir(base_temp_dir) if
                             os.path.isdir(os.path.join(base_temp_dir, d))],
                            key=os.path.getmtime)[:-3]  # Keep the latest three by skipping them
    for dir_path in dirs_to_delete:
        try:
            shutil.rmtree(dir_path)
        except PermissionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("Caught PermissionError during cleanup simulation")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    base_temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()

    # Trying to ensure the base temp directory is somewhat populated
    create_temp_directories(base_temp_dir, 5)
    time.sleep(1)  # Small delay to simulate test run duration before cleanup

    try:
        simulate_pytest_cleanup(base_temp_dir)
    except AssertionError:
        exit(1)  # Exit with error if the issue is present

    print("Cleanup simulation completed without issues.")
    shutil.rmtree(base_temp_dir)  # Clean up the base temp directory after simulation
    exit(0)  # Exit code 0 when issue is fixed or not encountered
```

This script creates temporary directories within a base temporary directory, attempting to mimic the condition where *pytest* needs to clean up older directories after running tests. It then tries to simulate the cleanup process based on your description, aiming to reproduce the `PermissionError`. If the problem occurs, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints the stack trace of the issue using the provided `print_stacktrace` function.
