Given the requirement to closely mimic the *pytest* issue and to potentially reproduce the environment where the `PermissionError` arises during cleanup, below is a more specific approach. This script will create a similar condition by heavily using a temporary directory creation and deletion pattern in a loop, which is more likely to trigger file system timing issues similar to those described.

```python
import os
import tempfile
import shutil
import threading
import time

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_temp_directories(base_temp_dir, count=100):
    """Simulate *pytest* temporary directory creation under load."""
    for _ in range(count):
        temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp(dir=base_temp_dir)
        # Simulate file creation within temp directory
        with open(os.path.join(temp_dir, "temp_file.txt"), 'w') as f:
            f.write("Some content.")

def cleanup_temp_directories(base_temp_dir, expect_error=False):
    """Attempt to cleanup, mirroring the reported issue scenario."""
    try:
        for entry in os.listdir(base_temp_dir):
            full_path = os.path.join(base_temp_dir, entry)
            if os.path.isdir(full_path):
                shutil.rmtree(full_path)
    except PermissionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        if expect_error:
            raise AssertionError("PermissionError encountered during cleanup.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    base_temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()

    # Running directory creation in a background thread to simulate test environment load.
    t = threading.Thread(target=create_temp_directories, args=(base_temp_dir, 100))
    t.start()

    # Wait for thread to complete to ensure directories have been created.
    t.join()

    # Introduce a brief delay to emulate the cleanup timing issue.
    time.sleep(1)

    try:
        cleanup_temp_directories(base_temp_dir, expect_error=True)
    except AssertionError as e:
        # Cleanup to ensure no leftover directories in case of failure.
        shutil.rmtree(base_temp_dir, ignore_errors=True)
        exit(1)
    
    shutil.rmtree(base_temp_dir, ignore_errors=True)  # Cleanup after successful run.
    print("Test completed without encountering PermissionError.")
    exit(0)
```

This script attempts to closely reflect the situation where *pytest* would be running tests and generating temporary directories under 'heavy' load, based on the description provided in the issue. To emulate load and possible timing-related aspects that might influence the cleanup phase, it employs:

- Temporary directory creation in a loop.
- Threaded execution to simulate concurrent operations possibly affecting the file system.
- A delay before cleanup, aiming to increase the chance of reproducing the issue.

By adapting this pattern, we're attempting to force a condition where the file system has not yet fully released file handles or directory locks before the cleanup phase attempts to remove these directories, thereby increasing the likelihood of encountering `PermissionError`.
