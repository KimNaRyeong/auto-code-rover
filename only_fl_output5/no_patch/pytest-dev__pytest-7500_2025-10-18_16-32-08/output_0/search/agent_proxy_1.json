Currently, it first attempts to clean up directories based on cleanup candidates determined by age and requirement (numbered directories) and thereafter addresses directories prefixed with \"garbage-\". The suggested change is to reverse this order, first handling the clean-up of \"garbage-\" prefixed directories before moving on to cleanup candidates. This change aims to reduce the likelihood of encountering a `PermissionError` by potentially allowing more time for the file system to release locks or other holds on resources that are part of cleanup candidate directories. This preserves existing functionality by maintaining the cleanup logic and the conditions under which directories are selected for cleanup but changes the sequence to minimize chances of encountering permission errors during cleanup.\n\n- **Location 2**: File: src/_pytest/pathlib.py, Method: try_cleanup\n    - **Intended Behavior**: While the core functionality of `try_cleanup` seems sound, scrutinizing its mechanism\u2014or the mechanisms of methods it depends on, like `ensure_deletable`\u2014for determining whether a directory is safe to delete could be critical. A more nuanced approach might be required to handle edge cases where the Windows file system has not yet fully released deleted files or directories, especially under heavy load. The intended behavior would ensure `try_cleanup` either more reliably assesses a directory's readiness for deletion or implements a more robust retry logic that can handle intermittent `PermissionError` occurrences. This would further protect against attempting deletions on directories or files still under a lock without fundamentally changing the logic that determines deletability."
