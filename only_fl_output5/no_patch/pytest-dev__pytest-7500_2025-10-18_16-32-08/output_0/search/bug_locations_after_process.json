Currently, it first attempts to clean up directories based on cleanup candidates determined by age and requirement (numbered directories) and thereafter addresses directories prefixed with 'garbage-'. The suggested change is to reverse this order, first handling the clean-up of 'garbage-' prefixed directories before moving on to cleanup candidates. This change aims to reduce the likelihood of encountering a `PermissionError` by potentially allowing more time for the file system to release locks or other holds on resources that are part of cleanup candidate directories."

A more nuanced approach might be required to handle edge cases where the Windows file system has not yet fully released deleted files or directories, especially under heavy load. The intended behavior would ensure `try_cleanup` either more reliably assesses a directory's readiness for deletion or implements a more robust retry logic that can handle intermittent `PermissionError` occurrences."
