Below is an example of the output of a test session in which the exception arises.  The test file contains only the function `test_temp` shown in the output.  A necessary condition for the exception is that *pytest*'s base temporary directory already contains at least three temporary directories to cause *pytest* to try to clean up at least one directory.  Also, the exception occurred more often when the computer was under load.\n============================= test session starts =============================\nplatform win32 -- Python 3.7.7, pytest-5.4.3, py-1.9.0, pluggy-0.13.1\nrootdir: C:\\Users\\stan.west\\Desktop\\pytest-garbage\ncollected 1 item\ntest_temp.py F                                                           [100%]\n================================== FAILURES ===================================\n__________________________________ test_temp __________________________________\ntmp_path_factory = TempPathFactory(_given_basetemp=None, _trace=<pluggy._tracing.TagTracerSub object at 0x0000026E365FECC8>, _basetemp=None)\ndef test_temp(tmp_path_factory):\nfor _ in range(1000):\n>           tmp_path_factory.mktemp(\"temp\")\ntest_temp.py:3:\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n..\\..\\Programs\\Miniconda3-64\\envs\\pytest-garbage\\lib\\site-packages\\_pytest\\tmpdir.py:71: in mktemp\nbasename = self._ensure_relative_to_basetemp(basename)\n..\\..\\Programs\\Miniconda3-64\\envs\\pytest-garbage\\lib\\site-packages\\_pytest\\tmpdir.py:50: in _ensure_relative_to_basetemp\nif (self.getbasetemp() / basename).resolve().parent != self.getbasetemp():\n..\\..\\Programs\\Miniconda3-64\\envs\\pytest-garbage\\lib\\site-packages\\_pytest\\tmpdir.py:98: in getbasetemp\nprefix=\"pytest-\", root=rootdir, keep=3, lock_timeout=LOCK_TIMEOUT\n..\\..\\Programs\\Miniconda3-64\\envs\\pytest-garbage\\lib\\site-packages\\_pytest\\pathlib.py:344: in make_numbered_dir_with_cleanup\nconsider_lock_dead_if_created_before=consider_lock_dead_if_created_before,\n..\\..\\Programs\\Miniconda3-64\\envs\\pytest-garbage\\lib\\site-packages\\_pytest\\pathlib.py:323: in cleanup_numbered_dir\ntry_cleanup(path, consider_lock_dead_if_created_before)\n..\\..\\Programs\\Miniconda3-64\\envs\\pytest-garbage\\lib\\site-packages\\_pytest\\pathlib.py:300: in try_cleanup\nif ensure_deletable(path, consider_lock_dead_if_created_before):\n..\\..\\Programs\\Miniconda3-64\\envs\\pytest-garbage\\lib\\site-packages\\_pytest\\pathlib.py:284: in ensure_deletable\nif not lock.exists():\n..\\..\\Programs\\Miniconda3-64\\envs\\pytest-garbage\\lib\\pathlib.py:1356: in exists\nself.stat()\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nself = WindowsPath('C:/Users/stan.west/AppData/Local/Temp/pytest-of-stan.west/garbage-f1c50674-fd35-4f5b-b6c5-1ad95ba7ffa7/.lock')\ndef stat(self):\n\"\"\"\nReturn the result of the stat() system call on this path, like\nos.stat() does.\n\"\"\"\n>       return self._accessor.stat(self)\nE       PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is denied: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\stan.west\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\pytest-of-stan.west\\\\garbage-f1c50674-fd35-4f5b-b6c5-1ad95ba7ffa7\\\\.lock'\n..\\..\\Programs\\Miniconda3-64\\envs\\pytest-garbage\\lib\\pathlib.py:1178: PermissionError\n=========================== short test summary info ===========================\nFAILED test_temp.py::test_temp - PermissionError: [WinError 5] Access is deni...\n============================== 1 failed in 0.83s ==============================\nIt seems that sometimes the operating system continued to actually delete the files and directories inside an old directory even after the `cleanup_numbered_dir` function (below) completed the call in its first `for` statement to `try_cleanup`.

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to \"Cleaning up temporary directories occasionally raises PermissionError\" in a *pytest* environment, we could benefit from examining several key components in the *pytest* codebase. The issue description provides multiple entry points:\n\n1. **`cleanup_numbered_dir` function**: This function is directly implicated in the issue and is described as part of the cleanup process that might be leading to the permission errors.\n2. **`try_cleanup` function**: Mentioned as being invoked within `cleanup_numbered_dir`, it seems to be at the core of the cleanup logic, potentially interfacing with file system operations that could fail under certain conditions.\n3. **`_pytest/tmpdir.py`**: Reference to this file suggests it contains implementations directly related to the creation and cleanup of temporary directories.\n4. **`_pytest/pathlib.py`**: Another file mentioned in the traceback which seems to include definitions and utility functions used in managing paths, including the cleanup task.\n5. **Classes like `TempPathFactory`**: This is cited in the context of the testing example, and understanding its relation to the temporary path creation and cleanup may offer insights into the underlying issue.\n\nGiven these, a set of search API calls that would be most useful in gathering the needed context might include:\n\n- To understand the implementation and potential side effects of `cleanup_numbered_dir` and `try_cleanup`, especially regarding their order of operations and error handling:\n  - `search_method(\"cleanup_numbered_dir\")`\n  - `search_method(\"try_cleanup\")`\n\n- To explore relevant classes and methods within the specified files, providing direct engagement with mechanisms for path manipulation and temporary directory management:\n  - `search_class_in_file(\"TempPathFactory\", \"_pytest/tmpdir.py\")`\n  - `search_method_in_file(\"mktemp\", \"_pytest/tmpdir.py\")`\n  - `search_method_in_file(\"getbasetemp\", \"_pytest/tmpdir.py\")`\n  - `search_method_in_file(\"make_numbered_dir_with_cleanup\", \"_pytest/pathlib.py\")`\n  - `search_method_in_file(\"cleanup_numbered_dir\", \"_pytest/pathlib.py\")`\n\nThese calls should yield a comprehensive view of the components involved, highlighting interaction patterns, the temporal relationships between calls, and any specific conditions that may lead to a `PermissionError` during cleanup operations. Additionally, reviewing these methods and classes could clarify whether reversing the order of `for` statements in `cleanup_numbered_dir` is a robust solution or if a more surgical approach to error handling and directory management is needed."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results provides deep insights into how *pytest* manages temporary directories and the related components that might contribute to the issue at hand. Here\u2019s a breakdown based on the questions:\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\n- **`cleanup_numbered_dir`** (in `src/_pytest/pathlib.py`): This function is designed to clean up lock-driven numbered directories. It first gathers a list of cleanup candidates (directories that are considered no longer needed) based on a root path, a prefix, and a \"keep\" count. It attempts to clean these directories first. Then, it searches for directories that are prefixed with \"garbage-\" within the root directory and tries to clean those up as well. The purpose is to maintain a manageable number of temporary directories by removing old ones.\n\n- **`try_cleanup`** (in `src/_pytest/pathlib.py`): Attempts to clean up a specified path (directory) if it's deemed deletable. This determination is done by `ensure_deletable`, which takes into consideration certain conditions, like the age of a lock file. If the directory is deletable, `maybe_delete_a_numbered_dir` is called to proceed with deletion.\n\n- **`TempPathFactory`** (in `src/_pytest/tmpdir.py`): Represents a factory class for creating and managing temporary directories. It allows the creation of new temporary directories with a specified basename and handles them either as unique by adding a numbered suffix or directly under a basetemp if numbered is false. This class situates temporary directories under a common base directory, which can be adjusted via the `--basetemp` option.\n\n- **`mktemp` method of TempPathFactory**: Creates a new temporary directory managed by the factory. It can either make a uniquely numbered directory or a singular one based on the \"basename\" and \"numbered\" parameters. It ensures directories fall under the base temporary directory managed by the factory.\n\n- **`getbasetemp` method of TempPathFactory**: Returns the base temporary directory used by the factory. It determines the basetemp path based on initialization parameters or environment settings and ensures this directory is created or reset to a clean state.\n\n- **`make_numbered_dir_with_cleanup`** (in `src/_pytest/pathlib.py`): Creates a numbered directory with a cleanup lock while also handling the removal of old directories. It attempts to do this within a defined number of tries, and upon success, registers an atexit cleanup callback.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe bug describes a scenario where cleaning up temporary directories occasionally raises a `PermissionError`. This error is tied to the process of cleaning up old temporary directories and specifically to when the system tries to delete directories that are either currently in use or locked.\n\n- `cleanup_numbered_dir` directly interacts with the cleanup process, which is failing as per the bug report. Since it attempts to delete directories, it can run into `PermissionError` if the directories are locked or still being used.\n- `try_cleanup` is a key player in attempting the deletion process. Its call to `ensure_deletable` suggests there's a mechanism to check if a directory should be safe to delete, which could fail or misjudge under certain conditions (e.g., when files inside are locked or not fully released by the OS).\n- `TempPathFactory` and its methods (`mktemp`, `getbasetemp`) are responsible for the creation of the directories that are eventually subject to cleanup. Understanding how these directories are created and managed may reveal why some of them are not deletable at the time of cleanup.\n- `make_numbered_dir_with_cleanup` is involved in not just creation but also the registration of cleanup actions, which ties back to the issue of directory removal. This method's logic for cleanup registration might be crucial in understanding the timings of deletion attempts.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior of the involved components is to create, manage, and eventually clean up temporary directories in a way that doesn't interfere with *pytest*'s test execution or leave behind unnecessary files and directories that clutter the file system. Cleanup actions should ideally:\n\n- Only attempt to delete directories that are no longer in use, ensuring no `PermissionError` occurs from trying to delete locked or active files.\n- Be executed in a manner (or order) that reduces the likelihood of attempting to delete active or momentarily locked directories, especially under conditions where the filesystem might not immediately release deleted files or directories (as sometimes happens on Windows platforms).\n\nConsidering the problem described in the issue and the intended behavior, the suggestion to reverse the order of the `for` statements in `cleanup_numbered_dir` seems aimed at addressing the timing issue related to when cleanup actions are attempted on directories still being acted upon by the system. Reversing the order might allow the system more time to release resources associated with numbered directories by cleaning up the \"garbage-\" prefixed ones first.\n\nGiven these insights, the patch development would focus on ensuring the cleanup process respects the timing and locking constraints of the filesystem, possibly by adjusting order or method of cleanup actions to minimize errors."

Currently, it first attempts to clean up directories based on cleanup candidates determined by age and requirement (numbered directories) and thereafter addresses directories prefixed with \"garbage-\". The suggested change is to reverse this order, first handling the clean-up of \"garbage-\" prefixed directories before moving on to cleanup candidates. This change aims to reduce the likelihood of encountering a `PermissionError` by potentially allowing more time for the file system to release locks or other holds on resources that are part of cleanup candidate directories. This preserves existing functionality by maintaining the cleanup logic and the conditions under which directories are selected for cleanup but changes the sequence to minimize chances of encountering permission errors during cleanup.\n\n- **Location 2**: File: src/_pytest/pathlib.py, Method: try_cleanup\n    - **Intended Behavior**: While the core functionality of `try_cleanup` seems sound, scrutinizing its mechanism\u2014or the mechanisms of methods it depends on, like `ensure_deletable`\u2014for determining whether a directory is safe to delete could be critical. A more nuanced approach might be required to handle edge cases where the Windows file system has not yet fully released deleted files or directories, especially under heavy load. The intended behavior would ensure `try_cleanup` either more reliably assesses a directory's readiness for deletion or implements a more robust retry logic that can handle intermittent `PermissionError` occurrences. This would further protect against attempting deletions on directories or files still under a lock without fundamentally changing the logic that determines deletability."
