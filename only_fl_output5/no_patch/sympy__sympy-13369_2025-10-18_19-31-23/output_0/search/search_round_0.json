        "content": "To address the issue described, we'll need to gather more context about the methods and classes involved in computing the eigenvalues of a symbolic matrix using SymPy. Specifically, we should focus on the `.eigenvals`, `det`, and `charpoly` methods, as these are directly mentioned in the issue. Additionally, understanding how `solve` works with symbolic matrices might provide insight. We should also verify if the `Matrix` class properly handles symbolic computations, especially for the case described. Let's start by gathering information on these methods and classes:\n\n1. Search for the `Matrix` class to understand how it is implemented and if there are any known issues or special considerations for symbolic matrices.\n2. Search for the `eigenvals` method in the `Matrix` class to see how eigenvalues are computed.\n3. Search for the `charpoly` method in the `Matrix` class since the issue suggests that `roots(M.charpoly())` returns an empty dictionary, indicating a potential problem in either generating the characteristic polynomial or finding its roots.\n4. Search for `det` method usage within the `Matrix` class context to understand how the determinant is computed, as this is crucial for both the `charpoly` method and solving for eigenvalues.\n5. Finally, search for the `solve` function to understand how it successfully computes the roots when `eigenvals` fails, as it might provide clues on the underlying issue.\n\nLet's proceed with these searches:\n\n- search_class(\"Matrix\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"eigenvals\", \"Matrix\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"charpoly\", \"Matrix\")\n- search_method(\"det\")\n- search_method(\"solve\")"
