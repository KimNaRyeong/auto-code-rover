        "intended_behavior": "The corrected code should properly parse and validate extended locale codes such as 'nl-nl-x-informal', converting them into the correct format ('nl_NL-x-informal') consistent with the output of the `to_locale` method. This involves updating the validation logic to: Recognize and accept locale strings that include a script or modifier code prefixed with 'x-', following the initial language and country code. Ensure the command does not erroneously suggest an invalid locale format when encountering extended codes. Prevent the makemessages command from skipping valid directories named after the correctly translated locale code."
