        "intended_behavior": "Introduce a new command-line flag (e.g., '--skip-checks' or '--no-database-check') that, when used, prevents the execution of 'loader.check_consistent_history(connection)'. This flag should be processed in the command's argument parsing section, and its state evaluated before the 'for alias in sorted(aliases_to_check):' loop. If the flag is active, the code should bypass the block of code that includes the call to 'check_consistent_history(connection)'. This keeps the default behavior intact while providing an escape hatch for cases where database consistency checks are not feasible or desired."
