If you run makemigrations on such a machine it will fail while attempting to check the migrations consistency, which is quite annoying. The solution seems to either add a django.db.backends.dummy backend for such cases or start a database server locally.\nI'd like to add a flag to skip the consistency check in these situations, or fail gracefully if the connection to the database isn't available.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides us with insights into how the `makemigrations` command and the database consistency check, performed by `check_consistent_history`, operate within Django's framework. Let's break down what we've learned:\n\n### `makemigrations` Command Context (from `makemigrations.py`)\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n   The snippet from `makemigrations.py` shows the process of ensuring migrations consistency across the databases before creating new migrations. It initializes a `MigrationLoader`, identifies databases to check based on settings (`DATABASE_ROUTERS`), and then for each database connection (excluding \u2018django.db.backends.dummy\u2019), it looks for at least one model that should be migrated. If such models exist, `loader.check_consistent_history(connection)` is called to ensure there are no applied migrations with unapplied dependencies.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug**\n\n   The described functionality directly relates to the issue at hand. The process mandates an active database connection to check for consistency, which fails in environments without a setup database or with inaccessible databases (e.g., configurations intended for use within Docker but executed outside it). This requirement can obstruct some workflows, where developers intend to generate migrations without validating them against a particular database state.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**\n\n   Based on the issue description, the intended behavior would be to optionally bypass this consistency check, thereby allowing `makemigrations` to proceed without requiring a database connection or a successful consistency validation. This could be implemented as an additional command-line flag that, when used, skips the `loader.check_consistent_history(connection)` process.\n\n### `check_consistent_history` Context (from `loader.py`)\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n   The `check_consistent_history` method in the `MigrationLoader` class checks if there are any applied migrations that have dependencies not yet applied. It uses the `MigrationRecorder` to identify applied migrations and then verifies against the migrations graph if all dependencies of these migrations are also marked as applied. If it finds inconsistencies, it raises an `InconsistentMigrationHistory` exception.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug**\n\n   This method is the core functionality that the issue aims to conditionally bypass under certain circumstances. Since it requires an active connection to the database to retrieve the applied migrations, its execution represents the crux of the problem for scenarios described in the issue.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**\n\n   While the method's behavior is crucial for maintaining database and migrations integrity, allowing an optional skip can facilitate some development workflows, especially in initial development stages or in CI/CD pipelines where database consistency checks might be either premature or unnecessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe intended patch would involve modifying the `makemigrations` command to include a flag that conditionally bypasses calling `loader.check_consistent_history(connection)`. This involves changes to argument parsing within `makemigrations` to recognize and respect this new flag, and conditioning the invocation of `check_consistent_history` on this flag's state. This solution retains the integrity check's protective mechanism while offering flexibility for situations where it's deemed unnecessary or impracticable."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This flag should be processed in the command's argument parsing section, and its state evaluated before the `for alias in sorted(aliases_to_check):` loop. If the flag is active, the code should bypass the block of code that includes the call to `check_consistent_history(connection)`. This keeps the default behavior intact while providing an escape hatch for cases where database consistency checks are not feasible or desired.\n\nThe solution would entail adding logic around the existing call to `loader.check_consistent_history(connection)` inside the `handle` method, controlled by a newly introduced argument. It is essential that this modification does not alter the default behavior, ensuring backward compatibility for users not utilizing the new flag."
