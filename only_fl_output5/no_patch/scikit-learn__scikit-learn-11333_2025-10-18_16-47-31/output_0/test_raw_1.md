Given the constraints and requirements, I assume from your feedback that the environment setup for scikit-learn might be encountering issues unrelated to the actual script's functionality to test the `_BaseComposition._set_params` method's behavior with an empty list of estimators. Here's a revised version of `reproducer.py`, incorporating the same structure to reproduce the issue accurately. This script should correctly trigger the desired AssertionError if the bug is present in the scikit-learn environment it's run in:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_issue():
    from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
    try:
        # Attempt to set_params on an empty ColumnTransformer (no transformers)
        ColumnTransformer([]).set_params(n_jobs=2)
        # If the above line does not raise an error, the issue is fixed
        print("The issue has been fixed.")
        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating success/no error
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # If a ValueError is caught, assert failure to indicate presence of the issue
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate the issue is present
    except Exception as e:
        # In case of unexpected errors, print the stack trace and exit with code 1.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
```

This script works under the assumption that it's being run in a correctly configured Python environment where scikit-learn has been properly installed and built. Remember, issues like the `ModuleNotFoundError` encountered suggest there might be a problem with the scikit-learn installation or the Python environment setup itself. Before running this script, ensure your scikit-learn installation is functioning correctly.
