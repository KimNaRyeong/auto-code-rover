Here's a revised version of `reproducer.py`, incorporating the same structure to reproduce the issue accurately. This script should correctly trigger the desired AssertionError if the bug is present in the scikit-learn environment it's run in:\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef test_issue():\n    from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\n    try:\n        # Attempt to set_params on an empty ColumnTransformer (no transformers)\n        ColumnTransformer([]).set_params(n_jobs=2)\n        # If the above line does not raise an error, the issue is fixed\n        print(\"The issue has been fixed.\")\n        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating success/no error\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        # If a ValueError is caught, assert failure to indicate presence of the issue\n        raise AssertionError(\"The issue is present.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        test_issue()\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print(e)\n        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate the issue is present\n    except Exception as e:\n        # In case of unexpected errors, print the stack trace and exit with code 1.\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)\n```\n\nThis script works under the assumption that it's being run in a correctly configured Python environment where scikit-learn has been properly installed and built. Remember, issues like the `ModuleNotFoundError` encountered suggest there might be a problem with the scikit-learn installation or the Python environment setup itself. Before running this script, ensure your scikit-learn installation is functioning correctly."
