Based on your requirements, here is the standalone `reproducer.py` Python file designed to reproduce the specified issue within the sklearn environment. This script will attempt to utilize the `_BaseComposition._set_params` method in a scenario that is known to cause an error when there are no estimators provided. It will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue exists, else it will exit with code 0 indicating the issue is fixed or not present.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_test():
    from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
    try:
        ct = ColumnTransformer([])
        ct.set_params(n_jobs=2)
        # If no exception raised, the issue is considered as fixed
        print("No error occurred, the issue seems to be fixed.")
        exit(0)
    except ValueError as e:
        print("Reproduced the issue as expected:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is still present.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_test()
```

This file has to be placed in the root directory of the scikit-learn project and executed with Python 3. The script specifically targets the issue described, where setting parameters on a `ColumnTransformer` object with no transformers fails due to a `ValueError` caused by attempting to unpack empty lists.

When you run this script, it will attempt the operation known to fail due to the issue. If the failure occurs, the script will print the stack trace using `print_stacktrace` function to show where the error happened, finally raising an `AssertionError` to indicate the problem persists. If the script executes without any exceptions, it exits with code 0, suggesting that the issue has either been fixed or is not present in the version of scikit-learn being tested.
