        "intended_behavior": "The `_set_params` method should be modified to correctly handle scenarios where the attribute being set or modified is empty, notably the list of tuples often found in attributes like `_transformers` for classes inheriting `_BaseComposition`. The intended modification should include a conditional check before the operation that leads to the unpacking error (`zip(*getattr(self, attr))`). If the attribute is empty, the method should bypass operations that are not applicable for an empty list. This ensures that the method does not raise a `ValueError` when trying to unpack values from an empty tuple or list, thus allowing parameter updates to proceed even in the absence of any estimators. The rest of the functionality, which includes setting other specified parameters and replacing estimators when applicable, should remain unchanged to preserve existing functionality."
