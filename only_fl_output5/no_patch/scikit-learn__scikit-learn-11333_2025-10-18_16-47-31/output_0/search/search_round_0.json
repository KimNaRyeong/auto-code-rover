        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, we should focus on the mentioned classes, methods, and code snippets. Given the details from the issue, it's clear that the problem lies within `_BaseCompostion._set_params` method and its behavior when used by a `ColumnTransformer` instance with an empty list of transformers. Here's a plan for API calls to be made:\n\n1. **Class Context for `_BaseComposition`:** Since the issue mentions a problem with `_BaseCompostion._set_params`, getting the context of this class could reveal how estimators are managed and may highlight why an empty list causes an issue.\n\n2. **Method Context for `_set_params`:** Specifically, understanding how `_set_params` is implemented in the context of `_BaseComposition` will be crucial. This is directly where the error occurs, according to the stack trace.\n\n3. **Method Context in `ColumnTransformer`:** Although the issue is with `_BaseComposition`, `ColumnTransformer` is the class causing the problematic call to `_set_params`. Understanding how `ColumnTransformer` interacts with `_set_params` might uncloak how it's supposed to handle estimators, including the edge case of having none.\n\n4. **Code Context of the Error Line:** Lastly, a glance at the specific line raising the error (`zip(*getattr(self, attr))` where `attr` is `_transformers`) might shed light on assumptions made about transformers in a `ColumnTransformer`, potentially clarifying the modification needed to handle the edge case.\n\nGiven this plan, the necessary API calls are:\n\n- `search_class(\"_BaseComposition\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_set_params\", \"_BaseComposition\")`\n- `search_class(\"ColumnTransformer\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"set_params\", \"ColumnTransformer\")`\n- `search_code(\"zip(*getattr(self, attr))\")`"
