This is because MessageEncoder checks for the truthyness of extra_tags rather than checking it is not None.\nTo replicate this bug\n>>> from django.conf import settings\n>>> settings.configure() # Just to allow the following import\n>>> from django.contrib.messages.storage.base import Message\n>>> from django.contrib.messages.storage.cookie import MessageEncoder, MessageDecoder\n>>> original_message = Message(10, \"Here is a message\", extra_tags=\"\")\n>>> encoded_message = MessageEncoder().encode(original_message)\n>>> decoded_message = MessageDecoder().decode(encoded_message)\n>>> original_message.extra_tags == \"\"\nTrue\n>>> decoded_message.extra_tags is None\nTrue\nEffect of the bug in application behaviour\nThis error occurred in the wild with a template tag similar to the following:\n{% if x not in message.extra_tags %}\nWhen the message was displayed as part of a redirect, it had been serialised and deserialized which meant that extra_tags was None instead of the empty string. This caused an error.\nIt's important to note that this bug affects all of the standard API (messages.debug, messages.info etc. all have a default value of extra_tags equal to \"\").\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context leads us to several key insights into the structure and behavior of Django's messages framework, particularly how messages are serialized and deserialized, which is central to the issue described. The gathered information brings us to the following analyses:\n\n### Analysis of `Message` Class\n- **Code Location**: `django/contrib/messages/storage/base.py`\n- **Code Summary**: The `Message` class appears to have an initializer that accepts `level`, `message`, and optionally `extra_tags` parameters. It also has methods that suggest functionality related to managing message tags and comparison operations.\n- **Relation to Bug**: The `extra_tags` attribute, if initialized as an empty string, is the focal point of the issue. Correct handling of the `extra_tags=\"\"` case vs. `extra_tags=None` during the serialization/deserialization process is essential but seems to be mishandled currently.\n- **Intended Behavior**: `Message` objects should maintain the `extra_tags` attribution consistently through serialization/deserialization processes, retaining an empty string value (`\"\"`) as such, rather than converting it into `None`.\n\n### Analysis of `MessageEncoder` and `MessageDecoder` Classes\n- **Code Locations**: Both located within `django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py`\n- **Code Summary**: \n  - `MessageEncoder` derives from `json.JSONEncoder` suggesting it customizes how messages are converted into JSON format. \n  - `MessageDecoder` uses `json.JSONDecoder`, indicating it customizes the reverse process.\n- **Relation to Bug**: Since the issue occurs during serialization/deserialization with any built-in storage backend, these two classes are likely places where the erroneous conversion from an empty string to `None` occurs for `extra_tags`.\n- **Intended Behavior**: The encoder should serialize `extra_tags` in such a way that empty strings are preserved, and the decoder should accurately reconstruct the original `Message` object, maintaining the integrity of the `extra_tags` field regardless of its content.\n\n### Regarding the `encode` and `decode` Methods\nThe search for `encode` and `decode` methods returned multiple matches across the codebase, with specific mentions in the relevant `cookie.py` file for `MessageDecoder`. However, without direct snippets from these methods in the context of `MessageEncoder` and `MessageDecoder`, determining the exact implementation and potential misbehaviors in handling `extra_tags` is difficult. \n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\nTo pinpoint exactly where the described behavior (empty string converting to `None`) occurs and devise a fix, we need to directly examine the `default` method within `MessageEncoder` and the `decode` method within `MessageDecoder`. Specifically, how these methods handle the `extra_tags` attribute of a `Message` object requires scrutiny. \n\nGiven the relationship established between the problem and the parts of the code identified, the intended behavior is clear: both serialization and deserialization processes should preserve the distinction between `extra_tags` being an empty string and it being `None`. To achieve this, identifying and adjusting the conditionals or logic that currently conflates these two cases will be necessary.\n\n### Further Context Needed\nTo fully understand how `extra_tags` is handled during serialization and deserialization, and to draft a patch, reviewing the actual implementation of `default` in `MessageEncoder` and `process_messages` or `decode` in `MessageDecoder` is essential. This will illuminate how `extra_tags` is processed and where the logic needs adjustment to preserve an empty string as an empty string through the round-trip of serialization/deserialization."

        "content": "### Analysis of the `default` Method in `MessageEncoder`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\nThe `default` method in `MessageEncoder` is responsible for converting `Message` objects into a JSON-serializable format. For `Message` objects, it creates a list that includes a special key indicating it's a message, a flag for `SafeData` (presumably to handle HTML safely), the message's level, its content, and `extra_tags` if they exist. The method uses the truthiness of `obj.extra_tags` to decide whether to append `extra_tags` to the serialized message.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\nThe bug occurs because this method checks the truthiness of `obj.extra_tags` rather than explicitly checking whether it is not `None`. This leads to the exclusion of `extra_tags` from the serialized object if it's an empty string (`\"\"`), given that an empty string is considered `False` in a boolean context. Upon deserialization, there's no way to distinguish between the absence of `extra_tags` and `extra_tags` set to an empty string, leading to it defaulting to `None`.\n\n- **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\nThe intended behavior is to ensure that `extra_tags=\"\"` is explicitly serialized and preserved through the serialization process. A check should be implemented to differentiate between `None` and an empty string, thereby preserving the integrity of `extra_tags` as an empty string through serialization/deserialization. A possible adjustment could be modifying line 22 to something that explicitly checks for `None`, such as `\"if obj.extra_tags is not None:\"`.\n\n### Analysis of the `decode` Method in `MessageDecoder`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\nThe `decode` method in `MessageDecoder` decodes JSON-encoded string `s` using the parent class's `decode` method, then processes the decoded messages through `process_messages`. The extracted content doesn't provide the implementation of `process_messages`, which is where the actual reconstruction of `Message` objects likely occurs.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\nGiven that `decode` directly relates to how messages are reconstructed from serialized data, the relationship lies in how `process_messages` interprets the absence or presence of `extra_tags` in the decoded data. If `process_messages` defaults `extra_tags` to `None` when it is not found (because it was omitted during serialization for being an empty string), this would directly contribute to the observed bug.\n\n- **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\nWhile the `decode` method itself doesn't seem to be incorrect, the intended behavior looking further into `process_messages` would involve correctly handling the reconstruction of `Message` objects to preserve `extra_tags` as an empty string if it was such before serialization. This would likely involve adjusting the logic in `process_messages` to interpret the serialized data correctly.\n\n### Conclusion\nTo resolve the issue, adjustments need to be made in the `default` method of `MessageEncoder` to ensure proper serialization of `extra_tags` when it is an empty string. Furthermore, while the `decode` method does not directly exhibit a flaw based on the provided information, the subsequent handling (possibly in `process_messages`) should ensure that `extra_tags` is accurately reconstituted as an empty string, rather than defaulting to `None`, when deserialized. This comprehensive approach will preserve the integrity of `extra_tags` through the serialization/deserialization cycle."

This could be done by replacing the check on line 22 from `if obj.extra_tags:` to `if obj.extra_tags is not None:`. This modification ensures that `extra_tags` is preserved as `\"\"` (an empty string) during serialization, thereby allowing it to be accurately represented and distinguished from `None`.\n\n- There does not seem to be a need to modify the `decode` method within `MessageDecoder` based on the provided code snippets. However, ensuring the `process_messages` method (which wasn't fully shown in the results) and any relevant deserialization logic accurately retains or reconstructs `extra_tags` when it's intentionally an empty string might need attention. The detailed modification would depend on how `process_messages` interprets the serialized data, but specific corrections cannot be confidently proposed without the method's implementation details. The described intended behavior assumes the primary issue lies within the serialization logic in `MessageEncoder.default`, where making the suggested adjustment provides a clear path to resolving the described bug."
