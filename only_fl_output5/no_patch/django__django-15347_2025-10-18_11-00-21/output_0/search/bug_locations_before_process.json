This could be done by replacing the check on line 22 from `if obj.extra_tags:` to `if obj.extra_tags is not None:`. This modification ensures that `extra_tags` is preserved as `\"\"` (an empty string) during serialization, thereby allowing it to be accurately represented and distinguished from `None`."
