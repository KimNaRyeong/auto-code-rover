This is because MessageEncoder checks for the truthyness of extra_tags rather than checking it is not None.\nTo replicate this bug\n>>> from django.conf import settings\n>>> settings.configure() # Just to allow the following import\n>>> from django.contrib.messages.storage.base import Message\n>>> from django.contrib.messages.storage.cookie import MessageEncoder, MessageDecoder\n>>> original_message = Message(10, \"Here is a message\", extra_tags=\"\")\n>>> encoded_message = MessageEncoder().encode(original_message)\n>>> decoded_message = MessageDecoder().decode(encoded_message)\n>>> original_message.extra_tags == \"\"\nTrue\n>>> decoded_message.extra_tags is None\nTrue\nEffect of the bug in application behaviour\nThis error occurred in the wild with a template tag similar to the following:\n{% if x not in message.extra_tags %}\nWhen the message was displayed as part of a redirect, it had been serialised and deserialized which meant that extra_tags was None instead of the empty string. This caused an error.\nIt's important to note that this bug affects all of the standard API (messages.debug, messages.info etc. all have a default value of extra_tags equal to \"\").\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context leads us to several key insights into the structure and behavior of Django's messages framework, particularly how messages are serialized and deserialized, which is central to the issue described. The gathered information brings us to the following analyses:\n\n### Analysis of `Message` Class\n- **Code Location**: `django/contrib/messages/storage/base.py`\n- **Code Summary**: The `Message` class appears to have an initializer that accepts `level`, `message`, and optionally `extra_tags` parameters. It also has methods that suggest functionality related to managing message tags and comparison operations.\n- **Relation to Bug**: The `extra_tags` attribute, if initialized as an empty string, is the focal point of the issue. Correct handling of the `extra_tags=\"\"` case vs. `extra_tags=None` during the serialization/deserialization process is essential but seems to be mishandled currently.\n- **Intended Behavior**: `Message` objects should maintain the `extra_tags` attribution consistently through serialization/deserialization processes, retaining an empty string value (`\"\"`) as such, rather than converting it into `None`.\n\n### Analysis of `MessageEncoder` and `MessageDecoder` Classes\n- **Code Locations**: Both located within `django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py`\n- **Code Summary**: \n  - `MessageEncoder` derives from `json.JSONEncoder` suggesting it customizes how messages are converted into JSON format. \n  - `MessageDecoder` uses `json.JSONDecoder`, indicating it customizes the reverse process.\n- **Relation to Bug**: Since the issue occurs during serialization/deserialization with any built-in storage backend, these two classes are likely places where the erroneous conversion from an empty string to `None` occurs for `extra_tags`.\n- **Intended Behavior**: The encoder should serialize `extra_tags` in such a way that empty strings are preserved, and the decoder should accurately reconstruct the original `Message` object, maintaining the integrity of the `extra_tags` field regardless of its content.\n\n### Regarding the `encode` and `decode` Methods\nThe search for `encode` and `decode` methods returned multiple matches across the codebase, with specific mentions in the relevant `cookie.py` file for `MessageDecoder`. However, without direct snippets from these methods in the context of `MessageEncoder` and `MessageDecoder`, determining the exact implementation and potential misbehaviors in handling `extra_tags` is difficult. \n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\nTo pinpoint exactly where the described behavior (empty string converting to `None`) occurs and devise a fix, we need to directly examine the `default` method within `MessageEncoder` and the `decode` method within `MessageDecoder`. Specifically, how these methods handle the `extra_tags` attribute of a `Message` object requires scrutiny. \n\nGiven the relationship established between the problem and the parts of the code identified, the intended behavior is clear: both serialization and deserialization processes should preserve the distinction between `extra_tags` being an empty string and it being `None`. To achieve this, identifying and adjusting the conditionals or logic that currently conflates these two cases will be necessary.\n\n### Further Context Needed\nTo fully understand how `extra_tags` is handled during serialization and deserialization, and to draft a patch, reviewing the actual implementation of `default` in `MessageEncoder` and `process_messages` or `decode` in `MessageDecoder` is essential. This will illuminate how `extra_tags` is processed and where the logic needs adjustment to preserve an empty string as an empty string through the round-trip of serialization/deserialization."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

        "content": "1. To effectively address the areas highlighted in our analysis, further context is indeed necessary. Specifically, we need to examine the implementation details of the `default` method within the `MessageEncoder` class and the `decode` method within the `MessageDecoder` class to understand how they handle the `extra_tags` field during serialization and deserialization. The following API calls are proposed to obtain this context:\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"default\", \"MessageEncoder\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"decode\", \"MessageDecoder\")`\n\n2. Based on the preliminary analysis and understanding of where the bug likely resides, the potential bug locations and their intended behaviors are as follows:\n\n   - **Bug Location 1**:\n     - **File**: `django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py`\n     - **Class**: `MessageEncoder`\n     - **Method**: `default`\n     - **Intended Behavior**: This method should explicitly check if `extra_tags` is an empty string and ensure that it is serialized in a manner that preserves this value instead of allowing it to default to `None` or be interpreted as `False` in a boolean context. The adjusted serialization logic should accurately differentiate between `None` and an empty string, ensuring that an empty string is serialized distinctly and can be reconstructed as such.\n\n   - **Bug Location 2**:\n     - **File**: `django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py`\n     - **Class**: `MessageDecoder`\n     - **Method**: `decode`\n     - **Intended Behavior**: The decoding process should include logic to accurately interpret serialized data such that if an `extra_tags` value was an empty string at the time of encoding, it is reconstructed as an empty string (`\"\"`) rather than `None`. This may involve adjusting how `extra_tags` is initially represented in the serialized data or modifying the conditional logic that interprets this data upon deserialization.\n\nThese adjustments will ensure the framework accurately handles the case where `extra_tags=\"\"`, preserving message integrity through serialization and deserialization processes while maintaining compatibility with existing functionality that relies on distinguishing between an empty string and `None`."
