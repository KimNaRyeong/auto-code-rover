Ensure there are no error-category issues - this can be achieved by looking at the exit code\n2. Ensure the overall linting score doesn't deteriorate too much - this can be achieved by using `--fail-under=8`\nHowever if `--fail-under` is used, and the score is above that, then it passes even if there are error-category issues detected. Essentially it's acting as a \"only throw fail (non-zero) codes if under this\", instead of a \"fail if under this, otherwise change nothing\".\nTwo possible solutions I can think of here are:\n1. Have a configuration option to prevent `--fail-under` from consuming other exit statuses. I.e. a way to say \"if score is under N, return error code X, regardless of all else, otherwise change nothing\".\n2. Add a new option like `--fail-on=E,unused-import` which means that if there are any `E*` code (error-category) issues, or any `unused-error` issues, then fail, otherwise change nothing.\n</issue>"

From the description, we understand that the `--fail-under` option is already implemented, and we need to either adjust its behavior or add a new option that allows failing based on specific issue types.\n\nLet's break down the steps necessary to gather sufficient context for resolving the issue:\n\n1. **Find where the `--fail-under` functionality is implemented**: This would likely be handled in a method that processes CLI arguments or calculates the lint score to decide whether to exit with a non-zero status.\n\n2. **Identify how lint issues are categorized and stored after linting**: Since the suggestion involves failing based on specific issue types (e.g., error category issues like `E*` or specific issues such as `unused-import`), we need to understand how these issues are represented and accessed in the code.\n\n3. **Understand the existing logic for deciding the exit code**: It's important to see the current mechanism that decides the exit code, especially under the influence of the `--fail-under` option.\n\nGiven these requirements, specific API calls are needed to locate the relevant parts of the codebase:\n\n- To address step 1, we need to search for the method that processes the `--fail-under` option or handles the exit code decision based on lint scores. This method is likely part of a class that deals with CLI argument processing or lint result evaluation.\n\n- For step 2, searching for how issues are categorized (e.g., finding classes or methods related to issue management) will be important. This will help understand the structure of error categories and individual issues.\n\n- Step 3 requires looking at the logic currently employed for exiting with an error code. This might involve both direct searches for exit logic and more specific searches within classes or methods identified in steps 1 and 2.\n\nGiven these considerations, these are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_method(\"parse_args\")`\n2. `search_method(\"calculate_score\")`\n3. `search_class(\"Reporter\")`\n4. `search_code(\"--fail-under\")`\n\nThese calls aim to uncover the parts of code that are most likely involved with handling exit codes based on linting results, including how the command-line options are parsed, how the score is calculated, and how reporting is managed."

Without direct hits on the method names, class names, or the specific `--fail-under` code snippet, we need to adjust our strategy to find the mechanisms related to linting score calculation, command-line argument parsing, and how the project categorizes and handles linting issues and exit codes.\n\n### Adjusted Strategy\n\nSince our initial approach did not yield results, here's an adjusted plan to gather the required context:\n1. **Broaden the search for argument parsing**: The specific method name `parse_args` may not be used. However, every CLI-based application will have some mechanism to parse arguments. Let's look for any file or code snippets related to CLI argument handling more generally.\n\n2. **Look for score calculation in a broader sense**: Instead of looking for a method explicitly named `calculate_score`, search for anything related to \"score\" or \"rating\" in the codebase. There might be functions or methods responsible for calculating or managing scores without explicitly having \"calculate\" in their name.\n\n3. **Find error handling or exit code logic**: The application must have some centralized way of determining when to exit and what exit code to use. This might not be exclusively connected to linting score or specific issues but should provide insight into how the application manages exit statuses.\n\n4. **Investigate how issues or messages are categorized or managed**: Even if there wasn't a direct hit on a \"Reporter\" class, there should be some mechanism or data structure that categorizes lint issues into errors, warnings, etc.\n\nGiven the need to adjust our strategy, let's make the following API calls to collect more context using broader terms:\n\n- `search_code(\"CLI\")`: To find any code related to the command-line interface handling.\n- `search_code(\"score\")`: To unearth parts of the code that manage or reference scoring.\n- `search_code(\"exit\")`: This can provide details on how the program decides to exit with specific codes.\n- `search_code(\"issue category\")`: To get insight into how issues are categorized, which may lead us to how error categories are distinguished (like `E*` codes).\n\nThese searches are intended to be broad enough to catch relevant aspects of the project that our initial, more focused attempts missed, hopefully leading us to the areas of the code that can be adapted or extended to implement the feature described in the issue."

Unfortunately, searches for \"CLI\" and \"lint result\" did not yield direct results, but we can proceed with the information we have.\n\n### Analysis of Search Results\n\n#### 1. Code Containing `exit`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The snippets containing `exit` are likely scattered throughout various aspects of the application, including error handling, checker functionality, linter termination, and possibly command-line interface handling.\n  \n- **Relationship to the bug:**\n  These parts of the code are crucial since the issue requires the adjustment or extension of existing logic related to exiting the program based on lint results. Specifically, the `pylint/lint/run.py` file with 27 matches suggests significant involvement with program execution logic, which is a key area for implementing the `--fail-on` feature.\n  \n- **Intended behavior:**\n  The intended behavior would involve ensuring that the application can interpret new command-line arguments to determine exit codes based on specific linting issue types or categories found. For example, allowing the program to exit with a non-zero code if specified issue types are detected, irrespective of the `--fail-under` behavior. This would likely involve modifications in how the exit codes are determined, integrating new logic to check for specified issues before deciding the exit code.\n\n#### 2. Code Containing `configuration option`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  These code parts deal with the configuration options of pylint, likely defining, parsing, and applying various settings specified by the user through command-line arguments or configuration files.\n  \n- **Relationship to the bug:**\n  This directly relates to the enhancement, as the introduction of the `--fail-on` feature requires adjustments or additions to how configuration options are handled, including parsing and applying these settings as part of the linting process.\n  \n- **Intended behavior:**\n  The intended behavior here is to effectively parse and integrate the `--fail-on` option within the linter\u2019s configuration management systems. This includes recognizing the new option, parsing its values (e.g., error category codes or specific issue identifiers), and applying this configuration to influence the linting process and exit code decisions.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nGiven the connections to the existing functionality and the requirements for the new feature, the next steps would involve looking deeper into the specific files identified, particularly `pylint/lint/run.py` for implementing the `--fail-on` logic and files related to configuration options for parsing and applying the `--fail-on` setting.\n\nTo get more context on how to proceed, especially for incorporating the new feature's logic, the following API calls could be insightful:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"parse_args\", \"pylint/lint/run.py\")`: To check how command-line arguments are currently parsed and where the new argument could be integrated.\n- `get_code_around_line(\"pylint/lint/run.py\", [line_number], 10)`: For specified line numbers where `exit` occurs, to understand how it currently decides on exit codes.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"--rcfile\", \"pylint/lint/run.py\")`: To understand how configuration options are handled, which can provide clues on integrating `--fail-on`."
