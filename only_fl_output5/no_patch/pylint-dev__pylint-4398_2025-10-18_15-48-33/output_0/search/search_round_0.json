Ensure there are no error-category issues - this can be achieved by looking at the exit code\n2. Ensure the overall linting score doesn't deteriorate too much - this can be achieved by using `--fail-under=8`\nHowever if `--fail-under` is used, and the score is above that, then it passes even if there are error-category issues detected. Essentially it's acting as a \"only throw fail (non-zero) codes if under this\", instead of a \"fail if under this, otherwise change nothing\".\nTwo possible solutions I can think of here are:\n1. Have a configuration option to prevent `--fail-under` from consuming other exit statuses. I.e. a way to say \"if score is under N, return error code X, regardless of all else, otherwise change nothing\".\n2. Add a new option like `--fail-on=E,unused-import` which means that if there are any `E*` code (error-category) issues, or any `unused-error` issues, then fail, otherwise change nothing.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we should first find the relevant parts of the codebase that handle the existing functionality related to exiting with error codes based on linting results and score thresholds. From the description, we understand that the `--fail-under` option is already implemented, and we need to either adjust its behavior or add a new option that allows failing based on specific issue types.\n\nLet's break down the steps necessary to gather sufficient context for resolving the issue:\n\n1. **Find where the `--fail-under` functionality is implemented**: This would likely be handled in a method that processes CLI arguments or calculates the lint score to decide whether to exit with a non-zero status.\n\n2. **Identify how lint issues are categorized and stored after linting**: Since the suggestion involves failing based on specific issue types (e.g., error category issues like `E*` or specific issues such as `unused-import`), we need to understand how these issues are represented and accessed in the code.\n\n3. **Understand the existing logic for deciding the exit code**: It's important to see the current mechanism that decides the exit code, especially under the influence of the `--fail-under` option.\n\nGiven these requirements, specific API calls are needed to locate the relevant parts of the codebase:\n\n- To address step 1, we need to search for the method that processes the `--fail-under` option or handles the exit code decision based on lint scores. This method is likely part of a class that deals with CLI argument processing or lint result evaluation.\n\n- For step 2, searching for how issues are categorized (e.g., finding classes or methods related to issue management) will be important. This will help understand the structure of error categories and individual issues.\n\n- Step 3 requires looking at the logic currently employed for exiting with an error code. This might involve both direct searches for exit logic and more specific searches within classes or methods identified in steps 1 and 2.\n\nGiven these considerations, these are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_method(\"parse_args\")`\n2. `search_method(\"calculate_score\")`\n3. `search_class(\"Reporter\")`\n4. `search_code(\"--fail-under\")`\n\nThese calls aim to uncover the parts of code that are most likely involved with handling exit codes based on linting results, including how the command-line options are parsed, how the score is calculated, and how reporting is managed."
