This method should ensure that even if the `--fail-under` score is met or exceeded, the presence of any issues specified by `--fail-on` will still result in a failure. This requires carefully integrating checks against the list of detected issues before the final exit code is decided, ensuring it does not interfere with other exit logic unless the specific conditions for `--fail-on` are met."

This includes assessing whether any of the issues detected match the types or specific issues flagged by the `--fail-on` option and ensuring that such detection overrides any pass condition implied by a score above the `--fail-under` threshold. It should preserve existing functionality around scoring while adding the new conditional check."
