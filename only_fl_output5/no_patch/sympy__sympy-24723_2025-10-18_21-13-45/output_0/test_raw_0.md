To create a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that reproduces the reported issue with the probability density function (PDF) of the Matrix Normal Distribution in SymPy, and checks for the discrepancy in the constant of the PDF, you can use the following script:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_matrix_normal_pdf():
    from sympy import MatrixSymbol, pi, simplify, exp
    from sympy.stats import density, MatrixNormal

    # Define the matrix normal distribution as per the issue
    M = MatrixNormal('M', [[1, 2]], [1], [[1, 0], [0, 1]])
    X = MatrixSymbol('X', 1, 2)

    # Get the density
    pdf_expr = density(M)(X).doit()

    # Asserting the expected PDF form, adjusting for the constant difference
    expected_pdf_expr = exp(-1/2 * ((X - [[1, 2]]).T * (X - [[1, 2]])).doit()[0]) / (2 * pi)

    # Simplify both expressions to check for equality
    if not simplify(pdf_expr - expected_pdf_expr) == 0:
        raise AssertionError("The PDF does not match the expected expression.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_matrix_normal_pdf()
        print("Test passed, no issue found with the PDF constant.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e
```

This script defines a function to test the density function of the Matrix Normal Distribution against what is expected based on the Wikipedia equation provided, adjusted for the difference in constants. If the issue is present, it should raise an `AssertionError` and provide a stack trace showing where the problem occurs. When the issue is fixed (i.e., the constant in the PDF is corrected), the script will exit with a message indicating no issues were found, and exit with code 0.
