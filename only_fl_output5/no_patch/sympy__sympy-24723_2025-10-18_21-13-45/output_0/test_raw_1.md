Given the error and the requirements, here is a revised version of `reproducer.py` that takes into account the correct operand types for matrix operations in SymPy and aims to accurately reproduce and detect the described issue regarding the probability density function (PDF) of the Matrix Normal Distribution:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_matrix_normal_pdf():
    from sympy import Matrix, pi, simplify, exp
    from sympy.stats import density, MatrixNormal
    from sympy.abc import x, y

    # Define a MatrixSymbol, a mean matrix, and covariance matrices
    X = Matrix([[x, y]])
    M = MatrixNormal('M', Matrix([[1, 2]]), Matrix([[1]]), Matrix([[1, 0], [0, 1]]))

    # Get the density
    pdf_expr = density(M)(X).doit()

    # Defined manually the expression of the expected PDF based on the description.
    # Note: Adjusting the formulation to match the provided expected form
    expected_expr_components = -((X - Matrix([[1, 2]])).T*(X - Matrix([[1, 2]])))
    expected_expr = exp(expected_expr_components[0, 0]/2) / (2*pi)

    # Simplify both expressions to check for equality
    if not simplify(pdf_expr - expected_expr) == 0:
        raise AssertionError("The PDF does not match the expected expression.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_matrix_normal_pdf()
        print("Test passed, no issue found with the PDF constant.")
    except Exception as e:  # Catching a generic exception to handle all types including AssertionError
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Ensure to exit with non-zero when the test fails to indicate error
    exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 when issue is fixed
```

In this corrected version, the script correctly handles matrix subtraction by ensuring that operations are performed on compatible SymPy `Matrix` objects instead of using a combination of `MatrixSymbol` and lists. This should correctly reproduce the issue and validate against the expected correct behavior. The correct usage and checking methodology will print a stack trace if there's an `AssertionError` indicating a discrepancy in the PDF's constant factor as described.
