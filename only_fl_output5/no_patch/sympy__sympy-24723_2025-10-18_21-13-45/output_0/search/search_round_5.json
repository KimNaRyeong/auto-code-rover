The error seems to be related to the PDF's constant term, suggesting that the implementation of the PDF, possibly within a method or class related to matrix statistical distributions, may have an error.\n\nGiven the information in the issue description, we can outline a series of steps to find the necessary code context:\n1. Since the issue mentions using `MatrixNormal` from `sympy.stats`, we should start by searching for the `MatrixNormal` class.\n2. Following finding the class, it's likely we'll need to find where the PDF is calculated. This could be in a method specifically for calculating the PDF, or it could be part of a more general method that gets overridden in the `MatrixNormal` class.\n3.

Since the problem involves the PDF's final expression and specifically its constant term, searching for relevant code snippets related to PDF calculation or displaying might also be helpful.\n\nTherefore, the necessary API calls based on the steps above are:\n- `search_class(\"MatrixNormal\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"density\", \"MatrixNormal\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"MatrixNormal\")`"

To proceed, we should consider alternate strategies for locating the relevant portions of the codebase that deal with the Matrix Normal Distribution and its probability density function (PDF). Here are some alternative approaches:\n\n1. **Search for Related Classes or Methods:** If `MatrixNormal` isn't the direct name or not found due to some indexing issue, it might be beneficial to search for classes and methods broadly related to statistical distributions or probability density functions. This could include parent classes, utility functions, or interfaces that `MatrixNormal` might extend or utilize.\n\n2. **Search by Method Name:** Specific methods like `density` that handle the PDF calculation across different statistical distributions might be part of a base class or a utility module. \n\n3. **Search by Code Snippet:** Given the specific nature of the bug (related to the constant term in the PDF), searching for code snippets that relate to that calculation could yield relevant sections of the codebase. This could include mathematical expressions similar to those mentioned in the issue.\n\n4. **Broaden the Search for Initialization:** Since `__init__` might be too broad or not specific enough to catch distribution initialization, searching for broader statistical initialization methods may help.\n\nGiven these insights, I will reframe my approach with broader or alternate search strategies:\n\n- `search_method(\"density\")`: This could help find where the PDFs are calculated for various distributions if there is a shared method or a pattern in naming these methods.\n- `search_code(\"probability density function\")`: Looking for comments or code snippets that explicitly mention the PDF could lead to the relevant sections, assuming that developers have documented the code with such terms."

Given this, the files identified could contain:\n1. Base classes or utilities used by `MatrixNormal` for PDF calculation, even though `MatrixNormal` itself wasn't directly found.\n2. Implementation details of how PDFs are generally handled in Sympy for statistical distributions, which could hint at where the error in the constant term arises.\n\n### Intended Behavior of the Code:\nBased on the issue description, the intended behavior is for the PDF of the Matrix Normal Distribution to align with the mathematical definition, specifically including the correct constant term in the formula. This means:\n- The implementation must accurately calculate the PDF, reflecting the correct constant term as shown in the mathematical formula from Wikipedia.\n- Any class related to `MatrixNormal` distribution should correctly instantiate or calculate the PDF, ensuring the constant term is not mistakenly doubled or misrepresented.\n\nGiven these insights, further investigation should focus on the implementation within `random_matrix_models.py` for any methods related to PDF calculation or distribution initialization. Moreover, examining how `density` is applied in this context, and verifying the correct application of mathematical formulas in `MatrixNormal`'s PDF computation, would be crucial."

This outcome leads us to reflect on our search strategy and consider alternative approaches or broader searches to locate where SymPy handles matrix-valued distributions, particularly the Matrix Normal Distribution.\n\n### Reflecting on the Strategy:\n\n- **Alternative Naming or Modular Organization:** The structure of SymPy's codebase suggests that implementations of statistical distributions could either be modular, abstracted into base classes, or named differently than their mathematical counterparts. This requires a more nuanced understanding of the codebase organization.\n- **Broader Search for Statistical Distributions:** Since `MatrixNormal` wasn't found directly, it might be beneficial to broaden the search to look at how SymPy implements statistical distributions in general, particularly those that are matrix-valued.\n\n### Revised Strategy for More Context:\n\nGiven the information we have now, a logical next step is to broaden our search to better understand where and how SymPy could implement matrix distributions, given that the specific search for `MatrixNormal` was unfruitful.\n\n### New API Calls:\n\n- **Searching for Matrix Distributions Broadly:** Since \"MatrixNormal\" wasn't found, it's possible it might be grouped or implemented with other matrix distributions or under a different naming convention within Sympy.\n\n- **Reviewing Parent Classes or Utilities for Statistical Distributions:** Understanding how distributions are generally handled in SymPy could give clues about where specific implementations, like matrix-valued distributions, are located.\n  \nTherefore, without additional search capabilities specified here, our next steps would involve manually reviewing SymPy's documentation or codebase, particularly focusing on the stats module's organization and how distributions, especially those involving matrices, are structured. This could involve looking into base classes for distributions, utility functions for statistical computations, or even broader terms that might encapsulate the logic for matrix distributions.\n\n### Intended Outcome:\n\nThe aim is to locate the part of the code that implements the PDF for the Matrix Normal Distribution correctly. Unfortunately, without the ability to make further API calls that could help in this analysis, the next steps rely on manual investigation into SymPy's statistics module, looking for matrix-related distributions, and understanding their implementation to accurately pinpoint where the bug relating to the PDF's constant term might reside."

Specifically:\n\n- **Correct Constant Term Calculation:** The code responsible for determining the constant term in the PDF calculation should accurately reflect the mathematical formula. This involves ensuring that the constant term is `\\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{nk/2}}` where `n` and `k` are dimensions of the matrix, rather than any incorrect variation of this term.\n- **Accuracy in Exponential Term:** Besides the constant term correction, it's crucial that the exponential term inside the PDF calculations correctly computes based on the given matrices and their dimensions.
