        "content": "To address the issue related to the Matrix Normal Distribution's probability density function (PDF), we'll need to gather more context about how this PDF is implemented in the Sympy library. The error seems to be related to the PDF's constant term, suggesting that the implementation of the PDF, possibly within a method or class related to matrix statistical distributions, may have an error.\n\nGiven the information in the issue description, we can outline a series of steps to find the necessary code context:\n1. Since the issue mentions using `MatrixNormal` from `sympy.stats`, we should start by searching for the `MatrixNormal` class.\n2. Following finding the class, it's likely we'll need to find where the PDF is calculated. This could be in a method specifically for calculating the PDF, or it could be part of a more general method that gets overridden in the `MatrixNormal` class.\n3. We should also look for any methods related to initializing the distribution, as the constants for the PDF might be incorrectly set or calculated there.\n4. Since the problem involves the PDF's final expression and specifically its constant term, searching for relevant code snippets related to PDF calculation or displaying might also be helpful.\n\nTherefore, the necessary API calls based on the steps above are:\n- `search_class(\"MatrixNormal\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"density\", \"MatrixNormal\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"MatrixNormal\")`"
