        "intended_behavior": "The method in the `MatrixNormal` class that calculates the PDF should be corrected to ensure that the constant term in the formula aligns with the mathematical standard for the Matrix Normal Distribution. Specifically, the corrected implementation should ensure that the constant term is calculated as per the formula given in the issue description, which is `\\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{nk/2}}` for a matrix of dimension `n x k`, rather than any incorrect variation of this term. This includes careful handling of the determinant of the covariance matrix in the denominator and the trace operation in the exponent of the e-function within the PDF formula. The correction should be applied in a way that does not negatively impact other functionalities provided by the `MatrixNormal` class, ensuring that the class remains fully functional for other uses, such as sampling and parameter checks. This means preserving the overall structure and logic of the PDF computation while adjusting the specific part of the formula that is incorrect. In addition to the PDF formula correction, tests or validations should be reviewed or added to confirm that the PDF calculation now matches the expected mathematical definition, thus ensuring the bug is resolved and similar issues are prevented in the future."
