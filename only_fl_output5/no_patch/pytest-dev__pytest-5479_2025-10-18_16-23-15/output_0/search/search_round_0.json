        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue related to Unicode match assertions failing with `pytest.raises` under Python 2 due to a `UnicodeEncodeError`, we should focus on understanding how `pytest.raises` and the assertion mechanism are implemented within the pytest framework. Specifically, we need to investigate:\n\n- How `pytest.raises` is implemented to understand why it might not handle Unicode exceptions correctly in Python 2.\n- The mechanism that formats or encodes the exception messages to identify where the encoding issue arises.\n- Whether there's a specific part of the pytest codebase that deals with exception message handling that might need adjustment for Unicode support in Python 2.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n1. **Search for the `pytest.raises` implementation**: It could either be a method in a class or a standalone function within the pytest framework. Our goal here is to understand how it's supposed to catch and handle exceptions.\n    ```python\n    search_method(\"raises\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Search for code related to exception message handling**: Since the issue arises when an exception message includes Unicode characters, pinpointing how pytest deals with encoding these messages will be critical.\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"UnicodeEncodeError\")\n    ```\n\n3. **Search for any utility or helper function that might be involved in encoding or matching exception messages**: These functions could play a crucial role in modifying or checking exception messages that contain Unicode characters.\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"encode\")\n    search_code(\"match\")\n    ```\n\nThese calls are focused on finding the relevant parts of the pytest codebase that could contribute to the issue, thereby providing a comprehensive overview of where changes might be needed to address the Unicode encoding problem in Python 2 environments."
