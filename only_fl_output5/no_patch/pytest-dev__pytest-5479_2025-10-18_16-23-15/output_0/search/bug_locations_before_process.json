        "intended_behavior": "This method should be modified to ensure Unicode string compatibility, particularly when handling the match parameter under Python 2 environments. The modification must preserve the existing functionality for Python 3 users while introducing a reliable way to encode or decode Unicode exception messages before matching them against the pattern provided in the match parameter. A potential approach could involve conditionally encoding the exception message and the match pattern to a common encoding (e.g., 'utf-8') under Python 2 before attempting to match them. This ensures that the UnicodeEncodeError is avoided, and the function's existing functionality is preserved across different Python versions."
