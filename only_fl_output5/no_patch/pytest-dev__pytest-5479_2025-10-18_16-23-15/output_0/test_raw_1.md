Given the updated context and requirements, it seems there was confusion in the initial solution provided, especially around the testing framework usage and the explicit error handling. To accurately capture and address the original issue (which involves handling Unicode with pytest assertions in a Python 2 context but executed as Python 3 code), we will adjust the code accordingly. However, the issue described originates from a Python 2 context, while the expectation now is to create a Python 3 compatible script. Since the original error (`UnicodeEncodeError`) is specific to Python 2's handling of Unicode and not directly replicable in Python 3 due to its improved Unicode support, here's a revised Python 3-compatible script that simulates the testing scenario, with an adjusted expectation based on your requirements:

Please note: Since Python 3's handling of Unicode differs fundamentally from Python 2's, the specific `UnicodeEncodeError` cannot be reproduced under Python 3 when using pytest in the described manner. Instead, this script checks for the attribute and attempts to catch any AssertionError, while printing a stack trace for any caught exceptions.

```python
# reproducer.py

import traceback
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_u():
    try:
        assert False, u"\u2603"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Exit with code 0 to indicate that the script ran successfully and the output is as expected
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_u()
```

This script will attempt to run a simple assertion that is expected to fail and catch the `AssertionError`. Upon catching the error, it will print the stack trace using the `print_stacktrace` function provided. It exits with code 0 if the script runs to completion, indicating that while the original issue as it pertains to Python 2 cannot be reproduced in a Python 3 environment, any similar exception handling within a Python 3 context works as intended.
