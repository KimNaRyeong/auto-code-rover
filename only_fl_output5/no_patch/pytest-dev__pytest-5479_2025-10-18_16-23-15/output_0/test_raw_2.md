Under the revised requirements, the goal is to craft a script that simulates the context in which the original issue occurs, checks for its presence, and handles the output appropriately. Given the specific nature of the request, it seems there is a misunderstanding in reproducing the exact Python 2 issue within a Python 3 environment directly, specifically dealing with `pytest.raises` and Unicode match assertions. 

Python 3's handling of Unicode is inherently different and more robust than Python 2, making the original `UnicodeEncodeError` unlikely to occur in this context. However, I will provide a Python 3 script meant to simulate the environment as closely as possible, despite the potential limitations in replicating Python 2-specific behavior precisely.

Given these constraints, remember the original issue's reproduction in Python 3 may not exactly match due to the differences in Unicode handling and exception management between Python 2 and 3. Nevertheless, this script will simulate the test case context and the use of `pytest`'s `raises` method with a focus on match assertions. The script will use the `print_stacktrace` function as requested to handle and display any exceptions that occur.

```python
# reproducerer.py

import pytest
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_u():
    try:
        with pytest.raises(AssertionError, match=u"\u2603"):
            assert False, u"\u2603"
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating the issue was not reproduced as originally described.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_u()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exiting with code 1 to indicate an unhandled exception occurred during the test execution.
```

This script attempts to follow the instructions and the provided format closely. It's crafted to be run in a Python 3 environment and uses `pytest` for asserting exceptions with specific messages, capturing any exceptions using the provided `print_stacktrace` function for detailed error logging.

Please note, the script assumes `pytest` is installed and functioning within your Python 3 environment. The actual behavior and output might differ from the original issue reported under Python 2 due to the inherent differences between Python 2 and 3, particularly regarding string encoding and exception handling.
