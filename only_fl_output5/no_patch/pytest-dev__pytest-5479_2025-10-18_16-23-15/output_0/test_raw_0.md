This standalone Python file should reproduce the issue when executed with Python 2 and pytest by trying to match a unicode character in the test assertion. However, the script is written to run with Python 3, and due to the provided instructions, it will print a stack trace if an error occurs but exit with code 0 to indicate a successful execution and that the original specific issue (related to Python 2's Unicode handling and pytest) has been addressed or is not applicable. Remember, you'd need to have 'pytest' installed in your Python environment to run this script, and the script assumes Python 3 based on the execution command you've provided. The handling of unicode characters in assertions and the `pytest.raises` context differs significantly between Python 2 and Python 3, largely due to Python 3's more comprehensive and integrated support for Unicode.
