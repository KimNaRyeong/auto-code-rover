This method should dynamically construct a `Piecewise` expression based on the `Min` function's arguments. For a `Min` instance with two arguments, `a` and `b`, the method would produce `Piecewise((a, a<b), (b, True))`, indicating that the minimum value between `a` and `b` would be `a` if `a` is less than `b`, otherwise `b`. The method should handle an arbitrary number of arguments by constructing the appropriate conditionals within the `Piecewise` expression."

        "method": "rewrite",
        "intended_behavior": "Similar to `Min`, implement a new `rewrite` method for the `Max` class that transforms an instance of `Max` into a `Piecewise` function. The method should create a `Piecewise` expression that reflects the logic of the `Max` operation: for two arguments `a` and `b`, it would produce `Piecewise((a, a>b), (b, True))`. This method must also support a variable number of arguments, establishing conditions for each to maintain the semantics of the maximum operation in piecewise terms."
