        "content": "<issue>Avoid passing NULL to the IN lookup\nDescription\nCurrently prefetch_related on a FK passes the NULL through to the database for e.g. author_id IN (NULL, 2). Passing NULL is always unnecessary, since it's not allowed in FK's. There's a small risk from passing NULL that it could lead to incorrect with complex prefetch querysets using PK refs because of NULL's weirdness in SQL.\nFor example with these models:\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Author(models.Model):\npass\nclass Book(models.Model):\nauthor = models.ForeignKey(Author, null=True, on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING)\nPrefetching authors on Books, when at least one Book has author=None, uses IN (..., NULL, ...) in the query:\nIn [1]: from example.core.models import Author, Book\nIn [2]: a1 = Author.objects.create()\nIn [3]: Book.objects.create(author=a1)\nOut[3]: <Book: Book object (3)>\nIn [4]: Book.objects.create(author=None)\nOut[4]: <Book: Book object (4)>\nIn [5]: Book.objects.prefetch_related('author')\nOut[5]: <QuerySet [<Book: Book object (3)>, <Book: Book object (4)>]>\nIn [6]: from django.db import connection\nIn [7]: connection.queries\nOut[7]:\n[{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_author\" (\"id\") VALUES (NULL)', 'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_book\" (\"author_id\") VALUES (2)', 'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_book\" (\"author_id\") VALUES (NULL)',\n'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"core_book\".\"id\", \"core_book\".\"author_id\" FROM \"core_book\" LIMIT 21',\n'time': '0.000'},\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"core_author\".\"id\" FROM \"core_author\" WHERE \"core_author\".\"id\" IN (NULL, 2)',\n'time': '0.000'}]\nMaybe this could generally be extended to use of __in with non-nullable fields?\n</issue>"

        "content": "To investigate this issue, we need to collect more context about how `prefetch_related` is implemented for ForeignKey (FK) fields, especially how it constructs the `IN` part of the SQL query that includes `NULL`. The classes involved are likely `ForeignKey` (standard in models) and possibly methods related to `prefetch_related`. Let's start by gathering information on the implementation details of these components in the Django ORM.\n\n1. Search for the ForeignKey class definition to understand its properties and any relevant methods:\n   - `search_class(\"ForeignKey\")`\n\n2. Search for the implementation of `prefetch_related` to see how it prepares the SQL query, especially how it handles `NULL` values in FK fields:\n   - `search_method(\"prefetch_related\")`\n\n3. Since the issue specifically mentions that the NULL is passed through to the database in an `IN` clause, we need to look for the part of the code that constructs this query. We suspect it might be in the query construction or compilation process, so initially, we can look for methods responsible for generating `SELECT` statements or handling `__in` lookups:\n   - `search_method(\"build_filter\")`\n   - `search_method(\"get_filtered_relations\")`\n\nThese API calls will help gather sufficient context around ForeignKey handling, prefetch_related mechanics, and SQL query construction within the Django ORM framework. Once we have this information, we can better understand where and how to adjust the code to prevent NULL values from being unnecessarily included in `IN` clauses for non-nullable FK fields."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insights into how the Django ORM and specifically, how ForeignKey and query building mechanisms work. Here\u2019s a breakdown based on the questions:\n\n### ForeignKey Class in `django/db/models/fields/related.py`\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `ForeignKey` class represents a database Foreign Key relationship defined in a Django model. It inherits from `ForeignObject` and enables defining a many-to-one relationship between models. It contains methods for initialization, validation, preparing values for database operations, and contributing to the related class, among other responsibilities.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - While the `ForeignKey` class definition itself does not directly manipulate query construction, it is central to the issue as the bug description revolves around `ForeignKey` fields' behavior with `NULL` values during `prefetch_related` operations. The manner in which `ForeignKey` fields contribute to query construction, especially handling of `NULL` values, is relevant here.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Ideally, the `ForeignKey` class, in conjunction with the query construction logic, should ensure that `NULL` values are not unnecessarily included in `IN` clauses for non-nullable fields. This might involve filtering out `NULL` values from the list of foreign keys before query construction in related operations, such as `prefetch_related`.\n\n### build_filter Method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `build_filter` method constructs a `WhereNode` from a single filter clause without adding it directly to the current `Query` object. It supports complex filtering operations, including handling negations and deep relationships through joins. It plays a crucial role in how Django's ORM constructs the underlying SQL queries based on model queries.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - This method is key to understanding how `NULL` values might be included in `IN` clauses, as it's responsible for transforming filter expressions (like those used by `prefetch_related`) into database queries. If `NULL` values are being passed through to `IN` clauses in ways that don't make sense for the database schema (i.e., non-nullable foreign keys), then the logic in this method or how it's invoked could be relevant to addressing the bug.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - An intended improvement in this method would be to refine the logic such that it identifies when `NULL` values are part of a filter set for a non-nullable `ForeignKey` and either removes those `NULL` values from the query or optimizes the query construction to exclude unnecessary `NULL` checks. This would prevent the `author_id IN (NULL, 2)` scenario described in the issue since `NULL` is not a meaningful value for a non-nullable foreign key in SQL terms.\n\nConsidering the insights and intended behaviors highlighted during the analysis, further steps to address the issue could involve identifying the exact point(s) in `build_filter` or related query construction processes where `NULL` values are introduced into the set of keys for `IN` clauses. This may require looking into how `prefetch_related` operations construct their filter sets and interact with `build_filter`, and implementing logic to exclude `NULL` from such sets when the targeted foreign key is non-nullable."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

        "content": "1. \n\n2. \n- **Bug Location 1**: \n  - **File**: `django/db/models/sql/query.py`\n  - **Class**: `Query`\n  - **Method**: `build_filter`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: The `build_filter` method should be adapted to filter out `NULL` values when constructing queries for non-nullable `ForeignKey` fields. This involves adjusting the logic within this method to check if the query involves a non-nullable foreign key and if `NULL` is a part of the values being queried for. If both conditions are true, the method should exclude `NULL` from the generated `IN` SQL clause. This adjustment should preserve the functionality of querying nullable and non-nullable fields with `NULL` values appropriately, ensuring that `IN` clauses for non-nullable foreign keys do not include `NULL` as this is both unnecessary and could potentially lead to incorrect data retrieval due to SQL's handling of `NULL`.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**:\n  - **File**: `django/db/models/query.py`\n  - **Method**: `prefetch_related`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: While the specifics of what needs to be changed in `prefetch_related` are not explicitly detailed from our initial context collection, given the nature of the issue, it's likely that adjustments to how this method prepares its queries for execution might be needed. Specifically, before executing a prefetch operation that results in a query like `author_id IN (NULL, 2)`, it should check if the field being prefetch_related on is non-nullable and filter out `NULL` values from the query list. This would prevent unnecessary `NULL` checks in the database. Detailed inspection of the method's handling and preparation of `IN` queries is required for precise modifications, which would ensure `NULL` values are only passed to the database when appropriate and align with the field's nullability."
