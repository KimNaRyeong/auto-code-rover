This involves adjusting the logic within this method to check if the query involves a non-nullable foreign key and if `NULL` is a part of the values being queried for. If both conditions are true, the method should exclude `NULL` from the generated `IN` SQL clause. This adjustment should preserve the functionality of querying nullable and non-nullable fields with `NULL` values appropriately, ensuring that `IN` clauses for non-nullable foreign keys do not include `NULL` as this is both unnecessary and could potentially lead to incorrect data retrieval due to SQL's handling of `NULL`.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**:\n  - **File**: `django/db/models/query.py`\n  - **Method**: `prefetch_related`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: While the specifics of what needs to be changed in `prefetch_related` are not explicitly detailed from our initial context collection, given the nature of the issue, it's likely that adjustments to how this method prepares its queries for execution might be needed. Specifically, before executing a prefetch operation that results in a query like `author_id IN (NULL, 2)`, it should check if the field being prefetch_related on is non-nullable and filter out `NULL` values from the query list. This would prevent unnecessary `NULL` checks in the database. Detailed inspection of the method's handling and preparation of `IN` queries is required for precise modifications, which would ensure `NULL` values are only passed to the database when appropriate and align with the field's nullability."
