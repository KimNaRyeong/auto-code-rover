        "content": "<issue>Avoid passing NULL to the IN lookup\nDescription\nCurrently prefetch_related on a FK passes the NULL through to the database for e.g. author_id IN (NULL, 2). Passing NULL is always unnecessary, since it's not allowed in FK's. There's a small risk from passing NULL that it could lead to incorrect with complex prefetch querysets using PK refs because of NULL's weirdness in SQL.\nFor example with these models:\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Author(models.Model):\npass\nclass Book(models.Model):\nauthor = models.ForeignKey(Author, null=True, on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING)\nPrefetching authors on Books, when at least one Book has author=None, uses IN (..., NULL, ...) in the query:\nIn [1]: from example.core.models import Author, Book\nIn [2]: a1 = Author.objects.create()\nIn [3]: Book.objects.create(author=a1)\nOut[3]: <Book: Book object (3)>\nIn [4]: Book.objects.create(author=None)\nOut[4]: <Book: Book object (4)>\nIn [5]: Book.objects.prefetch_related('author')\nOut[5]: <QuerySet [<Book: Book object (3)>, <Book: Book object (4)>]>\nIn [6]: from django.db import connection\nIn [7]: connection.queries\nOut[7]:\n[{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_author\" (\"id\") VALUES (NULL)', 'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_book\" (\"author_id\") VALUES (2)', 'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_book\" (\"author_id\") VALUES (NULL)',\n'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"core_book\".\"id\", \"core_book\".\"author_id\" FROM \"core_book\" LIMIT 21',\n'time': '0.000'},\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"core_author\".\"id\" FROM \"core_author\" WHERE \"core_author\".\"id\" IN (NULL, 2)',\n'time': '0.000'}]\nMaybe this could generally be extended to use of __in with non-nullable fields?\n</issue>"

        "content": "To investigate this issue, we need to collect more context about how `prefetch_related` is implemented for ForeignKey (FK) fields, especially how it constructs the `IN` part of the SQL query that includes `NULL`. The classes involved are likely `ForeignKey` (standard in models) and possibly methods related to `prefetch_related`. Let's start by gathering information on the implementation details of these components in the Django ORM.\n\n1. Search for the ForeignKey class definition to understand its properties and any relevant methods:\n   - `search_class(\"ForeignKey\")`\n\n2. Search for the implementation of `prefetch_related` to see how it prepares the SQL query, especially how it handles `NULL` values in FK fields:\n   - `search_method(\"prefetch_related\")`\n\n3. Since the issue specifically mentions that the NULL is passed through to the database in an `IN` clause, we need to look for the part of the code that constructs this query. We suspect it might be in the query construction or compilation process, so initially, we can look for methods responsible for generating `SELECT` statements or handling `__in` lookups:\n   - `search_method(\"build_filter\")`\n   - `search_method(\"get_filtered_relations\")`\n\nThese API calls will help gather sufficient context around ForeignKey handling, prefetch_related mechanics, and SQL query construction within the Django ORM framework. Once we have this information, we can better understand where and how to adjust the code to prevent NULL values from being unnecessarily included in `IN` clauses for non-nullable FK fields."
