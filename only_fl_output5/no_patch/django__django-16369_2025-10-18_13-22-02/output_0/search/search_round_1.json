        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search API calls gives us valuable information about the Sitemap class, i18n handling, and URL translation within the Django framework. Let's delve into each part:\n\n### 1. Sitemap Class (`django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py`)\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n    - The Sitemap class in Django is designed to create sitemaps according to the sitemap protocol. It offers various settings such as `limit`, `protocol`, `i18n`, `languages`, and mechanisms to generate URLs (locations) for items to be included in the sitemap. The presence of `i18n` and `languages` attributes suggests it supports internationalization in some capacity.\n- **Relationship to the bug:**\n    - The issue mentions a problem with the i18n handling in Sitemap generation, particularly the inability to selectively display items per language. The `i18n` flag and `languages` attribute in this class would be directly related to where modifications are needed to allow for more granular control over what gets included in the sitemap per language.\n- **Intended behavior:**\n    - The intended behavior should allow for specifying which items to display in the sitemap on a per-language basis, rather than showing all items for all languages or a cartesian product of items and languages. Modifications would likely involve enhancing how the `i18n`, `languages`, and item generation (`_items`, `items`) work together to allow for more specific inclusion rules based on language.\n\n### 2. i18n Handling (`django/template/context_processors.py`)\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n    - This method provides context variables related to internationalization, including available languages (`LANGUAGES`), the currently active language (`LANGUAGE_CODE`), and text direction (`LANGUAGE_BIDI`). It's part of Django's machinery for handling language preferences and serving localized content.\n- **Relationship to the bug:**\n    - While tangentially related to handling internationalization, this method itself is not directly involved in sitemap generation or the specifics of the issue. However, understanding how language context is managed in Django can be helpful when thinking about how to extend or customize the Sitemap class to conditionally include or exclude content based on language.\n- **Intended behavior:**\n    - Since this part is more about providing context rather than directly influencing sitemap content, the intended behavior relative to the issue would remain as is. Changes we're considering would not alter this mechanism but would interact with the language context it provides.\n\n### 3. URL Translation (`django/urls/base.py`)\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n    - The `translate_url` method attempts to find a translated version of a given URL for a specified language. This is part of Django's URL handling system which supports internationalization by matching URLs to their corresponding views/locale versions.\n- **Relationship to the bug:**\n    - The issue mentions that depending on the language, a URL may not exist or may raise an error. This method is crucial for translating URLs and ensuring that the correct, potentially localized URL is used for each item in the sitemap.\n- **Intended behavior:**\n    - For the sitemap, the intended behavior would involve ensuring that only URLs that exist for a given language are included, possibly by utilizing this method or similar logic within the Sitemap class to check or translate URLs based on the available languages and conditions specified for including items in the sitemap.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps would involve:\n1. **Extending the Sitemap Class**: To allow specifying which items should be displayed per language, potentially by introducing new methods or attributes that enable fine-grained control over item inclusion based on language.\n2. **Utilizing URL Translation**: Ensuring that any URL included in the sitemap for a given language is validated or translated accordingly to prevent errors or dead links.\n\nFurther exploration may be necessary to find how exactly items are selected for inclusion in the sitemap (`_items`, `items`) and to determine the best approach to modifying this logic to incorporate language-based conditions."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This could be achieved by adding a new method or attribute that developers can override or specify. For example, adding an attribute or method like `items_per_language(self, lang_code)` that returns a filtered set of items based on the passed `lang_code`. This method would be called within the already existing `get_urls` method when `i18n` is enabled, thereby preserving existing functionality while adding the new capability.\n   \n   The addition or modification here allows developers to implement logic for conditionally including items in the sitemap based on language, addressing the issue raised.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe identified bug locations and described intended behavior are crucial for resolving the issue of selectively displaying items in the sitemap based on the language, especially for instances where some content is not translated. This solution keeps the current functionality intact for situations where this level of granular control is unnecessary while providing the needed flexibility for projects with specific i18n requirements."
