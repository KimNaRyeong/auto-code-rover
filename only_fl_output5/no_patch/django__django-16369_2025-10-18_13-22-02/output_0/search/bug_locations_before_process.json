        "intended_behavior": "Modify the Sitemap class to allow filtering or specifying which items should be shown per language. This could be achieved by adding a new method or attribute that developers can override or specify. For example, adding an attribute or method like items_per_language(self, lang_code) that returns a filtered set of items based on the passed lang_code. This method would be called within the already existing get_urls method when i18n is enabled, thereby preserving existing functionality while adding the new capability."
