        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand the current implementation of the Sitemap generation, especially regarding the handling of internationalization (i18n) and how it generates a cartesian product of items and languages. It's also crucial to understand how the system currently deals with untranslated items and how URLs are managed per language. Given this, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n1. **Search for the Sitemap implementation**: We need to find where the Sitemap is generated in order to understand the current implementation and see where the changes need to be made.\n    - `search_class(\"Sitemap\")` or `search_method(\"generate_sitemap\")`\n\n2. **Understanding i18n handling**: Since the issue specifically mentions the interaction with i18n, we need to find how it's currently implemented or used within the Sitemap generation process.\n    - `search_method(\"i18n\")`\n\n3. **Identify how items and languages are currently combined**: Understanding the cartesian product generation mechanism is key to addressing the issue.\n    - `search_code(\"cartesian product\")`\n\n4. **Find how URLs are managed per language**: Since the issue points out that URLs may not exist or raise an error for some languages, understanding the URL generation or translation mechanism is essential.\n    - `search_method(\"translate_url\")`\n\nGiven the complexity of the issue, further API calls may be needed after reviewing the results of these initial queries to gather more specific code context or details related to handling untranslated items and error management for non-existing URLs."
