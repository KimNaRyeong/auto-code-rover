The inconsistency described in the issue implies that the method is either misinterpreting the polynomial's structure or incorrectly calculating the multiplicities. The correction must ensure that for any polynomial passed to `sqf_list`, it consistently decomposes it into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a factor and its correct multiplicity, without erroneously duplicating factors or misassigning their multiplicities. This includes handling edge cases that might involve unique polynomial structures or specific factors that could be causing the current inconsistency. The solution must retain all existing functionalities, such as handling various kinds of polynomial inputs and maintaining performance optimizations currently in place."
