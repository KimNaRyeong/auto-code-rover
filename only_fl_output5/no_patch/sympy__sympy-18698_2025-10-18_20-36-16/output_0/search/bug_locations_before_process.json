        "intended_behavior": "This method is intended to accurately factorize any given polynomial into a list of square-free factors, each accompanied by its correct multiplicity. The fix should guarantee that the method computes the multiplicities correctly and does not erroneously consolidate different factors or misassign their multiplicities. It should handle edge cases more effectively, ensuring that even in complex polynomial expressions, each factor's multiplicity is accurately reflected. This requires a review and possible refinement of the algorithm `_generic_factor_list` employs, specifically concerning how factors are combined and multiplicities computed."

        "method": "sqf_list",
        "intended_behavior": "In the context of `Poly` objects, this method must maintain the integrity of square-free factorization, properly managing representations to ensure that no inaccuracies in multiplicities or factor listings occur due to the internal representation (`rep`) or domain conversions. The behavior should ensure that when the `all` parameter is set to true, unit factors are correctly included without affecting the accuracy of the primary factorization\u2014particularly the multiplicities. Any discovered inconsistencies stemming from representation or conversion processes should be rectified, ensuring that the output aligns with the mathematical expectations of square-free factorization."
