This script reproduces the reported issue by comparing the output of the `sqf_list` function against the expected result. The assertion will fail, and an `AssertionError` will be raised if the output is inconsistent, indicating the presence of the issue described. The `print_stacktrace` function is used to print a detailed stack trace when an error occurs, providing clear identification of where the inconsistency arises in the script.
