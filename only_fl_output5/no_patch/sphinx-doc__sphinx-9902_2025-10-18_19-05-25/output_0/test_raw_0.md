This script attempts to reproduce the described issue by mimicking a Sphinx documentation build process, particularly focusing on the linking behavior of types specified with the `:type:` option in `.. py:data:` directives. It leverages a mock function to simulate the issue rather than integrating directly with Sphinx, due to the constraints of running in such an isolated script without the full Sphinx environment. 

In a real debugging or issue reproduction scenario, more sophisticated and environment-specific checks would be necessary, including actual Sphinx build operations and verification of documentation output. The condition checks here are placeholders to represent the logic that would be applied to determine if the issue exists based on the output generated by Sphinx's processing of documentations.
