This may involve tweaking settings such as autodoc_typehints to ensure that Sphinx's autodoc extension can handle local types without requiring them to be fully qualified. The behavior should ensure that any type mentioned in the :type: field of a .. py:data:: directive is linked correctly if it's available in the module's scope, thus enhancing the documentation's usability and readability."

If there are custom Sphinx processes or extensions added here that influence the documentation build process, they should be reviewed and possibly modified to support the correct resolution and linking of local types in the generated documentation. This might include adding custom logic to better interpret type hints or enforce the resolution of local types during the Sphinx documentation generation process."
