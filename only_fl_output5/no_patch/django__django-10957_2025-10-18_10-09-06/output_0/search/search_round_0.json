As other compatibility layers have been cleaned up, these shims can be deprecated for removal.\n</issue>"

Given the issue, I'll target the search towards occurrences of these specific functions.\n\n1. **Search for the `ugettext` function in the entire codebase:** This function is a legacy method for translating strings in Django projects. Deprecating it requires understanding where it's used directly or referenced for aliasing.\n\n   - `search_method(\"ugettext\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `ugettext_lazy` function across the project:** Similar to `ugettext`, but for lazy translations. Identifying its usage patterns is crucial before deprecation.\n\n   - `search_method(\"ugettext_lazy\")`\n\n3. **Investigate `ugettext_noop` across the codebase:** This function marks strings for translation without actually translating them. It's important to find its implementations and usages.\n\n   - `search_method(\"ugettext_noop\")`\n\n4. **Find occurrences of `ungettext`:** This is the plural version of `ugettext` and understanding its usage is necessary for a proper deprecation strategy.\n\n   - `search_method(\"ungettext\")`\n\n5. **Search for `ungettext_lazy` usages in the project:** Similar to `ungettext` but for lazy translations of plural strings.\n\n   - `search_method(\"ungettext_lazy\")`\n\n6. **Given that these methods are part of the `django.utils.translation` module, searching for code snippets that directly import or reference these functions could provide insight into potential modifications or areas that need attention during the deprecation process.**\n\n   - `search_code(\"from django.utils.translation import ugettext\")`\n   - `search_code(\"from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy\")`\n   - `search_code(\"from django.utils.translation import ugettext_noop\")`\n   - `search_code(\"from django.utils.translation import ungettext\")`\n   - `search_code(\"from django.utils.translation import ungettext_lazy\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to comprehensively understand the current status and usage of the functions slated for deprecation, allowing for informed decisions to be made regarding their removal or replacement.\n"
