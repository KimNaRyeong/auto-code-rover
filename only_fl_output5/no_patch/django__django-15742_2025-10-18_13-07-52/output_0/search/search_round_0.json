Since it is a str, it will be escaped, so control characters are escaped again, breaking their display on the final page.\nMinimal example to reproduce (can be put in any view):\nfrom django.template import Template, Context\ntemplate_content = \"\"\"\n{% blocktranslate asvar the_title %}The title is {{ title }}.{% endblocktranslate %}\n<title>{{ the_title }}</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"{{ the_title }}\">\n\"\"\"\nrendered = Template(template_content).render(Context({\"title\": \"<>& Title\"}))\nassert \"&amp;lt;\" not in rendered, \"> was escaped two times\"\nI'd argue that blocktranslate should:\nEither assign a SafeString instance to prevent future escaping\nor not escape the variables used within the translation, and store them marked as unsafe (= as str instance)\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given the issue description, it seems we need to understand how Django's `blocktranslate` template tag, specifically with the `asvar` argument, is handling the escaping of variables. To get the context required to address this issue, we'll need to locate the implementation of the `blocktranslate` tag as well as its handling of variables and the output (whether it's marked safe or not).\n\nHere are the API calls that would provide us with the necessary information:\n\n1. To find out how `blocktranslate` is implemented and potentially identify if it's part of a specific class or module, we'll start by searching where the `blocktranslate` tag is defined.\n   - `search_code(\"blocktranslate\")`\n\n2. Once we have the file or class where `blocktranslate` is implemented, we might need to look into how this tag handles the `asvar` argument specifically, so it might be beneficial to search within a specific file or class if we know where to look based on the first search. However, the exact call might depend on the results from the initial search.\n\n3. We also need to understand how escaping is handled for variables within the `blocktranslate` scope and when emitting them into the context, especially in relation with the `SafeString` class (to prevent double escaping). Thus, we need to find the definition or usage of `SafeString`.\n   - `search_class(\"SafeString\")`\n\n4. It will be useful to understand how and when the conditional escaping happens for variables marked as strings in Django templates.\n   - `search_code(\"conditionally escape\")`\n   - This is more of a conceptual search to locate the mechanism Django uses to decide whether to escape a string or not, likely part of the template rendering process.\n\nThese searches should give us a good starting point to understand the problem deeply and propose a solution."
