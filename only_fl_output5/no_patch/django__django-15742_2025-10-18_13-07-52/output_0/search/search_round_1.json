Since it is a str, it will be escaped, so control characters are escaped again, breaking their display on the final page.\nMinimal example to reproduce (can be put in any view):\nfrom django.template import Template, Context\ntemplate_content = \"\"\"\n{% blocktranslate asvar the_title %}The title is {{ title }}.{% endblocktranslate %}\n<title>{{ the_title }}</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"{{ the_title }}\">\n\"\"\"\nrendered = Template(template_content).render(Context({\"title\": \"<>& Title\"}))\nassert \"&amp;lt;\" not in rendered, \"> was escaped two times\"\nI'd argue that blocktranslate should:\nEither assign a SafeString instance to prevent future escaping\nor not escape the variables used within the translation, and store them marked as unsafe (= as str instance)\n</issue>"

To get the context required to address this issue, we'll need to locate the implementation of the `blocktranslate` tag as well as its handling of variables and the output (whether it's marked safe or not).\n\nHere are the API calls that would provide us with the necessary information:\n\n1. To find out how `blocktranslate` is implemented and potentially identify if it's part of a specific class or module, we'll start by searching where the `blocktranslate` tag is defined.\n   - `search_code(\"blocktranslate\")`\n\n2. Once we have the file or class where `blocktranslate` is implemented, we might need to look into how this tag handles the `asvar` argument specifically, so it might be beneficial to search within a specific file or class if we know where to look based on the first search. However, the exact call might depend on the results from the initial search.\n\n3.

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. django/templatetags/i18n.py\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \n    This file likely contains the implementation of the `blocktranslate` template tag, given the high number of matches found. The tag is used for translating text blocks in Django templates, potentially formatting them with variables.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**  \n    Since this file contains the implementation of the `blocktranslate` tag, it's directly related to the bug regarding double escaping when using `blocktranslate` with the `asvar` argument. The bug arises in the process of escaping variables within the `blocktranslate` block and then again when these variables are used in the template.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**  \n    The intended behavior would be for the `blocktranslate` tag to either safely mark the variable after formatting to prevent double escaping or handle variable formatting in such a way that double escaping does not occur. Specifically, it should ensure that variables used within a `blocktranslate` block that are stored with `asvar` are properly escaped once, without losing the \"was escaped\" context.\n\n#### 2. django/utils/safestring.py (SafeString)\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \n    The `SafeString` class inherits from `str` and `SafeData`, indicating it's designed to be used for strings that are marked safe from escaping in Django's template system. This class likely provides the mechanism through which strings can avoid being automatically escaped by the template engine.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**  \n    The issue might be solved by utilizing `SafeString` for variables rendered within the `blocktranslate` block and captured with `asvar`. If the `blocktranslate` tag correctly uses `SafeString` for the output, it would prevent the double escaping issue, as the template system treats instances of `SafeString` as already safe for HTML and does not escape them again.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**  \n    The `SafeString` class should allow variables to be marked as already escaped (or safe), which would be crucial for fixing the bug. Ensuring the output of `blocktranslate` is a `SafeString` when using `asvar` could resolve the problem.\n\n#### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven the analysis, the next actions should involve:\n1. **Investigating how `blocktranslate` uses `asvar`**: To understand how variables are managed within the `blocktranslate` block and identify the point at which `SafeString` should be applied or how escaping is handled. This requires looking into the implementation in `django/templatetags/i18n.py`.\n   - An appropriate API call might be: `search_method_in_file(\"blocktranslate\", \"django/templatetags/i18n.py\")`\n\n2. **Examining Django's conditional escaping mechanism**: Since the direct search for \"conditionally escape\" did not return results, understanding how Django decides to escape strings may require a more targeted approach, possibly by looking into how template rendering or variable handling is implemented.\n   - Potential API calls could include:\n     - `search_code_in_file(\"safe\", \"django/template/base.py\")`\n     - `search_code_in_file(\"escape\", \"django/utils/html.py\")`\n     - These are speculative paths based on Django's architecture; understanding where escaping logic is implemented requires knowledge of the framework's template handling or safe data mechanisms.\n\nThese steps should provide a clearer path towards crafting a patch for the bug."

When a variable is formatted within a `blocktranslate` block and stored using `asvar`, the intended behavior should ensure that the variable is marked as safe if it is already escaped. This would prevent Django's template engine from escaping it again when it is injected into the template, thereby resolving the issue of double escaping. Ideally, the code should check if the content being assigned to a variable via `asvar` is already escaped and, if so, wrap it in a `SafeString` instance before storing it. This change should preserve the current functionality of allowing dynamic content translation while ensuring proper handling of HTML characters to prevent double escaping.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**:  \n    **File**: `django/utils/safestring.py`  \n    **Intended Behavior**:  \n    Although `SafeString` itself may not be directly buggy, its interaction with the `blocktranslate` tag's handling of variables might need to be clarified in the documentation or through additional utility functions/methods that facilitate safely marking strings as safe post-translation and formatting within the `blocktranslate` context. Ensuring that `SafeString` can be correctly utilized by `blocktranslate` to mark strings as safe, thereby preventing double escaping, might require additional examples or utility functions that are explicitly designed to integrate with `blocktranslate`'s `asvar` functionality. This helps in preserving the safety of variables while preventing double escaping, maintaining the existing functionality of marking strings as safe while also considering their use in translations."
