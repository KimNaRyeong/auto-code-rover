        "intended_behavior": "The code in `sphinx/util/cfamily.py` responsible for parsing C/C++ constructs, specifically enums and their attributes, needs to be revised with the following behavior in mind:\n   - Correctly parse and ignore (or handle separately without affecting names) attributes attached to `enum` values. This ensures that the actual names of the enums are used in the documentation rather than the attributes' names.\n   - Ensure that when attributes are present, they do not interfere with the recognition of enum value names. This involves possibly extending the parsing logic to differentiate between the enum names and their optional attributes, ensuring attributes like `__attribute__((__deprecated__))` or macros that expand to such attributes are properly skipped over in the name recognition process.\n   - Prevent the generation of duplicates in the documentation due to misinterpreted enum values. This might require checking for uniqueness in the context where an attribute could lead to misunderstanding of the enum's actual identifiers.\n   - The existing functionality for parsing and documenting C/C++ code must be preserved, with additional handling for enums with attributes being the only change. This involves retaining all current capabilities for processing standard enum declarations, function declarations, variable definitions, and other typical C/C++ constructs without attributes."
