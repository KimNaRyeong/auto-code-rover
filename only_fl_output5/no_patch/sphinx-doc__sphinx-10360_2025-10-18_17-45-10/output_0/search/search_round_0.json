This enum has a deprecated value `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN`. The macro `JXL_DEPRECATED` is defined elsewhere, but it is included in `c_id_attributes` and `cpp_id_attributes`, so that shouldn't be the problem.\n```\n/** Data type for the sample values per channel per pixel.\n*/\ntypedef enum {\n/** Use 32-bit single-precision floating point values, with range 0.0-1.0\n* (within gamut, may go outside this range for wide color gamut). Floating\n* point output, either JXL_TYPE_FLOAT or JXL_TYPE_FLOAT16, is recommended\n* for HDR and wide gamut images when color profile conversion is required. */\nJXL_TYPE_FLOAT = 0,\n/** DEPRECATED: Bitpacked 1-bit. As an alternative, use JXL_TYPE_UINT8.\n*/\nJXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN JXL_DEPRECATED,\n[...]\n```\nWhen building documentation from this, it is parsing it as if the enum value is `JXL_DEPRECATED`, not `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN` as it should be. When there are two or more enum values deprecated like this, it results in `Duplicate C++ declaration`.\n### Expected behavior\nJust like attributes for function definitions, attributes for enum values should be ignored when parsing.\n### Your project\nhttps://libjxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nLinux\n### Python version\n3.9.10\n### Sphinx version\n4.5.0\n### Sphinx extensions\n_No response_\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"
