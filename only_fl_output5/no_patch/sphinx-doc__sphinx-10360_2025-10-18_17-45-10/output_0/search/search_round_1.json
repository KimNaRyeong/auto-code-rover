This enum has a deprecated value `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN`. The macro `JXL_DEPRECATED` is defined elsewhere, but it is included in `c_id_attributes` and `cpp_id_attributes`, so that shouldn't be the problem.\n```\n/** Data type for the sample values per channel per pixel.\n*/\ntypedef enum {\n/** Use 32-bit single-precision floating point values, with range 0.0-1.0\n* (within gamut, may go outside this range for wide color gamut). Floating\n* point output, either JXL_TYPE_FLOAT or JXL_TYPE_FLOAT16, is recommended\n* for HDR and wide gamut images when color profile conversion is required. */\nJXL_TYPE_FLOAT = 0,\n/** DEPRECATED: Bitpacked 1-bit. As an alternative, use JXL_TYPE_UINT8.\n*/\nJXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN JXL_DEPRECATED,\n[...]\n```\nWhen building documentation from this, it is parsing it as if the enum value is `JXL_DEPRECATED`, not `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN` as it should be. When there are two or more enum values deprecated like this, it results in `Duplicate C++ declaration`.\n### Expected behavior\nJust like attributes for function definitions, attributes for enum values should be ignored when parsing.\n### Your project\nhttps://libjxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nLinux\n### Python version\n3.9.10\n### Sphinx version\n4.5.0\n### Sphinx extensions\n_No response_\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

The presence of `__attribute__` here suggests that this file manages or processes attributes in some way. This is directly related to the bug since the issue described involves mishandling attributes attached to enum values.\n\n3. **No direct finds for `JXL_DEPRECATED`**: Since `JXL_DEPRECATED` was not found, it may be defined outside the accessible codebase or it could be a part of the configuration that isn't directly visible through the API searches. This also indicates that our focus should be more on how attributes (in general, not just `JXL_DEPRECATED`) are processed rather than on a specific attribute.\n\n### Intended Behavior\nGiven the issue, the intended behavior of the parsing logic in `sphinx/util/cfamily.py` would be to properly recognize and ignore (or handle differently) attributes applied to `enum` values so that the actual enum names are correctly parsed and documented, rather than having the attributes interfere with the names or causing duplicates due to misinterpretation.\n\n### Next Steps - Additional API Calls\n\nGiven this analysis, we need additional context on how attributes are handled in `sphinx/util/cfamily.py`, as this seems to be the crux of the issue. Thus, a reasonable next step would be to look into this file more closely:\n\n- **search_code_in_file(\"__attribute__\", \"sphinx/util/cfamily.py\")**: To get more detailed information on how `__attribute__` is used or processed in this particular file which seems central to our issue.\n- **search_code_in_file(\"enum\", \"sphinx/util/cfamily.py\")**: Since the initial search for `typedef enum` globally returned no results, it would be wise to search for enum handling specifically within the `cfamily.py` file to see how enums and potentially their attributes are parsed or processed.\n\nThese steps should give us a clearer picture of where the logic might be failing or needs to be adjusted to correctly handle attributes for enum values."

The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This ensures that the actual names of the enums are used in the documentation rather than the attributes' names.\n   - Ensure that when attributes are present, they do not interfere with the recognition of enum value names. This involves possibly extending the parsing logic to differentiate between the enum names and their optional attributes, ensuring attributes like `__attribute__((__deprecated__))` or macros that expand to such attributes are properly skipped over in the name recognition process.\n   - Prevent the generation of duplicates in the documentation due to misinterpreted enum values. This might require checking for uniqueness in the context where an attribute could lead to misunderstanding of the enum's actual identifiers.\n   - The existing functionality for parsing and documenting C/C++ code must be preserved, with additional handling for enums with attributes being the only change. This involves retaining all current capabilities for processing standard enum declarations, function declarations, variable definitions, and other typical C/C++ constructs without attributes.\n\nImplementing this behavior requires a thorough understanding of how `sphinx/util/cfamily.py` processes C/C++ syntax and integrating an enhanced mechanism for attribute recognition and processing that aligns with the described intended behavior."
