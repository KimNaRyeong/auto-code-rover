        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `__eq__` method within the `Model` class should be modified to adhere to the Python data model's recommendation. The modification involves changing the implementation to return `NotImplemented` instead of `False` when the `other` object being compared is not an instance of `Model`. This change ensures that Python's fallback mechanisms for equality checks can be engaged, allowing for the correct delegation of the equality operation to the `other` object if it defines its own `__eq__` method capable of handling the comparison with a Django `Model` instance. This adjustment preserves the existing functionality when comparing two model instances (including the checks for same concrete model and primary key equality) while improving compatibility and compliance with the broader Python ecosystem, specifically in scenarios involving comparisons with objects of non-model types."
