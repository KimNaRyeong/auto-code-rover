    from django.core.validators import slug_re

    original_title = "Hello İstanbul"
    expected_slug = "hello-istanbul"  # Assuming this is the corrected behavior

    # Apply slugify with the allow_unicode True to potentially trigger the issue.
    slug = slugify(original_title, allow_unicode=True)

    # Check if the resulting slug matches the expected pattern and does not raise validation error.
    if not slug_re.match(slug):
        raise ValidationError("Generated slug does not match the expected pattern")

    # Additionally, check if the slug is exactly as expected (hello-istanbul).
    assert slug == expected_slug, "Slug does not match the expected output"

try:
    check_slugify_issue()
    print("Issue not present, slug generated correctly.")
except AssertionError as e:

    raise
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise
```

When executing the above script in the environment described (with Python 3.6 or Python 3.7, Django 2.2.6), if the issue is still present, it will raise an `AssertionError` indicating the slug does not match the expected output. The custom `print_stacktrace` function will show exactly where the problem occurs, making it easier to debug and understand the issue's origin.

Ensure to set up a minimal Django environment before running this script, as it relies on Django's `slugify` and validation mechanisms. 

This script assumes that the desired behavior is to convert "Hello İstanbul" to "hello-istanbul" without the "İ" problem causing a `ValidationError` due to an unexpected character after being lowercased.
