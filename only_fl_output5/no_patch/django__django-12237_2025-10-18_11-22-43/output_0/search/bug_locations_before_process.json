        "intended_behavior": "The `slugify` function should accurately handle special cases like the Turkish \"\u0130\" letter, such that when `allow_unicode=True`, the transformation into lowercase does not produce characters that are invalid in slug contexts (e.g., the 'COMBINING DOT ABOVE' character). This requires either preprocessing specific characters before the general lowercasing logic applies or adjusting the post-processing steps to ensure that any non-desired Unicode artifacts (like combining marks that could result from the lowercase conversion) are effectively removed or normalized into their respective base characters, ensuring that the resulting slug fully adheres to Unicode letter, number, underscore, or hyphen criteria. This behavior must maintain the function's capability to handle a wide range of Unicode characters while correctly dealing with edge cases, ensuring backward compatibility and not breaking existing slugs."
