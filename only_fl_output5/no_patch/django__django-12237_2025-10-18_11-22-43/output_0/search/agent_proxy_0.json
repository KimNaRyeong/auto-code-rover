Search for the `Page` model referenced in the issue to understand more about its structure and any custom methods that might be interacting with `slugify`:\n\n```\nsearch_class(\"Page\")\n```\n\n2. Since the issue directly involves the `slugify` function, it is crucial to locate this function in the Django codebase to inspect how it's defined and potentially identify where the proposed solution could be implemented:\n\n```\nsearch_method(\"slugify\")\n```\n\n3. The issue suggests a modification to the `slugify` function, implying it's part of the Django `utils.text` module. Locate the exact implementation to note the current order of operations (`re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s-]', '', value).strip().lower()`), which the submitter suggests modifying:\n\n```\nsearch_code(\"re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s-]', '', value).strip().lower()\")\n```\n\nThese searches should provide a meaningful starting point to understand the issue's context, helping us evaluate the feasibility of the proposed solution or suggest an alternative approach."
