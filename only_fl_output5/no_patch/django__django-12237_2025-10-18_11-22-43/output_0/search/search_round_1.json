        "content": "<issue>slugify() doesn't return a valid slug for \"\u0130\".\nDescription\nWhile working on an international project, we discovered that the turkish/azerbaijani letter \u0130 can not be properly processed when SlugField and slugify are run with allow_unicode=True.\nThe project itself runs with Django 2.2.6 and Wagtail 2.6.2. I first talked about this in the Wagtail Support Channel and while researching further, discovered that this is a Django/Python related issue. This was tested on Python 3.6 and on Python 3.7.\n(quick shoutout to Matt Wescott @gasmanic of Wagtail Fame for being a sparing partner in this)\nThere is a rather detailed analysis (README) in a git repo I created \u200bhttps://github.com/originell/django-wagtail-turkish-i - it was also the basis for my initial call for help in wagtail's support channel. Meanwhile I have extended it with a Django-only project, as to be a 100% sure this has nothing to do with Wagtail.\nI was not able to find anything similar in trac. While I encourage whoever is reading this to actually read the README in the git repo, I want to honor your time and will try to provide a more concise version of the bug here.\nExplanation\nmodels.py\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.utils.text import slugify\nclass Page(models.Model):\ntitle = models.CharField(max_length=255)\nslug = models.SlugField(allow_unicode=True)\ndef __str__(self):\nreturn self.title\nUsing this in a shell/test like a (Model)Form might:\nfrom django.utils.text import slugify\npage = Page(title=\"Hello \u0130stanbul\")\npage.slug = slugify(page.title, allow_unicode=True)\npage.full_clean()\nfull_clean() then raises\ndjango.core.exceptions.ValidationError: {'slug': Enter a valid 'slug' consisting of Unicode letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens.?}\nWhy is that?\nslugify does the following internally:\nre.sub(r'[^\\w\\s-]', '', value).strip().lower()\nThing is, Python's .lower() of the \u0130 in \u0130stanbul looks like this:\n>>> [unicodedata.name(character) for character in '\u0130'.lower()]\n['LATIN SMALL LETTER I', 'COMBINING DOT ABOVE']\nSo, while slugify() finishes, the result is then passed into SlugField which uses the slug_unicode_re (^[-\\w]+\\Z). However, the Combining Dot Above is not a valid \\w:\n>>> [(character, unicodedata.name(character), slug_unicode_re.match(character)) for character in '\u0130'.lower()]\n[\n('i', 'LATIN SMALL LETTER I', <re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='i'>),\n# EUREKA!!\n('\u0307', 'COMBINING DOT ABOVE', None)\n]\nSo that's why the ValidationError is raised.\nProposed Solution\nThe culprit seems to be the order in which lower() is called in slugify. The assumption that the lowercase version of a re.sub-ed string is still a valid slug_unicode_re, does not seem to hold true.\nHence, instead of doing this in slugify()\nre.sub(r'[^\\w\\s-]', '', value).strip().lower()\nIt might be better to do it like this\nre.sub(r'[^\\w\\s-]', '', value.lower()).strip()\nIs Python the actual culprit?\nYeah it might be. Matt (@gasmanic) urged me to also take a look if Python might be doing this wrong.\nThe \u0130 is the Latin Capital Letter I with Dot Above. It's codepoint is U+0130 According to the chart for the Latin Extended-A set (\u200bhttps://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0100.pdf), it's lowercase version is U+0069.\nU+0069 lives in the C0 Controls and Basic Latin set (\u200bhttps://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf). Lo and behold: it is the Latin small letter I. So a latin lowercase i.\nDoes this really mean that Python is doing something weird here by adding the Combining dot above? Honestly, I can't imagine that and I am probably missing an important thing here because my view is too naive.\n---\nI hope this shorter explanation makes sense. If it does not, please try to read through the detailed analysis in the repo (\u200bhttps://github.com/originell/django-wagtail-turkish-i/blob/master/README.md). If that also does not make a ton of sense, let me know.\nIn any case, thank you for taking the time to read this bug report. Looking forward to feedback and thoughts. I am happy to oblige in any capacity necessary.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the API calls, here's an overview:\n\n### Analysis of `Page` class search result\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \n  The `Page` class found in `django/core/paginator.py` is unrelated to the issue described. This `Page` class deals with pagination and is part of Django's core paginator implementation. This result is a false positive because the issue relates to a custom `Page` model defined within a user's project, not within the Django framework itself.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**  \n  There is no direct relationship between the `Page` class found in the paginator module and the bug. The bug concerns the `slugify` function's handling of specific Unicode characters in a context likely specific to the user's project model.\n\n- **Intended behavior of this part of the code?**  \n  The intended behavior for this part of the code (paginator's `Page` class) is to correctly handle pagination regardless of the issue at hand with slugification.\n\n### Analysis of `slugify` method search results\n\n- **django/template/defaultfilters.py result:**  \n  This `slugify` function seems to be a wrapper that calls another `_slugify` function internally. However, details on its operation or handling of Unicode are not provided.\n\n- **django/utils/text.py result:**  \n  This is the main implementation of the `slugify` function which takes a `value` and an optional `allow_unicode` flag.\n  \n  - The function converts input to ASCII if `allow_unicode` is False, replaces spaces with hyphens, removes non-alphanumeric/underscore/hyphen characters, converts to lowercase, and finally strips leading and trailing whitespace.\n  - The issue described concerns the `allow_unicode=True` path where the function attempts to normalize Unicode input but still runs into issues with specific characters (`\u0130` in this case), leading to a ValidationError due to the presence of 'COMBINING DOT ABOVE' which is not matched as a word character by the regular expression used to enforce slug validity.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**  \n  The implementation of `slugify` in `django/utils/text.py` is directly related to the bug. The issue arises because the Turkish letter \"\u0130\" when converted to lowercase, transforms into \"i\" followed by a \"COMBINING DOT ABOVE\" character. This additional character is not considered a valid character in a slug by Django's validation regex, thus causing the ValidationError.\n\n- **Intended behavior of this part of the code?**  \n  The intended behavior of the `slugify` function, when `allow_unicode=True`, is to accept Unicode characters and convert them into a slug-friendly format. However, it should handle character cases like \"\u0130\" more gracefully, ensuring that the transformation into lowercase does not introduce characters that are not valid in a slug.\n\n### Next Steps for API Calls\nGiven the failed search for an accurate representation of the problematic `re.sub` code string due to likely escaping issues, and considering the insight that the issue is deeply interlinked with both the implementation of `slugify` and the Unicode character handling, further steps could involve:\n\n1. Direct examination of the `slugify` function in `django/utils/text.py` to understand potential discrepancies in Unicode handling, especially for characters with diacritics like \"\u0130\".\n\n2. **Potential API calls**:\n    - Investigate the use of `unicodedata.normalize` in `slugify` and whether there's an alternative approach that could avoid the problematic scenario.\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"unicodedata.normalize\")\n    ```\n\n    - Review how Django's `SlugField` does its validation - particularly looking at the regex used (`slug_unicode_re`) to validate a slug. This could provide insight into what characters are considered valid or invalid in a slug context within Django.\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"slug_unicode_re\")\n    ```\n\nThese steps might provide further clarity on how the `slugify` function and Django's `SlugField` interact with Unicode characters and potentially reveal a pathway to rectify the described issue."

This requires either preprocessing specific characters before the general lowercasing logic applies or adjusting the post-processing steps to ensure that any non-desired Unicode artifacts (like combining marks that could result from the lowercase conversion) are effectively removed or normalized into their respective base characters, ensuring that the resulting slug fully adheres to Unicode letter, number, underscore, or hyphen criteria. This behavior must maintain the function's capability to handle a wide range of Unicode characters while correctly dealing with edge cases, ensuring backward compatibility and not breaking existing slugs."
