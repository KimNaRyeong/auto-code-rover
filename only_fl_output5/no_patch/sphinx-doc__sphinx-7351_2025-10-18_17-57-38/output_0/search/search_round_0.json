        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how Sphinx decides which file to parse when multiple files share the same name but have different extensions. Since the issue mentions a behavior specific to handling document files with different extensions, it would be relevant to look into the parts of the Sphinx codebase where files are collected and parsed, particularly where the decision is made about which file to include based on the extension.\n\nGiven that Sphinx extensions like `myst-parser` can influence which files Sphinx chooses to parse, it's also valuable to look into how Sphinx manages extensions and their preferences for file types. The mention of `index.rst` including `a.md` instead of `a.rst` suggests we should explore how Sphinx treats `toctree` directives and resolves file references within them.\n\nGiven the above considerations, here are the API calls that can help us gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for a method or class that handles the inclusion of files in documents, possibly related to parsing toctree directives or resolving file paths:\n   - `search_code(\"toctree\")`\n\n2. Since the issue might relate to how Sphinx prioritizes file extensions when multiple possibilities exist, let's search for any functionality that handles file extensions or decides which file to parse:\n   - `search_code(\"file extension\")`\n   \n3. Considering the `myst-parser` extension is specifically mentioned, and the issue seems to involve the way Sphinx interacts with extensions to parse different file types:\n   - `search_class(\"ExtensionManager\")`\n   - `search_method(\"add_source_parser\")`\n\n4. Lastly, because the issue indicates a potential oversight or bug in file selection that may not be intended behavior, let's also check for any Sphinx log warnings or error handling that might pertain to conflicting file names or extensions:\n   - `search_code(\"log warning\")`\n   - `search_code(\"resolve conflicts\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a broad set of contexts from the Sphinx project that can help in understanding the reported issue, potentially identifying where the unexpected behavior originates, and where a patch might be needed to enable more explicit control or warnings about file extension handling."
