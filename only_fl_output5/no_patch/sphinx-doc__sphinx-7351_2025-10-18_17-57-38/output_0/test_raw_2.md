Given the requirement and the provided function for printing a stack trace, I'll revise the `reproducer.py` to correctly initialize and handle the testing process for the described issue. This involves setting up a simplified Sphinx environment that mimics the issue surrounding file extension handling, ensuring correct indentation and structure follows Python standards.

```python
import os
import shutil
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_project(project_dir):
    srcdir = os.path.join(project_dir, 'source')
    confdir = srcdir
    outdir = os.path.join(project_dir, 'build')
    doctreedir = os.path.join(project_dir, 'doctrees')
    os.makedirs(srcdir, exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs(outdir, exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs(doctreedir, exist_ok=True)

    with open(os.path.join(srcdir, 'index.rst'), 'w') as f:
        f.write('.. toctree::\n    a.md\n')

    with open(os.path.join(srcdir, 'a.rst'), 'w') as f:
        f.write('This is a.rst')

    with open(os.path.join(srcdir, 'a.md'), 'w') as f:
        f.write('This is a.md')

    with open(os.path.join(confdir, 'conf.py'), 'w') as f:
        f.write(
            "extensions = ['myst_parser']\n"
            "source_suffix = ['.rst', '.md']"
        )
    return srcdir, confdir, outdir, doctreedir

def build_sphinx(srcdir, confdir, outdir, doctreedir):
    from sphinx.cmd.build import main as sphinx_build
    sphinx_build(['-b', 'html', srcdir, outdir, '-d', doctreedir, '-W', '--keep-going'])

def check_build_output(outdir):
    with open(os.path.join(outdir, 'index.html'), 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
        if 'This is a.md' not in content:
            raise AssertionError("a.md was not included as expected.")

def main():
    try:
        project_dir = 'test_sphinx_project'
        srcdir, confdir, outdir, doctreedir = setup_sphinx_project(project_dir)
        build_sphinx(srcdir, confdir, outdir, doctreedir)
        check_build_output(outdir)
        print("The issue seems to be fixed.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    finally:
        # Cleanup: Uncomment the next line if you do not want to keep the test project after running this script.
        # shutil.rmtree(project_dir)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script integrates the setup, Sphinx build, and validation into a single process. It raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, adhering to the initial request. The script also attempts a cleanup process for the created directories and files, which you can enable or disable as needed.

**Important Notes:**
- Before running this script, ensure Sphinx (`pip install sphinx`) and `myst-parser` (`pip install myst-parser`) are installed in your Python environment.
- Uncomment `shutil.rmtree(project_dir)` in the `finally` block if you wish the script to automatically clean up the temporary Sphinx project after running.
