Certainly! Here's a corrected version of the `reproducer.py` file, including adjustments for the `print_stacktrace` function formatting and any indentation issues that were previously present.

```python
import os
import shutil
import sys
from sphinx.application import Sphinx

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_project(srcdir, confdir, outdir, doctreedir):
    os.makedirs(srcdir, exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs(outdir, exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs(doctreedir, exist_ok=True)

    with open(os.path.join(srcdir, 'index.rst'), 'w') as f:
        f.write('.. toctree::\n    a.md\n')

    with open(os.path.join(srcdir, 'a.rst'), 'w') as f:
        f.write('This is a.rst')

    with open(os.path.join(srcdir, 'a.md'), 'w') as f:
        f.write('This is a.md')

    with open(os.path.join(confdir, 'conf.py'), 'w') as f:
        f.write("extensions = ['myst_parser']\n")

def run_sphinx(srcdir, confdir, outdir, doctreedir):
    app = Sphinx(srcdir, confdir, outdir, doctreedir, 'html')
    app.build(force_all=True)
    return app

def check_issue(app):
    with open(os.path.join(app.outdir, 'a.html'), 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
        if 'This is a.md' not in content:
            raise AssertionError("Unexpected content in 'a.html': Expected inclusion of 'a.md', found 'a.rst'.")

def main():
    project_dir = 'test_sphinx_project'
    srcdir = os.path.join(project_dir, 'source')
    confdir = srcdir  # Configuration directory is the same as source directory in this setup
    outdir = os.path.join(project_dir, 'build')
    doctreedir = os.path.join(project_dir, 'doctrees')

    try:
        setup_sphinx_project(srcdir, confdir, outdir, doctreedir)
        app = run_sphinx(srcdir, confdir, outdir, doctreedir)
        check_issue(app)
        print("The issue seems to be fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    finally:
        # Cleanup: Uncomment the next line if you do not want to keep the test project after running this script.
        # shutil.rmtree(project_dir)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In the above script, a Sphinx project is dynamically created with the structure necessary to trigger the described issue. The script attempts to verify if the problem where Sphinx favors a `.rst` file over a `.md` file, despite explicit mention of the `.md` file, is reproduced. An `AssertionError` is raised if the script concludes that Sphinx is incorrectly handling files with the same name but different extensions, indicating the unfixed issue.

**Instructions:**

1. Ensure Sphinx and the `myst_parser` extension are installed in your environment. If not, you can install them using pip:

    ```shell
    pip install sphinx myst-parser
    ```

2. Place this script in the root directory of where you want the test project setup.
3. Run the script using Python 3:

    ```shell
    python3 reproducer.py
    ```

This script will either confirm the issue (by exiting with code 1 and printing a stack trace) or state that the issue seems fixed (by exiting with code 0) based on whether the assertion fails or passes.
