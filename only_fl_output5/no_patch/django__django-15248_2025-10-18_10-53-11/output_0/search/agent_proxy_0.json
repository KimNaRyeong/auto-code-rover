Based on the issue description, we need to look into models' `delete()` methods and `queryset.delete()` methods, and how signals are dispatched in both contexts. Given these requirements, I propose the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"delete\")`: This call will help us find both instance-level `delete()` methods and `queryset.delete()` methods throughout the codebase.\n2. `search_method(\"send_pre_delete_signal\")`: Assuming a method like this exists based on common patterns in signal handling, this call would help find signal dispatching related to object deletion.\n3. `search_method(\"send_post_delete_signal\")`: Similarly, this call is made based on the assumption that there's a specific method for dispatching post-delete signals."
