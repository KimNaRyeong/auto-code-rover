If it's deleted from a model.delete(), you know which instance initiated the delete and if it's from a queryset.delete() you know which queryset initiated the delete, with the models in that queryset. Using this you know if the instance is being deleted directly or because it's related to another instance.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather enough context for resolving the issue related to knowing where an object was deleted from in pre/post delete signals, it would be meaningful to start by identifying the parts of the codebase that handle deletion and signals. Based on the issue description, we need to look into models' `delete()` methods and `queryset.delete()` methods, and how signals are dispatched in both contexts. Given these requirements, I propose the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"delete\")`: This call will help us find both instance-level `delete()` methods and `queryset.delete()` methods throughout the codebase.\n2. `search_method(\"send_pre_delete_signal\")`: Assuming a method like this exists based on common patterns in signal handling, this call would help find signal dispatching related to object deletion.\n3. `search_method(\"send_post_delete_signal\")`: Similarly, this call is made based on the assumption that there's a specific method for dispatching post-delete signals."
