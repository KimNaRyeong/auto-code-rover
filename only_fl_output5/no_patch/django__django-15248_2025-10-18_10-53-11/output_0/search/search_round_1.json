Based on the issue description, we need to look into models' `delete()` methods and `queryset.delete()` methods, and how signals are dispatched in both contexts. Given these requirements, I propose the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"delete\")`: This call will help us find both instance-level `delete()` methods and `queryset.delete()` methods throughout the codebase.\n2. `search_method(\"send_pre_delete_signal\")`: Assuming a method like this exists based on common patterns in signal handling, this call would help find signal dispatching related to object deletion.\n3. `search_method(\"send_post_delete_signal\")`: Similarly, this call is made based on the assumption that there's a specific method for dispatching post-delete signals."

        "content": "Analyzing the results of the `search_method(\"delete\")` call reveals key locations in the codebase that handle deletion in Django, a popular Python-based web framework, which our issue description seems to pertain to. Specifically, the methods within `django/db/models/deletion.py`, `django/db/models/base.py`, and `django/db/models/query.py` are of highest interest to us since they directly relate to object deletion at both the individual object level and the queryset level, which are central to the issue at hand. Let's break down the analysis based on the questions:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - `django/db/models/deletion.py`: Likely contains the implementation details of how objects are deleted, potentially dealing with cascading deletes and handling related objects.\n   - `django/db/models/base.py`: This could contain the `delete` method for individual model instances, defining how a single object is deleted.\n   - `django/db/models/query.py`: Contains queryset operations, including the `delete` method for deleting multiple objects/records at once through Django ORM querysets.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue concerns enhancing deletion operations with additional context regarding the origin of the delete operation\u2014i.e., being able to distinguish between deletes initiated by a direct `delete()` call on a model instance vs. those initiated by calling `delete()` on a queryset. The files identified above are directly involved in these operations, making them pivotal points for implementing a solution to the issue.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would involve modifying the deletion logic so that it carries forward information about the origin of the delete operation. This could involve expanding the methods in `django/db/models/deletion.py`, `django/db/models/base.py`, and `django/db/models/query.py` to include this context, or introducing a mechanism to trace this information.\n   \nGiven the lack of directly found methods relating to pre/post deletion signals (`send_pre_delete_signal` and `send_post_delete_signal`), we need to reevaluate our approach for digging into how deletion signals are dispatched in Django. The correct hooks for dispatching signals in the context of Django involve `pre_delete` and `post_delete` signals specifically, rather than methods explicitly named `send_pre_delete_signal` or `send_post_delete_signal`.\n\nAdditional queries to gather context should thus focus on:\n- Identifying how `pre_delete` and `post_delete` signals are dispatched around deletions.\n- Understanding the context or additional arguments passed to these signals, to propose a patch that includes origin of deletion as part of those contexts.\n\nWith this in mind, additional API calls should include:\n- `search_code(\"pre_delete.send\")` and `search_code(\"post_delete.send\")`: to find how and where these deletion signals are dispatched in the Django framework's deletion logic. This can provide insight into the current mechanism of signal handling and how it could be augmented to include the origin of deletion."
