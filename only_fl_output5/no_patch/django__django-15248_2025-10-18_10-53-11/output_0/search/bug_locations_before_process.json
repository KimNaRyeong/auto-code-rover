        "intended_behavior": "The `delete` method within the `Collector` class should be enhanced to include additional context when dispatching both `pre_delete` and `post_delete` signals. Specifically, the method should be modified to carry information about the deletion's origin, differentiating between deletions initiated via a model instance (`model.delete()`) versus those initiated via a queryset (`queryset.delete()`). This could be accomplished by introducing a new parameter to the signal, such as `deletion_origin` that could be set to an appropriate value based on the context of the deletion call within the `delete` method workflow. This enhancement should be implemented in a way that ensures backward compatibility with existing signal receivers that might not expect the new parameter. As such, the addition should be optional or managed in a way that non-expecting receivers can ignore it without issues. The primary goal is to enrich the context provided by deletion signals without disrupting existing functionalities or signal handling implementations."
