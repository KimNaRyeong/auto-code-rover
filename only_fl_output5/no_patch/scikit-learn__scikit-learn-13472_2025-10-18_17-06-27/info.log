</code><intended_behavior>The `fit` method of `GradientBoostingRegressor` should handle the `sample_weight` parameter in a way that is compatible with various initial estimators, including pipelines and other estimators that accept `sample_weight` as part of their `fit` method signature. The adjustment should be as follows:

1. **Dynamic Handling of `sample_weight`**: Before attempting to fit the `init_` estimator, programmatically determine if the `init_.fit` method can accept `sample_weight` as a parameter. This can be done through introspection methods such as `inspect.signature` in Python.

2. **Conditionally Pass `sample_weight`**: If the `init_` estimator's `fit` method supports `sample_weight`, then it should be passed as a keyword argument. This ensures compatibility with estimators or pipelines that expect `sample_weight` as part of their `fit` method parameters.

3. **Provide Fallback Mechanism**: If `sample_weight` is not supported by the `init_` estimator, the fallback mechanism (as currently implemented) should be maintained. This ensures that existing functionality for initial estimators that do not require `sample_weight` is preserved.

This approach ensures that `GradientBoostingRegressor` remains flexible and compatible with a wide range of initial estimators, improving the usability of the class with pipelines and other custom estimators within the scikit-learn ecosystem.</intended_behavior>, <file>sklearn/ensemble/gradient_boosting.py</file>

</code><intended_behavior>The `fit` method of `GradientBoostingRegressor` should handle the `sample_weight` parameter in a way that is compatible with various initial estimators, including pipelines and other estimators that accept `sample_weight` as part of their `fit` method signature. The adjustment should be as follows:

1. **Dynamic Handling of `sample_weight`**: Before attempting to fit the `init_` estimator, programmatically determine if the `init_.fit` method can accept `sample_weight` as a parameter. This can be done through introspection methods such as `inspect.signature` in Python.

2. **Conditionally Pass `sample_weight`**: If the `init_` estimator's `fit` method supports `sample_weight`, then it should be passed as a keyword argument. This ensures compatibility with estimators or pipelines that expect `sample_weight` as part of their `fit` method parameters.

3. **Provide Fallback Mechanism**: If `sample_weight` is not supported by the `init_` estimator, the fallback mechanism (as currently implemented) should be maintained. This ensures that existing functionality for initial estimators that do not require `sample_weight` is preserved.

This approach ensures that `GradientBoostingRegressor` remains flexible and compatible with a wide range of initial estimators, improving the usability of the class with pipelines and other custom estimators within the scikit-learn ecosystem.</intended_behavior>]

1418             The monitor is called after each iteration with the current
1419             iteration, a reference to the estimator and the local variables of
1420             ``_fit_stages`` as keyword arguments ``callable(i, self,
1421             locals())``. If the callable returns ``True`` the fitting procedure
1422             is stopped. The monitor can be used for various things such as
1423             computing held-out estimates, early stopping, model introspect, and
1424             snapshoting.

</code><intended_behavior>The `fit` method of `GradientBoostingRegressor` should handle the `sample_weight` parameter in a way that is compatible with various initial estimators, including pipelines and other estimators that accept `sample_weight` as part of their `fit` method signature. The adjustment should be as follows:

1. **Dynamic Handling of `sample_weight`**: Before attempting to fit the `init_` estimator, programmatically determine if the `init_.fit` method can accept `sample_weight` as a parameter. This can be done through introspection methods such as `inspect.signature` in Python.

2. **Conditionally Pass `sample_weight`**: If the `init_` estimator's `fit` method supports `sample_weight`, then it should be passed as a keyword argument. This ensures compatibility with estimators or pipelines that expect `sample_weight` as part of their `fit` method parameters.

3. **Provide Fallback Mechanism**: If `sample_weight` is not supported by the `init_` estimator, the fallback mechanism (as currently implemented) should be maintained. This ensures that existing functionality for initial estimators that do not require `sample_weight` is preserved.

This approach ensures that `GradientBoostingRegressor` remains flexible and compatible with a wide range of initial estimators, improving the usability of the class with pipelines and other custom estimators within the scikit-learn ecosystem.</intended_behavior>, <file>sklearn/ensemble/gradient_boosting.py</file>

1407             in regression)
1408             For classification, labels must correspond to classes.

1410         sample_weight : array-like, shape (n_samples,) or None
1411             Sample weights. If None, then samples are equally weighted. Splits
1412             that would create child nodes with net zero or negative weight are
1413             ignored while searching for a split in each node. In the case of
1414             classification, splits are also ignored if they would result in any
1415             single class carrying a negative weight in either child node.
1416 
1417         monitor : callable, optional
1418             The monitor is called after each iteration with the current
1419             iteration, a reference to the estimator and the local variables of
1420             ``_fit_stages`` as keyword arguments ``callable(i, self,
1421             locals())``. If the callable returns ``True`` the fitting procedure
1422             is stopped. The monitor can be used for various things such as
1423             computing held-out estimates, early stopping, model introspect, and
1424             snapshoting.

</code><intended_behavior>The `fit` method of `GradientBoostingRegressor` should handle the `sample_weight` parameter in a way that is compatible with various initial estimators, including pipelines and other estimators that accept `sample_weight` as part of their `fit` method signature. The adjustment should be as follows:

1. **Dynamic Handling of `sample_weight`**: Before attempting to fit the `init_` estimator, programmatically determine if the `init_.fit` method can accept `sample_weight` as a parameter. This can be done through introspection methods such as `inspect.signature` in Python.

2. **Conditionally Pass `sample_weight`**: If the `init_` estimator's `fit` method supports `sample_weight`, then it should be passed as a keyword argument. This ensures compatibility with estimators or pipelines that expect `sample_weight` as part of their `fit` method parameters.

3. **Provide Fallback Mechanism**: If `sample_weight` is not supported by the `init_` estimator, the fallback mechanism (as currently implemented) should be maintained. This ensures that existing functionality for initial estimators that do not require `sample_weight` is preserved.

This approach ensures that `GradientBoostingRegressor` remains flexible and compatible with a wide range of initial estimators, improving the usability of the class with pipelines and other custom estimators within the scikit-learn ecosystem.</intended_behavior>]
