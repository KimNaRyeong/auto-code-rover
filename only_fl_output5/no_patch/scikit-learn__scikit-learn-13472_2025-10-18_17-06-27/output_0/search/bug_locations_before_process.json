        "intended_behavior": "The `fit` method of `GradientBoostingRegressor` should handle the `sample_weight` parameter in a way that is compatible with various initial estimators, including pipelines and other estimators that accept `sample_weight` as part of their `fit` method signature. The adjustment should be as follows:\n\n1. **Dynamic Handling of `sample_weight`**: Before attempting to fit the `init_` estimator, programmatically determine if the `init_.fit` method can accept `sample_weight` as a parameter. This can be done through introspection methods such as `inspect.signature` in Python.\n\n2. **Conditionally Pass `sample_weight`**: If the `init_` estimator's `fit` method supports `sample_weight`, then it should be passed as a keyword argument. This ensures compatibility with estimators or pipelines that expect `sample_weight` as part of their `fit` method parameters.\n\n3. **Provide Fallback Mechanism**: If `sample_weight` is not supported by the `init_` estimator, the fallback mechanism (as currently implemented) should be maintained. This ensures that existing functionality for initial estimators that do not require `sample_weight` is preserved.\n\nThis approach ensures that `GradientBoostingRegressor` remains flexible and compatible with a wide range of initial estimators, improving the usability of the class with pipelines and other custom estimators within the scikit-learn ecosystem."
