Based on your requirements, below is a revised `reproducer.py` script designed to replicate the reported issue regarding the integration of `GradientBoostingRegressor` with a `pipeline` as an initial estimator. The script raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is detected, prints a detailed stack trace of the error, and exits gracefully with code 0 if the issue has already been addressed in the library.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def attempt_fit_with_pipeline():
    import sklearn.pipeline
    import sklearn.ensemble
    import sklearn.decomposition
    import sklearn.linear_model
    import numpy as np

    # Attempt to create an initial estimator using sklearn's pipeline
    init_estimator = sklearn.pipeline.make_pipeline(
        sklearn.decomposition.PCA(),
        sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNet()
    )
    model = sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor(init=init_estimator)

    # Generate some random data for the example
    x = np.random.rand(100, 10)
    y = np.random.rand(100)

    try:
        model.fit(x, y)
        print("Model fit successfully. If an issue was expected, this may indicate it has been resolved.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        if "fit() takes from 2 to 3 positional arguments but 4 were given" in str(e):
            raise AssertionError("Identified expected issue with incompatible signatures.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        attempt_fit_with_pipeline()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(1)
    exit(0)
```

This script, when executed, checks for the compatibility between `GradientBoostingRegressor` and sklearn pipelines as initial estimators. It carefully captures any exceptions, prints a comprehensive stack trace for deeper insight, and specifically checks for the TypeError that indicates the issue. If no exceptions are captured, or if the error does not match the expected signature issue, the script will either flag the problem has been addressed or prompt further investigation.
