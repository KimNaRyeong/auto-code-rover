Given the previous misunderstanding, let's correct the approach and ensure the `reproducer.py` script focuses explicitly on reproducing the initially described issue with `GradientBoostingRegressor` and a `Pipeline` as its initial estimator. This script will now properly attempt to catch the TypeError specific to the scenario and handle it accordingly.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_gradient_boosting_with_pipeline():
    import sklearn
    import sklearn.pipeline
    import sklearn.ensemble
    import sklearn.decomposition
    import sklearn.linear_model
    import numpy as np

    # Create a pipeline to use as initial estimator
    init = sklearn.pipeline.make_pipeline(sklearn.decomposition.PCA(), sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNet())
    model = sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor(init=init)

    # Dummy data for fitting
    x = np.random.rand(12, 3)
    y = np.random.rand(12)

    try:
        # Attempt to fit the model
        model.fit(x, y)
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # If the specific error message is captured, assert issue presence
        if "fit() takes from 2 to 3 positional arguments but 4 were given" in str(e):
            raise AssertionError("The issue with the incompatible signature of the initial estimator in GradientBoostingRegressor is present.")
    
    print("No TypeError experienced - if the issue was previously present, it appears to be fixed.")
    return 0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_gradient_boosting_with_pipeline()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(1)
    exit(0)
```

This version of the script specifically targets the issue with passing a `Pipeline` as an initial estimator to `GradientBoostingRegressor` and checks if it results in a `TypeError` due to incorrect argument handling. If the `TypeError` related to the argument count is encountered, an `AssertionError` will be raised, indicating that the issue persists. If no error occurs, it is presumed the issue has been corrected, and the script exits with a success code (0).
