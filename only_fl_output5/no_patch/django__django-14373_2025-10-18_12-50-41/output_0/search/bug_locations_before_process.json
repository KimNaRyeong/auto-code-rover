        "intended_behavior": "The `Y` method should be modified to ensure it always returns a four-digit year string, padded with zeros for years less than 1000. This modification should keep the existing functionality of the code intact for years 1000 and above (returning them exactly as they are), but for years below 1000, it should add leading zeros to make the year a four-digit string. This could involve using Python's string formatting methods or the `zfill()` method to achieve the desired output."
