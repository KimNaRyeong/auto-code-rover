It seems like there should be one that is standard and that it should be possible to change that by configuration.\n### \\text\n* **Pro** adapts the font to the used math-font, not necessarily a Roman font\n* **Con** Relies on the `amsmath` (or some other `ams*` package\n### \\mathrm\n* **Pro** works in default LaTeX without importing any packages\n* **Con** always gives a Roman (Serif) font, even if the current math font is not Roman\nSome quick grep:ing tells us that there are 123 instances of `\\mathrm` and 46 instances of `\\text` in the .py-files.\nIdeally, this should be configurable, but even then we need to decide on a standard. Personally, I will set it to `\\text` the second it is implemented, but the package dependency may be confusing for newer users. (It seems like both options works in e.g. iPython but I have not explicitly tested, just not noted any issue.)\nProbably the easiest way to implement it is to add a helper function `print_text` or something so people do not have to test at every single instance.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand where and how the `\\mathrm` and `\\text` commands are currently used within the LaTeX printing routines of the project. This entails identifying key functions, classes, or files where these LaTeX commands are prominently featured. We should prioritize locating any centralized LaTeX printing functions or classes, as changes here could affect the entire project. Given the nature of the issue, it's likely that these LaTeX commands are not scattered randomly but are instead used within specific contexts related to mathematical or scientific printing.\n\nFirst, let's gather context on how text is being printed in mathematical contexts throughout the project:\n\n1. **Search for `\\mathrm` usage:** Since `\\mathrm` is used more frequently according to the issue description, identifying where it's used can give us insight into the standard approach for rendering text within mathematical expressions.\n\n2. **Search for `\\text` usage:** Similarly, understanding where and how `\\text` is employed will highlight the cases where the text formatting adapts to the math-font, which might be crucial for certain types of mathematical documentation or rendering.\n\nGiven these considerations, the following search API calls will be most relevant:\n\n- `search_code(code_str: \"\\\\mathrm\")`: This will find instances of `\\mathrm` in the codebase, helping us identify files, classes, or methods where standard text formatting in LaTeX is applied.\n  \n- `search_code(code_str: \"\\\\text\")`: This will locate instances of `\\text`, shedding light on where adaptive text formatting in LaTeX is preferred.\n\nThese initial searches should provide a broad overview of where and how these LaTeX commands are integrated into the project's LaTeX printing routines.

What does this part of the code do?**\n\n- The code snippets identify two helper classes, `_erfs` and `_eis`, within the `error_functions.py` file of the `sympy` library. These helpers seem to be designed for making the error functions and specific integrals (`\\mathrm{erf}(z)`, `\\mathrm{Ei}(z)`, and `\\mathrm{li}(z)`) more tractable for symbolic computation, particularly for use with the Gruntz algorithm for calculating limits.\n\n**2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n- The use of `\\mathrm` in these snippets indicates a standard approach to formatting these functions in a mathematically accurate manner within Latex expressions. The key issue mentioned in the bug is the inconsistency in using `\\mathrm` and `\\text` across the project and the desire to standardize this and potentially make it configurable.\n\n**3. What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n- Ideally, for these specific mathematical functions, the text should be consistently formatted in a way that correctly represents mathematical symbols within Latex rendered output. Whether using `\\mathrm` or `\\text` should depend on a preferred standard or be configurable as per the user's need, possibly affecting how these functions are presented in Latex documentation or within symbolic computation outputs.\n\n### Analysis of `\\text` Usage:\n\n**Found in:** `sympy/integrals/meijerint_doc.py`\n\n**1. What does this part of the code do?**\n\n- The identified code within `meijerint_doc.py` is involved in dynamically generating documentation for Meijer G-functions integrals. It includes constructing Latex expressions where conditions (`if` statements) or symbols are rendered using `\\text`, allowing the text to be formatted according to the surrounding math font in the generated documentation.\n\n**2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n- These snippets highlight the use of `\\text` for integrating textual information within mathematical expressions in a way that harmonizes with the rest of the math-font, reflecting the adaptability aspect mentioned in the issue's description. The examination is critical for addressing the inconsistency issue, revealing a particular scenario where `\\text` is favored over `\\mathrm`.\n\n**3. What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n- This part is expected to seamlessly merge text with mathematical notation in documentation, ensuring that any textual content (like conditions) matches the overall style and font of the mathematical expressions. This adaptability should ideally be preserved or standardized based on the library's configuration, making it important for deciding on the default behavior and configurability in the context of the issue.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nGiven the information from analyzing these code snippets, the next steps could involve making decisions regarding:\n\n- **Standardization:** Choosing between `\\mathrm` and `\\text` as the default for the project. This could lean towards `\\text` for its adaptability but requires consideration for the broader implications on documentation and symbol representation.\n  \n- **Configurability:** Implementing a configurable option for users to specify their preference between `\\text` and `\\mathrm`. This may involve refactoring the existing uses or providing a utility function that abstracts away the choice, used across the project wherever textual content in math expressions needs to be formatted.\n\nIn essence, the snippets underscore the usage scenarios of both Latex commands across different contexts, informing the necessary considerations for addressing the issue at hand."

To resolve the issue, either maintain the use of `\\mathrm` as the standard due to its simplicity and lack of additional package dependencies or introduce a helper function/utility method within this file (or at a more global scope accessible by this file) that abstracts away the choice between `\\text` and `\\mathrm`. This method should allow for configuration at the library level, determining which command to use based on user preference or a global setting. The existing functionality of rendering mathematical expressions accurately should be preserved, with added flexibility for font adaptiveness where required.\n\n- **Location 2:** File: `sympy/integrals/meijerint_doc.py`\n\n  **Intended Behavior:** Here, the `\\text` command is used to adapt the font of textual content within mathematical expressions in dynamic documentation. The intended behavior should ensure that any conditional statements or symbols added to the documentation continue to match the style of the surrounding maths content. Implementing a similar helper function/utility method that chooses between `\\text` and `\\mathrm` based on a configurable setting would standardize the approach and potentially enhance adaptability. This utility method should be used wherever such textual content is integrated with mathematical expressions to ensure consistency and configurability throughout the project. The method should default to `\\text` to preserve the adaptiveness with the math font but allow for `\\mathrm` if specified by the user or the project settings.\n\nThe resolution involves ensuring the flexibility and consistency of textual representation in mathematical expressions across the project, aligning with user expectations and the diverse needs of math rendering within the library."
