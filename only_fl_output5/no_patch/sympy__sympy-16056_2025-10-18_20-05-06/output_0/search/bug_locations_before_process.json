To resolve the issue, either maintain the use of \\mathrm as the standard due to its simplicity and lack of additional package dependencies or introduce a helper function/utility method within this file (or at a more global scope accessible by this file) that abstracts away the choice between \\text and \\mathrm. This method should allow for configuration at the library level, determining which command to use based on user preference or a global setting. The existing functionality of rendering mathematical expressions accurately should be preserved, with added flexibility for font adaptiveness where required."

        "intended_behavior": "Here, the \\text command is used to adapt the font of textual content within mathematical expressions in dynamic documentation. The intended behavior should ensure that any conditional statements or symbols added to the documentation continue to match the style of the surrounding maths content. Implementing a similar helper function/utility method that chooses between \\text and \\mathrm based on a configurable setting would standardize the approach and potentially enhance adaptability. This utility method should be used wherever such textual content is integrated with mathematical expressions to ensure consistency and configurability throughout the project. The method should default to \\text to preserve the adaptiveness with the math font but allow for \\mathrm if specified by the user or the project settings."
