It seems like there should be one that is standard and that it should be possible to change that by configuration.\n### \\text\n* **Pro** adapts the font to the used math-font, not necessarily a Roman font\n* **Con** Relies on the `amsmath` (or some other `ams*` package\n### \\mathrm\n* **Pro** works in default LaTeX without importing any packages\n* **Con** always gives a Roman (Serif) font, even if the current math font is not Roman\nSome quick grep:ing tells us that there are 123 instances of `\\mathrm` and 46 instances of `\\text` in the .py-files.\nIdeally, this should be configurable, but even then we need to decide on a standard. Personally, I will set it to `\\text` the second it is implemented, but the package dependency may be confusing for newer users. (It seems like both options works in e.g. iPython but I have not explicitly tested, just not noted any issue.)\nProbably the easiest way to implement it is to add a helper function `print_text` or something so people do not have to test at every single instance.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand where and how the `\\mathrm` and `\\text` commands are currently used within the LaTeX printing routines of the project. This entails identifying key functions, classes, or files where these LaTeX commands are prominently featured. We should prioritize locating any centralized LaTeX printing functions or classes, as changes here could affect the entire project. Given the nature of the issue, it's likely that these LaTeX commands are not scattered randomly but are instead used within specific contexts related to mathematical or scientific printing.\n\nFirst, let's gather context on how text is being printed in mathematical contexts throughout the project:\n\n1. **Search for `\\mathrm` usage:** Since `\\mathrm` is used more frequently according to the issue description, identifying where it's used can give us insight into the standard approach for rendering text within mathematical expressions.\n\n2. **Search for `\\text` usage:** Similarly, understanding where and how `\\text` is employed will highlight the cases where the text formatting adapts to the math-font, which might be crucial for certain types of mathematical documentation or rendering.\n\nGiven these considerations, the following search API calls will be most relevant:\n\n- `search_code(code_str: \"\\\\mathrm\")`: This will find instances of `\\mathrm` in the codebase, helping us identify files, classes, or methods where standard text formatting in LaTeX is applied.\n  \n- `search_code(code_str: \"\\\\text\")`: This will locate instances of `\\text`, shedding light on where adaptive text formatting in LaTeX is preferred.\n\nThese initial searches should provide a broad overview of where and how these LaTeX commands are integrated into the project's LaTeX printing routines. This information will be critical for deciding on a standard approach and for designing a configurable solution."
