            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand where and how the `\\mathrm` and `\\text` commands are currently used within the LaTeX printing routines of the project. This entails identifying key functions, classes, or files where these LaTeX commands are prominently featured. We should prioritize locating any centralized LaTeX printing functions or classes, as changes here could affect the entire project. Given the nature of the issue, it's likely that these LaTeX commands are not scattered randomly but are instead used within specific contexts related to mathematical or scientific printing.\n\nFirst, let's gather context on how text is being printed in mathematical contexts throughout the project:\n\n1. **Search for `\\mathrm` usage:** Since `\\mathrm` is used more frequently according to the issue description, identifying where it's used can give us insight into the standard approach for rendering text within mathematical expressions.\n\n2. **Search for `\\text` usage:** Similarly, understanding where and how `\\text` is employed will highlight the cases where the text formatting adapts to the math-font, which might be crucial for certain types of mathematical documentation or rendering.\n\nGiven these considerations, the following search API calls will be most relevant:\n\n- `search_code(code_str: \"\\\\mathrm\")`: This will find instances of `\\mathrm` in the codebase, helping us identify files, classes, or methods where standard text formatting in LaTeX is applied.\n  \n- `search_code(code_str: \"\\\\text\")`: This will locate instances of `\\text`, shedding light on where adaptive text formatting in LaTeX is preferred.\n\nThese initial searches should provide a broad overview of where and how these LaTeX commands are integrated into the project's LaTeX printing routines. This information will be critical for deciding on a standard approach and for designing a configurable solution."
