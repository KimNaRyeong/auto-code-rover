So it would require documentation changes, release notes, and a deprecation period.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the API calls provides significant insight into the issue and the existing codebase.\n\n### Analysis of `make_key` Method\n\nThe `make_key` method appears in `django/core/cache/backends/base.py` under the `BaseCache` class. This method is responsible for constructing the cache key used by all other methods in the cache backend. It allows for a custom key function to be provided at the time of cache construction or for subclassing the cache backend to provide custom key-making behavior. The presence of `version` argument handling in the method suggests cache keys can be versioned, which is a flexible feature for managing cache entries.\n\n**Relation to the Issue**: The issue aims to streamline the process of generating and validating cache keys by creating a helper function that integrates both `make_key` and `validate_key` functionalities. The `make_key` method's responsibility for constructing cache keys makes it a critical component of this new helper function.\n\n**Intended Behavior**: In the context of the issue, the `make_key` method's functionality will be retained but should be invoked within the proposed `make_and_validate_key` method to ensure keys are generated and validated in a single step.\n\n### Analysis of `validate_key` Method\n\nThe search results indicate that the `validate_key` method is defined in `django/core/cache/backends/base.py` and `django/core/cache/backends/memcached.py`, suggesting it's a common validation mechanism across different cache backends. While the specific code of `validate_key` wasn't retrieved, its presence across multiple backends underscores its importance in ensuring cache keys meet certain criteria or standards before being used, which could relate to format, character restrictions, or other validation rules necessary for the cache backend's proper operation.\n\n**Relation to the Issue**: Incorporating `validate_key` alongside `make_key` within the new helper function is essential for maintaining the validation logic's integrity every time a cache key is generated. This simultaneous invocation adheres to the issue's goal of reducing repetitiveness while ensuring consistency in key validation.\n\n### Absence of Direct `make_key` and `validate_key` Invocation Together\n\nThe attempt to find the direct invocation pattern `key = self.make_key(key, version=version)\\nself.validate_key(key)` yielding no results suggests that this pattern might either be used in a more complex context or spread across the code in a way that the search query couldn't directly capture. This absence highlights the necessity of the proposed helper function to encapsulate this behavior to ensure it's consistently applied across the codebase.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the inability to directly find instances where `make_key` and `validate_key` are used sequentially, it would be prudent to:\n\n1. **Search for Individual Usages**: Investigate how each method is called within the codebase contextually. This could involve looking for functions or methods where `make_key` is followed by other logic before `validate_key` is called, which might not strictly adhere to the direct sequence searched previously.\n   \n2. **Review Implementation in Backends**: Given the presence of `validate_key` in specific backends like `memcached.py`, it would be beneficial to review how these backends implement `validate_key` to ensure the helper function is broadly applicable across various backend types.\n\n3. **Understand `BaseCache` Class**: Further exploration of the `BaseCache` class and its methods could provide insights into how best to integrate the `make_and_validate_key` function without disrupting existing functionalities.\n\nThe primary goal moving forward is to ensure the integration of the helper function does not only simplify the code but also aligns with current usages and practices within the project."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Bug Location 1: \n   - **File**: django/core/cache/backends/base.py\n   - **Class**: BaseCache\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Add a new method named `make_and_validate_key` to this class. The purpose of this method is to streamline the generation and validation of cache keys into a single, reusable function, which adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. This method will internally call the existing `make_key` method to generate a cache key based on given parameters, and immediately afterwards, it will invoke the `validate_key` method to ensure the generated key meets all necessary criteria defined for cache keys within the system. This approach not only simplifies the codebase by reducing repetition of the `make_key` and `validate_key` invocation pattern but also ensures consistency and reliability in key validation across different parts of the application where cache keys are generated and used. The method's signature will likely match the following declaration:\n\n```python\ndef make_and_validate_key(self, key, version=None):\n    key = self.make_key(key, version=version)\n    self.validate_key(key)\n    return key\n```\n\nThis new method will serve as a consolidated way to generate and validate cache keys within the application, ensuring both steps are always performed together and thus reducing the risk of unvalidated keys being used due to developer oversight or code evolution."
