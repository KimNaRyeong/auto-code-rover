So it would require documentation changes, release notes, and a deprecation period.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about the implementation of cache backends, specifically around the methods `make_key` and `validate_key`, and how they are currently utilized within the codebase. Additionally, understanding the structure of the base cache backend is crucial for introducing a new helper method. Here are the API calls we should make to collect this context:\n\n1. **Search for the `make_key` method in the entire codebase**: This will give us an idea of where and how this method is used and whether it's consistently implemented across different backends.\n   - `search_method(\"make_key\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `validate_key` method in the entire codebase**: Since the issue suggests that `validate_key` is always called after `make_key`, understanding its usage will help ensure the proposed helper method aligns with current practices.\n   - `search_method(\"validate_key\")`\n\n3. **Search for instances where both `make_key` and `validate_key` are used together**: This helps to identify the repetitiveness of the pattern that the helper method seeks to address.\n   - `search_code(\"key = self.make_key(key, version=version)\\nself.validate_key(key)\")`\n\nThis selection of API calls should provide a solid foundation of the current state of these methods and their usage pattern, allowing for a well-informed approach to introducing the `make_and_validate_key` helper function."
