        "intended_behavior": "Add a new method named `make_and_validate_key` to this class. The purpose of this method is to streamline the generation and validation of cache keys into a single, reusable function, which adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. This method will internally call the existing `make_key` method to generate a cache key based on given parameters, and immediately afterwards, it will invoke the `validate_key` method to ensure the generated key meets all necessary criteria defined for cache keys within the system. This approach not only simplifies the codebase by reducing repetition of the `make_key` and `validate_key` invocation pattern but also ensures consistency and reliability in key validation across different parts of the application where cache keys are generated and used. The method's signature will likely match the following declaration: def make_and_validate_key(self, key, version=None): key = self.make_key(key, version=version) self.validate_key(key) return key This new method will serve as a consolidated way to generate and validate cache keys within the application, ensuring both steps are always performed together and thus reducing the risk of unvalidated keys being used due to developer oversight or code evolution."
