        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `validate` method within the `ForeignKey` class should be updated to use the `_base_manager` instead of the `_default_manager` for validation. This change ensures that the validation logic includes all records, without the constraints applied by the `_default_manager` which may exclude certain records due to custom filtering (such as excluding archived articles in the issue's context).\n\nThe specific lines:\n```python\nqs = self.remote_field.model._default_manager.using(using).filter(\n    **{self.remote_field.field_name: value}\n)\n```\nshould be altered to utilize `_base_manager`, becoming:\n```python\nqs = self.remote_field.model._base_manager.using(using).filter(\n    **{self.remote_field.field_name: value}\n)\n```\nThis modification will allow `ForeignKey` fields to validate against the full breadth of associated models, including those that may be filtered out by a model's default querying logic, thus addressing the validation issue for scenarios where users are allowed to select from entries that are normally excluded by custom managers.\n\nIt's important to preserve the existing functionality for cases where the default manager behavior is expected. An additional parameter or a settings flag might be considered if there needs to be backward compatibility or configurability regarding which manager `ForeignKey.validate` uses, but based on the issue description, the direct switch to `_base_manager` is the targeted resolution."
