This is because the ForeignKey validation always uses _default_manager instead of _base_manager. The user facing error message is \"article instance with id 123 does not exist.\" (quite confusing to typical users). The code for this validation is here:\n\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/94f63b926fd32d7a7b6e2591ef72aa8f040f25cc/django/db/models/fields/related.py#L917-L919\nThe FavoriteAriclesForm is specifically designed to use a different manager, but the ForeignKey validation makes this difficult.\nIn this example scenario, it is not acceptable to change the model's default manager as the default should avoid archived articles in other typical scenarios.\nSuggested solution: the ForeignKey validation should use the _base_manager instead which does not include the default filters.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue adequately, we need to collect more context around several parts of the Django framework mentioned in the issue. Specifically, we will focus on the implementation of `ForeignKey.validate()`, the use of managers (`ArticleManager`), and the form where the problem occurs. We aim to understand how `ForeignKey.validate()` currently functions and to explore where and how we might adjust its behavior to utilize `_base_manager` for validation instead of `_default_manager`. \n\nLet's outline the API calls to make:\n\n1. Search for the `ForeignKey` class in the Django codebase to understand its structure and the current implementation of the `validate()` method. \n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"ForeignKey\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the `ForeignKey.validate()` method is the core of the issue, we'll retrieve more context about its implementation directly from the indicated file and line numbers.\n\n   ```python\n   get_code_around_line(\"django/db/models/fields/related.py\", 918, 10)\n   ```\n\n3. To get a deeper understanding of how managers are defined and used within models, particularly to differentiate between `_default_manager` and `_base_manager`, let's examine the `ArticleManager` class. Given that this might not be directly in Django's code but rather in the example provided, this is more about understanding how `ArticleManager` diverges from Django's built-in managers, but we'll try to see if there's a direct declaration or similar example in Django's code for educational purposes.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"ArticleManager\")\n   ```\n\n4. Lastly, since the form `FavoriteArticlesForm` is central to the workflow and error encountered, understanding how forms manage and apply managers to queryset in ForeignKey fields will be helpful. Although this form might be specific to the user's application, any form working similarly in Django's documentation or examples could provide insights. Therefore, we'll look for methods that allow modification of `queryset` for model fields in forms. \n\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"queryset\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches aim to gather comprehensive information around the ForeignKey validation mechanism related to manager use, the behavior of custom managers in Django, and form handling of ForeignKey fields' querysets."

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. The `ForeignKey` Class in Django\n\n- **What it does:** The `ForeignKey` class in Django is used for defining a database foreign key relationship. It inherits from `ForeignObject` and has many specific attributes and methods for managing relations, handling validations, preparing database values, and supporting model form fields.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The `ForeignKey.validate()` method within this class is directly related to the issue. This method is responsible for validating the association between the ForeignKey field and its related model. According to the issue description, the bug is that this validation does not consider objects handled by the `_base_manager`, but rather by `_default_manager`.\n\n- **Intended behavior:** The intended behavior, as proposed in the issue, is for `ForeignKey.validate()` to use the `_base_manager` for performing validations rather than the `_default_manager`. This change aims to ensure that even objects that are not typically included in the queryset (like archived articles in the provided example) due to custom manager filters can still be validated correctly.\n\n#### 2. `ForeignKey.validate()` Method Context\n\n- **What it does:** The collected context around the `ForeignKey.validate()` method reveals its operation mode. It uses the `_default_manager` of the related model to filter and validate if the passed `value` (the ForeignKey value) corresponds to an existing record.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The core issue described revolves around this specific practice of using `_default_manager` for fetching and validating records. The `_default_manager` might exclude certain records based on custom filters defined in custom managers, like the `ArticleManager`'s exclusion of archived articles.\n\n- **Intended behavior:** Considering the issue, `ForeignKey.validate()` should utilize `_base_manager` to include all possible records without the application of filters set by the custom or default managers, ensuring validations pass for cases like archived articles.\n\n#### 3. `ArticleManager` and Related Managers\n\n- **What it does:** Though the search did not find the `ArticleManager` class in the Django codebase, which is expected since it\u2019s a user-defined manager, we can infer its purpose based on the issue description. Custom managers like `ArticleManager` allow for overriding the default queryset to include or exclude records based on custom logic.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The `ArticleManager` is likely filtering out certain records (archived articles), which should still be valid targets for a `ForeignKey` field in some contexts.\n\n- **Intended behavior:** The existence and use of managers like `ArticleManager` accentuate the need for `ForeignKey.validate()` to operate in a way that either considers such custom querying logic optional or bypasses it altogether for validation purposes, hence the suggestion to use `_base_manager`.\n\n#### 4. Queryset Modifications and the `queryset` Method\n\n- **What it does:** The mention of queryset modifications and the `queryset` method indicates how querysets can be manipulated in Django, typically for filtering purposes. \n\n- **Relationship to the bug:** Though not directly impacting the `ForeignKey.validate()` method, the ability to manipulate querysets is central to understanding why one might want `validate()` to operate using `_base_manager`\u2014to ensure it considers the complete set of records beyond the subset presented by custom managers.\n\n- **Intended behavior:** The knowledge of how querysets are manipulated emphasizes the broader requirement that validation logic in foreign keys should be flexible enough to accommodate records beyond the default scope defined by custom or default managers.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nThe issue's resolution requires modifying the `ForeignKey.validate()` method from using `_default_manager` to `_base_manager`. This aligns with the need to validate foreign key references against the entire set of possible records, not just those filtered by custom logic in certain contexts.\n\nGiven the analysis, the next steps would involve preparing a patch for the `ForeignKey.validate()` method to address this requirement. However, this alteration must be carefully considered for its impact on Django's broader ORM behaviors and existing applications relying on the current validation logic."

This change ensures that the validation logic includes all records, without the constraints applied by the `_default_manager` which may exclude certain records due to custom filtering (such as excluding archived articles in the issue's context).\n\n    The specific lines:\n    ```python\n    qs = self.remote_field.model._default_manager.using(using).filter(\n        **{self.remote_field.field_name: value}\n    )\n    ```\n    should be altered to utilize `_base_manager`, becoming:\n    ```python\n    qs = self.remote_field.model._base_manager.using(using).filter(\n        **{self.remote_field.field_name: value}\n    )\n    ```\n    This modification will allow `ForeignKey` fields to validate against the full breadth of associated models, including those that may be filtered out by a model's default querying logic, thus addressing the validation issue for scenarios where users are allowed to select from entries that are normally excluded by custom managers. \n\n    It's important to preserve the existing functionality for cases where the default manager behavior is expected. An additional parameter or a settings flag might be considered if there needs to be backward compatibility or configurability regarding which manager `ForeignKey.validate` uses, but based on the issue description, the direct switch to `_base_manager` is the targeted resolution."
