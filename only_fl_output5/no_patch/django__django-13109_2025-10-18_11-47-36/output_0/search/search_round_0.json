This is because the ForeignKey validation always uses _default_manager instead of _base_manager. The user facing error message is \"article instance with id 123 does not exist.\" (quite confusing to typical users). The code for this validation is here:\n\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/94f63b926fd32d7a7b6e2591ef72aa8f040f25cc/django/db/models/fields/related.py#L917-L919\nThe FavoriteAriclesForm is specifically designed to use a different manager, but the ForeignKey validation makes this difficult.\nIn this example scenario, it is not acceptable to change the model's default manager as the default should avoid archived articles in other typical scenarios.\nSuggested solution: the ForeignKey validation should use the _base_manager instead which does not include the default filters.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue adequately, we need to collect more context around several parts of the Django framework mentioned in the issue. Specifically, we will focus on the implementation of `ForeignKey.validate()`, the use of managers (`ArticleManager`), and the form where the problem occurs. We aim to understand how `ForeignKey.validate()` currently functions and to explore where and how we might adjust its behavior to utilize `_base_manager` for validation instead of `_default_manager`. \n\nLet's outline the API calls to make:\n\n1. Search for the `ForeignKey` class in the Django codebase to understand its structure and the current implementation of the `validate()` method. \n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"ForeignKey\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the `ForeignKey.validate()` method is the core of the issue, we'll retrieve more context about its implementation directly from the indicated file and line numbers.\n\n   ```python\n   get_code_around_line(\"django/db/models/fields/related.py\", 918, 10)\n   ```\n\n3. To get a deeper understanding of how managers are defined and used within models, particularly to differentiate between `_default_manager` and `_base_manager`, let's examine the `ArticleManager` class. Given that this might not be directly in Django's code but rather in the example provided, this is more about understanding how `ArticleManager` diverges from Django's built-in managers, but we'll try to see if there's a direct declaration or similar example in Django's code for educational purposes.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"ArticleManager\")\n   ```\n\n4. Lastly, since the form `FavoriteArticlesForm` is central to the workflow and error encountered, understanding how forms manage and apply managers to queryset in ForeignKey fields will be helpful. Although this form might be specific to the user's application, any form working similarly in Django's documentation or examples could provide insights. Therefore, we'll look for methods that allow modification of `queryset` for model fields in forms. \n\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"queryset\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches aim to gather comprehensive information around the ForeignKey validation mechanism related to manager use, the behavior of custom managers in Django, and form handling of ForeignKey fields' querysets."
