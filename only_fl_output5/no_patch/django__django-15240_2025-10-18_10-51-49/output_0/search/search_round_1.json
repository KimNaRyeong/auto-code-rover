This can be problematic if naming duplication occurs:\nExample:\nI have an app with:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial.py\n0002_blah.py\n0003_blah.py\nI squash and delete replaced migrations:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial_squashed_0003_blah.py\nI create a new migration and use poor naming:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial_squashed_0003_blah.py\n0002_blah.py\nMy new migration never runs because the django_migrations table thinks it has already been applied.\nI propose truncation of the django_migrations table so that it includes only migrations that actually exist in the django project. This could be done automatically (when executor runs, or inside the migrate mcommand). Or have its own mcommand that requires it be run manually. I prefer the automatic approach though.\nPros:\nCleans up old data that just bloats the database.\nProtects users from the trap mentioned above where a new migration is created with the same name as one that was applied in the past.\nCons:\nA loss of historical information.\nNote:\nNeed to be careful with implementation to avoid a possible new trap if a user squashes migrations and then proceeds to delete the replaced migrations before running the squashed migrations on their database -> django will think squashed migrations haven't been applied and will attempt to reapply them. This can be remedied simply by not removing migrations mentioned in replaces lists of other migrations from django_migrations (ie. we'd consider replaced migrations as still existing, even if their actual files have already been removed).\n</issue>"

        "content": "The collected context provides us with valuable insights into Django's migration system, particularly how migrations are executed and recorded in the `django_migrations` table. Let's analyze this information in relation to the reported issue.\n\n### Analysis of `MigrationExecutor` and `apply_migration`\n\nThe `MigrationExecutor` class is a crucial part of Django\u2019s migration system. It's responsible for managing the application and rollback of migrations. The method `apply_migration` within this class specifically handles the forward application of migrations. The code snippet reveals that:\n\n1. **Functionality**: This method applies a migration to the database. If the migration is not marked as fake, it makes actual changes to the database schema within a schema editor context (`schema_editor`). After applying the migration, it records the migration as applied using the `record_migration` method if certain conditions are met (for example, if there are no deferred SQL commands to run after schema changes).\n\n2. **Relation to the Bug**: The issue arises when old migrations, which are no longer present due to squashing, still exist in the `django_migrations` table. This situation can prevent new migrations with identical names from being applied because Django thinks these migrations have already been executed. The `apply_migration` method and its interactions with the migration recording logic (such as `record_migration`) are directly relevant because the proposed solution involves altering how migrations are recorded, especially considering squashed and deleted migrations.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: Given the issue, the intended behavior would involve introducing a mechanism to ensure the `django_migrations` table reflects only existing migrations. This might involve checking existing migration files against entries in the `django_migrations` table before marking a migration as applied, or providing a cleanup routine to remove records of migrations that no longer exist from the table.\n\n### Analysis of `django_migrations` References\n\nThe references to `django_migrations` found in `recorder.py` and `executor.py` suggest that these files are involved in recording which migrations have been applied and possibly managing the `django_migrations` table.\n\n1. **Functionality of References**: These references likely pertain to the creation, update, or query operations on the `django_migrations` table to track the state of each migration. This is crucial for Django to understand the current state of the database schema and decide which migrations need to be applied or rolled back.\n\n2. **Relation to the Bug**: Since the issue involves entries in the `django_migrations` table that do not correspond to actual migration files (due to deletion after squashing), understanding how these references work is key to resolving the issue. Specifically, any logic that adds, checks, or removes entries in this table is directly related to the bug.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: The solution to the issue might involve enhancing the logic around these references to ensure the `django_migrations` table is accurately maintained. This could mean introducing additional checks during the migration apply process to verify the existence of migration files, or a separate cleanup command that removes records of deleted migrations, carefully handling migrants mentioned in the `replaces` attribute of squashed migrations.\n\nGiven the analysis, it's clear we need detailed insights into how migrations are recorded (via `record_migration` and interactions with `django_migrations` in `recorder.py`) and potentially more context on squashing mechanisms, despite not finding a direct match for `squashmigrations`. Further investigation could look into how squashed migrations are handled and recorded, and how the system can be enhanced to avoid the problem described in the issue.\n\nNext steps might involve API calls to:\n- Explore `record_migration` in `MigrationExecutor` for understanding migration recording logic more deeply.\n- Examine the code in `recorder.py` to understand how the `django_migrations` table is managed, specifically looking at methods interacting with this table."

If the file does not exist but the migration is still about to be recorded (ideal for squashed migrations that are replaced), it should check if the migration is listed as a replacement (`replaces` attribute in a migration file). If it's a case of naming conflict (identical naming as a previously squashed and deleted migration), then extra care should be taken not to skip applying it by mistake. Additionally, there could be an automatic cleanup process either before or after migrations are applied to remove any records from `django_migrations` that do not have a corresponding migration file in the project and are not mentioned in the `replaces` list of an existing migration.\n\n   - **Location 2**: \n     - **File**: Not specifically identified yet but likely would involve `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n     - **Class**: `MigrationRecorder`\n     - **Intended Behavior**: Introduce a new method or adjust existing logic to facilitate the cleanup of the `django_migrations` table to only include migrations that either exist in the Django project or are referenced in the `replaces` attribute of squashed migrations. This method should be carefully designed to run as part of the migration application process without causing disruptive behavior, such as accidentally re-applying squashed migrations. Ideally, it would be a part of the migration application process (possibly hooked in the `MigrationExecutor` workflow) to ensure the database reflects only the migrations that are relevant to the current state of the project.\n\nThese modifications aim to preserve the integrity of the migration history in the `django_migrations` table while preventing potential issues arising from naming conflicts due to deleted (specifically, squashed and removed) migrations."
