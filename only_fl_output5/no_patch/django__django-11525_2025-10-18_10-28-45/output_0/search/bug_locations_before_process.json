If the structure is incorrect, the function should raise a clear and descriptive error early on. This validation will ensure developers are immediately aware of misconfigurations in their ADMINS setting, thus preventing runtime errors related to email sending failures. The existing functionality of sending an email to the admins should be preserved after validation confirms the settings are correctly formatted."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to mail_admins, include a validation step for the MANAGERS setting before proceeding with email construction and delivery. This validation should check for the setting's adherence to its expected format (a list of tuples featuring a name and an email address for each entry). If a misconfiguration is detected, the function will raise an informative error at an early stage. This change aims to maintain the pre-existing functionality of emailing managers while ensuring the MANAGERS setting's correctness is verified early in the process."
