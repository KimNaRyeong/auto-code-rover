This issue just arose on a project I've been working on, and it goes as follows:\nOur MANAGERS setting was set like so:\nMANAGERS = ['one@example.com', 'two@example.com']\nAnd after calling mail_managers, the result was:\nsmtplib.SMTPRecipientsRefused: {'=?utf-8?q?h?=': (550, b'5.1.1 <=?utf-8?q?h?=>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table'), '=?utf-8?q?u?=': (550, b'5.1.1 <=?utf-8?q?u?=>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table')}\nAfter some investigation it became clear that this setting was in the improper format, but that was only because of \u200bthis StackOverflow post. It would be nice if Django failed early if this setting was detected but improperly set, rather than waiting until the consequences become apparent.\nThank you,\nKevin\n</issue>"

The same could potentially happen with `mail_admins()` if `ADMINS` were misconfigured. \n\nGiven the implementation details, currently, neither `mail_admins()` nor `mail_managers()` performs any validation on the email addresses (or their formats) provided under `ADMINS` or `MANAGERS` settings. They simply accept the settings as provided, resulting in the application failing at a later stage when the emails fail to be sent.\n\n### Intended Behavior Post-Fix\n\nBased on the issue description:\n\n- **Validation**: A pre-validation step should be introduced to ensure early detection of misconfigurations in `ADMINS` and `MANAGERS` settings. The format expected by Django for these settings is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the name and email address of an administrator or manager. The issue experienced by the user implies a lack of such validation.\n\nThe intended behavior should be failing early with an informative error if the settings do not conform to the expected format (e.g., if they are provided as a list of strings instead of a list of tuples). This change would guide developers in correcting their configurations without waiting for the email sending to fail, ultimately enhancing developer experience by providing clearer guidance and avoiding confusing SMTP errors.\n\nImplementing such a change would involve adding validation logic either directly within the `mail_admins()` and `mail_managers()` functions or within a helper function invoked by both, to check the formats of `ADMINS` and `MANAGERS` before proceeding with email preparation and sending."

If the structure is incorrect, the function should raise a clear and descriptive error early on. This validation will ensure developers are immediately aware of misconfigurations in their `ADMINS` setting, thus preventing runtime errors related to email sending failures. The existing functionality of sending an email to the admins should be preserved after validation confirms the settings are correctly formatted.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - File: `django/core/mail/__init__.py`\n  - Method: `mail_managers`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Similar to `mail_admins`, include a validation step for the `MANAGERS` setting before proceeding with email construction and delivery. This validation should check for the setting's adherence to its expected format (a list of tuples featuring a name and an email address for each entry). If a misconfiguration is detected, the function will raise an informative error at an early stage. This change aims to maintain the pre-existing functionality of emailing managers while ensuring the `MANAGERS` setting's correctness is verified early in the process.\n\nThese enhancements will not alter the core functionality of sending emails but will improve error handling and configuration validation, leading to a more robust and developer-friendly system."
