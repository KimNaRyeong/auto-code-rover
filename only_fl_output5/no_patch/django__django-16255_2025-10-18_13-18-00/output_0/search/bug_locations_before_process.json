        "intended_behavior": "The method get_latest_lastmod should be modified to handle the case when there are no items in the sitemap without raising an unhandled ValueError. To resolve the issue, the method should catch both TypeError and ValueError exceptions. If either exception is caught, the method should return None. This ensures that the method gracefully handles scenarios where self.items() is an empty sequence and preserves existing functionality by still throwing an exception for other unforeseen errors. This change aligns the code behavior with the expected outcome of not crashing on empty sitemaps while trying to calculate the maximum lastmod date."
