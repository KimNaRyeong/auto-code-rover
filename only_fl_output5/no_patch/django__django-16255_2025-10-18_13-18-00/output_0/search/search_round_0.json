        "content": "To better understand the context and where to apply the suggested patch for the issue related to generating sitemaps in Django, we need to gather context from the Django project source code regarding classes and methods mentioned in the issue. Here is the plan of API calls to obtain relevant code:\n\n1. Search for the `Sitemap` class to understand its structure and methods: we suspect this is where `get_latest_lastmod` method would be defined.\n   - `search_class(\"Sitemap\")`\n\n2. Since the issue details point to the `get_latest_lastmod` method and its attempt to handle an empty sequence when invoking `max()`, we need to check the implementation of this method.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"get_latest_lastmod\", \"Sitemap\")`\n\n3. The error trace mentions several files and methods. Understanding the sequence of calls leading to the error could also require looking at the sitemap view handling, specifically in `views.py`.\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"index\", \"django/contrib/sitemaps/views.py\")`\n\n4. The issue mentions changes related to error handling in the `get_latest_lastmod` method to handle both `TypeError` and `ValueError`. It might be helpful to see the current handling of exceptions in this method.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"except TypeError:\", \"django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py\")`\n\nThese API calls should give us a comprehensive understanding of the problem, how the `get_latest_lastmod` method works, and where to insert the proposed try-except block modification."
