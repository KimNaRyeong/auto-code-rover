Certainly! So, based on the details mentioned, I'll craft a `reproducer.py` file that should be compatible as a standalone script, making adjustments to ensure it does not rely on an existing Django project settings module by defining a minimal Django setup inline. This file will attempt to reproduce the issue of a WHERE block missing entirely when filtering on an `Exists` subquery with an empty queryset. On encountering the issue, the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace. It will exit with code 0 if the issue is resolved.

Here's how you could set it up:

```python
import os
import sys
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models

# Dynamically configure Django settings
settings.configure(
    DEBUG=True,
    DATABASES={
        "default": {
            "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
            "NAME": "db.sqlite3",
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=[
        __name__,  # Add this script as an app to enable model discovery
    ],
    USE_TZ=True,
)

# Initialize Django
django.setup()

# Define the model inside the script to avoid external dependencies
class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

    class Meta:
        app_label = __name__

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Mimic the problematic queryset
        qs = MyModel.objects.filter(~models.Exists(MyModel.objects.none()), name='test')
        query_str = str(qs.query)

        # Check and assert based on the issue definition
        if "WHERE" not in query_str:
            raise AssertionError("The WHERE block is missing from the query.")

        print("Query generated correctly, issue not detected.")
    
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error indicating the issue is present
    
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Handle any other exception

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with success if the issue is not detected
```

This script includes a minimal setup required to create and use a Django model without relying on an existing Django project structure. It directly configures Django settings within the script itself and defines a model for the purpose of the test. Note that this approach has some limitations and simplifications for the sake of a reproducible demonstration. Ensure that you have Django installed in your environment (`pip install django`) before running this script. Adjust the database settings as necessary for your testing environment.
