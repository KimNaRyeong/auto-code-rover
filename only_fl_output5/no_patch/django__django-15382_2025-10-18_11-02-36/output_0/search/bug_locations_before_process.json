This might involve inspecting how the `EmptyResultSet` is used or generated within this method and ensuring that the existence of conditions outside of the `Exists` clause (e.g., `name='test'`) still results in their inclusion in the final compiled SQL query. The method might need to explicitly handle cases where the queryset is known to be empty in such a way that it doesn't lead to the complete omission of other valid query parts."

It's possible that optimizations or early return patterns in this file assume no need for further query construction upon encountering an `EmptyResultSet`, without considering other accompanying filter conditions that remain valid."
