Below is a `reproducer.py` standalone Python file tailored to reproduce the reported issue. This script is designed to be run in a Django project environment. Please ensure you have Django and django-debug-toolbar installed and properly configured in your project before running this script. The script aims to simulate the issue described, verifying the presence of the problem by checking if the generated SQL query lacks a `WHERE` clause when it should not. If the issue is present, it will print a stack trace; otherwise, it will exit gracefully.

```python
import os
import django
from django.db import models
from django.core.exceptions import EmptyResultSet

# Configure Django settings
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project.settings')
django.setup()

# Define a simple model for demonstration
class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Main function to reproduce the issue
def main():
    try:
        # Attempt to filter MyModel using an Exists subquery with an empty queryset
        qs = MyModel.objects.filter(~models.Exists(MyModel.objects.none()), name='test')
        
        # Print generated query for inspection
        print(f"Generated Query: {str(qs.query)}")
        
        # Check for empty result set exception or missing WHERE clause as per issue description
        if str(qs.query) == "EmptyResultSet":
            raise AssertionError("EmptyResultSet issue detected")
        
        query_str = str(qs.query)
        if "WHERE" not in query_str:
            raise AssertionError("WHERE block is missing from the query")
    
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code if assertion error is raised (issue is present)
    else:
        print("Issue not detected, exiting normally.")
        exit(0)  # Exit normally if no issue is detected
```

Before running this script, replace `'your_project.settings'` with the actual path to your Django project's settings module. This script assumes the presence of a Django model `MyModel` and attempts to execute a query that would exhibit the reported issue, based on details provided. If the environment or model setup differs significantly from your setup, adjustments may be necessary.
