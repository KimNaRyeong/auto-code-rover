Decimal numbers are converted to float instead.\nPull request is prepared \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/15863\n</issue>"

        "content": "To understand the bug and potentially identify where the fix needs to be applied, we need to gather related information about the `floatformat` filter implementation in the Django codebase, how `Decimal` numbers are managed, and also any interaction within template rendering. With this in mind, I will use the search APIs as follows:\n\n1. Since the issue mentions the `floatformat` filter, we need to find out in which file this filter is implemented. As it is a template filter, it will likely be defined in a class related to template tags or filters:\n\n```\nsearch_method(\"floatformat\")\n```\n\n2. The issue description states that Decimal numbers are incorrectly converted to float. Given this information, I'll search for code snippets where `Decimal` is converted to `float`, as fixing the issue will likely involve modifying this conversion process:\n\n```\nsearch_code(\"Decimal(\")\nsearch_code(\".to_float(\")\n```\n\n3. Furthermore, since the issue involves template rendering, understanding how the `Template` and `Context` classes work with filters would be beneficial, meaning we should find their implementations as well:\n\n```\nsearch_class(\"Template\")\nsearch_class(\"Context\")\n```\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive overview of the necessary parts of the codebase to understand and address the issue effectively."
