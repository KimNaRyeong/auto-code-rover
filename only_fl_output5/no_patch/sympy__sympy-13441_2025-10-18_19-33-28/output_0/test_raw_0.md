Below is a Python file named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue described. When executed, it attempts to replicate the slow performance in the `count_ops` function for large expressions. The script is structured to throw an `AssertionError` if the issue exists by checking the performance threshold. If the issue is resolved and the performance is within the expected limit, it exits with code 0. Additionally, it uses the provided function to print a clear stack trace of the issue.

```python
# reproducer.py
import time
from pydy.models import n_link_pendulum_on_cart

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_count_ops_speed():
    try:
        sys = n_link_pendulum_on_cart(4)
        x_dot = sys.eom_method.rhs()
        start_time = time.time()
        jac = x_dot.jacobian(sys.states)
        elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
        # Assuming a performance threshold for the operation (in seconds)
        performance_threshold = 5  # Adjust based on expected performance metrics
        assert elapsed_time < performance_threshold, "count_ops is slow for large expressions."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e from None  # Comment this if you want to continue execution after printing stack trace

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_count_ops_speed()
```

This script sets up a specific environment to test the performance of the `count_ops` function with a heavy computational task derived from creating a Jacobian matrix of a 4 link pendulum system on a cart. The performance threshold (5 seconds in this example) is arbitrary and should be adjusted based on what is considered acceptable for your use case. 

**Note**: Before running this script, ensure that you have the `pydy` library installed and properly set up in your environment. You might need to install or configure other dependencies related to your project or development environment. Additionally, the performance threshold is just a placeholder; it might need adjustment based on hardware capabilities and expectations of what constitutes a "slow" operation within your context.
