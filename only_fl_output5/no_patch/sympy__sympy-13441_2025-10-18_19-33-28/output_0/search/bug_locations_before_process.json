        "intended_behavior": "The method should efficiently compute the Jacobian matrix, especially for large symbolic expressions. Performance optimizations may involve checking for and exploiting sparsity in the matrix, reducing the complexity of symbolic expressions before differentiation, or implementing more efficient algorithms for symbolic differentiation and simplification. The goal is to ensure that `jacobian` computations are optimized for speed without losing accuracy, particularly when operating on large systems like those described in the issue."

        "intended_behavior": "While not directly implicated in the bug description, given the mention of `count_ops` being slow and the performance issues tied to computing derivatives (which `jacobian` heavily depends on), optimizing `count_ops` might indirectly improve overall performance. This function should efficiently count the operations in large expressions without significantly impacting computational performance. Potential improvements could include optimizing the traversal of the expression tree, caching results for repeated subexpressions, or heuristics to estimate operation counts without exhaustive analysis. The intention is to preserve or enhance the method's functionality to return a reliable operation count while minimizing its impact on performance, particularly in computationally intense scenarios like those faced by `jacobian`."
