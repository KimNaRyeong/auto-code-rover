I understand you're looking for a corrected script to specifically address the scenario where `count_ops` becomes slow for large expressions. Given my previous oversight, let's correct the pathway focusing more accurately on simulating the environment and behavior that would trigger the performance issue concerning the `count_ops` function directly, without depending on an external package that was erroneously referenced earlier.

Since the original issue seems to be deeply related to how Sympy's `count_ops` function performs with large expressions, this adjusted script will engage with Sympy more directly:

```python
# reproducer.py
import time
import sympy as sp

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def generate_large_expression(size=1000):
    x = sp.symbols('x')
    expr = 1
    for i in range(1, size):
        expr += x**i/i
    return expr

def test_count_ops_performance():
    try:
        large_expr = generate_large_expression()
        start_time = time.time()
        ops_count = sp.count_ops(large_expr)
        elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time
        # Assuming a performance threshold for the operation (in seconds)
        performance_threshold = 5  # Adjust based on expected performance metrics
        assert elapsed_time < performance_threshold, "count_ops is slow for large expressions."
        print(f"count_ops executed in {elapsed_time} seconds, which is within the acceptable threshold.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e from None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_count_ops_performance()
```

This script creates a large symbolic expression using Sympy and then measures the time taken by `count_ops` to count the operations within that expression. If the execution time exceeds a predefined threshold, it prints a stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. The performance threshold is set at 5 seconds, but this value can be adjusted depending on the expected performance criteria for your particular environment or hardware configuration.

**Requirements**: To run this script, ensure that Sympy is installed in your Python environment.
- You can install Sympy using pip: `pip install sympy`

**Execution**: Place `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project and run it with:
- `python3 reproducerer.py`

If the issue persists (execution time exceeds the threshold), the script will throw an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace. If the problem does not occur (execution time is within bounds), it concludes with a printed message indicating a successful performance check.
