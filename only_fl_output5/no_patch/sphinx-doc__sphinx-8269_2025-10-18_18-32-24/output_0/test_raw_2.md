Given the need to address the issue directly without relying on Sphinx internals and focusing on a script that needs to function in a standalone manner without requiring the execution environment to have Sphinx or other dependencies pre-installed, the approach has to be different. This script will manually create a minimal Sphinx configuration, run the Sphinx build process with `subprocess`, and then analyze the output explicitly looking for the presence of the reported issue.

However, the previous issue with the script indicated missing dependencies, notably `docutils` which is a core dependency for Sphinx. Since managing dependencies falls outside the scope of a simple standalone script without external command invocations (like pip install), I'll adjust the approach to ensure the script checks for the presence and readiness of its environment first.

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_dependencies():
    try:
        import sphinx
        import docutils
    except ImportError as e:
        print("Missing dependencies. Please ensure Sphinx and docutils are installed.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

def setup_sphinx_project():
    project_dir = "test_proj"
    os.makedirs(project_dir, exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs(os.path.join(project_dir, "source"), exist_ok=True)
    with open(os.path.join(project_dir, "source", "conf.py"), "w") as conf_file:
        conf_file.write("extensions = []\n")  # Minimal config
        conf_file.write("\nlinkcheck_anchors = True\n")  # Issue-related config
    with open(os.path.join(project_dir, "source", "index.rst"), "w") as index_file:
        index_file.write("`foo <https://google.com/test.txt#test>`_")  # Test link

    return project_dir

def run_sphinx_build(project_dir):
    try:
        command = ["sphinx-build", "-b", "linkcheck", os.path.join(project_dir, "source"), os.path.join(project_dir, "build")]
        result = subprocess.run(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
        return result.stdout + result.stderr
    except Exception as e:
        print("Failed to run sphinx-build.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

def verify_output(output):
    expected_string = "404 Client Error: Not Found for url"
    incorrect_string = "Anchor 'test' not found"
    try:
        assert expected_string in output, "Expected HTTP error not found."
        assert incorrect_string not in output, "Incorrectly reported anchor instead of HTTP error."
        print("Issue not present, linkcheck behaves as expected.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_dependencies()
    project_dir = setup_sphinx_project()
    output = run_sphinx_build(project_dir)
    verify_output(output)
```

This script takes a simpler approach by assuming a local installation of Sphinx and its dependencies (with `docutils` explicitly mentioned). It sets up a minimal Sphinx project programmatically, avoiding the use of Sphinx utilities like `sphinx-quickstart`, which limits external dependencies and complexity. Please ensure Sphinx and `docutils` are correctly installed in your environment before running this script.
