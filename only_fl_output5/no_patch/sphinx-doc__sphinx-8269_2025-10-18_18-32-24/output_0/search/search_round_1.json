The issue suggests that when `linkcheck_anchors` is enabled, and a link with an anchor results in an HTTP error, the error reported is misleading, indicating that the anchor was not found rather than reporting the HTTP error.\n\nTo get started, the relevant classes and methods are likely involved in requesting URLs, parsing the response, and deciding what error to report. Given this, we might need to look into classes or methods that handle link checking, HTTP requests, error handling, and configuration options.\n\nLet's use the following API calls to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"LinkCheckWorker\")` - This class could be responsible for the actual link checking, including issuing HTTP requests and processing responses.\n2. `search_method(\"check_uri\")` - This method might be the one that performs the URI check, including fetching the URI and determining the outcome.\n3. `search_code(\"linkcheck_anchors\")` - Since the issue is specifically about how the `linkcheck_anchors` configuration option changes the behavior of reporting errors, searching for this configuration option within the codebase may reveal where and how it's used to alter error reporting logic."

The `check_uri` function seems to handle the checking of individual URIs/URLs for link validity, including processing anchors when `linkcheck_anchors` is `True`. It splits the URL into the base URI and the anchor part, checks and encodes non-ASCII URIs, manages authentication, and chooses between a HEAD or GET request based on the presence of an anchor and its configuration settings.\n2. When `linkcheck_anchors` is `True`, and an anchor is present, it performs a GET request to read the whole document and checks if the specified anchor exists in the response.\n3. It has error handling for HTTP errors, distinguishing between various HTTP status codes (e.g., 401 and 503) and other types of exceptions, including SSL errors. \n\n#### Relationship between this code part and the bug\n\nThe bug describes a situation where an HTTP error message is expected, but the reported error is about an anchor not being found. Given the provided code, the process does involve anchor verification and HTTP status checking, but it seems like the error response for HTTP errors (especially for 404 Not Found or 500 Internal Server Error) might not be correctly prioritized or reported when anchors are involved. \n\n#### Intended behavior\n\nThe intended behavior, based on the issue, would be to accurately report the nature of the failure. If an HTTP error occurs (404, 500, etc.), this should be reported directly, regardless of whether an anchor is present or not. The current logic appears to prioritize anchor checking even when an HTTP error would be more relevant to report. Given that the same URI check attempts to differentiate between multiple outcomes (SSL error, unauthorized, service unavailable, redirected URL), it indicates a design to handle and report various issues distinctly. The issue suggests that HTTP errors are not being reported as expected in cases involving anchors.\n\n### Next Steps for a Patch\n\nGiven this analysis, a patch might involve modifying the error handling in the `check_uri` function to ensure that HTTP errors have priority in reporting over anchor existence checks, or at least that the HTTP status code is included in the error message regarding anchors not being found. \n\nThis suggests a more intricate look into:\n\n- How HTTP errors are caught and reported in the context of anchor checking (`lines 164-195`).\n- How the logic could be adjusted so that an HTTP error status results in an immediate error response, potentially before or alongside anchor existence checks.\n- Ensuring that the user is informed about the primary issue (HTTP error) along with any secondary issues (anchor not found) in a clear manner.\n\nTo move forward towards crafting a patch, it would be necessary to develop a clearer understanding of how `response.raise_for_status()` interacts with anchor checking and to consider structuring the logic to prioritize reporting HTTP errors or to clearly report both issues without masking one with the other."

Specifically:\n   - When an HTTP error is encountered (e.g., a 404 or 500 error status), this error should be reported directly and take precedence over an anchor not being found. This means adjusting the try-except blocks to ensure HTTPError exceptions are handled in a way that prioritizes their output to the user.\n   - In cases where both an HTTP error occurs and an anchor is missing, the error message should clearly indicate the HTTP error first, as this is the root cause of the failure to locate the anchor.\n   - Preserve the functionality to check anchors, but modify the flow or the error handling to ensure HTTP status codes are reported accurately upfront. This might involve checking the status code right after the request is made and before proceeding to anchor checking.\n   - Ensure that any redirection is still handled correctly, as the current functionality appears to support reporting redirected URLs, which should remain unaffected by changes to error reporting logic.\n\nThese adjustments would address the issue by ensuring that the primary cause of a link check failure is reported accurately, aligning the behavior with user expectations and the reported issue's request for clearer error messaging."
