        "content": "To address the reported issue effectively, we should gather more context about how the Sphinx `linkcheck` feature is implemented, particularly how it handles checking anchors and reporting errors. The issue suggests that when `linkcheck_anchors` is enabled, and a link with an anchor results in an HTTP error, the error reported is misleading, indicating that the anchor was not found rather than reporting the HTTP error.\n\nTo get started, the relevant classes and methods are likely involved in requesting URLs, parsing the response, and deciding what error to report. Given this, we might need to look into classes or methods that handle link checking, HTTP requests, error handling, and configuration options.\n\nLet's use the following API calls to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"LinkCheckWorker\")` - This class could be responsible for the actual link checking, including issuing HTTP requests and processing responses.\n2. `search_method(\"check_uri\")` - This method might be the one that performs the URI check, including fetching the URI and determining the outcome.\n3. `search_code(\"linkcheck_anchors\")` - Since the issue is specifically about how the `linkcheck_anchors` configuration option changes the behavior of reporting errors, searching for this configuration option within the codebase may reveal where and how it's used to alter error reporting logic."
