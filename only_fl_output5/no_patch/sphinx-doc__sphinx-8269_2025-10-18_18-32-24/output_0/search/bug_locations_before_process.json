        "intended_behavior": "The logic within the 'check_uri' function needs to be adjusted to better handle and differentiate between HTTP errors and anchor checking errors. Specifically:\n- When an HTTP error is encountered (e.g., a 404 or 500 error status), this error should be reported directly and take precedence over an anchor not being found. This means adjusting the try-except blocks to ensure HTTPError exceptions are handled in a way that prioritizes their output to the user.\n- In cases where both an HTTP error occurs and an anchor is missing, the error message should clearly indicate the HTTP error first, as this is the root cause of the failure to locate the anchor.\n- Preserve the functionality to check anchors, but modify the flow or the error handling to ensure HTTP status codes are reported accurately upfront. This might involve checking the status code right after the request is made and before proceeding to anchor checking.\n- Ensure that any redirection is still handled correctly, as the current functionality appears to support reporting redirected URLs, which should remain unaffected by changes to error reporting logic."
