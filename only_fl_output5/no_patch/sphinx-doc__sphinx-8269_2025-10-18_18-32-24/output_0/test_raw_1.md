Given the feedback on the previous script and the error encountered due to missing dependencies, I'll simplify the approach for reproducing the issue without specifically calling into Sphinx's internal Python API or relying on it being installed in the same environment. This will make the script more focused on setting up a reproducible environment and then running the `sphinx-build` command, assuming that Sphinx is installed and accessible in the execution environment.

Below is the adjusted standalone Python script, `reproducer.py`, which meets your criteria:

```python
import subprocess
import os

def setup_environment():
    """
    Setup a minimal Sphinx project environment for reproducing the issue.
    """
    os.makedirs('source', exist_ok=True)
    with open('source/conf.py', 'w') as f:
        f.write("project = 'proj'\n")
        f.write("author = 'me'\n")
        f.write("release = '1.0'\n")
        f.write("language = 'en'\n")
        f.write("linkcheck_anchors = True\n")
    with open('source/index.rst', 'w') as f:
        f.write('`foo <https://google.com/test.txt#test>`_\n')

def run_linkcheck():
    """
    Runs the sphinx-build linkcheck command and returns its output.
    """
    result = subprocess.run(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'linkcheck', 'source', '_build'], capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result.stdout, result.stderr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    setup_environment()
    stdout, stderr = run_linkcheck()
    output = stdout + stderr
    
    expected_error = "404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://google.com/test.txt"
    if expected_error in output:
        print("Issue fixed.")
        exit(0)  # Issue is fixed
    else:
        error_msg = "Error: Expected HTTP error reporting but got different output."
        print_stacktrace(AssertionError(error_msg))
        exit(1)  # Issue persists

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This script does the following:
1. Sets up a minimal Sphinx project structure programmatically, including a simple `conf.py` with `linkcheck_anchors` set to `True` and an `index.rst` file referring to a non-existent anchor on an external URL.
2. Runs the Sphinx `linkcheck` using a subprocess call and captures its output.
3. Verifies whether the expected HTTP error message is present in the output and concludes whether the issue is fixed based on that.
4. `print_stacktrace` is used to display error details clearly if the expected output is not found.

Please ensure Sphinx is installed in your environment where you are running this script. Otherwise, you can install Sphinx using pip:

```bash
pip install sphinx
```

Execute this script in the root directory of your project. If there is an issue with the Sphinx environment or dependencies, please ensure they are correctly installed and accessible in your Python environment.
