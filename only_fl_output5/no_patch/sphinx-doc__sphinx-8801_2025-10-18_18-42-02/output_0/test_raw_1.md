Given the previous misunderstanding, let's adjust the approach to specifically target the documented issue concerning Sphinx autodoc functionality. To address this, I will craft a more appropriate `reproducer.py` script that checks for the presence of the inherited attribute `attr1` in the Sphinx-generated documentation. This script will need to ensure that Sphinx is executed correctly, taking into account any potential errors in the Sphinx build process which was overlooked in the previous script. 

To directly address the error in ensuring that the documentation build process is correctly initiated and verified, the script will also include checks for the existence of key files and directories before attempting to open them. It's also vital to tailor the verification to the specific issueâ€”ensuring that `attr1` from the superclass is documented for `Bar`.

Here's an adjusted script:

```python
# reproducerer.py
import os
import subprocess
import sys

def setup_sphinx_environment():
    # Creating a minimal Sphinx project environment
    with open('conf.py', 'w') as f:
        f.write("""
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))
extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']
project = 'Test Autodoc'
master_doc = 'index'
html_theme = 'alabaster'
""")

    with open('index.rst', 'w') as f:
        f.write("""
.. autoclass:: example.Bar
   :members:
   :inherited-members:
""")

    with open('example.py', 'w') as f:
        f.write("""
class Foo:
    \"\"\"docstring\"\"\"
    attr1: int  #: docstring for attr1

class Bar(Foo):
    \"\"\"docstring\"\"\"
    attr2: str  #: docstring for attr2
""")

def build_docs():
    # Build the Sphinx documentation.
    process = subprocess.run(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', '.', '_build'], capture_output=True, text=True)
    if process.returncode != 0:
        # Report Sphinx build errors
        raise Exception(f"Sphinx Build Failed: {process.stderr}")

def verify_documentation():
    attr1_doc_path = os.path.join('_build', 'html', 'example.Bar.html')
    if not os.path.isfile(attr1_doc_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Expected documentation file '{attr1_doc_path}' was not found.")
    
    with open(attr1_doc_path, 'r') as html_file:
        if "attr1" not in html_file.read():
            raise AssertionError("The attribute 'attr1' from the superclass 'Foo' is not documented in 'Bar' as expected.")

def main():
    setup_sphinx_environment()
    try:
        build_docs()
        verify_documentation()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("The documentation issue is fixed.")

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script includes:

1. A setup for a minimal Sphinx project that targets the issue.
2. A revised mechanism to build the Sphinx documentation and properly handle errors.
3. A focused approach to verify whether the documentation of the inherited `attr1` attribute is present for `Bar`, which is necessary to test the reported issue accurately.
4. A corrected function to display stack traces for better debuggability of potential issues during the execution of the script.
