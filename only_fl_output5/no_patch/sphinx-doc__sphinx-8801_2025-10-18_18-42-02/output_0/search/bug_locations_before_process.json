Specifically, the logic that determines member documentation status should take into account the existence of annotations as a valid form of documentation, particularly for inherited members. This may entail: Adjusting the `is_filtered_inherited_member` logic to consider members with only annotations (and optionally, associated comments) as documented. Ensuring that such members are not filtered out if the `undoc-members` option is not set, reflecting a broader definition of what is considered \"documented\"."

This includes: Improving how members are identified and marked as \"inherited\". This might require updating the conditionals that check if a member should be included based on `want_all` and `options.inherited_members` settings. Ensuring that annotation-only members are recognized as part of the object's members when `inherited_members` is active, possibly by augmenting how members are collected and processed (e.g., considering annotation presence as a criterion for inclusion)."
