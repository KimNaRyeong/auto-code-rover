        "content": "<issue>Make getting a topocentric ITRS position easier\n### What is the problem this feature will solve?\nRight now, it is not easy to create ITRS coordinates for sources relative to a given location (rather than geocentric), to the level that we have specific instructions on how to calculate relative `CartesianCoordinates` and then put these into an `ITRS`: https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/coordinates/common_errors.html#altaz-calculations-for-earth-based-objects\nThis has led to numerous issues, the latest of which is #12678\n### Describe the desired outcome\nIt would be nice if as part of `EarthLocation.get_itrs()` it would be possible to get a topocentric rather than a geocentric position. In #12678, @tomfelker and @mkbrewer [suggested](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/12678#issuecomment-1463366166) (and below) to extend `.get_itrs()` to take not just an `obstime` but also a `location` argument, with an implementation along [the following lines](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/12678#issuecomment-1464065862):\n> the idea would be to simply add a `location` argument to `get_itrs()` that defaults to `None`. Then if a location is provided, `get_itrs()` would return a topocentric ITRS frame containing the difference between the object's position and that of the `location` argument. One could also use `EARTH_CENTER` as the default and always return the difference.\n### Additional context\nSee #12768. Labeling this a good first issue since it is easy code wise. However, writing the tests and documentation will require understanding of how ITRS and the associated coordinate transformations work.\n</issue>"

This would allow the calculation of topocentric positions by taking the difference between the object's geocentric position and the specified location's geocentric position.\n\n### Intended Behavior\n- Ideally, the `get_itrs` method should be able to accept an additional `location` argument. When provided, the method should calculate the topocentric position of the `EarthLocation` instance relative to this location, instead of its geocentric position. This involves computing the difference between the positions of the current `EarthLocation` object and the provided `location` argument and returning this difference in an ITRS frame.\n\nConsidering that \"CartesianCoordinates\" was not found, it suggests the term may not directly correspond to a class or function in the Astropy library or it might be referred to in a different manner within the implementation. Given the context, we might need further information or clarification on how positions are represented or how such a calculation could be implemented within Astropy's framework. \n\nTo proceed, we might want to look into the `ITRS` class or similar constructs that deal with coordinate frames and transformations to better understand how to implement topocentric position calculations. Another logical step would be to explore how differences between positions are currently calculated within the library to see if existing functionality can be adapted or extended for this feature. \n\nHence, the next API call could be:\n- search_class(\"ITRS\")"

When the `location` argument is provided, the method should return the topocentric position as an `ITRS` object by computing the difference between the current `EarthLocation` object's position and that of the provided `location`. This difference should then be used to create and return a new `ITRS` object reflecting the topocentric coordinates. If `location` is not provided, the `get_itrs` method should behave as it currently does, maintaining backward compatibility by defaulting to calculate the geocentric position. This intended behavior will address the issue by simplifying the generation of topocentric ITRS positions directly via the `EarthLocation` class, thereby making it easier for users to perform calculations that are currently cumbersome and error-prone."
