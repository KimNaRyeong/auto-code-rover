Given the details, I'll proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `EarthLocation` class to understand its current structure and methods, as `get_itrs()` is likely a part of this class or closely related to it.\n2. Search for the `get_itrs` method to see where it's implemented and how it is currently used.\n3. Since the issue mentions `CartesianCoordinates`, it might be useful to look into how they are currently being implemented or used, particularly in relation to `EarthLocation` or `get_itrs()`.\n\nLet's start with these API calls:\n\n- search_class(\"EarthLocation\")\n- search_method(\"get_itrs\")\n- search_code(\"CartesianCoordinates\")"
