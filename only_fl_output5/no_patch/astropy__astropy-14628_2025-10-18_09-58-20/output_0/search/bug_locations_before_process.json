        "intended_behavior": "The `get_itrs` method should be enhanced to accept an additional optional argument `location` which, if provided, would enable the calculation of the topocentric ITRS position relative to the given location. When the `location` argument is provided, the method should return the topocentric position as an `ITRS` object by computing the difference between the current `EarthLocation` object's position and that of the provided `location`. This difference should then be used to create and return a new `ITRS` object reflecting the topocentric coordinates. If `location` is not provided, the `get_itrs` method should behave as it currently does, maintaining backward compatibility by defaulting to calculate the geocentric position. This intended behavior will address the issue by simplifying the generation of topocentric ITRS positions directly via the `EarthLocation` class, thereby making it easier for users to perform calculations that are currently cumbersome and error-prone."
