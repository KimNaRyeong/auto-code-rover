Inspecting the globals and source code of `f` shows us why we get the result:\n```python\n>>> import inspect\n>>> print(inspect.getsource(f))\ndef _lambdifygenerated(A):\nreturn (I + A)\n>>> f.__globals__['I']\n1j\n```\nThe code printer prints `I`, which is currently being interpreted as a Python built-in complex number. The printer should support printing identity matrices, and signal an error for unsupported expressions that might be misinterpreted.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue highlighted in the bug report, we would need to understand several aspects of the current implementation: How `lambdify` translates symbolic expressions to numpy expressions, where `Identity` and `MatrixSymbol` classes are handled, and how the code printer differentiates between different types of symbols, such as identifying `I` as the complex unit rather than the identity matrix. Let's collect necessary information using the given APIs.\n\n1. Identify where the `lambdify` function is implemented in the codebase to understand its mechanism for converting expressions.\n2. Find the implementation details of the `Identity` class to understand how identity matrices are represented within the library.\n3. Look for the usage of `MatrixSymbol` to observe how matrix symbols are handled during expression transformations.\n4. Determine how the code printer is implemented to see why it misinterprets the identity matrix as a complex number.\n\nHere are the API calls to gather the required information:\n\n- `search_method(\"lambdify\")`: This will help us find the implementation of `lambdify`.\n- `search_class(\"Identity\")`: To get details on how identity matrices are represented and possibly transformed.\n- `search_class(\"MatrixSymbol\")`: To understand the representation and handling of matrix symbols within expressions.\n- `search_code(\"I + A\")`: Since the issue specifically mentions the misinterpretation of `I` in the context of `I + A`, searching for this code snippet might lead us directly to the problematic part of the code printer or expression transformer logic."
