        "method": "lambdify",
        "intended_behavior": "The `lambdify` function should handle the translation of the `Identity` matrix symbolically represented in SymPy expressions to the appropriate numeric identity matrix in the chosen numerical library (e.g., NumPy). When the `Identity` class instance is encountered within an expression, `lambdify` should map it to `numpy.eye(n)` for NumPy, ensuring that the numeric evaluation correctly interprets it as an identity matrix. This translation logic might require enhancing the namespace translation or the implementation of custom handling for `Identity` within the `LambdaPrinter` or relevant printer class to preserve its matrix identity correctly across symbolic to numeric translation."
