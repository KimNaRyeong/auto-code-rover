This Python script attempts to replicate the described issue with `lambdify` misinterpreting some matrix expressions when using SymPy and numpy. Upon executing `reproducer.py`, it will conduct the test to see if `lambdify` mishandles the identity matrix expression as described. The script exits with code 1 if it encounters an error indicating the issue is present, including misinterpreting the identity matrix or encountering an unexpected result from the `lambdify` function. If the issue has been resolved, meaning no errors are raised, and the output is as expected, it exits with code 0, signaling the test passed.
