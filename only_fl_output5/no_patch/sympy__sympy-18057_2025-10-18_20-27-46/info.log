78 def sympify(a, locals=None, convert_xor=True, strict=False, rational=False,
79         evaluate=None):
80     """Converts an arbitrary expression to a type that can be used inside SymPy.
81 
82     For example, it will convert Python ints into instances of sympy.Integer,
83     floats into instances of sympy.Float, etc. It is also able to coerce symbolic
84     expressions which inherit from Basic. This can be useful in cooperation
85     with SAGE.
86 
87     It currently accepts as arguments:
88        - any object defined in SymPy
89        - standard numeric python types: int, long, float, Decimal
90        - strings (like "0.09" or "2e-19")
91        - booleans, including ``None`` (will leave ``None`` unchanged)
92        - dict, lists, sets or tuples containing any of the above
93 
94     .. warning::
95         Note that this function uses ``eval``, and thus shouldn't be used on
96         unsanitized input.
97 
98     If the argument is already a type that SymPy understands, it will do
99     nothing but return that value. This can be used at the beginning of a
100     function to ensure you are working with the correct type.
101 
102     >>> from sympy import sympify
103 
104     >>> sympify(2).is_integer
105     True
106     >>> sympify(2).is_real

112     True
113     >>> sympify("2e-45").is_real
114     True
115 
116     If the expression could not be converted, a SympifyError is raised.
117 
118     >>> sympify("x***2")
119     Traceback (most recent call last):
120     ...
121     SympifyError: SympifyError: "could not parse u'x***2'"
122 
123     Locals
124     ------
125 
126     The sympification happens with access to everything that is loaded
127     by ``from sympy import *``; anything used in a string that is not
128     defined by that import will be converted to a symbol. In the following,
129     the ``bitcount`` function is treated as a symbol and the ``O`` is
130     interpreted as the Order object (used with series) and it raises
131     an error when used improperly:
132 
133     >>> s = 'bitcount(42)'
134     >>> sympify(s)
135     bitcount(42)
136     >>> sympify("O(x)")
137     O(x)
138     >>> sympify("O + 1")
139     Traceback (most recent call last):
140     ...
141     TypeError: unbound method...
142 
143     In order to have ``bitcount`` be recognized it can be imported into a
144     namespace dictionary and passed as locals:
145 
146     >>> from sympy.core.compatibility import exec_
147     >>> ns = {}
148     >>> exec_('from sympy.core.evalf import bitcount', ns)
149     >>> sympify(s, locals=ns)
150     6
151 
152     In order to have the ``O`` interpreted as a Symbol, identify it as such
153     in the namespace dictionary. This can be done in a variety of ways; all
154     three of the following are possibilities:
155 
156     >>> from sympy import Symbol
157     >>> ns["O"] = Symbol("O")  # method 1
158     >>> exec_('from sympy.abc import O', ns)  # method 2
159     >>> ns.update(dict(O=Symbol("O")))  # method 3
160     >>> sympify("O + 1", locals=ns)
161     O + 1
162 
163     If you want *all* single-letter and Greek-letter variables to be symbols
164     then you can use the clashing-symbols dictionaries that have been defined
165     there as private variables: _clash1 (single-letter variables), _clash2
166     (the multi-letter Greek names) or _clash (both single and multi-letter
167     names that are defined in abc).
168 
169     >>> from sympy.abc import _clash1
170     >>> _clash1
171     {'C': C, 'E': E, 'I': I, 'N': N, 'O': O, 'Q': Q, 'S': S}
172     >>> sympify('I & Q', _clash1)
173     I & Q
174 
175     Strict
176     ------
177 
178     If the option ``strict`` is set to ``True``, only the types for which an
179     explicit conversion has been defined are converted. In the other
180     cases, a SympifyError is raised.
181 
182     >>> print(sympify(None))
183     None
184     >>> sympify(None, strict=True)
185     Traceback (most recent call last):
186     ...
187     SympifyError: SympifyError: None
188 
189     Evaluation
190     ----------
191 
192     If the option ``evaluate`` is set to ``False``, then arithmetic and
193     operators will be converted into their SymPy equivalents and the
194     ``evaluate=False`` option will be added. Nested ``Add`` or ``Mul`` will
195     be denested first. This is done via an AST transformation that replaces
196     operators with their SymPy equivalents, so if an operand redefines any
197     of those operations, the redefined operators will not be used.
198 
199     >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5')
200     19/3
201     >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5', evaluate=False)
202     2**2/3 + 5
203 
204     Extending
205     ---------
206 
207     To extend ``sympify`` to convert custom objects (not derived from ``Basic``),
208     just define a ``_sympy_`` method to your class. You can do that even to
209     classes that you do not own by subclassing or adding the method at runtime.
210 
211     >>> from sympy import Matrix
212     >>> class MyList1(object):
213     ...     def __iter__(self):
214     ...         yield 1
215     ...         yield 2
216     ...         return
217     ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]
218     ...     def _sympy_(self): return Matrix(self)
219     >>> sympify(MyList1())
220     Matrix([
221     [1],
222     [2]])
223 
224     If you do not have control over the class definition you could also use the
225     ``converter`` global dictionary. The key is the class and the value is a
226     function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy
227     object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.
228 
229     >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!
230     ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!
231     ...         yield 1
232     ...         yield 2
233     ...         return
234     ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]
235     >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter
236     >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)
237     >>> sympify(MyList2())
238     Matrix([
239     [1],
240     [2]])
241 
242     Notes
243     =====
244 
245     The keywords ``rational`` and ``convert_xor`` are only used
246     when the input is a string.
247 
248     Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions
249     that are very different in structure than what was entered. Until such
250     autosimplification is no longer done, the ``kernS`` function might be of
251     some use. In the example below you can see how an expression reduces to
252     -1 by autosimplification, but does not do so when ``kernS`` is used.
253 
254     >>> from sympy.core.sympify import kernS
255     >>> from sympy.abc import x
256     >>> -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1
257     -1
258     >>> s = '-2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1'
259     >>> sympify(s)
260     -1
261     >>> kernS(s)
262     -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1

82     For example, it will convert Python ints into instances of sympy.Integer,
83     floats into instances of sympy.Float, etc. It is also able to coerce symbolic
84     expressions which inherit from Basic. This can be useful in cooperation
85     with SAGE.
86 
87     It currently accepts as arguments:
88        - any object defined in SymPy
89        - standard numeric python types: int, long, float, Decimal
90        - strings (like "0.09" or "2e-19")
91        - booleans, including ``None`` (will leave ``None`` unchanged)

95         Note that this function uses ``eval``, and thus shouldn't be used on
96         unsanitized input.
97 
98     If the argument is already a type that SymPy understands, it will do
99     nothing but return that value. This can be used at the beginning of a

121     SympifyError: SympifyError: "could not parse u'x***2'"
122 
123     Locals
124     ------
125 
126     The sympification happens with access to everything that is loaded
127     by ``from sympy import *``; anything used in a string that is not
128     defined by that import will be converted to a symbol. In the following,
129     the ``bitcount`` function is treated as a symbol and the ``O`` is
130     interpreted as the Order object (used with series) and it raises
131     an error when used improperly:
132 
133     >>> s = 'bitcount(42)'
134     >>> sympify(s)
135     bitcount(42)
136     >>> sympify("O(x)")
137     O(x)
138     >>> sympify("O + 1")
139     Traceback (most recent call last):
140     ...
141     TypeError: unbound method...
142 
143     In order to have ``bitcount`` be recognized it can be imported into a
144     namespace dictionary and passed as locals:
145 
146     >>> from sympy.core.compatibility import exec_
147     >>> ns = {}
148     >>> exec_('from sympy.core.evalf import bitcount', ns)
149     >>> sympify(s, locals=ns)
150     6
151 
152     In order to have the ``O`` interpreted as a Symbol, identify it as such
153     in the namespace dictionary. This can be done in a variety of ways; all
154     three of the following are possibilities:
155 
156     >>> from sympy import Symbol
157     >>> ns["O"] = Symbol("O")  # method 1
158     >>> exec_('from sympy.abc import O', ns)  # method 2
159     >>> ns.update(dict(O=Symbol("O")))  # method 3
160     >>> sympify("O + 1", locals=ns)
161     O + 1
162 
163     If you want *all* single-letter and Greek-letter variables to be symbols
164     then you can use the clashing-symbols dictionaries that have been defined
165     there as private variables: _clash1 (single-letter variables), _clash2
166     (the multi-letter Greek names) or _clash (both single and multi-letter
167     names that are defined in abc).
168 
169     >>> from sympy.abc import _clash1
170     >>> _clash1
171     {'C': C, 'E': E, 'I': I, 'N': N, 'O': O, 'Q': Q, 'S': S}
172     >>> sympify('I & Q', _clash1)
173     I & Q
174 
175     Strict
176     ------
177 
178     If the option ``strict`` is set to ``True``, only the types for which an
179     explicit conversion has been defined are converted. In the other
180     cases, a SympifyError is raised.
181 
182     >>> print(sympify(None))
183     None
184     >>> sympify(None, strict=True)
185     Traceback (most recent call last):
186     ...
187     SympifyError: SympifyError: None
188 
189     Evaluation
190     ----------
191 
192     If the option ``evaluate`` is set to ``False``, then arithmetic and
193     operators will be converted into their SymPy equivalents and the
194     ``evaluate=False`` option will be added. Nested ``Add`` or ``Mul`` will
195     be denested first. This is done via an AST transformation that replaces
196     operators with their SymPy equivalents, so if an operand redefines any
197     of those operations, the redefined operators will not be used.
198 
199     >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5')
200     19/3
201     >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5', evaluate=False)
202     2**2/3 + 5
203 
204     Extending
205     ---------
206 
207     To extend ``sympify`` to convert custom objects (not derived from ``Basic``),
208     just define a ``_sympy_`` method to your class. You can do that even to
209     classes that you do not own by subclassing or adding the method at runtime.
210 
211     >>> from sympy import Matrix
212     >>> class MyList1(object):
213     ...     def __iter__(self):
214     ...         yield 1
215     ...         yield 2
216     ...         return
217     ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]
218     ...     def _sympy_(self): return Matrix(self)
219     >>> sympify(MyList1())
220     Matrix([
221     [1],
222     [2]])
223 
224     If you do not have control over the class definition you could also use the
225     ``converter`` global dictionary. The key is the class and the value is a
226     function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy
227     object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.
228 
229     >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!
230     ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!
231     ...         yield 1
232     ...         yield 2
233     ...         return
234     ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]
235     >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter
236     >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)
237     >>> sympify(MyList2())
238     Matrix([
239     [1],
240     [2]])
241 
242     Notes
243     =====
244 
245     The keywords ``rational`` and ``convert_xor`` are only used
246     when the input is a string.
247 
248     Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions
249     that are very different in structure than what was entered. Until such
250     autosimplification is no longer done, the ``kernS`` function might be of
251     some use. In the example below you can see how an expression reduces to
252     -1 by autosimplification, but does not do so when ``kernS`` is used.
253 
254     >>> from sympy.core.sympify import kernS
255     >>> from sympy.abc import x
256     >>> -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1
257     -1
258     >>> s = '-2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1'
259     >>> sympify(s)
260     -1
261     >>> kernS(s)
262     -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1

This could involve validating the string against a predefined pattern that recognizes valid symbol names and simple expressions without directly executing them through `eval`, especially for cases where the input comes from an object's `__repr__` method.
