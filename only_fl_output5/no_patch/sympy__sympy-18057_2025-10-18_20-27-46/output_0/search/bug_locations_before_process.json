        "intended_behavior": "Modify the function to handle string inputs more securely. Specifically, when converting strings that represent the names of symbols or expressions into SymPy objects, add a check to prevent arbitrary code execution. This could involve validating the string against a predefined pattern that recognizes valid symbol names and simple expressions without directly executing them through `eval`, especially for cases where the input comes from an object's `__repr__` method. The intention is to preserve the functionality of converting legitimate mathematical expressions into SymPy objects while avoiding the execution of unintended or malicious code."

        "intended_behavior": "This method should be modified to add safeguards against executing potentially harmful Python code derived from unsanitized inputs. This could include checks that the code being evaluated does not contain references to attributes or methods not intended to be accessed in this context. While preserving the ability to evaluate expressions necessary for SymPy's functionality, these modifications aim to prevent scenarios where the evaluation leads to unexpected side effects or security vulnerabilities."
