This script tests the issue described with `sympy` evaluating the representation (`repr`) of objects during equality checks within its `__eq__` method, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. It includes a specific comparison that results in an `AttributeError` due to the evaluation of the `repr` output, which should not happen. Additionally, it tests for an incorrect equality result when the `repr` of an object happens to math the string representation of a sympy symbol. The script uses assertions to signal the failure of these tests and prints the stack trace of any caught exceptions to help with debugging the issue. It is designed to exit with code 0 if and only if the issue is resolved.
