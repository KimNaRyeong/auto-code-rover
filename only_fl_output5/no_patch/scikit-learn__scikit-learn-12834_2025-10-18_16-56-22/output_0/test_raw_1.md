Based on the instructions and the requirement to avoid previous errors, we'll make a few adjustments to avoid issues encountered earlier. Notably, instead of using `from sklearn.utils.testing import assert_array_almost_equal, assert_equal`, which may cause issues due to module deprecation or changes in `sklearn`, I'll leverage basic `assert` statements which should be sufficient for our case. Moreover, to ensure the script remains standalone and maintains compatibility across different versions of `sklearn`, adjustments to error handling and imports will be made.

This script aims to mitigate the prior issue related to `ModuleNotFoundError` by removing dependencies on potentially unstable or deprecated modules and methods from `sklearn`. Instead, it uses standard Python assertions and numpy for array comparisons, which should make it more robust across different versions of scikit-learn. If the underlying issue with multi-output ensemble models receiving non-numeric DVs persists, the script will raise an error, print a detailed stack trace, and exit with code 1. If the issue is resolved, it will print "Tests passed successfully." and exit with code 0.
