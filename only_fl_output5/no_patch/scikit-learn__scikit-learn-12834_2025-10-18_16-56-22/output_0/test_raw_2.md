To write an improved `reproducer.py` script that better addresses the given task, I'll restructure the original script to specifically target the bug as described: handling multioutput ensemble models with non-numeric dependent variables (DVs) which leads to a `ValueError`. This script will forcefully demonstrate the issue when executed with a problematic `scikit-learn` version and validate the resolution once the mentioned bug is addressed in the library. 

Given the feedback, special attention will be paid to ensuring the script is standalone, managing import errors more gracefully if they arise, and properly invoking the `print_stacktrace` function to provide clear feedback on any encountered exceptions.

Here's the revised version:

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
try:
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, RandomForestRegressor
    sklearn_imported = True
except ImportError as e:
    sklearn_imported = False
    def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
        pass # Fallback when sklearn could not be imported, hence the traceback function is not used

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if sklearn_imported:
    def check_multioutput_string():
        X_train = [[-2, -1], [-1, -1], [-1, -2], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1], [-2, 1],
                   [-1, 1], [-1, 2], [2, -1], [1, -1], [1, -2]]
        y_train = [["red", "blue"], ["red", "blue"], ["red", "blue"], ["green", "green"],
                   ["green", "green"], ["green", "green"], ["red", "purple"],
                   ["red", "purple"], ["red", "purple"], ["green", "yellow"],
                   ["green", "yellow"], ["green", "yellow"]]
        X_test = [[-1, -1], [1, 1], [-1, 1], [1, -1]]

        try:
            est = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0, bootstrap=False)
            est.fit(X_train, y_train)
            print("Test failed to reproduce issue: No exception raised.")
        except ValueError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)

    check_multioutput_string()
else:
    print("Sklearn could not be imported. Ensure it's installed and built correctly.")
```

Please, make sure to have a correct `scikit-learn` environment set up before executing this script. This code is specifically designed to catch and expose issues related to multi-output classifications with non-numeric labels in ensemble models. If the setup or version of `scikit-learn` is incorrect, this could also affect the script's execution.
