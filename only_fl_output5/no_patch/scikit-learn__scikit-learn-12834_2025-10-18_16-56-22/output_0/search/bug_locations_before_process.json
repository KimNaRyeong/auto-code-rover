        "intended_behavior": "The predict method should be modified to properly handle string dependent variables (DVs) for multioutput scenarios. This can involve introducing an internal mechanism for encoding string DVs into numeric format before the prediction process and then decoding the predicted numeric outputs back to the original string labels for the final prediction output. It's essential that this behavior does not affect the current functionality for numerical DVs, thereby preserving the method's existing capabilities while extending support for non-numeric DVs."

        "method": "predict_proba",
        "intended_behavior": "In the predict_proba method, any logic directly handling the prediction probabilities needs to consider the possibility of string DVs for multioutput classifications. Since predict_proba is usually numeric, the primary concern is ensuring that any internal handling that might inadvertently assume numeric labels (e.g., during the calculation of probabilities) is robust to the actual nature of the DVs. The modification must ensure that existing functionalities for models with numeric labels remain unaffected."

The focus would be more on the preprocessing or postprocessing steps (if any) that rely on the nature of the DVs. Adjustments should be made to allow for seamless processing of both numeric and string outputs, without disrupting the method's ability to serve numeric DVs as it currently does."
