The previous guidance mentioned does not exactly fit the scenario described since the error occurs in a GUI interaction (mouse hover over the displayed image), which is not something the script can catch without manual inspection or advanced GUI testing techniques. Additionally, the script terminated without errors because it does not include logic to simulate or monitor for GUI interactions where the issue manifest.

The best approach to automate testing for such GUI-based issues involves using a framework or library designed for GUI automation testing, such as PyAutoGUI, Selenium (with appropriate extensions for desktop applications), or similar. However, these tools and approaches go beyond the simple standalone script execution and require a more complex setup, including potentially interacting with the operating system's graphical interface directly.

Since the initial request was to provide a script following specific guidelines, hereâ€™s an adjustment to the initial structure, incorporating a hypothetical function to simulate or wait for GUI interaction. Please note, this adaptation is speculative and primarily serves illustrative purposes to adhere to the format requested:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def simulate_gui_interaction():
    """
    Hypothetical function to simulate GUI interaction.
    In reality, this function would need to use a GUI automation library
    to interact with the matplotlib window, such as moving the mouse over the plot.
    """
    pass  # No implementation, as actual GUI automation is complex and case-specific


def test_imshow_negative_values_behavior():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    test = np.full((2, 1), -1)

    try:
        plt.imshow(test)
        simulate_gui_interaction()  # Pretend to hover the mouse over the plot
        plt.show()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue with displaying negative values using imshow is present.")
    else:
        print("No exception detected. Test passes but manual verification is recommended.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_imshow_negative_values_behavior()
```

This adjusted script still does not directly address the challenge of automating the reproduction of a GUI interaction-related issue. To effectively automate testing for the described problem, a practical approach would require incorporating actual GUI automation techniques, which are beyond the capabilities of a simple Python script running matplotlib operations in isolation.
