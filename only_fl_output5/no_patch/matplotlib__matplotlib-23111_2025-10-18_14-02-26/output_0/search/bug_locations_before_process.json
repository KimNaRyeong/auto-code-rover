        "intended_behavior": "This function attempts to compute significant digits for a given `value` and `delta`. The `math domain error` arises when trying to take the logarithm of a non-positive number, which occurs when `delta` <= 0. To resolve this issue, the function should check if `delta` is positive before attempting the logarithm operation. If `delta` is non-positive (<= 0), the function should gracefully handle this case to avoid a math domain error.\n\nA potential fix could include adjusting the logic to ensure `delta` is a positive number before the log calculation. For example, we might add a conditional check to set `delta` to a minimal positive value (such as `1e-10`) when it's non-positive. This would preserve the existing functionality by still allowing the calculation of significant digits but avoid the scenario leading to the domain error. The correction should maintain the logic's integrity for all other values of `delta` and `value` that do not cause an issue."
