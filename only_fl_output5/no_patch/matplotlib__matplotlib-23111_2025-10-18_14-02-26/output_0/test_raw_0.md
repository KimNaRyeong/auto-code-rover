This script attempts to reproduce the described issue by displaying an image with negative values using `imshow` from matplotlib. It follows the requester's instructions to raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present and to print the stack trace of the issue. It uses the given function `print_stacktrace` to print the stack trace clearly if an exception occurs. Note that the script assumes you would manually hover the mouse over the displayed image to trigger the error. However, detecting mouse hover events and handling GUI-related errors programmatically can be complex and might not be fully captured by this script without additional GUI automation tools or modifications to matplotlib's event loop handling, which are beyond the scope of a simple reproducer.
