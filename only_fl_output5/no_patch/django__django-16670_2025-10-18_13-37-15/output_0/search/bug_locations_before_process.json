        "intended_behavior": "Modify or enhance the ASGIStaticFilesHandler class to ensure that when serving static files, any synchronous iterators are properly converted to asynchronous iterators or handled in a manner that doesn't trigger the warning about iterator types. This could involve implementing an adaptation layer or utility within ASGIStaticFilesHandler that checks the iterator type of the response content and, if necessary, wraps it in an asynchronous iterator wrapper. This would allow the static files to be served without warnings and in an efficient manner that is compatible with ASGI's asynchronous nature."

        "intended_behavior": "Examine and possibly modify the __iter__ method or add a new method to facilitate the conversion of synchronous iterators to asynchronous ones when the response is served in an ASGI environment. This should be done in a way that checks the execution context (ASGI vs. WSGI) and applies the necessary conversion if asynchronous handling is required. This would ensure that StreamingHttpResponse and its subclasses, like FileResponse, can be used without causing warnings in an ASGI setup. The goal is to maintain backward compatibility and ensure that existing synchronous WSGI applications continue to work unchanged, while improving support for new or existing ASGI applications."
