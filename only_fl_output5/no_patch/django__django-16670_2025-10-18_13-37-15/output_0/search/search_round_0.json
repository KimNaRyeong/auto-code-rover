Use an asynchronous iterator instead.\nThis is because FileResponse is not async compatible (nor is that likely, since neither is open()).\nA new project with:\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n\"daphne\",\n...\n]\nASGI_APPLICATION = \"project.asgi.application\"\nrunserver, and then visit any page serving static files such as /admin/.\nThe fix is to have ASGIStaticFilesHandler adapt the iterator in the same way StreamingHttpResponse does.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather enough context to address the issue described, we need to understand how `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` and `StreamingHttpResponse` are implemented, and specifically, look at how they interact with iterator types. The warning suggests there's an incompatibility with how `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` handles synchronous iterators, which needs to be adapted for asynchronous iteration similar to `StreamingHttpResponse`. \n\nGiven this, the following API calls would be essential:\n\n1. Search for the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` class to see its current implementation and how it handles file responses:\n   - `search_class(\"ASGIStaticFilesHandler\")`\n\n2. Since `StreamingHttpResponse` is mentioned in relation to how it consumes iterators, we need to look at its implementation for clues on adapting iterators:\n   - `search_class(\"StreamingHttpResponse\")`\n\n3. The warning message is specifically mentioned to come from `http/response.py`. It might be beneficial to get the context around the line where the warning is raised to understand the expected iterator consumption:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"StreamingHttpResponse must consume synchronous iterators in order to serve them asynchronously.\", \"django/http/response.py\")`\n\n4. Additionally, understanding how `FileResponse` interacts with iterators could provide insight since the issue mentions that `FileResponse` is not async compatible. If there's specific handling or a workaround for `FileResponse` within `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` or `StreamingHttpResponse`, it could be a starting point for a fix:\n   - `search_class(\"FileResponse\")`\n\nThese searches should give us a comprehensive view of the components involved in the issue, allowing for a strategic approach to adapting the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` for asynchronous iteration compatibility."
