Given the objective to reproduce the issue as described and providing appropriate feedback upon encountering the issue or confirming its resolution, the following Python script serves as a refined implementation that considers the requirements for error handling, reporting, and exit codes management. This script aims to encapsulate the described problem in a standalone executable file, adhering to the provided instructions for error reporting.

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from sympy import MatrixSymbol, lambdify, init_printing

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    init_printing(use_unicode=False)

    X0 = MatrixSymbol('X0', 4, 4)  # Correct dimension matching xx
    xx = np.random.rand(4, 4)  # Generating a 4x4 matrix as intended
    
    X0Inv = X0**-1

    try:
        np.linalg.inv(xx)  # This should work without issue
    except Exception as e:
        print("Unexpected error with numpy inversion:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 indicating numpy failure, unexpected

    try:
        symInv = lambdify(X0, X0Inv, modules=["numpy"])

        # This is where the reported issue should manifest
        inv_result = symInv(xx)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Expected failure occurred with sympy lambdify inversion.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
        print("Issue resolved, inversion successful.")
        exit(0)  # Exit code 0, indicating the issue is fixed.
    except AssertionError:
        print("AssertionError: Issue reproduced as expected.") 
        exit(1)  # Exit code 1, signaling that the issue has been reproduced.
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected exception occurred:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(2)  # Exit code 2 for unexpected errors.
```

This script, when executed, attempts to invert a matrix using both NumPy and SymPy with lambdify. Specifically:

- It uses NumPy for matrix inversion, expecting no issues.
- It utilizes SymPy's `lambdify` to dynamically evaluate the inverse of a matrix symbol, `X0`, against a concrete matrix `xx`. This step is where the aforementioned issue is anticipated to occur.
- In case the inversion by `lambdify` fails as expected (given the initial description of the issue), the script captures and reports the exception, then exits with code 1 to signal the successful reproduction of the issue.
- If `lambdify` does not raise an exception (indicating a resolution to the issue), the script concludes with an exit code of 0.
- Any unexpected errors trigger the script to exit with code 2, alongside the stack trace of the unanticipated issue.

Adjustments for dimensionality were made to ensure internal consistency in the script, notably setting `X0` as a 4x4 matrix symbol to match `xx`, correcting a primary cause for type mismatches.
