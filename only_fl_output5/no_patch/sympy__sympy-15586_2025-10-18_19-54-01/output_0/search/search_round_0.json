        "content": "To address the issue related to sympy, numpy, and the error encountered when trying to get an inverted float matrix, the necessary context can be gathered through a series of search API calls focusing on the classes, methods, and code snippets mentioned in the issue:\n\n1. **Search for the `MatrixSymbol` class**: This will help us understand the properties and methods of `MatrixSymbol`, which is a key part of the issue.\n\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"MatrixSymbol\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Search for the `lambdify` function**: Since the `lambdify` function is directly implicated in the error, obtaining more details about its implementation and usage within the project can provide insight into the underlying issue.\n\n    ```python\n    search_method(\"lambdify\")\n    ```\n\n3. **Search for the usage of `lambdify` with `MatrixSymbol`**: This is a more fine-grained search to see how `lambdify` is specifically used with `MatrixSymbol`, which might reveal patterns of correct or incorrect use.\n\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"lambdify(X0,X0Inv)\")\n    ```\n\n4. **Search for the implementation of matrix inversion (`**-1`) with `MatrixSymbol`**: Since the issue involves taking the inverse of a matrix symbolically, understanding how matrix inversion is implemented could be critical.\n\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"MatrixSymbol('X0',2,2)**-1\")\n    ```\n\n5. **Search for the usage of `np.linalg.inv`**: Though the issue does not seem to directly stem from `numpy`'s `linalg.inv`, it's helpful to check how this function is used within the context of the project to ensure it's used correctly alongside sympy functions.\n\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"np.linalg.inv\")\n    ```\n\nThese searches aim to gather comprehensive context about how symbolic matrix inversion and numerical matrix inversion are handled in the project, specifically focusing on the interaction between sympy and numpy which is at the heart of the reported issue."
