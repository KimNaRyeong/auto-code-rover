        "intended_behavior": "lambdify should be enhanced to specifically detect and properly translate symbolic matrix inversion expressions (such as those involving MatrixSymbol and the **-1 operation for inversion) into numpy operations (numpy.linalg.inv or equivalent). The enhancement should: Introduce a check for matrix inversion operations within the symbolic expressions passed to lambdify. Translate such symbolic expressions accurately into numpy code that performs the numerical matrix inversion, ensuring that the dimensions and types of the matrices are compatible with numpy's expectations. Maintain existing functionality for all other types of expressions (scalar, vector, etc.), ensuring that this specific enhancement does not adversely affect the handling of non-matrix expressions."
