To address your request correctly, we'll rewrite the Python file to faithfully reproduce the specific issue described, incorporating your function for printing the stack trace in case of exceptions.

Given the earlier feedback, let me correct the approach and directly target the original problem provided with the given task.

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from sympy import MatrixSymbol, lambdify, init_printing

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    init_printing()

    X0 = MatrixSymbol('X0', 2, 2)  # Original dimension from your example
    xx = np.random.rand(4, 4)  # The provided matrix, although mismatched for demonstration
    
    # Make sure to adjust this if necessary to match dimensions
    X0Inv = X0**-1

    # First use numpy to invert, which should work with no issues
    try:
        numpy_inv_result = np.linalg.inv(xx)
        print("Numpy inversion worked correctly.")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Numpy inversion failed unexpectedly.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    
    # Then attempt the symbolic inversion using sympy and lambdify
    try:
        symInv = lambdify(X0, X0Inv, "numpy")
        inv_result = symInv(xx)
        print("Symbolic inversion successful. Issue not reproduced.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Symbolic inversion failed as expected.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Matrix inversion failed as expected due to the issue.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        exit(1)  # Exit with 1 indicates the presence of the issue
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(2)  # Indicates a different error occurred
```

This script is tailored to reproduce the issue by attempting to invert a matrix using both numpy directly and sympy with lambdify. It adheres to the constraints and instructions provided, especially regarding error handling and diagnostics. Note the hint of `exit codes` at the end of the script which provides a way to distinguish different outcomes when this script runs:
- Exit with `0` indicates the issue described could not be reproduced (i.e., everything worked as expected).
- Exit with `1` signals that the issue has been successfully reproduced (i.e., an `AssertionError` was raised due to inversion failure).
- Exit with `2` means an unexpected error occurred, not directly related to the matrix inversion logic described.
