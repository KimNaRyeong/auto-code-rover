It should only raise an `AssertionError` if the error is successfully reproduced, displaying the stack trace for debugging. The change from `X0 = MatrixSymbol('X0',2,2)` to `X0 = MatrixSymbol('X0', 4, 4)` was made to ensure that the dimensions of `X0` match the dimensions of the `xx` array, which is necessary for the operation to make theoretical sense, although for the purpose of reproducing the original issue as stated, this alignment of dimensions does not mitigate the error encountered with `lambdify`."
