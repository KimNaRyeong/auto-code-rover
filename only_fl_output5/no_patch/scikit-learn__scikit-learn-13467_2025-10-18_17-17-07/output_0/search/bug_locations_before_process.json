        "intended_behavior": "The method should be enhanced to include a new boolean parameter `squared` with a default value of `True`. When `squared=True`, the method behaves as it currently does, returning the mean squared error. When `squared=False`, the method should return the square root of the mean squared error, effectively calculating the RMSE. This change preserves the existing functionality while extending the method's capabilities to directly calculate RMSE when desired."

        "intended_behavior": "A new scorer called `neg_root_mean_squared_error` needs to be created. This scorer would compute the negative RMSE to ensure compliance with Scikit-Learn's convention where higher score values indicate better performance. This involves defining a new function that calculates the negative RMSE and registers this function as a scorer within the Scikit-Learn framework. The implementation should closely follow the pattern of existing scorers in Scorer.py, ensuring it can be easily used alongside them in model evaluation workflows."
