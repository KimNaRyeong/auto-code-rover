        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the `mean_squared_error` method and the references to `scorer` across the codebase provides insight into resolving the issue. Let's discuss each part separately:\n\n### `mean_squared_error` Analysis\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `mean_squared_error` method calculates the mean squared error (MSE) between two arrays, `y_true` and `y_pred`, which represent the true and predicted values, respectively. It can take into account sample weights if provided and can output the MSE either as a raw value or average value across multiple outputs.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue is not exactly a bug but a feature request. The current implementation of `mean_squared_error` only calculates MSE and does not directly allow for computing the root mean square error (RMSE). The issue proposes enhancing the `mean_squared_error` function by adding a `squared` parameter to control whether to compute MSE or RMSE directly.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code given the issue description?**\n   - The intended enhancement would involve modifying this method to include an optional `squared=True` parameter. When `squared=False`, it would return the square root of the MSE, thus directly giving the RMSE. This would allow users to compute RMSE without an additional call to `np.sqrt()`.\n\n### Scorer Analysis\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - References to `scorer` throughout the codebase likely pertain to Scikit-Learn's capabilities for evaluating the performance of models using various metrics. Scikit-Learn uses scorer objects which take a model, its inputs, and the true outputs, and return a score representing the model's performance.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue calls for adding a scorer equivalent to the RMSE metric. This would involve creating a new scorer that can be used in model evaluation processes, specifically for those models where a lower RMSE reflects better performance. The `neg_root_mean_squared_error` scorer would ideally be added to files or routines dealing with scoring where `scorer` references are found.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code given the issue description?**\n   - To implement the `neg_root_mean_squared_error` scorer, a function should be created to compute the negative RMSE (since higher score values should indicate better performance in Scikit-Learn's conventions). This implies extending the existing scorer functionality or creating a new scorer that accurately reflects this metric. This would likely involve defining this new scorer in `sklearn/metrics/scorer.py` or modifying existing scorer creation routines to recognize and handle this new case.\n\nGiven the analysis, the next steps could involve modifying `mean_squared_error` to accept and handle a `squared` parameter and creating a new scorer `neg_root_mean_squared_error` by utilizing the potentially updated `mean_squared_error` method or implementing the RMSE calculation directly within the scorer logic. Modifications would likely be needed in `sklearn/metrics/regression.py` for the `mean_squared_error` enhancement and in `sklearn/metrics/scorer.py` or similar files for the new scorer."

The provided information outlines a clear path for both modifying the existing `mean_squared_error` function and adding a new scorer.\n\n2. **Where are bug locations:** The files, classes, and methods that need to be modified are:\n\n   - **Location 1:** File: sklearn/metrics/regression.py, Method: mean_squared_error\n     - **Intended Behavior:** The method should be enhanced to include a new boolean parameter `squared` with a default value of `True`. When `squared=True`, the method behaves as it currently does, returning the mean squared error. When `squared=False`, the method should return the square root of the mean squared error, effectively calculating the RMSE. This change preserves the existing functionality while extending the method's capabilities to directly calculate RMSE when desired.\n\n   - **Location 2:** File: sklearn/metrics/scorer.py\n     - **Intended Behavior:** A new scorer called `neg_root_mean_squared_error` needs to be created. This scorer would compute the negative RMSE to ensure compliance with Scikit-Learn's convention where higher score values indicate better performance. This involves defining a new function that calculates the negative RMSE and registers this function as a scorer within the Scikit-Learn framework. The implementation should closely follow the pattern of existing scorers in Scorer.py, ensuring it can be easily used alongside them in model evaluation workflows.\n\nThese enhancements will directly address the issue by not only providing a more direct calculation method for RMSE but also by integrating this metric into the scoring system used for model evaluation, thereby enriching the toolkit available to users for more nuanced model performance assessment."
