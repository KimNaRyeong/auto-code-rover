Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\n```\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\njoule**(7/9)\n```\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\n```\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\njoule*second\n```\n```\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\nkg*m**2/s\n```\n```\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\nJ*mins/60\n```\n</issue>"

This directory likely contains the implementation responsible for handling unit operations, including conversions.\n\nThe less relevant matches found in the `sympy/polys/domainmatrix.py` file suggest that `convert_to` is also a method for mathematical manipulations outside the specific context of unit conversion, which probably isn't directly related to this bug. \n\nTherefore, the next steps should focus on the `convert_to` methods located within `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py` and `sympy/physics/units/util.py` since the bug is specifically about unit conversion. To narrow down the root cause, we need to inspect the implementation of `convert_to` in these files and understand how it might mistakenly handle the unit conversion leading to unexpected results.\n\nGiven this analysis, the subsequent API calls should aim to retrieve the implementation details of `convert_to` within the mentioned files to:\n1. Identify how `convert_to` interprets and manipulates unit expressions, especially how it deals with operations combining different units.\n2. Determine whether there's a conceptual misunderstanding or a limitation in handling units that aren't directly convertible (e.g., converting `joule*second` to `joule` without simplifying or keeping the intended physical significance).\n\nWith this in mind, the concrete next API calls should be:\n- search_method_in_file(`\"convert_to\"`, `\"sympy/physics/units/quantities.py\"`)\n- search_method_in_file(`\"convert_to\"`, `\"sympy/physics/units/util.py\"`) \n\nThese calls aim to provide direct insights into the implementation logic of `convert_to`, after which we can further decide if inspecting the definitions of units like `joule`, `second`, `kg`, `m`, and `s` is necessary, based on how these units are used or defined within the scope of `convert_to`."
