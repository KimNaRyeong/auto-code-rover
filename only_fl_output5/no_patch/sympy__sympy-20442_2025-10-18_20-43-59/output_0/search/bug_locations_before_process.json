        "intended_behavior": "The convert_to function should reliably convert expressions between compatible units while maintaining physical and mathematical integrity. To resolve the issue: Dimensional Compatibility Checks: Before proceeding with conversion, the function should verify that the resulting units post-conversion maintain dimensional integrity. If the target unit does not align dimensionally with the source expression, the function should either return the original expression without changes or raise an informative error indicating the infeasibility of such a conversion. Handling Complex Unit Expressions: For expressions involving unit combinations that aren't straightforward (e.g., Joule*second to Joule), the function should explicitly check for and handle such cases, either by preserving the original expression or by applying a logical rule-based conversion if feasible. If no sensible conversion exists, it should either reject the operation explicitly or guide the user towards a valid conversion. Preserving Existing Functionality: Any modifications should ensure that current valid conversions remain unaffected. This may involve adding conditional logic for edge cases or improving the underlying unit manipulation algorithms to more accurately handle a wider variety of unit conversion scenarios."
