This directory likely contains the implementation responsible for handling unit operations, including conversions.\n\nThe less relevant matches found in the `sympy/polys/domainmatrix.py` file suggest that `convert_to` is also a method for mathematical manipulations outside the specific context of unit conversion, which probably isn't directly related to this bug. \n\nTherefore, the next steps should focus on the `convert_to` methods located within `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py` and `sympy/physics/units/util.py` since the bug is specifically about unit conversion.

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py`\n\nThe method `convert_to` in `quantities.py` is part of the `Quantity` class. This method serves to convert a quantity (which inherently involves units) into another quantity of the same dimension but potentially different units. The actual conversion logic, however, is not directly implemented here. Instead, it delegates the operation to `convert_to` from the `util.py` file, indicating that the detailed conversion logic is centralized in the utilities file.\n\n#### `sympy/physics/units/util.py`\n\nThe `convert_to` function in `util.py` is designed to convert an expression with units into the same expression represented as factors of target units, given that the dimensions are compatible. It supports conversion to single units, collections of units, and works with various mathematical operations involved in unit conversion (e.g., multiplication and raising to a power). This function checks the type of expression, processes additive and multiplicative elements separately, and recursively applies the conversion to parts of complex expressions.\n\n### Relationship with the Bug\n\nThe bug detailed in the issue is specifically concerned with how `convert_to` handles the conversion when combining orthogonal units, such as converting `Joule*second` into `Joule`. According to the issue description, the expected behavior would be either returning the original expression when a direct conversion isn't logically feasible or meaningful, converting it into a compatible base unit, or raising an error if the conversion doesn't make sense. The observed output of `joule**(7/9)` instead suggests a lapse in the logic that deals with ensuring the dimensional compatibility and mathematical soundness of the conversion.\n\n### Intended Behavior\n\nGiven these insights, the intended behavior should involve a few adjustments:\n\n1. **Dimensional Check and Validation:** Enhance dimensional compatibility checks to better handle cases where units are combined in ways that don't make direct physical sense (e.g., `Joule*second` to `Joule`). This might involve explicit validation steps prior to attempting conversion calculations.\n   \n2. **Error Handling or Explicit Conversion:** Introduce better error handling or more explicit guidance on what conversions are valid. If a conversion request does not make physical sense or cannot be meaningously computed, the function should either return the original expression or throw a clear exception indicating the issue.\n   \n3. **Unit Combination Logic:** Rework or fine-tune the logic that deals with the combination of units, particularly ensuring that when units are combined through multiplication or other operations, the outcome respects both mathematical rules and physical reality.\n\n### Necessary Locations for Fixes\n\n- **Location 1:**\n  - **File:** `sympy/physics/units/util.py`\n  - **Function:** `convert_to`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** To refine conversion logic including dimensional checks, error handling, and dealing with complex unit expressions in a way that avoids nonsensical conversions. It should clearly handle or reject conversions that aren't physically meaningful or output a mathematically sound and physically plausible result.\n\nBy focusing on the utility function where the core logic resides, the solution can ensure that any improvements or fixes will be reflected across all instances where `convert_to` is utilized, thus maintaining consistency and preventing similar bugs in different contexts."

To resolve the issue:\n  - **Dimensional Compatibility Checks:** Before proceeding with conversion, the function should verify that the resulting units post-conversion maintain dimensional integrity. If the target unit does not align dimensionally with the source expression, the function should either return the original expression without changes or raise an informative error indicating the infeasibility of such a conversion.\n  - **Handling Complex Unit Expressions:** For expressions involving unit combinations that aren't straightforward (e.g., `Joule*second` to `Joule`), the function should explicitly check for and handle such cases, either by preserving the original expression or by applying a logical rule-based conversion if feasible. If no sensible conversion exists, it should either reject the operation explicitly or guide the user towards a valid conversion.\n  - **Preserving Existing Functionality:** Any modifications should ensure that current valid conversions remain unaffected. This may involve adding conditional logic for edge cases or improving the underlying unit manipulation algorithms to more accurately handle a wider variety of unit conversion scenarios.\n\nThis approach addresses the bug by refining the core conversion logic and enhancing the robustness and reliability of unit conversions within the scope of the `sympy` library."
