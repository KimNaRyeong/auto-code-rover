        "intended_behavior": "This method should implement a consistent datetime logging format, ideally making it configurable through Django's settings. Adjustments here should ensure that all log messages generated through this method adhere to the same datetime format, which could be derived from a configuration setting or at least match the default logging format used elsewhere in Django. This ensures that regardless of the source of the log message (e.g., standard request logging or error handling), the datetime stamps are uniform, addressing the inconsistency issue. The modification must preserve the method's primary functionality of logging HTTP request information, merely standardizing the datetime format used in these logs."

        "intended_behavior": "Given the earlier analysis, although this wasn't directly identified as a bug location initially, adjustments here could further ensure that the datetime format used in logging by the `ServerFormatter` class is consistent with the format now implemented in `WSGIRequestHandler.log_message`. This might involve enhancing the method to respect a new, configurable logging datetime format that would be applied to all log records handled by this formatter. The goal is to align the output of the server's logging statements, making log parsing and monitoring simpler and more predictable for developers."
