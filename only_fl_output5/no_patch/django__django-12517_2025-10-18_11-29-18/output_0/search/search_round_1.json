On the other hand, WSGIServer uses logging without providing a server_time. This gets \"fixed\" in ServerFormatter.format using self.formatTime(record, self.datefmt), which uses a completely different format.\nCurrently we make this at least consistent by providing the datefmt parameter when constructing the logger, but it would be better if they were coded to be in sync (and configurable?).\n(Looking into it further, it looks like we should be using %(asctime)s instead of %(server_time)s, but would be good if that were the suggested default. In \u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/1.10/#runserver-output-goes-through-logging we see %(server_time)s.)\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the API calls:\n\n### 1. WSGIRequestHandler and WSGIServer Classes\n\nFound in `django/core/servers/basehttp.py`, these classes are central to handling HTTP requests and server configuration in Django's development server (`runserver`). \n\n- **WSGIRequestHandler**: Deals with handling HTTP requests. Judging by the methods listed (`log_message`, `get_environ`, `handle`, `handle_one_request`), it's responsible for processing individual requests, extracting environment data, and logging requests. However, details on how `server_time` is managed or logged within this class are not directly shown in the snippet.\n  \n- **WSGIServer**: Configures server specifics such as the request queue size and contains an initializer that allows for IPv6 configuration, reuse of addresses, and error handling. There\u2019s no explicit mention of `server_time` or how logging formats are defined here.\n\nThese classes are directly involved in handling requests and server operation, suggesting their modification might impact how log formats, including date and time, are managed.\n\n### 2. Result of search_method(\"log_date_time_string\")\n\nNo results found for `log_date_time_string`, which was mentioned as a method potentially used by the `WSGIRequestHandler` class for logging. The absence of results implies either the method is inherited from a class not within Django (perhaps a standard Python library) or the approach to finding it needs adjustment.\n\n### 3. ServerFormatter class in django/utils/log.py\n\nThis part of the code seems responsible for formatting log messages, as indicated by the context around `self.formatTime(record, self.datefmt)`. This suggests that `ServerFormatter` might play a key role in how datetime is formatted in the logs, particularly when `record` does not already have a `server_time`.\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?** It formats log messages, potentially adding server time if it's not part of the original log record.\n  \n- **Relationship to the bug**: Since the issue describes inconsistencies in datetime logging formats, and this code segment relates to how datetime is formatted, the behavior here is likely to be directly relevant to the bug. The use of `self.datefmt` for formatting dates suggests that making `datefmt` consistent and/or configurable could resolve the inconsistency.\n\n- **Intended behavior**: Given the issue description, the intended behavior seems to be a consistent datetime format across all logs produced by the runserver. Hence, this code should ensure that the datetime format it applies is aligned with that used by other parts of the logging system, or it should be made configurable to allow explicit definition of the desired format.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the analysis, further investigations could include:\n\n- Searching the inheritance tree or usage of `WSGIRequestHandler` and `WSGIServer` to understand if and how they might be influencing the datetime format in logs, given the absence of direct evidence in the initial search.\n- Exploring how `ServerFormatter` is utilised within Django, specifically in relation to the runserver command, to see if altering its behavior could harmonize datetime logging.\n- Since neither `%(asctime)s` nor `%(server_time)s` were found in the search results, it might be useful to investigate how logging configuration is defined in Django settings or within the runserver setup to identify possible points of intervention for making log formats consistent or configurable.\n\nGiven the missing pieces of information, especially around `log_date_time_string` and the configurations involving `%(asctime)s` and `%(server_time)s`, additional API calls should focus on uncovering how log formats are specified and applied across different components related to the Django development server. Searching for documentation or default settings related to logging within Django could also provide insights into potential solutions."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

This can be achieved by using `self.formatTime(record, self.datefmt)` consistently for all log messages, or introducing a new class method that ensures datetime is uniformly formatted using either `%(asctime)s` or a new format string that aligns with Django's logging guidelines. It should still perform its primary function of logging HTTP request messages without altering its existing capabilities.\n\n- **Location 2**: \n  - File: `django/utils/log.py`\n  - Class: `ServerFormatter`\n  - Method: `format`\n  \n  **Intended Behavior**: This method should ensure that the datetime format (`self.datefmt`) used for `server_time` is consistent with the rest of Django's logging system or make it configurable via Django settings. The patch should ensure this consistency without breaking the current functionality of the `ServerFormatter` class, which involves enhancing log messages. This might involve more explicit documentation or default settings to guide developers towards a consistent datetime format in logs.\n\nThese locations and adjustments target the core of the issue around inconsistent datetime logging by ensuring that both the handling of request logging and the overall formatting of log messages employ a consistent and potentially configurable datetime format."
