On the other hand, WSGIServer uses logging without providing a server_time. This gets \"fixed\" in ServerFormatter.format using self.formatTime(record, self.datefmt), which uses a completely different format.\nCurrently we make this at least consistent by providing the datefmt parameter when constructing the logger, but it would be better if they were coded to be in sync (and configurable?).\n(Looking into it further, it looks like we should be using %(asctime)s instead of %(server_time)s, but would be good if that were the suggested default. In \u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/1.10/#runserver-output-goes-through-logging we see %(server_time)s.)\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue related to inconsistent datetime logging in Django's runserver, we need to gather more information about the involved classes and methods. The key components mentioned are `WSGIRequestHandler` and `WSGIServer`, along with their logging behaviors and the use of `BaseHTTPServer.log_date_time_string`. Additionally, it mentions the potential adjustment towards using `%(asctime)s` in logging configurations. Based on this information, we should:\n\n1. Search for the `WSGIRequestHandler` class to see how it implements logging and how it uses `server_time`.\n2. Search for the `WSGIServer` class to understand its logging configuration and the absence of `server_time`.\n3. Look for `BaseHTTPServer.log_date_time_string` usage to see how `server_time` is calculated.\n4. Search for configurations in Django related to `logger` construction, specifically the ones that might involve `datefmt` parameter setting.\n5. Investigate the logging format and how `%(asctime)s` and `%(server_time)s` are used within the codebase.\n\nGiven these objectives, the following API calls would be relevant:\n\n1. `search_class(\"WSGIRequestHandler\")`\n2. `search_class(\"WSGIServer\")`\n3. `search_method(\"log_date_time_string\")`\n4. `search_code(\"datefmt\")`\n5. `search_code(\"%(asctime)s\")`\n6. `search_code(\"%(server_time)s\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive view of how logging is handled within Django's server components and suggest how to make the logging formats consistent and configurable."
