Please describe.**\nI've been working on opening custom hdf formats in xarray, reading up on the apiv2 it is currently only possible to declare a new external plugin in setup.py but that doesn't seem easy or intuitive to me.\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nWhy can't we simply be allowed to add functions to the engine parameter? Example:\n```python\nfrom custom_backend import engine\nds = xr.load_dataset(filename, engine=engine)\n```\nThis seems like a small function change to me from my initial _quick_ look because there's mainly a bunch of string checks in the normal case until we get to the registered backend functions, if we send in a function instead in the engine-parameter we can just bypass those checks.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how `xarray` (the project in question) currently handles the `engine` parameter in the `load_dataset` method or function. We also need to understand how external plugins (engines) are registered and invoked. Therefore, our investigation will focus on the following aspects:\n\n1. The implementation of the `load_dataset` function to see how the `engine` parameter is currently handled.\n2. The mechanism for registering external plugins or backends to determine how it might be modified to support direct function assignment to the `engine` parameter.\n3. Any existing documentation or strings related to engine checks or backend registration that could provide additional context.\n\nGiven these objectives, we will use the following API calls for our investigation:\n\n- Search for the method where `load_dataset` is implemented to understand its current handling of the `engine` parameter.\n- Search for code snippets that involve registering backends or plugins and handling the `engine` parameter to see if there's a direct way to implement the suggested feature.\n\nHere are the specific API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"load_dataset\")`\n2. `search_code(\"engine\")`"
