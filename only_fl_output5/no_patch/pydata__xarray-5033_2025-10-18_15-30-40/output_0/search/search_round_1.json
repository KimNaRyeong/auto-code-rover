Please describe.**\nI've been working on opening custom hdf formats in xarray, reading up on the apiv2 it is currently only possible to declare a new external plugin in setup.py but that doesn't seem easy or intuitive to me.\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nWhy can't we simply be allowed to add functions to the engine parameter? Example:\n```python\nfrom custom_backend import engine\nds = xr.load_dataset(filename, engine=engine)\n```\nThis seems like a small function change to me from my initial _quick_ look because there's mainly a bunch of string checks in the normal case until we get to the registered backend functions, if we send in a function instead in the engine-parameter we can just bypass those checks.\n</issue>"

        "content": "The gathered context from the search results provides an insight into the structure of the `xarray` project, particularly how datasets are loaded and how the `engine` parameter is utilized across the library. Let\u2019s analyze the collected information with respect to the three points mentioned:\n\n### Analysis of `load_dataset` Method Results\n\n#### xarray/tutorial.py\n- The `load_dataset` function here seems to serve as a convenience function for loading datasets from an online repository. It leverages `open_dataset` internally, which is more relevant to our inquiry.\n- **Relation to Issue**: Although not directly related to adding custom backends, it highlights the hierarchical calling pattern in `xarray`, where `load_dataset` could indirectly be affected by backend changes.\n\n#### xarray/backends/api.py\n- This is a core function for loading datasets, acting as a wrapper around `open_dataset`, which differentiates by loading the dataset into memory and closing the file afterwards.\n- It mentions the passing of all parameters directly to `open_dataset`, which is crucial since any modifications to accept a function directly for the `engine` parameter will likely need to be implemented in or around these calls.\n- **Relation to Issue and Intended Behavior**: Given the feature request, this method appears to be a critical junction for implementing the proposed solution. Custom engine functions passed to `load_dataset` must be seamlessly handled, potentially within `open_dataset` or earlier, to bypass the usual string-based engine checks.\n\n### Analysis of `engine` Code Snippets Search Results\n\nThe search for `engine` code snippets revealed a wide dispersion of matches across multiple files with a significant concentration in `xarray/backends/api.py` and `xarray/backends/plugins.py`. This distribution suggests that:\n\n1. The handling of the `engine` parameter is spread across the backend loading and plugin management functionalities.\n2. **xarray/backends/plugins.py** might contain the logic for registering and recognizing different backends, which is directly relevant to allowing custom functions as backends.\n\n#### Intended Behavior in Relation to the Issue\n- The intended behavior, based on the issue description, is to allow direct function assignment to the `engine` parameter, bypassing the string-based checks and registrations currently in place. This suggests a need for the project to support dynamic recognition and incorporation of backend engines without solely relying on prior registration or name-based identification.\n- Given this, the mechanism for backend registration and handling within `open_dataset` seems like the next critical point of investigation, especially within `xarray/backends/api.py` and `xarray/backends/plugins.py`. The modification would likely involve allowing `open_dataset` to accept a callable as an engine and bypassing the traditional lookup and validation process that expects a string identifier.\n\n### Next Steps\nBased on this analysis, to get more specific code context that will be vital in formulating a patch or suggesting an architectural change, we should:\n\n1. Examine the implementation of `open_dataset` in `xarray/backends/api.py` to understand how it currently handles the `engine` parameter and how it might be adapted.\n2. Investigate `xarray/backends/plugins.py` for insights into how plugins (engines) are registered and managed, which could reveal how to integrate custom backend functions more naturally into the framework.\n\nThese steps will provide the detailed code context needed to propose a specific solution to the feature request."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

When a callable is passed, the method bypasses the usual backend lookup and directly uses this function to open and load the dataset. This change must preserve the ability to handle string-based identifiers for engines as before, maintaining backward compatibility and existing functionality.\n\n- **Location 2**: \n  - File: `xarray/backends/plugins.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Adapt the backend registration mechanism to recognize and allow callable objects (functions) as valid engines. This might include extending the `register_backend` function or adding a new function that facilitates the direct use of custom engine functions without a formal registration process. The intended behavior should ensure that when a function is used as an engine, it is invoked in a manner consistent with how registered backends are called, including passing the necessary parameters and handling return values appropriately, thus integrating seamlessly with the existing infrastructure without breaking current implementations."
