        "intended_behavior": "The `__init__` method of the `BaseConstraint` class should be modified to enforce that all its parameters (except for `self`) are passed as keyword arguments. This will ensure that calls to this method are clear in their intent, especially when specifying the constraint name and any custom violation error message. The change will involve making the `name` parameter keyword-only by adding a `*` before the `name` parameter in the method signature:\n\n```python\ndef __init__(self, *, name, violation_error_message=None):\n```\n\nThis modification mandates that any instantiation of `BaseConstraint` or its subclasses explicitly names the `name` and `violation_error_message` (if provided) arguments, thus preserving functionality while increasing code readability and maintainability."
