        "intended_behavior": "The `get_group_by` method should exclude `Random` expressions from influencing the generated `GROUP BY` clause when processing the `order_by` parameter. The current interpretation of `order_by` expressions indiscriminately adds them to the `GROUP BY` clause, as seen in how `expressions.extend(expr.get_group_by_cols())` is used.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the method should be modified to keep the existing functionality intact for all other orderings and expressions while filtering out `Random` (or potentially other similar non-aggregate, non-deterministic) functions specifically from affecting the `GROUP BY` calculation. This can be achieved without altering the logical flow of grouping or the treatment of other order_by expressions. A possible pseudocode fix within the method could look something like:\n\n```python\nfor expr, (sql, params, is_ref) in order_by:\n    if not is_ref and not isinstance(expr, Random):  # Assuming Random is properly imported\n        expressions.extend(expr.get_group_by_cols())\n```\n\nThis ensures that random ordering does not impact the aggregation's logic by keeping it out of the `GROUP BY` clause calculation, thereby preserving the intended single count per group of related items rather than splitting them due to the inclusion of a random order in the grouping logic."
