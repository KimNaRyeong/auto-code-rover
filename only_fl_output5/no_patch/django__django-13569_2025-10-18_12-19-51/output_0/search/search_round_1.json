The aggregation with Count produces a GROUP BY clause on related.id.\n>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('rc').values('id', 'rc')\n<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 2}]>\nThis also works as expected (at least to me). Although there is an aggregation, ordering by related means that the grouping will be broken down.\n>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('related').values('id', 'rc')\n<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 1}, {'id': 1, 'rc': 1}]>\nBut the following seems wrong to me.\n>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc')\n<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 1}, {'id': 1, 'rc': 1}]>\nThe random function call has nothing to do with the aggregation, and I see no reason it should break it. Dumping the query seems that indeed the random call breaks the group by call: (I simpilfied the table names a little)\n>>> print(Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc').query)\nSELECT \"thing\".\"id\", COUNT(\"related\".\"id\") AS \"rc\" FROM \"thing\" LEFT OUTER JOIN \"related\" ON (\"thing\".\"id\" = \"related\".\"thing_id\") GROUP BY \"thing\".\"id\", RANDOM() ORDER BY RANDOM() ASC\nI dug into the SQL compiler, and it seems to me the problem is inside django.db.models.sql.compiler.get_group_by, where the compiler combines all non-aggregate, non-ref order_by expressions into group_by. I patched it like this\nfor expr, (sql, params, is_ref) in order_by:\nif expr.contains_aggregate:\ncontinue\nif is_ref:\ncontinue\nexpressions.extend([\nexp for exp in expr.get_source_expressions()\nif not isinstance(exp, Random)\n])\nand things seem to work correctly.

        "content": "Based on the results obtained from the API calls, let's analyze the collected context to understand the issue better and formulate potential next steps.\n\n### Analysis of `get_group_by` in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThis part of the Django ORM SQL compiler code is responsible for constructing the `GROUP BY` part of an SQL query. It determines which columns should be included in the `GROUP BY` clause based on a combination of the query's selected fields, conditions (e.g., filters or annotations), and ordering. This method handles a variety of use cases to ensure that the resulting SQL query groups records correctly according to the developer's intentions as expressed through the Django ORM API.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nThe `get_group_by` method's logic plays a pivotal role in the issue. The problem arises when a query with aggregation (such as counting related objects) is combined with a random order (`order_by('?')`). According to the issue description, this random ordering unexpectedly affects the aggregation by seemingly adding `RANDOM()` to the `GROUP BY` clause, which should not happen. The method's implementation, especially how it decides which expressions to include in the `GROUP BY` clause and how it handles ordering expressions, is directly related to this bug.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nThe intended behavior would be for the random ordering not to break the aggregation. That is, the `RANDOM()` call used for ordering should not cause each related item to be counted separately when the aggregation should logically result in a single count per group of related items.\n\n### Analysis of `Random` in `django/db/models/functions/math.py`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThis class provides an abstraction over the SQL `RANDOM()` function, allowing it to be used within Django ORM queries. It includes method overrides for compatibility with different database backends (MySQL, Oracle, SQLite).\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nGiven that the class represents the SQL `RANDOM()` function and the issue arises from using `order_by('?')`, which translates to an SQL `RANDOM()` call, this class's implementation is crucial. The issue likely doesn't stem from how `Random` is defined but rather from how instances of this class (or the underlying SQL function calls they generate) are handled in aggregation and grouping contexts.\n\n#### Intended behavior\n`Random` should allow for the random ordering of query results without interfering with the logical grouping and aggregation of those results. It should serve purely as an ordering mechanism without affecting how counts or other aggregations are calculated.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context Gathering\n\nGiven the initial analysis, it's clear that the handling of `Random` within the grouping logic might not account for its unique nature as an ordering function that shouldn't influence grouping. However, to move toward a resolution, we need more specific insights into how expressions are processed for the `GROUP BY` clause and how ordering influences that processing. Specifically, examining how non-aggregate and non-reference order_by expressions are combined into `group_by` and how instances of `Random` affect this logic could be helpful.\n\nA potential next API call could aim to gather more insights into the processing of grouping and ordering expressions, especially looking for any handling of special cases like `Random`:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"collapse_group_by\", \"django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\")`\n- `search_code_in_file(\"isinstance(expr, Random)\", \"django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\")`\n\nThese calls could provide direct insights into how `Random` is considered in the grouping logic or reveal if there's a missing handling case for such expressions."

The current interpretation of `order_by` expressions indiscriminately adds them to the `GROUP BY` clause, as seen in how `expressions.extend(expr.get_group_by_cols())` is used.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the method should be modified to keep the existing functionality intact for all other orderings and expressions while filtering out `Random` (or potentially other similar non-aggregate, non-deterministic) functions specifically from affecting the `GROUP BY` calculation. This can be achieved without altering the logical flow of grouping or the treatment of other order_by expressions. A possible pseudocode fix within the method could look something like:\n\n```python\nfor expr, (sql, params, is_ref) in order_by:\n    if not is_ref and not isinstance(expr, Random):  # Assuming Random is properly imported\n        expressions.extend(expr.get_group_by_cols())\n```\n\nThis ensures that random ordering does not impact the aggregation's logic by keeping it out of the `GROUP BY` clause calculation, thereby preserving the intended single count per group of related items rather than splitting them due to the inclusion of a random order in the grouping logic."
