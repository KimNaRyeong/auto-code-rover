Figure title being removed by seaborn objects API when plotting on subfigures
I recently came across an odd behaviour with the seaborn objects API when using subfigures. Here is a minimal example : 
```
import seaborn as sns
import seaborn.objects as so
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig = plt.figure(constrained_layout=True)
subfigs = fig.subfigures(1,2)
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
p = (
    so.Plot(tips, "total_bill")
    .add(so.Bars(), so.Hist())
)
p.on(subfigs[0]).plot()

ax = subfigs[1].subplots()
ax.scatter([1],[1])

fig.suptitle("Test title")
plt.show()
```
which results in the title missing from the image :
![title_issue_bad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1338337/210242982-57262fb0-d1d4-4aab-b400-8f59cae522f3.png)

Commenting the `p.on(subfigs[0]).plot()` results in the title reappearing.
I have done a bit of digging and found that changing  line 186 from the _core/subplots.py file from `figure = target.figure` to `figure = target` seems to solve the issue. Is there a specific reason to why it fetches the parent figure currently, since Subfigure is supposed to be a drop-in replacement for Figure ? I also expect this will not have the intended behaviour if we deal with subfigures of subfigures.
