        "content": "<issue>Figure title being removed by seaborn objects API when plotting on subfigures\nI recently came across an odd behaviour with the seaborn objects API when using subfigures. Here is a minimal example :\n```\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport seaborn.objects as so\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfig = plt.figure(constrained_layout=True)\nsubfigs = fig.subfigures(1,2)\ntips = sns.load_dataset(\"tips\")\np = (\nso.Plot(tips, \"total_bill\")\n.add(so.Bars(), so.Hist())\n)\np.on(subfigs[0]).plot()\nax = subfigs[1].subplots()\nax.scatter([1],[1])\nfig.suptitle(\"Test title\")\nplt.show()\n```\nwhich results in the title missing from the image :\n![title_issue_bad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1338337/210242982-57262fb0-d1d4-4aab-b400-8f59cae522f3.png)\nCommenting the `p.on(subfigs[0]).plot()` results in the title reappearing.\nI have done a bit of digging and found that changing  line 186 from the _core/subplots.py file from `figure = target.figure` to `figure = target` seems to solve the issue. Is there a specific reason to why it fetches the parent figure currently, since Subfigure is supposed to be a drop-in replacement for Figure ? I also expect this will not have the intended behaviour if we deal with subfigures of subfigures.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To analyze and resolve the issue related to figure title being removed when using seaborn objects API with subfigures, let\u2019s use the provided APIs to get more context about the bug. The problem seems to be specifically related to how a plot is assigned to a subfigure and how it might be affecting the figure's title setting. Based on the issue description, the investigation should start around the seaborn and matplotlib interaction, specifically looking into how seaborn handles plotting on subfigures.\n\n1. From the issue description, it\u2019s mentioned that a potential solution involves changing the line from `figure = target.figure` to `figure = target`. The file mentioned is `_core/subplots.py`; it's likely a part of seaborn or matplotlib, considering seaborn extends matplotlib's capabilities. We can confirm this location and inspect the current implementation and surrounding code to better understand the exact impact of this change.\n\n2. The issue mentions `Plot` and `Bars` classes under seaborn objects API (`so`), suggesting we look into these classes to understand how seaborn handles the plotting, particularly with the `.on()` method causing the issue when generating plots on subfigures.\n\nGiven this information, the necessary API calls are:\n- `search_code_in_file(\"figure = target.figure\", \"_core/subplots.py\")`: To find the specific code snippet mentioned in the issue and its location.\n- `search_class(\"Plot\")`: To get context on how the seaborn `Plot` class is implemented and possibly how it interacts with figures/subfigures.\n- `search_class(\"Bars\")`: To gain an understanding of how the `Bars` class operates within seaborn, although it may not be central to the issue, it's involved in the plotting process."
