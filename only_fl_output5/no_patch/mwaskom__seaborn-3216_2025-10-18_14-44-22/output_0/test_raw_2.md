To fulfill the updated request effectively, we'll create a `reproducer.py` script tailored to directly assess the reported issue (figure title being removed when using seaborn objects API with subfigures) and apply the provided function for printing stack traces in case an exception is raised. This standalone script purposes to terminate with an error if the figure title is missing (thereby reproducing the issue) or exit normally (exit code 0) if the issue is fixed.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    import seaborn.objects as so

    try:
        # Prepare matplotlib figure and subfigures
        fig = plt.figure(constrained_layout=True)
        subfigs = fig.subfigures(1, 2)
        tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
        
        # Define the seaborn plot
        p = (
            so.Plot(tips, "total_bill")
            .add(so.Bars(), so.Hist())
        )

        # Apply the seaborn plot to the first subfigure
        p.on(subfigs[0]).plot()

        # Second subplot as a simple scatter for demonstration
        ax = subfigs[1].subplots()
        ax.scatter([1], [1])

        # Set figure super title and attempt to display the plots
        fig.suptitle("Test title")
        plt.show()

        # Check if the title is displayed, if not, it raises an error
        if not fig._suptitle:
            raise AssertionError("Figure title is missing after plotting with seaborn objects API.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code indicating the issue persists

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    print("SUCCESS: The issue is not present. Exiting with code 0.")
    exit(0)  # Exit with success code indicating the issue is fixed or not encountered
```

This script simulates the issue described, checking specifically for the presence of the figure's super title after conducting operations that lead to its disappearance according to the issue report. Should an AssertionError be triggered due to a missing title, the `print_stacktrace` function will execute, showing where the error occurred. The existence of the title after plot commands concludes the script successfully, indicating the absence of the reported problem.

Please ensure that the requisite libraries (`matplotlib` and `seaborn`) are installed in your environment. If not, you might have to install them via pip (`pip install matplotlib seaborn`) before executing this script.
