Given the specific requirements to produce a script capable of raising an `AssertionError` when the issue is present, and also conforming to the function structure provided for stack trace printing. You must adjust the approach to match your specific error verification needs accurately. Here's an updated version of the script designed to fail under the condition described (missing figure title when plotting with Seaborn's object API and subfigures), and successful completion indicates the absence of the identified issue.

This script presumes the issue is the removal or non-display of the figure title when using Seaborn's object API to plot on subfigures. An `AssertionError` will be raised if the title does not appear as expected:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_figure_title_with_seaborn_and_subfigures():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    import seaborn.objects as so

    try:
        # Create figure and subfigures for plotting
        fig = plt.figure(constrained_layout=True)
        subfigs = fig.subfigures(1, 2)

        # Load example dataset
        tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")

        # Create plot using seaborn objects API
        p = (
            so.Plot(tips, "total_bill")
            .add(so.Bars(), so.Hist())
        )
        # Plot on the first subfigure
        p.on(subfigs[0]).plot()

        # Create a scatter plot on the second subfigure
        ax = subfigs[1].subplots()
        ax.scatter([1], [1])

        # Set a super title for the figure
        fig.suptitle("Test title")

        # Verify that the figure title is present
        expected_title = "Test title"
        actual_title = fig._suptitle.get_text()
        assert actual_title == expected_title, f"Expected figure title to be '{expected_title}', but got '{actual_title}'."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_figure_title_with_seaborn_and_subfigures()
        print("Issue not found: Figure title correctly set.")
        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed
    except AssertionError:
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code when issue is present
```

In this script, an `AssertionError` is explicitly raised if the figure title (`fig._suptitle.get_text()`) does not match the expected title ("Test title"), which directly addresses the original issue description. Successful execution with a correct title (exit code 0) implies the issue has been resolved or does not exist under the tested conditions.
