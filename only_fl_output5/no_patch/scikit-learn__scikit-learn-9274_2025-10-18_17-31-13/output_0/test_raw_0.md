To create a standalone Python file `reproducer.py` that reproduces the issue described, you should follow the given instructions precisely. Given that the original issue occurs when training an MLP regressor (or classifier) with the `lbfgs` solver is artificially limited to roughly 15000 iterations due to how `max_iter` is passed to the underlying L-BFGS optimization method, the script needs to attempt to train an MLP model for more than 15000 iterations and check if the actual number of iterations matches the expected number. If the number of iterations is capped at 15000 (or around this value if not precisely), it's indicative that the issue is present, and an `AssertionError` should be raised. On the contrary, if the model is allowed to run for the specified number of iterations (e.g., 18000 in the example), it signifies that the issue has been resolved, and the script should terminate with exit code 0.

Below is the `reproducer.py` script crafted to fulfill the requirements:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
    import numpy as np

    # Generate synthetic data that mimics the required structure and size
    np.random.seed(42)
    train_x = np.random.rand(100, 10) # Example feature data
    train_y = np.random.rand(100)     # Example target data

    max_iter = 18000
    clf = MLPRegressor(max_iter=max_iter, activation='relu', solver='lbfgs', verbose=True)

    # Attempt to fit the model
    clf.fit(train_x, train_y)
    
    # Check if the actual iterations match the expected iterations
    actual_iterations = clf.n_iter_
    print("Iters: ", actual_iterations, " / ", max_iter)
    assert actual_iterations == max_iter, f"Expected {max_iter} iterations, got {actual_iterations} iterations"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero code to indicate failure/error
    exit(0)  # Exit with 0 when the issue is fixed or not present
```

This script checks if the issue regarding the iteration limit in the training of an MLP with the L-BFGS solver is present. It utilizes synthetic data to avoid external dependencies and ensure the script can be executed in any environment where the necessary Python packages (`scikit-learn` and `numpy`) are installed.
