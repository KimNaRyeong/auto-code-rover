Here is an updated and corrected version of the `reproducer.py` file to match the given requirements. This script will attempt to create an MLP model with the given parameters, verifying that it does not exceed the specified iteration limit due to the issue described. Note that any syntax or logical errors potentially causing exceptions should be caught, and the stack trace will be printed using the provided `print_stacktrace` function.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Generating dummy data to simulate training scenario
    train_x = np.random.randn(200, 10)  # 200 samples, 10 features each
    train_y = np.random.randn(200)      # 200 target values

    max_iter = 18000  # Trying to set a high max_iter value

    try:
        clf = MLPRegressor(max_iter=max_iter, activation='relu', solver='lbfgs', verbose=False)
        clf.fit(train_x, train_y)

        assert clf.n_iter_ < max_iter, f"Actual iterations ({clf.n_iter_}) exceeded or matched the expected limit ({max_iter})."
        
        # If the program reaches this point without an AssertionError, the issue is fixed or not present
        print("Issue not present or fixed. Model trained for iterations within expected limits.")
        exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Exiting with a specific error code for unknown errors
        exit(2)
```

Please, ensure the machine or environment where this script is executed has `Python 3` and the required libraries (`numpy`, `scikit-learn`) installed. This script assumes an environment where exceptions not directly related to the problem statement (like missing dependencies or incorrect Python versions) are handled and resolved separately.
