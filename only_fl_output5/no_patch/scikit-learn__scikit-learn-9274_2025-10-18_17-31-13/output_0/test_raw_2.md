Based on your updated request, I will craft a `reproducer.py` Python script that attempts to recreate the issue with the MLP training being limited to the default L-BFGS max iteration value, and ensure that it adheres to your requirements for execution and error handling. This script includes checks to trigger an `AssertionError` if the iterations do not exceed the expected threshold, indicative of encountering the reported issue.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor
import traceback
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def generate_data():
    # Simulate data for training
    train_x = np.random.randn(200, 10)  # 200 samples, 10 features
    train_y = np.random.randn(200)      # 200 target values
    return train_x, train_y

def main():
    train_x, train_y = generate_data()

    max_iter = 18000
    clf = MLPRegressor(max_iter=max_iter, activation='relu', solver='lbfgs', verbose=True)

    try:
        clf.fit(train_x, train_y)
        assert clf.n_iter_ < max_iter, f"Training exceeded expected max iterations: {max_iter}"
        print("Test passed: Training did not exceed the expected max iterations.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error if the issue is still present
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(2)  # Exit with error for any other exceptions

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit without error if the script executes successfully
```

This script checks if the `MLPRegressor` from scikit-learn's implementation stops training prematurely due to the limitation on the number of iterations when using the L-BFGS solver. In case of Encountered exceptions or assertion failures, the dedicated `print_stacktrace` function will clearly display the source of the error for better diagnosis.
