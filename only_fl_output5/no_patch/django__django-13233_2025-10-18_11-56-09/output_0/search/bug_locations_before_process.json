        "intended_behavior": "The method `contribute_to_class` should ensure that the `ImageField` properly maintains a reference to the concrete model it is part of, in a manner consistent with Django versions prior to 3.2. This could involve adjusting how the `ImageField` interacts with its base class or the model class to maintain or explicitly set a reference to the model. The modification should ensure that external apps or user code relying on the `model` attribute of `ImageField` instances to dynamically access model information can do so without breaking changes. The intended behavior must preserve the integrity of the `ImageField`'s functionality while reintroducing the accessibility or discoverability of the concrete model this field is attached to, thus helping in scenarios where model and field introspection is necessary for functionality such as the django-imagefield application mentioned in the issue."
