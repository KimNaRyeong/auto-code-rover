If it is the later, is there an alternative to find the concrete model an image field belongs to? I'm classifying this as a bug because the change made model and field introspection harder than it was before. Also, since behavior changed #31701 may possibly not be classified as a cleanup/optimization anymore...\n</issue>"

        "content": "For gathering the necessary context to address this issue, I would like to perform the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the Django model class related to image fields to understand how they were previously linked to concrete models. This requires identifying the specific Django class or classes that handle image fields. Since the issue does not specify the exact class name for image fields, I will make a general search.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"ImageField\")\n```\n\n2. Given that the issue was introduced in Django 3.2 as a result of fixing issue #31701, it would be useful to look at how model attributes of image fields are accessed or modified in this version. The issue specifically mentions the model attribute, so searching for code where this attribute might be referenced in relation to image fields would be useful.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"get_model\")\n```\n\n3. The description mentions a concrete example where this issue was identified (in the `django-imagefield` project). To better understand the impact of the Django change on external projects, looking at how they interact with the `model` attribute of image fields could be insightful. I'll search for the usage of this attribute in the context of the `django-imagefield` project.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"model attribute of image fields\")\n``` \n\nThese searches aim to identify the changes in Django 3.2 affecting image fields' relation to concrete models, understand how the `model` attribute was used, and gather insights into how external projects like `django-imagefield` are affected by this change."
