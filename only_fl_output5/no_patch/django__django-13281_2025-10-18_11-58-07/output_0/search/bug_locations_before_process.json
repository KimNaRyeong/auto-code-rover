This might mean detecting if an object is a copy and, if so, ensuring that `_state.fields_cache` is either not shared with the original object or is appropriately deep-copied. This would prevent unexpected behavior when one of the instances (original or copy) changes its state or relation, ensuring that each instance maintains its integrity independently of the other."

This could involve: Ensuring `get_cached_value` and `is_cached` methods return values appropriately reflective of the instance's own state, not mistakenly sharing state with the original instance from which it was copied. Modifying `set_cached_value` to correctly assign new cache values to copies without affecting the original instance's cache. Adjusting `delete_cached_value` to ensure it only affects the intended instance's cache without unintended side effects on any copies or the original instance."
