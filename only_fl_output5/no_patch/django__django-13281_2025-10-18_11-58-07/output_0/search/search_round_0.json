It seems quite unexpected.\nWhat is the recommended way to clone a model instance? To date we have been using copy() in a similar fashion to the test without issue. deepcopy seems to work fine in >=2.0 but we haven\u2019t done too much testing yet.\nTest (placed in tests/model_fields/test_field_caching_change.py):\nimport copy\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom .models import Bar, Foo\nclass ForeignKeyCachingBehaviorTest(TestCase):\ndef test_copy(self):\nfoo1 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo1', d=1)\nfoo2 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo2', d=2)\nbar1 = Bar.objects.create(a=foo1, b='bar1')\nbar2 = copy.copy(bar1)\nbar2.pk = None\nbar2.a = foo2\n# bar2 points to foo2\nself.assertEqual(bar2.a, foo2)\nself.assertEqual(bar2.a.id, bar2.a_id)\n# bar1 is unchanged and must still point to foo1\n# These fail on Django >= 2.0\nself.assertEqual(bar1.a, foo1)\nself.assertEqual(bar1.a.id, bar1.a_id)\nand executed that via:\npython3.6 tests/runtests.py --parallel 1 model_fields\nIn \u200bhttps://groups.google.com/g/django-developers/c/QMhVPIqVVP4/m/mbezfaBEAwAJ Simon suggests:\n..... Model.copy should make sure to make a deep-copy of self._state now that fields are cached in self._state.fields_cache.\nwhich I will attempt to implement.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, let's make the following API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Given that we're dealing with a change in behavior related to foreign key (FK) field caching and model instance copying, it's important to see if the `Bar` and `Foo` models and their relationships are defined in a way that could be affecting this behavior. Thus, we will search for these classes:\n\n- `search_class(\"Bar\")`\n- `search_class(\"Foo\")`\n\n2. The description mentions the use of the `copy.copy` method and its interplay with FK fields. Since the issue appears to be related to how copied instances reference their foreign keys, we'll look for the implementation or overrides of `copy` methods within these models, if any:\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"copy\", \"Bar\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"copy\", \"Foo\")`\n\n3. The issue's description also suggests that a change in Django's handling of `_state.fields_cache` might be causing this, implying that the model's state or the way Django caches fields has evolved. Let's search for references of fields_cache to understand how it's used or modified across the codebase:\n\n- `search_code(\"_state.fields_cache\")`\n\n4. To get more insight into recommended practices for cloning model instances in Django versions greater than 2.0, and considering the suggestion regarding making a deep copy of `self._state`, it would be useful to see if there's a method or pattern established in the Django codebase for cloning model instances appropriately:\n\n- `search_method(\"deepcopy\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a solid foundation of code context to identify the cause of the described issue and formulate a recommended approach for cloning model instances that maintains FK field relationships correctly in Django 2.x."
