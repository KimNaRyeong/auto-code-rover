It seems quite unexpected.\nWhat is the recommended way to clone a model instance? To date we have been using copy() in a similar fashion to the test without issue. deepcopy seems to work fine in >=2.0 but we haven\u2019t done too much testing yet.\nTest (placed in tests/model_fields/test_field_caching_change.py):\nimport copy\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom .models import Bar, Foo\nclass ForeignKeyCachingBehaviorTest(TestCase):\ndef test_copy(self):\nfoo1 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo1', d=1)\nfoo2 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo2', d=2)\nbar1 = Bar.objects.create(a=foo1, b='bar1')\nbar2 = copy.copy(bar1)\nbar2.pk = None\nbar2.a = foo2\n# bar2 points to foo2\nself.assertEqual(bar2.a, foo2)\nself.assertEqual(bar2.a.id, bar2.a_id)\n# bar1 is unchanged and must still point to foo1\n# These fail on Django >= 2.0\nself.assertEqual(bar1.a, foo1)\nself.assertEqual(bar1.a.id, bar1.a_id)\nand executed that via:\npython3.6 tests/runtests.py --parallel 1 model_fields\nIn \u200bhttps://groups.google.com/g/django-developers/c/QMhVPIqVVP4/m/mbezfaBEAwAJ Simon suggests:\n..... Model.copy should make sure to make a deep-copy of self._state now that fields are cached in self._state.fields_cache.\nwhich I will attempt to implement.\n</issue>"

Given that we're dealing with a change in behavior related to foreign key (FK) field caching and model instance copying, it's important to see if the `Bar` and `Foo` models and their relationships are defined in a way that could be affecting this behavior. Thus, we will search for these classes:\n\n- `search_class(\"Bar\")`\n- `search_class(\"Foo\")`\n\n2. The description mentions the use of the `copy.copy` method and its interplay with FK fields. Since the issue appears to be related to how copied instances reference their foreign keys, we'll look for the implementation or overrides of `copy` methods within these models, if any:\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"copy\", \"Bar\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"copy\", \"Foo\")`\n\n3. The issue's description also suggests that a change in Django's handling of `_state.fields_cache` might be causing this, implying that the model's state or the way Django caches fields has evolved. Let's search for references of fields_cache to understand how it's used or modified across the codebase:\n\n- `search_code(\"_state.fields_cache\")`\n\n4. To get more insight into recommended practices for cloning model instances in Django versions greater than 2.0, and considering the suggestion regarding making a deep copy of `self._state`, it would be useful to see if there's a method or pattern established in the Django codebase for cloning model instances appropriately:\n\n- `search_method(\"deepcopy\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a solid foundation of code context to identify the cause of the described issue and formulate a recommended approach for cloning model instances that maintains FK field relationships correctly in Django 2.x."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context and considering the absence of some specific results, let's proceed in the following manner:\n\n### Analyzing Collected Context\n\n#### The Issue with ForeignKey (FK) Field Caching and Model Cloning\nThe reported issue revolves around the unexpected change in FK field caching behavior when copying model instances. This behavior change was observed when upgrading a Django project from version 1.11.x to 2.x, affecting the integrity of references after a shallow copy (`copy.copy`) operation.\n\n#### 1. `_state.fields_cache` in the Django Codebase\nThe snippets found in `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/fields/mixins.py` that reference `_state.fields_cache` probably deal with the caching mechanism of model field values and state management.\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  This code likely interacts with, caches, or modifies the state of model fields, including but not limited to ForeignKey fields, which could impact how cloned models retain or lose their FK relationships.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug**: Since the unexpected behavior involves FK fields losing their integrity upon copying, the modifications or the way `_state.fields_cache` is handled in Django>=2.0 could be a potential cause. This gives a direct line of investigation to see how field caching behavior has changed and if it interferes with copying techniques.\n\n- **Intended behavior**: Ideally, when a model instance is copied, its FK relationships should remain intact, or the developer should have a clear, documented way to ensure integrity post-copy. This means any caching should either not interfere with copying or need to be addressed as part of the copy operation.\n\n#### Addressing the Absence of `Bar` and `Foo` Models and `deepcopy` Method\nGiven the `Bar` and `Foo` models are not found within the codebase (implying they are user-defined models in the project being upgraded), and the `deepcopy` method is not directly located, it's inferred that the provided code snippet was more an illustrative example to describe the issue rather than pinpoint specific implementations within Django's own code. However, since `deepcopy` worked fine according to the issue description, it suggests a need for a deeper (no pun intended) cloning method that encompasses the `_state` attribute or similar internals correctly.\n\n### Next Steps in Getting More Context\n\nBased on the analysis above, the next steps should involve:\n\n1. **Exploring How `_state.fields_cache` is Managed**: Since we have locations where `_state.fields_cache` is referenced, delving further into these specific files will provide insight into how caching has changed and what considerations are made for object copying.\n   \n   - `search_code_in_file(\"_state.fields_cache\", \"django/db/models/query.py\")`\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"_state.fields_cache\", \"django/db/models/fields/mixins.py\")`\n\n2. **Understanding Django's Model Copy Mechanisms**: Given the absence of results related to `deepcopy`, it would be beneficial to explore model copying or instance creation mechanisms further to recommend a robust solution. This includes understanding how Django models manage state deepcopying internally or providing utility functions for this purpose.\n\n3. **Further Documentation or Community Guidance Search**: Looking into Django's documentation or community-discussed solutions for model copying post-2.x would offer additional insights or recommended practices that could not only address the bug but also guide developers facing similar upgrade issues."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

This might involve introducing checks or logic to refresh or reconstruct the fields cache for copied instances, preventing unintended reference sharing between the original and the copied object.\n\n#### Bug Location 2:\n- **File**: Potentially involves files related to model instance creation or copying, though specific files beyond the mentioned two are unclear.\n\n- **Intended Behavior**: If the Django codebase does not currently provide a built-in, documented method for safely copying model instances (with FK fields) that accounts for changes in caching behavior or `_state` management in Django 2.x, then a recommended approach or utility function should be introduced or documented. This method should detail handling `_state.fields_cache`, among other considerations, to facilitate accurate and predictable clone/copy behaviors.\n\nThis handling would address not only the FK caching but potentially other subtle issues that arise from the evolution of Django\u2019s internal model management from 1.11.x to 2.x and beyond."
