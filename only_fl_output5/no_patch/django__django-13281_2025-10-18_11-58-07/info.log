</code><intended_behavior>When prefetching related objects, the system should properly handle the fields cache for copied instances. This might mean detecting if an object is a copy and, if so, ensuring that `_state.fields_cache` is either not shared with the original object or is appropriately deep-copied. This would prevent unexpected behavior when one of the instances (original or copy) changes its state or relation, ensuring that each instance maintains its integrity independently of the other.</intended_behavior>, <file>django/db/models/fields/mixins.py</file>

</code><intended_behavior>These methods should be enhanced to correctly manage caching for model instance copies. This could involve: Ensuring `get_cached_value` and `is_cached` methods return values appropriately reflective of the instance's own state, not mistakenly sharing state with the original instance from which it was copied. Modifying `set_cached_value` to correctly assign new cache values to copies without affecting the original instance's cache. Adjusting `delete_cached_value` to ensure it only affects the intended instance's cache without unintended side effects on any copies or the original instance.</intended_behavior>]
