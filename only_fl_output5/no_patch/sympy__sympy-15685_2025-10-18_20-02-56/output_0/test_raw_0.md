This script starts by defining `print_stacktrace` for detailed error messages. It then tries to reproduce the mentioned issue by dividing quantities of voltage by current and converting to ohm, expecting a straightforward result matching `ohm` without the unexpected `ohm / 1000` scale factor discrepancy.

If the issue is present, an `AssertionError` will be raised, and the `print_stacktrace` function will elucidate where the test failed, making it clearer how the issue manifested. Conversely, if the script does not raise an `AssertionError`, it indicates that the problem has been resolved, and it exits with code 0 to signify success.
