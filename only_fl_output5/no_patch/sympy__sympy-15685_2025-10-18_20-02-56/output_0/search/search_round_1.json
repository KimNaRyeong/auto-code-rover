In the SI system, 1 V/ 1 A = 1 \u03a9.\n### What I Did\n```\n>>> from sympy.physics.units import Quantity, voltage, current, ohm, convert_to\n>>> vs = Quantity('vs')\n>>> vs.set_dimension(voltage)\n>>> vs_i = Quantity('vs_i')\n>>> vs_i.set_dimension(current)\n>>> convert_to(vs/vs_i, ohm)\nohm/1000\n```\n### Further discussion\nThe problem is related to the kilogram workaround and the property `scale_factor`. The default scale_factor for a Quantity is 1.\n```\n>>> vs.scale_factor\n1.0\n```\nThe docstring for `scale_factor' states:\n> Overall magnitude of the quantity as compared to the canonical units.\nBut, the scale factor for ohm is 1000.\n```\n>>> ohm.scale_factor\n1000\nThis value of 1000 conflicts with the definition. `scale_factor` is a user facing property and should be consistent with the unit system definition, in this case the SI. The kilogram workaround should be an internal implementation factor and not exposed to the user.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context around the issue with the `.scale_factor` in the `Quantity` class, we can derive insights and relate them to the bug description as well as plan further steps towards resolving the issue. Here's a breakdown based on the obtained results:\n\n### 1. `Quantity` Class Analysis\nThe `Quantity` class extends `AtomicExpr` and includes properties and methods for handling physical quantities, including their dimensions and scale factors. Notably, the class defines methods like `set_dimension` and `set_scale_factor`, and properties like `dimension` and `scale_factor`. The presence of `scale_factor` as a property confirms it's designed to be directly accessed, which is at the heart of the reported issue.\n\n**Relevance to Bug**: The direct access and modification of `scale_factor` are central to the problem, especially considering the aim to make it private to prevent misuse or inconsistency as observed in the issue. Making `.scale_factor` private means changes will be needed in how this property is accessed and modified throughout the codebase.\n\n### 2. Usage of `.scale_factor` in the Codebase\nThe `.scale_factor` is referenced in multiple files, indicating its importance in unit conversions and calculations within the units system of SymPy. This widespread use underscores the need for careful refactoring to make `.scale_factor` private while ensuring backward compatibility or at least a clear migration path for users.\n\n**Relevance to Bug**: Understanding where and how `.scale_factor` is used will be critical to implementing a fix. The references across `prefixes.py`, `quantities.py`, and `util.py` signal areas of impact by the proposed change.\n\n### 3. `set_dimension` Method\nThe method `set_dimension` serves to assign a dimension to a `Quantity`, with strict checking against the SI system and raising exceptions for unsupported units or dimensions. This method's implementation emphasizes the framework's emphasis on accurately representing physical dimensions.\n\n**Relevance to Bug**: While not directly modifying `scale_factor`, the `set_dimension` method relates to the issue by governing how dimensions\u2014and implicitly, their scale\u2014are managed. Understanding its workings is valuable in considering how dimensions and scale factors interact and ensuring that changes to scale factor handling don't inadvertently impact dimensionality consistency.\n\n### 4. The Kilogram Workaround\nNo direct references to a \"kilogram workaround\" were found through the search APIs, suggesting that this workaround might be an informal term for handling scale factors or dimensions relating to kilograms that are not explicitly labeled as such in the code.\n\n**Next Steps**:\nConsidering the absence of information on the \"kilogram workaround\", it might be necessary to explore further into how `Quantity` objects handle dimensions and scale factors specific to mass or related units, possibly through exploring:\n- How `SI_quantity_scale_factors` is used or populated.\n- Examining the initialization of commonly used units like kilogram, ohm, volt, and ampere in the code, to understand their scale factors' setup.\n\n### Further API Calls Needed\n\nTo further investigate the implementation details concerning the handling of units, especially kilogram and related scale factors, and to understand the initialization and management of `SI_quantity_scale_factors`, the following API calls could provide more context:\n\n- `search_code(\"SI_quantity_scale_factors\")`: To understand how scale factors are managed at a global or class level.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"kilogram\", \"sympy/physics/units/quantities.py\")`: Since \"kilogram workaround\" did not yield results, directly searching for how kilograms are handled might provide clues.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"ohm.scale_factor\", \"sympy/physics/units/quantities.py\")`: To see specifically how ohm\u2019s scale factor is set or manipulated, given the issue's example.\n\nThese steps are necessary for crafting a detailed approach to making `.scale_factor` private while ensuring the integrity and functionality of the units module."

To resolve this issue while preserving existing functionality:\n- Make `.scale_factor` a private attribute (e.g., `_scale_factor`) to encapsulate its access and modification strictly within the `Quantity` class.\n- Introduce getter and setter methods for the scale factor (e.g., `get_scale_factor` and `set_scale_factor`) that can include validation logic to prevent incorrect modifications. The setter method can include transformations or checks related to unit consistency, especially for units affected by the kilogram workaround or others leading to unexpected scale factors.\n- Review and adjust all internal usages of `.scale_factor` within the `Quantities` class and potentially across other utility functions or classes within the units module (`prefixes.py`, `util.py`) to use the new protected member and its access methods. This transition will ensure that all manipulations of the scale factor are consistent with the newly implemented logic.\n- Document the change, informing users of the revised approach to accessing and modifying scale factors, directing them to use the new getter/setter methods or highlighting the change if `.scale_factor` needs to remain public in some form for backward compatibility, perhaps via a deprecation warning or a transition period where both access methods are supported.\n\nThis change aims to encapsulate the handling of scale factors, thereby reducing the risk of direct, unvalidated modifications that can lead to inconsistencies or incorrect calculations within the unit system. It preserves the ability to get and set scale factors as needed but through a controlled and validated interface."
