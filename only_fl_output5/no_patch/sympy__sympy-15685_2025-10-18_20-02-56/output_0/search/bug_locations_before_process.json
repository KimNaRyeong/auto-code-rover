        "intended_behavior": "The `.scale_factor` property within the `Quantity` class is currently public, allowing direct access and modification which can lead to inconsistencies in unit calculations, as exemplified by the issue where dividing a voltage by a current quantity yields `ohm/1000` instead of `ohm`. To resolve this issue while preserving existing functionality:\n- Make `.scale_factor` a private attribute (e.g., `_scale_factor`) to encapsulate its access and modification strictly within the `Quantity` class.\n- Introduce getter and setter methods for the scale factor (e.g., `get_scale_factor` and `set_scale_factor`) that can include validation logic to prevent incorrect modifications. The setter method can include transformations or checks related to unit consistency, especially for units affected by the kilogram workaround or others leading to unexpected scale factors.\n- Review and adjust all internal usages of `.scale_factor` within the `Quantities` class and potentially across other utility functions or classes within the units module (`prefixes.py`, `util.py`) to use the new protected member and its access methods. This transition will ensure that all manipulations of the scale factor are consistent with the newly implemented logic.\n- Document the change, informing users of the revised approach to accessing and modifying scale factors, directing them to use the new getter/setter methods or highlighting the change if `.scale_factor` needs to remain public in some form for backward compatibility, perhaps via a deprecation warning or a transition period where both access methods are supported.\n\nThis change aims to encapsulate the handling of scale factors, thereby reducing the risk of direct, unvalidated modifications that can lead to inconsistencies or incorrect calculations within the unit system. It preserves the ability to get and set scale factors as needed but through a controlled and validated interface."
