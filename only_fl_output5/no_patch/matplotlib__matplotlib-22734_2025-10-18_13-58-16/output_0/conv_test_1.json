It will attempt to verify if the color mapping correctly applies the `clim` range as expected. If the issue is present (i.e., the `clim` parameter is ignored), it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace. Otherwise, if the issue is resolved and the behavior is as expected, the script will exit normally with code 0.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef test_tripcolor_clim():\n    x = np.random.rand(100)\n    y = np.random.rand(100)\n    z = np.random.rand(100)\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n    collection = ax.tripcolor(x, y, z, clim=(0, 0.5))\n    plt.colorbar(collection)\n\n    # Get the limits of the color mapping\n    clim_actual = collection.get_clim()\n\n    # Expected clim values\n    clim_expected = (0, 0.5)\n\n    try:\n        assert clim_actual == clim_expected, f\"clim_actual {clim_actual} != clim_expected {clim_expected}\"\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_tripcolor_clim()\n\n    # If no exception was raised, the test passed\n    print(\"Test passed successfully.\")\n```\n\nThis script performs the following steps:\n\n1. Uses `matplotlib` to plot random data using `tripcolor`, specifying the color limit (`clim`) explicitly.\n2. Retrieves the actual color limit (`clim`) used by the `tripcolor` plot.\n3. Asserts whether the actual `clim` matches the expected `clim` values. If they do not match (indicating that the `clim` parameter was ignored), it raises an `AssertionError`.\n4. If an AssertionError is caught, it uses the `print_stacktrace` function to print the stack trace and then re-raises the exception to halt execution.\n5. If the script executes without raising an `AssertionError`, it indicates the test passed successfully, printing a confirmation message.\n\nTo run this test, place `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project and execute it using Python 3:\n\n```\npython3 reproducer.py\n```\n\nEnsure you have the specified version of Matplotlib installed, or adjust the script accordingly for compatibility with the version you are testing with."
