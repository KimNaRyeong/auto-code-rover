We should start by locating the `tripcolor` method to understand its current implementation and see where `kwargs` are being passed.\n   \n2. **Method Search:** Since the handling of `kwargs` and specifically the argument `clim` might involve the `_scale_norm` function (as hinted by the additional information provided in the issue), it is important to find where `_scale_norm` is declared and how it is currently used within `tripcolor`.\n\n3. **Code Search:** To understand how `kwargs` are currently being handled in the `tripcolor` method and to see if there's a specific part where `clim` should have been considered but wasn't, searching for the usage of `kwargs` within the scope of `tripcolor` could be insightful.\n\nThus, the API calls I would invoke for this task are:\n- `search_method(\"tripcolor\")`: To find the implementation of `tripcolor`.\n- `search_method(\"_scale_norm\")`: To find the implementation of `_scale_norm`.\n- `search_code(\"kwargs\"): This might be too broad without restricting the search to files or classes. If the initial search results are too broad, we may need to refine this by specifying a file or class context obtained from the first two searches."
