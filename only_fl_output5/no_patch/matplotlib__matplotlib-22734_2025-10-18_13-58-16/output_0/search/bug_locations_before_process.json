        "intended_behavior": "The `tripcolor` function needs to ensure that the `clim` parameter (or `vmin` and `vmax` equivalents) is accurately considered and applied when creating the color plot. This involves proper handling of these values before the `_scale_norm` call to ensure they modify the color mapping limits as expected. Given the issue, the correction would likely involve ensuring that `vmin` and `vmax` are either directly extracted from `clim` (if passed) and used to set the color limits appropriately in the plotting process. The existing functionality around shading, triangulation, and color application must remain unaffected by this change. Properly forwarding `vmin` and `vmax` to `_scale_norm` ensures that color limits are accurately applied, addressing the bug where the color mapping does not respect the specified limits."

        "intended_behavior": "While the `_scale_norm` method's main responsibility is ensuring that `norm` takes precedence over `vmin` and `vmax`, it may require a review to confirm it effectively supports the expected behavior when `vmin` and `vmax` are explicitly provided (via `clim` in `tripcolor`). The method should continue to enforce its rule that `norm` and `vmin`/`vmax` cannot be specified simultaneously unless it's part of the intended use-case with `clim`. The integrity of this error-checking mechanism should be maintained or adjusted only to allow correct application of `clim` without introducing regressions. This might involve adding a clearer pathway for `clim` values to be handled or ensuring that the interaction between `vmin`, `vmax`, and `norm` seamlessly accommodates the scenario described by the bug report."
