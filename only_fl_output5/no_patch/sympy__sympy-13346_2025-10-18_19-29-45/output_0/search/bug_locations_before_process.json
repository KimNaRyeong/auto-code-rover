        "intended_behavior": "The `DeferredVector` representation and its interaction with `lambdify` should, ideally, maintain type fidelity based on the operations involved. While the class accurately provides a symbolic vector for computation, the issue arises during the numeric evaluation (as seen in the doctest failure). Thus, the intended behavior here should ensure that numeric results are returned in a type-consistent manner with the input and the nature of the operation. In the specific case where operations lead to integer results, even if NumPy is not available, the system should return integers instead of floating-point numbers. This might necessitate either a review of the `lambdify` functionality or potentially adding a method or a check within `DeferredVector` that ensures type consistency based on the context of its usage."
