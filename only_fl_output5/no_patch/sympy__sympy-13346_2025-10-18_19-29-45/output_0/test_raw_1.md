Crafting a more precise solution to reproduce the specific issues listed, while fully acknowledging the constraints shared in the initial attempt, is critical. Given the variety of errors and their dependency on not having NumPy installed, this corrected approach will focus on setting up a minimal reproducible example for one of the test cases mentioned. You should expand this strategy to cover all the affected areas for a comprehensive diagnostic procedure. 

As we're focusing on the issues mentioned without directly invoking any NumPy functionalities and considering the nature of the errors occurring in an environment where NumPy is absent, it's pertinent to carefully design the test to mimic expected failures accurately.

Here's a sample `reproducer.py`, focused on accurately simulating a scenario closest to one of the mentioned test failures, while incorporating the function to print the stack trace for any `AssertionError` encountered.

```python
# Save this script as reproducer.py in the project's root directory.
# Ensure to run this in an environment where NumPy is not installed or is inaccessible to genuinely reproduce the reported issue.

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_issue_sympy():
    from sympy import symbols, Sum, oo, factorial, pi
    # Attempting to reproduce a failure similar to one mentioned.
    n = symbols('n')
    expr = Sum((2**-10 * factorial(4*n) * (1103 + 26390*n) / factorial(n)**4 / 396**(4*n)), (n, 0, oo))
    pi_str = str(expr.evalf(100))
    assert pi_str.startswith('3.141'), "Pi computation failed or accuracy is compromised"
    
try:
    test_issue_sympy()
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise
else:
    print("Test passed. The issue appears to be fixed.")
```

This script is structured to simulate failure in an environment where NumPy might influence the outcome of mathematical computations, focusing primarily on symbolic computation that is expected to fail based on the reported issues when NumPy is not present.

### Execution Details:

- Save the script in the root directory of the project.
- Make sure the environment does not have NumPy installed to accurately reproduce the conditions reported.
- Execute the script using `python3 reproducer.py`.

The script is tailor-made to specifically target and replicates one of the scenario types described. For a comprehensive approach, it's recommended to craft similar tests reflecting every unique issue outlined, adjusting mathematical expressions, and involved functions accordingly.
