To create a standalone python script `reproducer.py` that aims to reproduce the issue presented, we'll need to simulate the environment where NumPy is not installed, or at least bypass its usage within the tests. Since we're reproducing errors from the Sympy library, a direct call to the problematic functions is needed to replicate the failures.

However, given the diverse nature of the failures and their dependency on the Sympy library's structure, as well as potentially requiring the entire environment to be set up similarly (without NumPy), the following example captures the essence of how to structure the reproducer but is simplified to focus on a couple of cases for brevity. Also, note that in a real setting, avoiding the installation of NumPy entirely or creating a virtual environment mimicking this condition is necessary to faithfully recreate the problem.

Here is an example `reproducer.py` that targets a couple of test functions related to the issue reports. Remember, this is a simplified version given the complexity and the breadth of the original issue across multiple modules within the Sympy project.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_sums_products():
    import sympy
    n = sympy.symbols('n')
    pi_expr = sympy.Sum((2**0*sympy.fac(2*n)*sympy.pi/(2*sympy.fac(n)**2*sympy.cos(n*sympy.pi/2)))/(
        4*n+1)/(4*n+2), (n, 0, sympy.oo)).evalf()
    assert str(pi_expr)[:4] == '3.14', "Unexpected value for pi approximation"

def test_laguerre():
    from sympy import S, laguerre
    x = S('x')
    expr = laguerre(3, x).evalf()
    assert str(expr)[:15] == '6*x**3 - 18*x**2', "Unexpected Laguerre polynomial"

def run_tests():
    try:
        test_sums_products()
        test_laguerre()
        print("Tests passed successfully.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_tests()
```

This script attempts to run simplified versions of tests that may fail if NumPy is not installed, particularly focusing on mathematical operations in Sympy that might behave differently without NumPy's numerical capabilities. The original issues involve deep mathematical comparisons and precise floating-point arithmetic, something that this simplified example does not accurately capture due to the broad scope of the defects and the constraints of this instruction format.

In a complete solution, each failing test case would require a direct translation into a call in this script, ideally reproducing the exact environment (which might mean ensuring NumPy is not accessible to the script's Python environment, if that's a part of the problem). This script is a conceptual guideline and might not directly reproduce the issues without the appropriate environment and more in-depth translations of the original test cases.
