        "intended_behavior": "The `translate_url` method should account for optional named groups in URL patterns when attempting to translate URLs. This includes ensuring that when some optional elements are not present, the method still generates a valid and correct URL that adheres to the specified `lang_code`. This might involve additional logic to check for optional parameters in `match.args` and `match.kwargs` before attempting to create a translated URL with `reverse()`. The functionality should remain the same for URLs without optional groups, meaning the method still tries to translate the URL and falls back to the original URL if a translation cannot be formed. The modifications should specifically address the handling of optional named groups to prevent errors or incorrect translations due to their absence."
