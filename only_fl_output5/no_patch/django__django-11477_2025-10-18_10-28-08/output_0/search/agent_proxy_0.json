This information suggests that the `translate_url()` method is central to the problem.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls would be helpful in gathering the required context:\n\n1. **search_method(\"translate_url\")**: This call will help identify where the `translate_url()` method is defined across the entire project. Since the issue involves this method, finding its definition is crucial to understand how it currently handles URL translation and where it might be going wrong with optional arguments.\n\n2. **search_code(\"optional named groups\")**: The issue description mentions problems related to \"optional named groups.\" Searching the codebase for this phrase might lead us to relevant parts of the code that handle these optional named groups, potentially in relation to URL patterns or the `translate_url()` method itself.\n\nThese searches are aimed at identifying the critical components of the codebase related to the bug report and will serve as a foundation for further investigation and development of a fix."
