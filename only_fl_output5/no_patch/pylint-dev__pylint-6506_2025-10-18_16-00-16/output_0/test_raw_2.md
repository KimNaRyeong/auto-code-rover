Given the feedback and the aims outlined, let's craft a Python script tailored to reproduce the discussed issue. This script assumes that the environment is properly set up with `pylint` installed, and its path should not cause the `FileNotFoundError` seen in the previous attempt.

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    """Prints a detailed stack trace of the given exception."""
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_pylint_unrecognized_option():
    """Tests pylint with an unrecognized option to check for improper traceback."""
    try:
        # Attempt to invoke pylint with an unrecognized option
        # Directly using Python's -m option to ensure the module is called if pylint is in path
        process = subprocess.run(
            ['python', '-m', 'pylint', '-Q'],
            text=True,
            check=True,
            capture_output=True
        )
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        # Assert that behavior when encountering an unrecognized option has changed
        error_output = e.stderr
        if "Traceback (most recent call last):" in error_output:
            # Unwanted traceback observed
            print("Observed the unwanted traceback as detailed below:", file=sys.stderr)
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("Detected unintentional traceback when passing an unrecognized option to pylint.")
        else:
            # Expected failure without the traceback
            print("No traceback observed with following error output:", file=sys.stdout)
            print(error_output, file=sys.stdout)
    else:
        # pylint did not exit with an error as expected
        output_message = process.stderr or process.stdout
        raise AssertionError(f"Expected pylint to fail with an unrecognized option, but it ran successfully. Output: {output_message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_pylint_unrecognized_option()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(f"Test failed due to an AssertionError: {error}", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)  # Signal failure
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Signal failure due to unexpected error
    print("Test passed - the issue appears fixed or could not be replicated.", file=sys.stdout)
    sys.exit(0)  # Signal success
```

This script utilizes Python's `-m` command-line flag to run the installed `pylint` module, which should mitigate path-related errors encountered in certain environments. It aims to raise an `AssertionError` if the undesirable traceback is observed or exits cleanly if the issue is not present. Always ensure that your environment is correctly configured to find and run `pylint`.
