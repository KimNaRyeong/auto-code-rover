Based on the conditions you've described, the Python script below is designed to recreate the reported issue when an unrecognized option is passed to `pylint`, leading to a traceback. This script would raise an `AssertionError` if the malfunction is present, but should exit cleanly if the issue is resolved.

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    """Prints a detailed stack trace of the given exception."""
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_pylint_unrecognized_option():
    """Tests pylint with an unrecognized option to check for improper traceback."""

    try:
        # Attempt to invoke pylint with an unrecognized option
        process = subprocess.run(
            ['pylint', '-Q'],
            text=True, 
            check=True, 
            capture_output=True
        )
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        # Assert that behavior when encountering an unrecognized option has changed
        error_output = e.stderr
        if "Traceback (most recent call last):" in error_output:
            # We are handling the debugger-specific scenario to assess unwanted traceback
            print("Observed the unwanted traceback as detailed below:")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("Detected unintentional traceback when passing an unrecognized option to pylint.")
        else:
            # If traceback is not found, consider it a fix indication
            print("No traceback observed. This part aligns with expectations.")
    else:
        # pylint did not exit with an error as expected
        output_message = process.stderr or process.stdout
        raise AssertionError(f"Expected pylint to fail with an unrecognized option, but it ran successfully. Output: {output_message}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_pylint_unrecognized_option()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(f"Test failed due to an AssertionError: {error}")
        sys.exit(1)  # Signal failure
    print("Test passed - the issue appears fixed or could not be replicated.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Signal success
```

Please ensure that `pylint` is installed in your environment and is accessible in the system path for the script to function properly. Adjustments may be necessary based on your specific development setup or if there are differences in the behavior of `pylint` or the underlying system that were not accounted for in the original issue report.
