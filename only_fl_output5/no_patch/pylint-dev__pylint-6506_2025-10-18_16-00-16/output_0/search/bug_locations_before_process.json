The existing functionality to collect and identify unrecognized options is appropriate but should conclude with user guidance rather than an exception throw. Additionally, integrate better with `argparse`'s inherent mechanisms for handling unrecognized arguments to streamline the user experience."

        "intended_behavior": "Enhance the exception handling within this method to specifically catch `_UnrecognizedOptionError` exceptions, providing a more informative and user-friendly output that guides the user towards correct usage. This approach should preserve the method's current functionality of executing Pylint while refining the user interface in error scenarios. This change means implementing a try-except block around `PylintRun` invocation to catch the `_UnrecognizedOptionError` and handle it by printing an error message and possibly the general usage instructions, rather than exiting with a traceback."
