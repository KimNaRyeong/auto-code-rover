        "intended_behavior": "The intended modification is to enhance the `simplify` method by introducing an additional parameter, `max_rec_steps`, which controls the depth of recursive simplification attempts. This parameter should default to 0 (or another sensible default value indicating no recursion), preserving existing functionality for current users of the method. If `max_rec_steps` is greater than 0, the function should recursively apply itself to the expression, decrementing `max_rec_steps` with each recursion, until the most simplified form is reached or `max_rec_steps` decrements to 0. This ensures that if further simplification is possible beyond the initial pass, additional passes are automatically attempted, aiming to reach a more fully simplified expression without requiring manual re-application of the `simplify` function. The measure of simplification (e.g., `measure(expr)` vs `measure(original_expr)`) should be used to prevent unnecessary recursion when no further simplification is achieved. The recursive logic should be carefully designed to integrate with the existing simplification strategy application mechanism, ensuring that the new functionality seamlessly enhances the method\u2019s capability to simplify expressions in a more thorough and user-friendly manner."
