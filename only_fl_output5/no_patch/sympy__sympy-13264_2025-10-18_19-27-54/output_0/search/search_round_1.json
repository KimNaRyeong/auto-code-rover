Full script is attached in the .zip file:\n[simplify_last_step.zip](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/files/76131/simplify_last_step.zip)\n---\nI've been using Sympy to compute Laplacian in different geometrical coordinates system. This usually creates extremelly long expressions and simplify usually does a great job. However, I've come against one particular case where simplify does most of the job but doesn't perform the ultimate simplification step.\nI've reduced the problem set getting rid of all of the Derivative terms. The initial\nexpression is still huge (675 ops!):\n![initial_expression](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072960/a0c94034-b0b6-11e5-8626-90608bf70b84.png)\nA first call to `simplify` sucessfully reduces it to :\n![simplify](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072961/b681be7e-b0b6-11e5-9ddd-e5d077329773.png)\nWhich is great (23 ops), but somehow frustrating as we can factorize it a little more. If I apply `simplify` again, then I get the expression I wanted (7 ops):\n![simplify_bis](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072964/d2760f7c-b0b6-11e5-9562-37d4d32c9b88.png)\n---\nIf simplify worked perfectly, `simplify(simplify(expr))` shouldn't yield a different result from `simplify(expr)`\nFrom my understanding of how simplify works, it successively tries different simplification strategies  and compares them. In that case, the order of the different strategies matters. In my particular case, the strategy than eventually did the final factorisation step may have been called to early.\nI fixed that calling simplify again. We could fix it applying an optional recursive mode at the end of the simplify function:\n``` python\ndef simplify(expr, ratio=1.7, measure=count_ops, fu=False, max_rec_steps=0):\n\"\"\"\nSimplifies the given expression.\nInput\n========\nmax_rec_steps: int\nif >0, simplified is applied recursively with a maximum of 'max_rec_steps'\ntimes.\n(...)\n\"\"\"\n(...)\nif measure(expr) > ratio*measure(original_expr):\nexpr = original_expr\nif max_rec_steps>0 and measure(expr)<measure(original_expr):\nsexpr = simplify(expr, ratio, measure, fu, max_rec_steps=max_rec_steps-1)\nexpr = shorter(expr,sexpr)\nreturn expr\n```\nI can make the pull request if that helps.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the information collected from the API calls:\n\n### Analysis of `search_method(\"simplify\")` Results\n\nThe `simplify` method is widely used across the Sympy codebase, as indicated by the search results showing 20 methods named `simplify` in various files. Notably, it appears in core areas such as logic operations, vector calculations, matrix operations, physics vector handling, special functions, core expressions, and polynomial domains. This widespread usage underscores the method's fundamental role in SymPy for simplifying expressions in various mathematical contexts.\n\nThe presence of a `simplify` method within the file `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` (with 1 match) is particularly relevant to the issue, suggesting that this file likely contains the general-purpose simplification function that is applied to Sympy expressions.\n\n### Analysis of `search_code(\"def simplify(expr, ratio=1.7, measure=count_ops, fu=False\")` Results\n\nThe snippet found in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` confirms the location and the definition of the general `simplify` function. The brief glance at the function's signature shows that it currently accepts parameters such as `expr` (the expression to simplify), `ratio` (likely a heuristic for simplification), `measure` (a function to measure the complexity of an expression, defaulting to `count_ops` which counts the operations in the expression), and `fu` (which is not described in the snippet but might refer to applying specific simplification rules or strategies).\n\n### Relationship with the Bug and Intended Behavior\n\nThe issue describes the `simplify` function not always achieving the most simplified form of an expression on the first attempt but requiring a subsequent call to fully simplify the expression. This behavior suggests that the method's strategy for simplification might not exhaust all possible simplification pathways in a single pass or that certain simplification strategies are applied in an order that doesn't always lead to the most simplified result initially.\n\nGiven the function's purpose and the issue described, the intended modification would be to introduce an optional parameter (`max_rec_steps`) that allows the function to apply its simplification strategies recursively, up to a certain depth, to ensure more thorough simplification without requiring users to manually invoke `simplify` multiple times on the same expression.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nTo proceed with resolving the issue described, the following steps are necessary:\n\n1. **Further Examination of `simplify`:** It would be beneficial to examine the body of the `simplify` function in more depth, especially the logic determining how various simplification strategies are applied and in what order. This would require fetching the content of `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` around the definition of `simplify`.\n  \n2. **Identify Simplification Strategies Application:** Understanding the mechanism by which `simplify` decides on and applies different simplification strategies would help in formulating how a recursive approach could be integrated. This might be encapsulated in the logic after the line where `simplify` is defined.\n\n3. **Recursive Simplification Logic Proposal:** Based on the understanding of the current simplification process, draft a modification that allows setting a recursion depth, decreasing it with each recursive call to `simplify` until it reaches zero, thereby stopping further recursion.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next logical step entails detailed examination of the `simplify` function to craft an appropriate patch for the issue."

        "content": "1.\n\n2.\n- **Bug Location 1**: \n  - **File**: `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`\n  - **Method**: `simplify`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: The intended modification is to enhance the `simplify` method by introducing an additional parameter, `max_rec_steps`, which controls the depth of recursive simplification attempts. This parameter should default to 0 (or another sensible default value indicating no recursion), preserving existing functionality for current users of the method. If `max_rec_steps` is greater than 0, the function should recursively apply itself to the expression, decrementing `max_rec_steps` with each recursion, until the most simplified form is reached or `max_rec_steps` decrements to 0. This ensures that if further simplification is possible beyond the initial pass, additional passes are automatically attempted, aiming to reach a more fully simplified expression without requiring manual re-application of the `simplify` function. The measure of simplification (e.g., `measure(expr)` vs `measure(original_expr)`) should be used to prevent unnecessary recursion when no further simplification is achieved. The recursive logic should be carefully designed to integrate with the existing simplification strategy application mechanism, ensuring that the new functionality seamlessly enhances the method\u2019s capability to simplify expressions in a more thorough and user-friendly manner."
