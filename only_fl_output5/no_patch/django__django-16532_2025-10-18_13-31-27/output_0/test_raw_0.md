Below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that is designed to reproduce the issue when placed in the root directory of your Django project and run with Python 3. Ensure your environment is set up with Django and any other dependencies your project may require before executing the script.

```python
import os
import django
from django.core.management import call_command
from django.core.management.base import CommandError


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def run_migration():
    try:
        # Assuming that the application is named 'vault' and the problematic migration is '0002_rename_incident_folder'
        # You might need to adjust the migration name depending on your actual migration file names
        call_command("migrate", "vault", "0002_rename_incident_folder")
        print("Migration applied successfully, no issue detected.")
    except CommandError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Migration failure reproduced.") from e


if __name__ == "__main__":
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'edemo.settings')  # Adjust 'edemo.settings' to match your project settings
    django.setup()
    
    run_migration()
```

This script does the following:
1. Sets up a Django environment using the project settings.
2. Attempts to apply a specific migration, which in the context of the provided issue, is the migration that is expected to fail due to the RenameModel operation.
3. Catches the exception raised during the migration failure and prints a detailed stack trace using the `print_stacktrace` function.
4. Raises an `AssertionError` if the migration fails, indicating the issue is present.

Make sure to replace `"vault", "0002_rename_incident_folder"` with the actual app name and migration number causing the issue in your project. You should also adjust `'edemo.settings'` with your project's settings module path.

To use this script:
1. Place it in the root directory of the Django project.
2. Run the script using Python 3: `python3 reproducer.py`.

The script should produce a detailed stack trace if the issue is present. If the migration applies successfully (implying the issue is fixed or not present), it will simply print a success message.
