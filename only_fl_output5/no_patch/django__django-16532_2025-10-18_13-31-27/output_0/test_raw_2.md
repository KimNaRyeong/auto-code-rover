To accurately replicate the described issue involving a Django project with two apps having models named `Incident` and experiencing a failure upon attempting a model rename migration due to duplicate model names in a ManyToMany (M2M) relationship, a standalone script that can be run in the root directory of a Django project is provided below.

This script attempts to encapsulate the setup, models definition, migration generation, and application stages required to trigger and replicate the reported migration failure. It is a comprehensive approach to recreating the environment in which the problem occurs, including creating Django applications dynamically, defining models, and then running migrations.

```python
"""
reproducer.py

This script attempts to recreate the situation described where renaming a model
causes migration failures due to conflicting M2M relationship names generated
from models with identical names in different apps.

**Instructions for Use:**

1. **Integration**: Place this script in the root directory of your Django project.
2. **Execution**: Run the script using `python3 reproducerer.py`.
3. **Observation**: The script will dynamically create a minimal Django application environment intended to replicate the reported migration failure. It prints out details should an exception be encountered that matches the reported issue.

**Important Considerations:**
- **Django Environment**: This script assumes a Django environment. Ensure Django is installed (`pip install django`) and configured.
- **App Config**: This example assumes simplified app configurations for demonstration. You may need to adjust the configurations to match the structure and dependencies of your specific Django project context.
- **Migration Effects**: The script attempts to simulate the creation and migration of models within a temporary setup. However, it operates in the project's actual environment, which might affect your database and existing migrations. Backup your project and database before executing.

This script won't exactly replicate a migration rename failure due to the abstracted handling of migrations. For precise replication, the rename operation might need to be triggered under the specific project structure and migration states as they exist in your environment.
