        "intended_behavior": "The `as_relational` method within the `Range` class needs to be fixed to accurately represent ranges with steps other than 1. The correction involves adding an additional condition to the method that considers the step of the range and correctly applies the modulus operation to ensure that any value `x` satisfies the range's step interval. This will ensure the relational expression reflects that `x` not only lies within the bounds of the range but also adheres to its step. Specifically, the method should be updated to produce an expression of the form:\n   (x >= self.start) & (x <= self.last_element) & Eq(x, floor(x)) & Eq(Mod(x - self.start, self.step), 0)\n   where `last_element` is calculated as the largest value in the `Range` that is less than or equal to `stop` and conforms to the range's step. This update ensures the method functions correctly for all types of ranges, preserving the existing functionality while extending it to accurately handle ranges with arbitrary steps."
