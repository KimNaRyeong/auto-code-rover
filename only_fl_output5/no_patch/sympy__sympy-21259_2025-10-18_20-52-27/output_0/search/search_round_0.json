Here are the search API calls I would make for gathering the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Range\")`: This will help me find the file or files where the `Range` class is defined.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"as_relational\", \"Range\")`: This will help me locate the `as_relational` method within the `Range` class to see how it's currently implemented.\n3. `search_code(\"as_relational(x)\")`: The code snippet provided in the issue might be part of a larger block; finding other occurrences could reveal how ranges are generally converted to relational forms elsewhere in the codebase, offering insights or reusable logic."
