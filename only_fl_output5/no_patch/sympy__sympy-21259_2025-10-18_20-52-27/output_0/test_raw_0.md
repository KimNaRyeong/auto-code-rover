Below is a `reproducer.py` script designed to check for the described issue regarding the `Range.as_relational` method in SymPy. The purpose of this script is to verify if the output from the `as_relational` method matches the expected corrected form that includes a check for the modulus condition. If the issue exists, the script raises an AssertionError showing that the expected condition is not included in the output and prints a stack trace. Once the issue is corrected, it should exit with code 0 without any error.

```python
from sympy import Range, Eq, Mod, floor, symbols

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_issue():
    x = symbols('x')
    r = Range(3, 11, 2)
    expected = (x >= 3) & (x <= 9) & Eq(x, floor(x)) & Eq(Mod(x, 2), 1)
    try:
        assert r.as_relational(x) == expected
        print("Issue fixed, exiting with code 0.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Assertion failed: Expected expression does not match the output from as_relational method.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise SystemExit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_issue()
```

This script:
1. Imports necessary functions and classes from `sympy`.
2. Defines a `print_stacktrace` function to clearly output the line numbers and context for any errors.
3. Implements a `test_issue` function that:
   - Defines a symbol `x` used in the range.
   - Creates a `Range` object with specific parameters (`3, 11, 2`).
   - Defines the `expected` outcome incorporating the correct condition.
   - Asserts that the actual output from `Range.as_relational` matches the `expected` outcome.
   - Catches any `AssertionError`, prints a custom message, the stack trace, and exits with code 1 to indicate failure.
4. Calls `test_issue` when executed directly.

When the script is run, it will raise an `AssertionError` if the `Range.as_relational` method does not produce the correctly fixed outcome, highlighting the presence of the issue.
