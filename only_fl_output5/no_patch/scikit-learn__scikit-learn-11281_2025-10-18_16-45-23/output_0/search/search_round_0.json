They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers. But they are unlike clusterers in API:\n* they have an `n_components` parameter, with identical purpose to `n_clusters`\n* they do not store the `labels_` of the training data\n* they do not have a `fit_predict` method\nAnd they are almost entirely documented separately.\nShould we make the MMs more like clusterers?\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context on how mixture models are implemented and used in the project, especially in comparison to clusterers. Here's a plan for using the search APIs to find relevant code and documentation:\n\n1. **Search for Mixture Models and Clusterer Classes**: Since the issue mentions that mixture models and clusterers have different APIs, we should start by identifying the classes that represent these concepts in the project. \n\n2. **Examine Specific Differences**: The issue points out specific differences such as the `n_components` parameter, absence of `labels_` storage, and lack of a `fit_predict` method. We'll need to find where these are defined or not defined in the codebase.\n\nGiven this plan, here are the API calls I propose:\n\n1. `search_class(\"MixtureModel\")` - To identify the class(es) that implement mixture models.\n2. `search_class(\"Clusterer\")` - To identify the base class or specific classes that implement clustering.\n\nNext, for mixture models, we need to see if they indeed lack the features mentioned:\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"fit_predict\", \"MixtureModel\")` - To check if the `fit_predict` method is missing in the mixture model's implementation.\n4. `search_code(\"n_components\")` - To find instances of `n_components` being defined or used, which should help understand its commonality with `n_clusters`.\n5. `search_code(\"labels_\")` - To see where and how `labels_` are stored or not for mixture models compared to clusterers.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive view of the necessary components to address the issue, highlighting differences between mixture models and clusterers that may need modification for consistency."
