208         If bool, then determines whether to consider all features discrete
209         or continuous. If array, then it should be either a boolean mask
210         with shape (n_features,) or array with indices of discrete features.
211         If 'auto', it is assigned to False for dense `X` and to True for
212         sparse `X`.

215         Whether to consider `y` as a discrete variable.
216 
217     n_neighbors : int, default 3
218         Number of neighbors to use for MI estimation for continuous variables,
219         see [1]_ and [2]_. Higher values reduce variance of the estimation, but
220         could introduce a bias.
221 
222     copy : bool, default True
223         Whether to make a copy of the given data. If set to False, the initial
224         data will be overwritten.
225 
226     random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional, default None
227         The seed of the pseudo random number generator for adding small noise
228         to continuous variables in order to remove repeated values.  If int,
229         random_state is the seed used by the random number generator; If
