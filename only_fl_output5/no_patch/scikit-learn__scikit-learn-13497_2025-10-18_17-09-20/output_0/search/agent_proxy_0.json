The reported issue hints at an incorrect comparison that would fail in future numpy versions, and it suggests this logic is directly within the `_estimate_mi` function.\n\n1. We need to find which file or class contains `_estimate_mi`.\n2. We want to examine the usage of `discrete_features == 'auto'` to understand the current implementation.\n3. It could also be beneficial to check if there are tests related to `discrete_features != 'auto'` to gauge test coverage around this functionality.\n\nGiven these requirements, here are the necessary API calls:\n\n- search_method(\"_estimate_mi\")\n- search_code(\"discrete_features == 'auto'\")"
