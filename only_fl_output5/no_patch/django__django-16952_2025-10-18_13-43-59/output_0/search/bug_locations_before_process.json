        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `_save_parents` method should ensure that it correctly accesses the `attname` attribute for `OneToOneField` objects or any similar unique field types in parent models during the save operation. This includes possibly handling these fields differently if they do not directly map to the standard field attributes expected by the method. The method must ensure that parent-child linkage via `OneToOneField` accurately reflects the unique constraints and relationships defined by the user, without resulting in an `AttributeError`. The fix should maintain the method's functionality of saving parent models and linking them properly to the child instance while considering the unique nature of `OneToOneField`."

        "intended_behavior": "Although not directly indicated as buggy, considering the context and error, it could be beneficial to review and possibly adjust how `OneToOneField` ensures its `attname` or related attributes are set and accessible in inheritance scenarios. This is not to suggest a specific bug in the definition of `OneToOneField`, but to consider enhancements or clarifications in its interaction with model inheritance that might prevent the `AttributeError`. Essentially, ensure that essential attributes like `attname` are consistently available and correctly used in the context of multi-table inheritance, specifically where `OneToOneField` is involved. This might involve enhancing the descriptors or the save mechanisms employed by `OneToOneField` to handle these scenarios more gracefully, ensuring they integrate seamlessly into Django's MTI framework without leading to attribute errors."
