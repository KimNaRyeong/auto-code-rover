        "content": "To investigate the issue thoroughly, we need to gather context on several components mentioned in the issue:\n\n1. We need to explore the definition of the `ItalianRestaurantManyParents` class to understand how it is structured and what might cause the issue during object creation. Since it inherits from `ItalianRestaurant` and `Place`, understanding its structure is crucial.\n\n2. It's important to review the `save` and `_save_parents` method implementations in the `Model` class as the traceback points to these methods. These methods are pivotal in saving instances and handling multi-table inheritance, which is directly related to the crash.\n\n3. Gaining insight into the `OneToOneField` class might also be necessary since the error message specifically mentions that an 'OneToOneField' object has no attribute 'attname'. This could indicate an issue in how inheritance and field access are managed.\n\nLet's make the following API calls to gather relevant information:\n\n- `search_class_in_file(\"ItalianRestaurantManyParents\", \"tests/model_inheritance/models.py\")` to examine the 'ItalianRestaurantManyParents' class.\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"save\", \"Model\")` as 'save' is a common method for Django models and appeared in the error traceback to see how it's implemented generally.\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_save_parents\", \"Model\")` because the error occurs when trying to save parent models, which suggests an issue in handling MTI (Multi-Table Inheritance).\n\n- `search_class(\"OneToOneField\")` to better understand the 'OneToOneField' object, including its attributes, especially looking for 'attname' or related mechanisms.\n\nThese calls should provide a solid foundation to address the reported issue."
