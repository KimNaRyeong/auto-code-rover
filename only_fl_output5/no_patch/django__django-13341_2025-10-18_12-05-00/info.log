Specifically, within the inherited or defined `get_context_data` method in `TemplateView` (or the mixin providing this method), a condition to check for instances of `SimpleLazyObject` among `kwargs` and convert them to a string or necessary type should be added. This change must be designed carefully to avoid unexpected side effects, particularly in maintaining the lazy evaluation benefits elsewhere in Django's framework. This approach directly addresses the reported inconsistency and the error arising from handling `SimpleLazyObject` without breaking the existing functionality for current users of the `TemplateView`.
