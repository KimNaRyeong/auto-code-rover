It also includes a basic template rendering simulation (although it won't actually render HTML content here) and simulates a URL dispatch to the `OfferView`. Since the database is in memory (`:memory:`), and no real database operations are performed (e.g., `get_object_or_404` isn't genuinely fetching an object), this script mainly focuses on the setup and procedural invocation aspects specific to the issue reported. \n\nPlease be aware, to fully execute and interact with a Django powered HTTP request, more complex setup and execution context (like running a development server) would be required, which exceeds the standalone script's capabilities provided here."
