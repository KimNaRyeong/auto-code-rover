Furthermore, understanding how `SimpleLazyObject` from Django interacts with the context data is crucial, especially in the context of filtering operations that may lead to crashes as described. Gathering context on the `get_context_data` method, particularly its implementation within `TemplateView`, and how `get_object_or_404` is used within this context will be key to crafting a solution.

        "content": "Analyzing the context gathered from the API calls gives us the following information:\n\n### 1. `TemplateView` and `ListView` Class Implementations\n- **TemplateView**: Found in `django/views/generic/base.py`, it combines `TemplateResponseMixin`, `ContextMixin`, and `View` but the provided snippet doesn't show the implementation of `get_context_data`. This suggests that `get_context_data` might either be inherited from one of these mixins or not overridden in `TemplateView`, meaning we'd need to look further into these mixins, particularly `ContextMixin`.\n- **ListView**: Found in `django/views/generic/list.py`, it is a combination of `MultipleObjectTemplateResponseMixin` and `BaseListView`. Without the code for `get_context_data` directly visible here, it likely inherits the method from its parent classes or mixins.\n\n#### Analysis\nBoth `TemplateView` and `ListView` are based on generic class-based views but utilize different mixins. This architectural difference could potentially explain the inconsistency mentioned in the issue regarding how `kwargs` are handled. To understand the issue's nature fully, examining the `ContextMixin` might provide insights on how `kwargs` are passed into the context.\n\n### 2. `get_context_data` in `TemplateView`\nThe search did not find the `get_context_data` method directly in `TemplateView`, which implies the need for further action:\n- Investigate the mixins `TemplateView` inherits from, particularly `ContextMixin`, to find the `get_context_data` method, given that this method is crucial for understanding how `kwargs` are processed and included in the context.\n\n### 3. `get_object_or_404` Method\nThe method, as found in `django/shortcuts.py`, is designed to return an object by calling the `get()` method on the provided class, or raise an `Http404` exception if the object does not exist. Given the issue's description, the critical piece lies in how `get_object_or_404` handles `kwargs` when passed a `SimpleLazyObject` instead of a direct value. The method does not inherently resolve lazy objects into primitive data types, leading to the described error when the underlying database operation expects a primitive type.\n\nGiven the issue's description, the intended behavior of the parts of code mentioned in the bug would be:\n- **TemplateView's `get_context_data`**: Should either not automatically pass `kwargs` in the context or ensure any lazy objects (`SimpleLazyObject`) are resolved before being used in database queries like those in `get_object_or_404`.\n- **`get_object_or_404`**: While this method functions as expected under normal circumstances, the issue arises from its inability to process `SimpleLazyObject` directly from `kwargs`. Given the Django model, it might not be appropriate to modify `get_object_or_404` to handle this case, focusing instead on ensuring that parameters passed to it are of the correct type.\n\n### Next Steps\nBased on this analysis, further actions could involve:\n- Searching for `ContextMixin` to understand how `get_context_data` is implemented and interacts with `kwargs`.\n- Investigating any changes or discussions around `SimpleLazyObject` handling between Django 3.0 and 3.1 to pinpoint potential adjustments that might have led to the newly described behavior.\n\nTherefore, the following API calls would be beneficial:\n- `search_class(\"ContextMixin\")`: To find the implementation of `get_context_data`.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"get_context_data\", \"ContextMixin\")`: Assuming `get_context_data` is defined in `ContextMixin`.\n- Considering the absence of results for the error message, further investigation into `SimpleLazyObject` and how it's used or expected to be handled in Django's context might require looking into documentation or source code directly rather than relying on the error string."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Since the specific implementation was not found, we infer based on the description that the method of concern involves how `kwargs` are passed into the context.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\nTo resolve the issue, the intended behavior at this location involves modifying how `kwargs` are processed before being included in the context supplied to the template. Rather than directly passing `kwargs` which may contain `SimpleLazyObject`, a preprocessing step should be introduced to eagerly evaluate any lazy objects within `kwargs`. This ensures all context data are in their primitive or expected form, eliminating errors related to unsupported types when interacting with the database or rendering.\n\nSpecifically, within the inherited or defined `get_context_data` method in `TemplateView` (or the mixin providing this method), a condition to check for instances of `SimpleLazyObject` among `kwargs` and convert them to a string or necessary type should be added. This change must be designed carefully to avoid unexpected side effects, particularly in maintaining the lazy evaluation benefits elsewhere in Django's framework.\n\nThis approach directly addresses the reported inconsistency and the error arising from handling `SimpleLazyObject` without breaking the existing functionality for current users of the `TemplateView`. Additionally, it aligns `TemplateView` more closely with other class-based views like `ListView`, which do not automatically push all `kwargs` into the context, thereby standardizing the behavior across different views."
