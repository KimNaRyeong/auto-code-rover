        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we should investigate how `TemplateView` manages kwargs in its context data and if other class-based views like `ListView` handle kwargs differently. Furthermore, understanding how `SimpleLazyObject` from Django interacts with the context data is crucial, especially in the context of filtering operations that may lead to crashes as described. Gathering context on the `get_context_data` method, particularly its implementation within `TemplateView`, and how `get_object_or_404` is used within this context will be key to crafting a solution. Moreover, since the problem mentions a change in behavior between Django 3.0 and 3.1, it's vital to understand the specific alterations made.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls will be necessary to gather the required information:\n\n1. **Search `TemplateView` Class Implementation:**\n   - This will provide insights into how the `get_context_data` method is implemented and whether it automatically includes `kwargs` into the context.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"TemplateView\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search `ListView` Class Implementation:**\n   - Since the issue mentions `ListView` as a point of comparison, understanding its context data handling will highlight the inconsistency.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"ListView\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search the Implementation of `get_context_data` Method in `TemplateView`:**\n   - This will give specific details on how kwargs are passed into the context and if any changes might be causing the issues mentioned.\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"get_context_data\", \"TemplateView\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Search Global Usage of `get_object_or_404`:**\n   - To understand how `get_object_or_404` interacts with `SimpleLazyObject` and potential pitfalls when not explicitly converting `kwargs` values.\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"get_object_or_404\")\n   ```\n\n5. **Search for the Error Message to Find Relevant Code Snippets:**\n   - The error message mentioned could help locate where exactly the conversion issue arises or where Django's ORM interfaces with SQLite, potentially in `operations.py`.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"Error binding parameter 0 - probably unsupported type\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls should give us a comprehensive understanding of where the inconsistencies lie in how `TemplateView` versus other views handle context data and `kwargs`, as well as pinpoint where the type conversion issues arise with `SimpleLazyObject` in Django 3.1."
