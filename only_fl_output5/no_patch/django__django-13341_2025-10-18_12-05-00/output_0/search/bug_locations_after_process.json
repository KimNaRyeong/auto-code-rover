This ensures all context data are in their primitive or expected form, eliminating errors related to unsupported types when interacting with the database or rendering. Specifically, within the inherited or defined `get_context_data` method in `TemplateView` (or the mixin providing this method), a condition to check for instances of `SimpleLazyObject` among `kwargs` and convert them to a string or necessary type should be added. This change must be designed carefully to avoid unexpected side effects, particularly in maintaining the lazy evaluation benefits elsewhere in Django's framework. This approach directly addresses the reported inconsistency and the error arising from handling `SimpleLazyObject` without breaking the existing functionality for current users of the `TemplateView`. Additionally, it aligns `TemplateView` more closely with other class-based views like `ListView`, which do not automatically push all `kwargs` into the context, thereby standardizing the behavior across different views."
