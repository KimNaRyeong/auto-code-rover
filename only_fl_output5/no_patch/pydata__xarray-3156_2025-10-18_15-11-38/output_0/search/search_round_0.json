It should raise a more meaningful error.\nIn particular, I had this issue in a function I was calling inside of a generator, so the StopIteration just broke out of the generator and it took some digging to figure out what was going wrong in my code.\n#### Output of ``xr.show_versions()``\n<details>\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\n------------------\ncommit: None\npython: 3.6.5.final.0\npython-bits: 64\nOS: Linux\nOS-release: 3.10.0-862.14.4.el7.x86_64\nmachine: x86_64\nprocessor: x86_64\nbyteorder: little\nLC_ALL: None\nLANG: en_US.utf8\nLOCALE: en_US.UTF-8\nxarray: 0.10.7\npandas: 0.23.0\nnumpy: 1.14.3\nscipy: 1.1.0\nnetCDF4: 1.4.0\nh5netcdf: 0.6.1\nh5py: 2.7.1\nNio: None\nzarr: None\nbottleneck: 1.2.1\ncyordereddict: None\ndask: 0.17.5\ndistributed: 1.21.8\nmatplotlib: 2.2.2\ncartopy: None\nseaborn: 0.8.1\nsetuptools: 39.1.0\npip: 10.0.1\nconda: None\npytest: 3.5.1\nIPython: 6.4.0\nsphinx: 1.7.4\n</details>\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue regarding `groupby` on an empty `DataArray` raising a `StopIteration` error in xarray, let's gather the requisite context by targeting specific areas of the xarray codebase:\n\n1. Since the issue occurs with the `groupby` method on a `DataArray`, it's pertinent to look into the `DataArray` class definition and the implementation of `groupby`.\n2. The error message suggests that the handling of an empty `DataArray` within `groupby` or its underlying functionality may be lacking, so it's essential to review how groupby operations are processed.\n3. Given that `mean()` is called on the result of `groupby`, inspecting how the aggregation function interacts with possibly empty groups could also provide insights.\n\nBased on the above points, the following API calls would be appropriate:\n\n- `search_class(\"DataArray\")`: This will help us find where the `DataArray` class is defined.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"groupby\", \"DataArray\")`: This call aims to directly locate the `groupby` method implementation within the `DataArray` class.\n- `search_method(\"mean\")`: Since the issue also involves the `mean` method, understanding how it's implemented across the codebase may reveal how it behaves with empty DataArrays.\n\nThese calls should yield sufficient context to begin addressing the reported issue."
