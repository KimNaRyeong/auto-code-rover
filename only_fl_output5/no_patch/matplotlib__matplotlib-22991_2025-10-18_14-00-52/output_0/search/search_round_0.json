        "content": "To gather adequate context for resolving this issue, we'll need to search through the codebase of the project, focusing especially on how `plt.sca()` is implemented and how it interacts with subfigures and axes. Key aspects to investigate include the implementation details of `pyplot.sca`, the `SubFigure` class, perhaps the `figure` method referenced in the error stack trace, and how axes created using `subplots` differ when created directly or via a subfigure. Given this direction, the following search API calls would be relevant:\n\n1. `search_method(\"sca\")` - To understand how `plt.sca()` is implemented and to find potentially related issues within its implementation.\n2. `search_class(\"SubFigure\")` - To get more insights into the `SubFigure` class, understanding its structure might provide clues on why it's not recognized similar to a regular figure by `plt.sca()`.\n3. `search_method(\"figure\")` - Since the error involves a call to the `figure()` function with an invalid argument type, examining its code might reveal why it cannot handle `SubFigure` instances.\n4. `search_code(\"plt.subplots\")` - To compare the returned object from `plt.subplots` with that returned from using a subfigure's `subplots` method, understanding if there's a structural difference might be key to solving the issue.\n\nThese API calls aim to cover the breadth of the issue, touching on both the error's context and the broader system's implementation that contributes to it."
