        "intended_behavior": "The `sca(ax)` function in this file should be modified to correctly handle `SubFigure` objects. Since the `SubFigure` class inherits from `FigureBase`, the function needs to gracefully manage instances of `SubFigure` to set the current Axes. This entails ensuring that the `figure` method referenced within `sca(ax)` properly interprets `SubFigure` instances or an intermediate check or handling mechanism is introduced in `sca(ax)` before invoking `figure(ax.figure)`. Essentially, the function should verify the type of object `ax.figure` returns and implement a conditional path that supports both `Figure` and `SubFigure` objects without raising a `TypeError`. The goal is to preserve the existing functionality for regular figures while extending support to subfigures without introducing breaking changes."

        "intended_behavior": "Even though this method directly isn't faulty, a refinement could be beneficial to accommodate the fix for `sca(ax)`. Adjustments here would involve enabling `figure()` to recognize and correctly handle `SubFigure` objects passed to it, ensuring that a switch to a `SubFigure` context is as seamless as that of a `Figure` context. This might mean updating the method to check the type of the object and handling each case accordingly, or potentially setting a current figure context that aligns with `SubFigure`'s parent `Figure`, thereby preserving the method's existing functionality while incorporating the capability to switch contexts to a `SubFigure`."
