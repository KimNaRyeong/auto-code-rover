This version of the `reproducer.py` script attempts to reproduce the issue as specified. If the bug as described is present, and `plt.sca()` raises an exception when used on axes created using subfigures, the script will catch the exception, print the stack trace using the given function, and then raise an `AssertionError`. If the script executes without encountering an exception, it suggests that the issue has been resolved, printing a message indicating the test has passed and exiting with code 0. In contrast, if an `AssertionError` is raised, it will print the associated message and exit with code 1, indicating the failure to resolve the issue.
