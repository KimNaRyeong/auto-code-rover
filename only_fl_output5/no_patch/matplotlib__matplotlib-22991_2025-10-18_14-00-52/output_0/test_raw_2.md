This script aims to directly address the reproduction of the specific issue about using `plt.sca()` with axes created using subfigures. Here's the process this script follows:

1. **Setup**: It imports necessary modules and sets up the plotting environment by creating a figure and subfigures as per the reported issue. Then, it attempts to use `plt.sca()` with an axes object derived from a subfigure, which, according to the issue, should either work or fail.

2. **Error Handling and Reporting**: If an exception occurs during the call to `plt.sca()`, the script catches this exception and uses the provided `print_stacktrace` function to report the details of the error, including the file names, line numbers, and the specific error message. It ensures that if the reported issue still exists, the error details are clearly shown.

3. **Assertion and Exit Codes**: In case of an exception, an `AssertionError` is raised to indicate the issue persists. The try-except block around the `main()` call allows for clean handling of this condition. If the script reaches the end without encountering an error, it prints a success message indicating that the issue seems to be resolved, aiming for an exit code of 0. Conversely, catching the AssertionError will trigger an exit with code 1, clearly signaling that the bug is still present.

The described behavior ensures the script's purpose is evident, making it straightforward for others to use it for testing and verifying the issue with matplotlib's `plt.sca()` function and subfigures.
