When used with a descending order it will look correct.\nUnfortunately in the fix in #30903 it was assumed that the col_suffixes passed to django.db.backends.ddl_references.Columns would be empty for ascending order but instead it will contain empty strings and thus causing this bug. See: \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/db/backends/ddl_references.py#L87\nThe expected output would be:\nCREATE INDEX \"idx\" ON \"schema_author\" (\u201cname\u201d text_pattern_ops)\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue, we need to understand how the `CREATE INDEX` statement is generated and the context in which the spacing issue occurs. The issue description points out problems within the index generation functionality, specifically when generating indexes with descending order and when opclasses are used. The key points in the issue are related to how the `Index` class, the handling of \"fields\" and \"opclasses\" attributes, and the `django.db.backends.ddl_references.Columns` are implemented and utilized. Let's gather the necessary code context around these areas:\n\n1. First, we need to look at where and how the `Index` class is defined to understand its structure and how the fields and opclasses are handled.\n\n2. We need to investigate the `django.db.backends.ddl_references.Columns` class as mentioned in the issue description, focusing on the usage of `col_suffixes` and how it might lead to the spacing issues described.\n\n3. Since this might involve how `CREATE INDEX` statements are constructed, looking at methods responsible for generating these statements would be useful, including any methods that specifically handle ordering or opclasses within the index creation process.\n\nConsidering these points, let's define our API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"Index\")`: To get context on the `Index` class.\n- `search_class(\"Columns\")`: To get context on the `Columns` class within `django.db.backends.ddl_references`.\n- `search_code(\"CREATE INDEX\")`: To find potential methods or functions that construct the `CREATE INDEX` SQL statements.\n- `search_method(\"col_suffixes\")`: Since the issue mentions `col_suffixes`, finding where and how it is used could provide insights even though it might be a property or a method involved indirectly.\n\nThese calls should provide a good starting point to understand how the index creation process works, how space handling is currently implemented, and where the bug might be introduced from the changes made in relation to the ticket mentioned in the issue description."
