It should handle cases where opclasses are specified without explicit ordering, and not introduce unnecessary whitespace. When opclasses is used without a sorting direction, the method should ensure no extra space is added after opclasses specifications in the generated SQL statement. Conversely, when sorting directions are used (especially with DESC), it should ensure a space is properly placed between the column name and the direction keyword. The solution should maintain compatibility across different databases, taking into account any database-specific quirks in the formatting of CREATE INDEX statements."

Specifically, when col_suffixes is involved in constructing parts of the SQL statement (like in index creation), the implementation should carefully manage cases where col_suffixes contains empty strings, ensuring that these do not lead to erroneous spaces in the SQL syntax. This involves potentially adjusting how col_suffixes are appended to column names or operation classes (opclasses) to avoid trailing spaces when they are not needed, without disrupting the correct placements of spaces in other scenarios (e.g., before DESC or ASC)."
