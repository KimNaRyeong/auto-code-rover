We then have multiple Apps that talk to their own databases. Some share the same table names.\nWe have used this setup for a while, but after upgrading to Django 2.2 we're getting an error saying we're not allowed 2 apps, with 2 different models to have the same table names.\nIs this correct behavior? We've had to roll back to Django 2.0 for now.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gain sufficient context for resolving the issue related to Django models with the same table name across different apps, we need to identify where and how these models are defined and managed within the project. Given the description of the issue focusing on Django models and database table naming conflicts across different Django apps, we should start our investigation by locating the model definitions in the conflicting apps mentioned as 'base' and 'app2'. Additionally, since the issue mentions an upgrade to Django 2.2 resulted in the error, understanding how these models are configured (particularly with respect to the `db_table` attribute) will be crucial.\n\nLet's perform the following search API calls to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. Locate the model definitions in both the 'base' and 'app2':\n   - `search_class(\"ModelName\")` (To get initial pointer on where `ModelName` might be defined across the project, assuming it's not a common Django model and specifically related to the issue at hand.)\n\n2. Examine how the `db_table` attribute is being set for these models since it's directly related to the error message:\n   - `search_code(\"db_table\")` (This search is aimed at finding instances where the db_table Meta option is explicitly set, which could help identify how these conflicts are arising.)\n\nOnce we have the outputs from these initial searches, we can decide on further, more targeted queries based on specific files or class definitions identified as relevant to the issue."
