Locate the model definitions in both the 'base' and 'app2':\n   - `search_class(\"ModelName\")` (To get initial pointer on where `ModelName` might be defined across the project, assuming it's not a common Django model and specifically related to the issue at hand.)\n\n2. Examine how the `db_table` attribute is being set for these models since it's directly related to the error message:\n   - `search_code(\"db_table\")` (This search is aimed at finding instances where the db_table Meta option is explicitly set, which could help identify how these conflicts are arising.)\n\nOnce we have the outputs from these initial searches, we can decide on further, more targeted queries based on specific files or class definitions identified as relevant to the issue."

        "content": "The search results we obtained offer a broad landscape of where `db_table` is used across the Django framework and potentially in the project's custom code. Given that there\u2019s no direct hit for a class named `ModelName` in the codebase, it implies that the issue might not be strictly about specific models named `ModelName` but rather about how models in general are configured with respect to their database table names (`db_table`), especially across different Django apps. This understanding guides our analysis towards focusing on `db_table` usage and configurations.\n\n1. **Analyzing `db_table` Snippets Context**\n   - The snippets involving `db_table` span a wide range of files, from migrations to model field definitions and database backend-specific implementations. Given the diversity of files, it's likely that the core of the issue is related to how Django's ORM system interprets the `db_table` meta option when models from different apps are declared with the same database table name.\n   \n2. **Relationship to the Bug**\n   - The error message reflects a model check that fails when multiple models are found to use the same `db_table` value. Such checks are likely to be part of Django's system checks framework or the model validation process that ensures the integrity of model definitions. The results from `django/core/checks/model_checks.py` (10 matches) may include the relevant checks that trigger the error.\n   - The issue surfaced after upgrading to Django 2.2, suggesting a change in Django\u2019s model validation or schema management behavior. Hence, the files involved in migrations and schema management (e.g., `migrations/autodetector.py`, `backends/base/schema.py`) might contain changes in logic that introduced this stricter validation.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**\n   - The intended behavior from the project\u2019s perspective seems to be allowing different models across apps to share the same `db_table` name without raising errors, as long as they point to different databases. This is a common scenario in large Django projects where different apps might be interfacing with legacy databases or shared database infrastructures but using separate connections.\n   \nConsidering these insights, to further narrow down the context and understand how the upgraded Django version affects the project, additional targeted API calls should be made. Specifically, focusing on the Django core checks and schema management files could be instructive. However, given the project's setup and the provided search API capabilities, finding direct application code references might be challenging without more specific model names or app configurations. Thus, a more fruitful approach might involve:\n\n- Reviewing change logs or migration guides for Django 2.2 related to `db_table` and model checks.\n- Locally testing a simplified version of the project setup with different Django versions to observe behavior changes.\n\nGiven the provided API and results, specific further inquiries might be less direct in addressing the issue without more precise context or the ability to search based on the Django version directly. However, understanding the files that have been identified as containing relevant `db_table` mentions could have provided valuable insights into Django\u2019s internal handling of table names - insights that are crucial for formulating a strategy to mitigate the error through either application code adjustments or by influencing Django's ORM behavior through configuration."

        "content": "1. \n\n2. Given the nature of the issue and the insights from the search results, pinpointing exact bug locations in the absence of more detailed context or specific custom application file references is challenging. However, the underlying issue is not about specific \"bugs\" in the code but about a design decision in Django that affects how models across different apps can or cannot share the same `db_table` names, particularly after an upgrade to Django 2.2. Therefore, specific bug locations or changes in the application's codebase might not be directly applicable without first understanding the changes introduced by Django 2.2 related to model validation and schema management.\n\n**However, to address the issue described, a hypothetical approach to mitigate or adapt to the behavior introduced in Django 2.2 could involve:**\n\n- **Reviewing Django's Framework Code for Validation Checks:** One would need to review the model checks that are triggered during the system's startup to understand why the error is raised and if there's a way to bypass or configure these checks for specific multi-database setups. An important file to consider would be:\n    - **File:** `django/core/checks/model_checks.py`\n    - **Intended Behavior:** Adaptation or modification (if possible and advisable) could involve adding conditions or hooks that allow exempting certain app-model combinations from this check based on their database routing configurations, thus preserving the project's multi-database functionality without interfering with Django's integrity checks.\n\n- **Adjustment in Application Model Metadata:**\n    - Without a specific file or model, a general adjustment could involve ensuring that models intended to share the same table name across different databases/apps explicitly define their `Meta.db_table` in a way that respects Django's integrity checks. This might not \"fix\" the issue but adjusts the application's model definitions to adhere to Django 2.2's constraints.\n    - **Intended Behavior:** This adjustment aims to ensure that each model explicitly states its database table name, potentially alongside database routing logic that ensures no conflicts arise during migrations, model checks, or ORM operations across the project's database configurations.\n\nIn essence, resolving this issue might not solely revolve around correcting a specific portion of code but could necessitate a combination of reviewing Django's internal behavior changes with version 2.2, adjusting project model definitions, and potentially customizing Django's system checks or database routing mechanisms to accommodate the unique multi-database architecture of the project."
