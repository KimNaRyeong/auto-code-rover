This could involve introducing new methods for color updates or enhancing existing methods to handle color updates in a manner that is consistent with current Matplotlib API standards. The solution should ensure that the color change functionality is preserved or enhanced without triggering deprecation warnings, and should seamlessly integrate with the existing selector functionalities, such as responding to user inputs and visually reflecting selection states."
