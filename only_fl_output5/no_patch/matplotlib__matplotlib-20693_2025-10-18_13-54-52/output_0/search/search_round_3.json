I looked at this and #20558 and hoped / thought maybe I could find some `selector.set_*` or `selector.handle_props` or something to modify but I don't see anything. How should we update our code? (And it might be worth improving the deprecation warning to give some hints to anyone else who hits this issue.) Maybe with something like this?\n```\nselector.artists[0].set_color(color)\n```\nthe `artists[0]` is the `selector.rect`. But this just seems like a hack workaround, and if there are properties held internally it will not \"stick\" so I'm guessing it's not the right idea...\n_Originally posted by @larsoner in https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/20113#issuecomment-877345562_\n</issue>"

However, the broad searches for methods named `set_color` and `update` have returned various results across multiple modules, suggesting that these operations are common and widely used for different types of objects in Matplotlib.\n\n### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### `set_color` Method\n- **What does this part of the code do?** The `set_color` methods are likely used to change the colors of various elements in Matplotlib plots, including axis, patches, spines, lines, collections, text, etc. These methods are intended for direct manipulation of an object's color.\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?** The issue description mentions the use of a `set_color` operation (`selector.rect.set_color(color)`) that is presumably used to change the color of a selector's rectangle. The deprecation warning could be related to a change in how colors should be applied to selectors or their components.\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?** The intended behavior in the context of the bug would likely be to provide an updated, non-deprecated way to change the color of selector components, ensuring that any internal properties related to the color are correctly updated.\n\n#### `update` Method\n- **What does this part of the code do?** The `update` methods are used to update properties of objects in a batch manner, applying multiple attribute changes at once. This is a common method in various objects for reflective updates of properties.\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?** The issue mentions using `selector.rectprops.update(dict(facecolor=color))` for updating properties, which suggests that an `update` method might be involved in the current process of changing the selector's appearance. The deprecation warning could concern changes in how properties should be updated.\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?** Ideally, an updated approach or method would allow for the bulk updating of visual or stylistic properties of a selector (or its components) without using deprecated functionality.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the absence of direct references to a \"selector\" class and the broad nature of `set_color` and `update` methods, additional API calls might be needed to specifically locate where selectors are implemented or interacted with in the Matplotlib codebase. Specifically, we may need to investigate within the `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py` file, given that it's a potential location for interactive features like selectors:\n\n- search_code_in_file(\"selector\", \"lib/matplotlib/widgets.py\")\n\nThis targeted search could help to find the implementation or use of selectors within Matplotlib, providing a clearer path towards solving the issue described."

These mentions are found in various methods and outside specific function blocks. Here's an analysis based on the obtained context:\n\n### What does this part of the code do?\n- The code snippets related to \"selector\" within `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py` are likely part of the implementation and functionality of various interactive selector widgets in Matplotlib. These can include tools to select areas or shapes within a plot.\n- Methods like `_set_cursor`, `_press`, `direction`, `extents`, and `onmove` are indicative of functionalities related to interactive behavior, including setting the cursor appearance, handling press events, defining selection directions, adjusting or reporting selection extents, and responding to cursor movements.\n\n### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n- The issue describes a deprecation warning when attempting to update the selector colors, specifically through direct modifications via `rect.set_color(color)` and `rectprops.update(dict(facecolor=color))`. The mentioned methods and snippets within `widgets.py` could be where such interactions are intended or expected to occur, especially in ways that might now be deprecated.\n- The deprecation likely stems from changes in how colors and properties should be updated for selectors, suggesting a shift towards different practices or methods for achieving similar outcomes without using deprecated pathways.\n\n### Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n- The intended behavior would allow for the color and possibly other visual or interactive properties of selectors to be updated in a way that aligns with current best practices or API guidelines, moving away from deprecated methods.\n- This would likely involve either using alternative existing methods that are not deprecated or introducing new methods or properties to safely and effectively update the selectors' appearances. Such solutions would need to integrate smoothly with the existing functionalities surrounding selector use in Matplotlib, ensuring that interactive behaviors (like selection extents, direction, and responses to movement) remain consistent and effective.\n\nGiven this analysis, to resolve the issue, a review and potential update or extension of the selector-related functionalities within `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py` are required. This would involve:\n\n### Where are bug locations:\n- **File:** `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py`\n- **Methods:** Potentially `_set_cursor`, `_press`, `direction`, `extents`, `onmove`, and additional context around these might need adjustments or new implementations to:\n    - Provision a non-deprecated way of updating selector colors and possibly other properties.\n    - Preserve the existing functionalities intended by these interactive tools while complying with current Matplotlib standards and practices.\n\nThe solution would involve engineering a means to update selector properties without triggering deprecation warnings, potentially through a new API interface or by enhancing the existing method signatures or class properties."

The exact locations need a detailed review of these methods to identify where deprecation warnings are triggered when setting colors.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Modify or extend these methods (or the classes they belong to) to include non-deprecated ways of updating selector appearance, specifically color changes. This could involve introducing new methods for color updates or enhancing existing methods to handle color updates in a manner that is consistent with current Matplotlib API standards.
