I looked at this and #20558 and hoped / thought maybe I could find some `selector.set_*` or `selector.handle_props` or something to modify but I don't see anything. How should we update our code? (And it might be worth improving the deprecation warning to give some hints to anyone else who hits this issue.) Maybe with something like this?\n```\nselector.artists[0].set_color(color)\n```\nthe `artists[0]` is the `selector.rect`. But this just seems like a hack workaround, and if there are properties held internally it will not \"stick\" so I'm guessing it's not the right idea...\n_Originally posted by @larsoner in https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/20113#issuecomment-877345562_\n</issue>"

This means looking for the classes and methods that are likely involved with the selector functionality and its properties, such as color setting. Since the specific snippets provided didn't yield results, I should look for:\n\n1. The class definitions related to the selector functionality.\n2. Any methods or properties that might be related to setting or updating attributes of graphical elements (like the selector's rectangle color).\n\nGiven this approach, here are the new API calls I'll make to get more context:\n- search_class(\"selector\")\n- search_method(\"set_color\")\n- search_method(\"update\")\n\nThese searches are intended to give a broader view of how selectors and color settings are implemented within the MNE context, which should help in understanding how to adapt or replace the deprecated usage mentioned in the issue."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.
