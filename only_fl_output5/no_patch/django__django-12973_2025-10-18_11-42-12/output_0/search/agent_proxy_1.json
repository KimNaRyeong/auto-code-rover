This check should validate the presence and correct order of `SessionMiddleware` before `AuthenticationMiddleware` is activated. If this middleware is not present or incorrectly ordered, the system should throw a descriptive error during the startup phase, preventing the application from running and directing the developer to fix the middleware ordering in the settings. This enhancement will prevent runtime errors related to session management by ensuring correct middleware configuration ahead of time.\n  \nSince the specific `AssertionError` location wasn't identified through the searches, and additional context on how Django performs system checks for middleware configuration was not obtained, the description provided focuses on the logical location and enhancement needed to resolve the reported issue. The action involves augmenting the Django system's initialization checks to enforce the middleware order requirement, specifically ensuring that `SessionMiddleware` is configured before `AuthenticationMiddleware`. This would both preserve the existing functionality and prevent the misconfiguration issue from occurring."
