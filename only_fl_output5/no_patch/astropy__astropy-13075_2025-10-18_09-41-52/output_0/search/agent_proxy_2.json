This enhancement would include recognizing the 'html' format as a valid option, converting the cosmology instance data into a tabular format suitable for HTML (potentially leveraging `QTable`), applying MathJax where necessary for mathematical expressions, and ultimately writing this formatted data to an HTML file. The implementation should ensure that the mathematics representations (e.g., units and cosmological parameters) are correctly translated into MathJax syntax to be both visually appealing and mathematically accurate in the resulting HTML document. This extension must be made while ensuring that the existing functionality for other formats remains unaffected, preserving the class's current capabilities in handling various IO operations.\n\n- **Location 2**: File: `astropy/table/table.py`, Class: `QTable`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: While `QTable` may not directly require modification for this particular feature implementation, its existing methods and capabilities should be leveraged to support the creation and formatting of tables for the HTML output. If `QTable`'s current functionality lacks direct support for incorporating MathJax formatting within HTML outputs, a potential intervention could involve ensuring that `QTable.write` or a related method can accept additional formatting instructions or parameters aimed at enhancing HTML output with MathJax. This might take the form of either a direct extension of `QTable` capabilities or the development of utility functions/methods that pre-process the table data for MathJax compatibility before invoking `QTable.write` for the HTML format. However, based on the current understanding, `QTable` primarily serves as a crucial tool for the intended behavior of formatting and outputting cosmology data in HTML format, with a specific emphasis on additional handling to integrate MathJax correctly.\n\nThese locations and intended behaviors frame the development work needed to address the issue, laying out an approach that integrates with the existing Astropy architecture and leverages its capabilities for enriching the `Cosmology` class's IO functionalities."
