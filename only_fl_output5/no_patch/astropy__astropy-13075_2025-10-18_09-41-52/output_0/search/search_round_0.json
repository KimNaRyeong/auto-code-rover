        "content": "To address the issue effectively, I would need to gather context on key components involved in implementing the `write_html` method for the `Cosmology` class, especially focusing on its interaction with `cosmology.io.table.to_table()` and the integration of MathJax for formatting. The information provided in the issue suggests inspecting the `Cosmology` class, existing IO functionality for cosmology, and potentially how parameters and their units are defined and formatted. Here are the API calls I would make to get this context:\n\n1. **Search for the `Cosmology` class**: We need to understand the current structure of the `Cosmology` class to see where the `write_html` method would fit.\n   - `search_class(\"Cosmology\")`\n\n2. **Search for existing write methods within `Cosmology` class**: Inspecting existing write methods can provide insights into how to integrate the new `write_html` method.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"write\", \"Cosmology\")`\n\n3. **Search for `to_table` method within the `cosmology.io.table` namespace**: Since the issue suggests that `write_html(...)` will call `cosmology.io.table.to_table()`, context about this method is essential.\n   - `search_code(\"cosmology.io.table.to_table\")`\n\n4. **Inspect `QTable.write` method to understand its usage with format='html'**: Given that `QTable.write(..., format='html')` is a part of the implementation suggestion, understanding its capability and requirements for HTML formatting is necessary.\n   - `search_method(\"write\")`\n   - `search_code(\"QTable.write\")`\n\n5. **Looking into how units and their formats are defined, focusing on `def_unit`**: This could give clues on how to store and utilize mathjax representations for each parameter.\n   - `search_code(\"def_unit\")`\n\nThese API calls are designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the `Cosmology` class's existing structure and methods, IO capabilities related to cosmology, and formatting concerns related to the implementation of a new `write_html` method."
