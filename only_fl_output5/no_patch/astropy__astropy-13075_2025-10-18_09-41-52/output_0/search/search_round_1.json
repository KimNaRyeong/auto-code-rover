        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, we can draw several insights concerning the project and how they relate to the reported issue. The issue is focused on implementing a new feature in the Astropy `Cosmology` class that involves writing to HTML format with enhanced MathJax formatting. Let's break down the findings:\n\n### 1. Cosmology Class\nThe `Cosmology` class is part of `astropy.cosmology.core.py` and supports various operations, including reading and writing cosmology instances. While the search for a specific `write` method in the `Cosmology` class did not yield results directly showing the method, the listing of the `Cosmology` class shows `write = UnifiedReadWriteMethod(CosmologyWrite)`, indicating an interface for write operations is indeed present, probably leveraging a more flexible IO system. This suggests that extending or adding a new write format would involve working with this `UnifiedReadWriteMethod` setup.\n\n### 2. `cosmology.io.table.to_table`\nNo direct results were found for `cosmology.io.table.to_table`, which could mean that the function might be a high-level description of the intended behavior rather than an existing method. Considering the intent, the function seems aimed at converting cosmology data into a tabular format, which is a plausible intermediary step before formatting it for HTML output. It's possible that a more general table conversion method exists that needs to be extended or specified for HTML output with MathJax.\n\n### 3. `QTable.write` Method\nAlthough the search did not directly return results for `QTable.write`, the mention of it in the issue suggests it's a method for writing tables (likely instances of `QTable` from Astropy's table module) to various formats, including HTML. Given that `QTable` has HTML writing capabilities, integrating this with `Cosmology.write` to support the `'html'` format directly seems like a natural extension. The specific task would involve ensuring the cosmology data, once in a `QTable` format, is written to an HTML file with the correct MathJax annotations.\n\n### 4. `def_unit` and Parameter Formatting\nThe search for `def_unit` code snippets returned many results, indicating that unit definition and formatting are well-supported throughout Astropy. The issue mentions storing the MathJax representation on the corresponding Parameter object, similar to how units might have formats. This suggests that parameter objects in cosmology (or related entities) could be enhanced or augmented to include information needed for MathJax formatting. This part of the issue seems to introduce a requirement to make parameters' representation in MathJax straightforwardly configurable or retrievable, enriching the HTML output.\n\n### Next Steps for Context Gathering\nGiven the above insights and considering gaps in the information retrieved:\n\n- Further investigation into `UnifiedReadWriteMethod` and `CosmologyWrite` might reveal how the current cosmology IO system is structured and how a new format can be registered or supported.\n- The absence of direct references to `cosmology.io.table.to_table` suggests a need to look more closely at how cosmology data is currently converted to tables. A search for general table conversion methods in the cosmology module or `UnifiedReadWriteMethod` implementations may provide clues.\n- Specific exploration of the `QTable` class and its methods could offer more detail on how the `write` function works, especially regarding formats. This could involve searching for `QTable` directly or examining files related to Astropy's table functionality for HTML writing capabilities.\n- Detailed examination of how units and formatting are handled within Astropy could inform how to implement the parameter formatting with MathJax. Directly looking into files and code snippets where `def_unit` is utilized could yield insights into extending or applying similar patterns for MathJax representation.\n\nThis contextual information sets the stage for detailed technical planning on implementing the requested feature, with focused next steps in both code exploration and design considerations."

This method should leverage the `to_table` methodology (even if the exact function needs to be further defined or located) to first convert cosmology data into a table format. Following this, it should apply any necessary transformations or enhancements to support MathJax formatting for parameter representations, and finally write out to an HTML file by utilizing the capabilities of the `QTable` class for HTML formatting. The implementation should ensure that this process is integrated in such a way that it complements existing functionality without causing regressions in other output formats supported by `Cosmology.write`.\n\n- **Location 2**: File: `astropy/cosmology/units.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior**:\n    - Enhance or utilize functionality within the cosmology units management (potentially extending from insights gathered with `def_unit` and related code snippets) to include a way for parameter objects to carry MathJax representation information. This might involve defining a new structure or field within parameter definitions that can store MathJax formatting details, ensuring that this information is readily available when generating HTML output. The goal here would be to seamlessly integrate MathJax representations into the HTML writing process, enabling rich and correctly formatted mathematical expressions in the output without disrupting existing unit or parameter handling mechanisms.\n\nThese enhancements and integrations aim to introduce rich HTML documentation capabilities to the `Cosmology` class in Astropy, improving usability, and making cosmological models more accessible for sharing and presentation purposes."
