Examples are an actual bug when changing columns: #14237 and how to define number of input features #13603.\nRelated is also the idea of checking for column name consistency: #7242\nMainly I'm asking whether it makes sense to have the same requirements for ColumnTransformer as for other estimators.\nColumnTransformer is the only estimator that addresses columns by name, and so reordering columns doesn't impact the model and actually everything works fine. Should we still aim for checking for reordering of columns?\nRight now, ``transform`` even works if we add additional columns to ``X``, which makes sense, since it only cares about the columns it is using.\nShould we allow that going forward as long as remainder is not used? (if remainder is used, the result of ``ColumnTransformer`` would have a different shape and downstream estimators would break, so I think we shouldn't support it in this case).\nIn either case, what's ``n_features_in_`` for a ColumnTransformer? The number of columns in ``X`` during ``fit`` or the number of columns actually used?\nDoes it even make sense to define it if we allow adding other columns that are ignored?\n</issue>"

Here's a plan for the API calls we need to make:\n\n1. Search for the `ColumnTransformer` class to understand its current implementation and structure.\n2. Given the discussion about reordering columns and adding new columns, we should examine the `transform` method within `ColumnTransformer` to see how it's currently handling these cases.\n3. The issue discusses how the `ColumnTransformer` behaves with the remainder parameter and the overall shape of its output. Checking the implementation of where the remainder is handled will be crucial.\n4. Investigating the property `n_features_in_` in context of `ColumnTransformer` is necessary to understand its current logic and how it's set during `fit`.\n\nBased on the above, here are the API calls we'll make:\n\n- `search_class(\"ColumnTransformer\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"transform\", \"ColumnTransformer\")`\n- `search_code(\"remainder\")` - This is to understand how `remainder` parameter is handled across the codebase, as it might not be limited to a specific method.\n- `search_code(\"n_features_in_\")` - Considering `n_features_in_` might be used or set in multiple places, searching it directly in the codebase will provide a broader picture."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the `ColumnTransformer` and its method `transform`, including references to `remainder` and the absence of findings for `n_features_in_`, we can outline the following insights and next steps:\n\n### Analysis of `ColumnTransformer` class structure and `transform` method:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n    - The `ColumnTransformer` class is designed to apply transformers to columns of an array or pandas DataFrame. The `transform` method specifically transforms the data by applying each transformer to its respective column and concatenates the results.\n    - The `transform` method checks if the fitted model and the input data have a compatible number of features. It also validates column ordering when the remainder parameter is used and named columns are involved.\n\n2. **Relationship between this part of the code and the bug:**\n\n    - The issue highlighted concerns with how `ColumnTransformer` handles changing columns, the definition of the number of input features (`n_features_in_`), and column name consistency. The `transform` method's check for the number of features and column ordering directly relates to these concerns.\n    - The absence of findings for `n_features_in_` suggests that this attribute might not be explicitly managed in the same way as other estimators, which could be part of the inconsistency or confusion mentioned in the issue.\n\n3. **Intended behavior based on the issue:**\n\n    - Ideally, `ColumnTransformer` should robustly handle columns' reordering and adding new columns without impacting the model's performance, provided the columns it uses for transformation remain consistent. \n    - The `transform` method should maybe offer flexibility in handling additional columns not used in the fit phase, especially if `remainder='drop'`. However, this flexibility must be balanced with clarity on how `n_features_in_` is defined and used.\n    - For `n_features_in_`, a decision needs to be made whether it should represent the number of columns seen during `fit` or the number of columns actually used for transformation. This clarification could impact how model validation and compatibility with other estimators are handled.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context:\n\nGiven the absence of `n_features_in_`, there are a few potential next steps to further clarify how `ColumnTransformer` manages feature count and interacts with added or reordered columns. These steps include:\n\n1. **Check how other estimators handle `n_features_in_`:** Since `n_features_in_` was not found within the context of `ColumnTransformer`, we might gain insights by how this is implemented in other estimators.\n   \n    - `search_code(\"n_features_in_\")` in a broader range, perhaps specifying different modules known to include estimators (`sklearn/base.py` for base classes might be a good start).\n\n2. **Review how `remainder` parameter is handled more deeply within the `ColumnTransformer`:**\n\n    - As `remainder` appeared mostly in `_column_transformer.py`, reviewing the complete file or focusing on methods that interact with `remainder` could provide insights. This includes initialization, fitting, and transforming steps that might adjust based on the `remainder`.\n    - `search_method_in_file(\"fit\", \"sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py\")` and `search_method_in_file(\"_validate_remainder\", \"sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py\")` might reveal how columns are verified initially and how the remainder columns are treated.\n\n3. **Documentation and Usage of `ColumnTransformer`:** Sometimes, documentation within the code or associated comments can offer hints about intended use cases or behavioral nuances that are not immediately clear from method signatures or attribute checks alone.\n\nTaking these steps should provide a comprehensive understanding necessary for addressing the reported issue, particularly in determining the correct behavior and requirements for handling input validation and requirements in `ColumnTransformer`."

This ensures that as long as the columns required by the transformers are present and unchanged, the order or addition of new columns should not cause an error. This change is to address the main issue without affecting the current functionality for scenarios where column ordering and new columns are not a factor.\n\n**Bug Location 2:**\n   - **File:** sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py\n   - **Class:** ColumnTransformer\n   - **Attribute/Method to be added or modified:** n_features_in_\n   - **Intended Behavior:** While `n_features_in_` was not previously handled explicitly in context to `ColumnTransformer`, to resolve the issue, we should introduce or clarify the handling of `n_features_in_`. The logic here should involve defining `n_features_in_` as the number of features (columns) that the transformer was fitted with that are necessary for the transformation. This attribute might not need to account for any additional columns that do not interact with the transformer, ensuring flexibility in processing extra columns present during the `transform` phase without impacting the expected output's shape, especially when `remainder='drop'`.\n\nThese adjustments aim to enhance `ColumnTransformer`'s robustness and flexibility in handling input features while maintaining backward compatibility and expected functionality."
