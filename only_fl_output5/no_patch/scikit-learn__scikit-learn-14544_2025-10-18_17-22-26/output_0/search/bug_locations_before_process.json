This ensures that as long as the columns required by the transformers are present and unchanged, the order or addition of new columns should not cause an error. This change is to address the main issue without affecting the current functionality for scenarios where column ordering and new columns are not a factor."

        "intended_behavior": "While `n_features_in_` was not previously handled explicitly in context to `ColumnTransformer`, to resolve the issue, we should introduce or clarify the handling of `n_features_in_`. The logic here should involve defining `n_features_in_` as the number of features (columns) that the transformer was fitted with that are necessary for the transformation. This attribute might not need to account for any additional columns that do not interact with the transformer, ensuring flexibility in processing extra columns present during the `transform` phase without impacting the expected output's shape, especially when `remainder='drop'`."
