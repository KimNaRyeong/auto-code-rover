        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n### 1. `BaseCommand` Class (django/core/management/base.py)\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `BaseCommand` class provides a framework for writing management commands in Django. It includes methods for adding arguments, executing the command, and handling the command logic.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  The bug is related to command argument handling, particularly to mutually exclusive arguments that are improperly processed when using `call_command`. Since `BaseCommand` defines how arguments are added and parsed, understanding its implementation is crucial to resolving the issue.\n\n- **Intended Behavior:**\n  The intended behavior should allow defining commands with mutually exclusive arguments that can be invoked programmatically via `call_command` without encountering parsing errors.\n\n### 2. `call_command` Function (django/core/management/__init__.py)\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n   `call_command` programmatically invokes a management command by name or by passing a command object. It handles argument parsing and simulates command line argument passing internally.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   The issue arises because `call_command` seems to be unable to correctly handle custom parsing logic for mutually exclusive arguments that map to the same destination. This method's mechanism for handling arguments and options directly relates to how the bug manifests.\n\n- **Intended Behavior:**\n   When using `call_command`, it should correctly parse and pass arguments to commands, including cases with mutually exclusive arguments, respecting the custom parsing logic defined for those commands.\n\n### 3. `parse_time` Function (django/utils/dateparse.py)\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n   It parses a string representation of a time into a `datetime.time` object, ignoring time zone information. This function does not support string values with time zone offsets.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   The bug description mentions issues related to parsing time values passed through `call_command`, and this function is directly involved in converting input string values into time objects for the `--until` argument.\n\n- **Intended Behavior:**\n   The `parse_time` function should accurately convert well-formatted string inputs into `datetime.time` objects, which would then be correctly handled by the command's logic when `call_command` is used.\n\n### Missing Context: `parse_duration_to_time`\n\nWe couldn't find the `parse_duration_to_time` method in the codebase. This missing piece is critical because the issue particularly mentions problems related to this parsing when using `--for` as an input through `call_command`.\n\n- **Next Steps to Consider:**\n  Given the absence of `parse_duration_to_time` in the search results, we might need to:\n  - Verify if `parse_duration_to_time` is an external library function not indexed in the code search or if it was perhaps misspelled.\n  - Consider searching for a broader pattern of custom parsing functions (`search_code(\"def parse_\")`) to possibly catch `parse_duration_to_time` or any relevant parsing logic used by the command.\n\nUnderstanding the exact mechanism and expected data formats of both `parse_time` and `parse_duration_to_time` is essential to suggest a fix for the command's argument handling, ensuring both `--for` and `--until` work seamlessly with `call_command`. A likely solution would involve adjusting how these custom parsers are invoked within the `call_command` framework or clarifying the command's argument handling to seamlessly process these inputs."

Specifically, it needs to correctly differentiate and process mutually exclusive arguments that may use the same `dest` but are intended for consumption in different contexts (like `--for` vs. `--until`). This would likely involve refining how `arg_options` are built and parsed from `options` dict (around lines 118-122), ensuring the custom parsers for duration and time are invoked correctly based on the argument passed. This adjustment needs to preserve the functionality for all other commands and argument types, ensuring it remains backward compatible.\n  \n- **Location 2: File: django/core/management/base.py, Method: add_arguments (in context of child class Command)**\n  - **Intended Behavior:** While the specific command class and its `add_arguments` method were not directly inspected via API calls, the issue originates from how arguments are defined here. The class implementation should ensure that when defining mutually exclusive arguments with custom parse functions (`parse_duration_to_time` and `parse_time`), they should not use the same `dest` if it causes conflict when invoked via `call_command`. If the architecture demands a shared `dest` (as might be intended for simplifying the handling logic within the `handle` method), additional checks or preprocessing steps should be implemented within `handle` or a custom argument parsing mechanism to accommodate this design choice without causing errors.\n\nWithout direct access to the `parse_duration_to_time` method or a closer look into the custom command class implementation, these locations are identified based on the understanding that handling of command arguments (especially those using custom parsing functions) needs refinement to avoid the described issue."
