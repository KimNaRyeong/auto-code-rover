After assigning the coordinates, the dataset was in a state where its length was coming out as less than zero, which caused all sorts of issues.\n### What did you expect to happen?\nI think the issue is with the updating of `_coord_names`, perhaps in https://github.com/pydata/xarray/blob/18454c218002e48e1643ce8e25654262e5f592ad/xarray/core/coordinates.py#L389.\nI expected to just be able to assign the coords and then print the array to see the result.\n### Minimal Complete Verifiable Example\n```Python\nimport xarray as xr\nds = xr.DataArray(\n[[[1, 1], [0, 0]], [[2, 2], [1, 1]]],\ndims=(\"lat\", \"year\", \"month\"),\ncoords={\"lat\": [-60, 60], \"year\": [2010, 2020], \"month\": [3, 6]},\nname=\"test\",\n).to_dataset()\nstacked = ds.stack(time=(\"year\", \"month\"))\nstacked = stacked.assign_coords(\n{\"time\": [y + m / 12 for y, m in stacked[\"time\"].values]}\n)\n# Both these fail with ValueError: __len__() should return >= 0\nlen(stacked)\nprint(stacked)\n```\n### MVCE confirmation\n- [X] Minimal example \u2014 the example is as focused as reasonably possible to demonstrate the underlying issue in xarray.\n- [X] Complete example \u2014 the example is self-contained, including all data and the text of any traceback.\n- [x] Verifiable example \u2014 the example copy & pastes into an IPython prompt or [Binder notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pydata/xarray/main?urlpath=lab/tree/doc/examples/blank_template.ipynb), returning the result.\n- [X] New issue \u2014 a search of GitHub Issues suggests this is not a duplicate.\n### Relevant log output\n```Python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"mre.py\", line 17, in <module>\nlen(stacked)\nFile \".../xarray-tests/xarray/core/dataset.py\", line 1364, in __len__\nreturn len(self.data_vars)\nValueError: __len__() should return >= 0\n```\n### Anything else we need to know?\nHere's a test (I put it in `test_dataarray.py` but maybe there is a better spot)\n```python\ndef test_assign_coords_drop_coord_names(self) -> None:\nds = DataArray(\n[[[1, 1], [0, 0]], [[2, 2], [1, 1]]],\ndims=(\"lat\", \"year\", \"month\"),\ncoords={\"lat\": [-60, 60], \"year\": [2010, 2020], \"month\": [3, 6]},\nname=\"test\",\n).to_dataset()\nstacked = ds.stack(time=(\"year\", \"month\"))\nstacked = stacked.assign_coords(\n{\"time\": [y + m / 12 for y, m in stacked[\"time\"].values]}\n)\n# this seems to be handled correctly\nassert set(stacked._variables.keys()) == {\"test\", \"time\", \"lat\"}\n# however, _coord_names doesn't seem to update as expected\n# the below fails\nassert set(stacked._coord_names) == {\"time\", \"lat\"}\n# the incorrect value of _coord_names means that all the below fails too\n# The failure is because the length of a dataset is calculated as (via len(data_vars))\n# len(dataset._variables) - len(dataset._coord_names). For the situation\n# above, where len(dataset._coord_names) is greater than len(dataset._variables),\n# you get a length less than zero which then fails because length must return\n# a value greater than zero\n# Both these fail with ValueError: __len__() should return >= 0\nlen(stacked)\nprint(stacked)\n```\n### Environment\n<details>\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\n------------------\ncommit: e678a1d7884a3c24dba22d41b2eef5d7fe5258e7\npython: 3.8.13 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Mar 25 2022, 06:04:14)\n[Clang 12.0.1 ]\npython-bits: 64\nOS: Darwin\nOS-release: 21.5.0\nmachine: arm64\nprocessor: arm\nbyteorder: little\nLC_ALL: None\nLANG: en_AU.UTF-8\nLOCALE: ('en_AU', 'UTF-8')\nlibhdf5: 1.12.2\nlibnetcdf: 4.8.1\nxarray: 0.1.dev4312+ge678a1d.d20220928\npandas: 1.5.0\nnumpy: 1.22.4\nscipy: 1.9.1\nnetCDF4: 1.6.1\npydap: installed\nh5netcdf: 1.0.2\nh5py: 3.7.0\nNio: None\nzarr: 2.13.2\ncftime: 1.6.2\nnc_time_axis: 1.4.1\nPseudoNetCDF: 3.2.2\nrasterio: 1.3.1\ncfgrib: 0.9.10.1\niris: 3.3.0\nbottleneck: 1.3.5\ndask: 2022.9.1\ndistributed: 2022.9.1\nmatplotlib: 3.6.0\ncartopy: 0.21.0\nseaborn: 0.12.0\nnumbagg: 0.2.1\nfsspec: 2022.8.2\ncupy: None\npint: 0.19.2\nsparse: 0.13.0\nflox: 0.5.9\nnumpy_groupies: 0.9.19\nsetuptools: 65.4.0\npip: 22.2.2\nconda: None\npytest: 7.1.3\nIPython: None\nsphinx: None\n</details>\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the retrieved code snippets and the information about the methods provides valuable insights into how the issue might be approached and resolved.\n\n### Analysis of `_maybe_drop_multiindex_coords` in `xarray/core/coordinates.py`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThis section of the code appears to be responsible for handling the drop of coordinates and any associated indexes when dealing with a `DataArray`. The function `drop_coords` is called to remove specific coordinates from `_data._coords` and also update `_data._indexes` accordingly.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nGiven the issue description about problems with assigning coordinates to a stacked dataset leading to incorrect dataset length calculations, this part of `coordinates.py` is relevant since it directly manipulates coordinates and indexes. However, the problem described in the issue likely arises before this point, where the act of assigning new coordinates somehow disrupts the dataset's internal consistency, particularly regarding `_coord_names`.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nIdeally, this code ensures that any operations that modify a `DataArray`'s coordinates or indexes maintain the overall integrity of the dataset, such that subsequent operations like `__len__` or any coordinate-based access operations continue to function correctly. The method should ensure that only relevant coordinates and indexes are dropped and that the dataset remains in a consistent state afterward.\n\n### Relevance of `assign_coords` and `__len__`\n\n#### `assign_coords`\nFound in `xarray/core/common.py` and `xarray/core/groupby.py`, the `assign_coords` method is central to the issue, as it's the method being called when the error is experienced. This method is tasked with assigning new coordinates to a dataset, affecting how it's indexed and accessed.\n\nGiven the issue, it's plausible that `assign_coords`'s implementation may not be correctly handling the case where a coordinate assignment leads to changes in the multi-index structure and `_coord_names`, thus causing inconsistencies that manifest when attempting to determine the dataset's length.\n\n#### `__len__`\nImplementation variations of `__len__` were found in multiple files, including `xarray/core/dataset.py`, which is directly referenced in the error traceback. `__len__` should ideally return the number of variables in the dataset, but the issue indicates a computational logic flaw where the dataset ends up with a length less than zero.\n\nThe relationship between this part of the code and the bug is direct since the error comes from an invalid length computation, which is abnormal and suggestive of an internal state inconsistency likely introduced during coordinate assignment or manipulation.\n\n### Next Steps for Investigation\nGiven the above analysis, further investigation into `assign_coords` within `xarray/core/common.py` to understand its implementation details seems crucial. Specifically, examining how it updates `_coord_names` could provide critical insights into the issue.\n\nLikewise, reviewing the implementation of `__len__` particularly in `xarray/core/dataset.py` could offer clues on how the length calculation is being conducted and why it might end up negative after coordinate assignment.\n\n### Suggested API Calls for Further Investigation\n\n1. To explore `assign_coords` more deeply:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"assign_coords\", \"xarray/core/common.py\")`\n   - This will provide detailed insights into how coordinates are being assigned and potentially why this operation might disrupt dataset integrity.\n\n2. To understand the `__len__` operation better:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"__len__\", \"xarray/core/dataset.py\")`\n   - This would reveal how dataset length is calculated and possibly why an incorrect (negative) length could result after coordinate reassignment.\n\nThese specific API calls would target the most likely areas in the codebase where the issue originates, based on the provided context and the user's problem description."

When new coordinates are assigned, especially with operations that could lead to a MultiIndex or change the dimensionality of the data, the method needs to ensure that `_coord_names` and other internal structures reflect the true state of the dataset, preserving consistency. This might involve adding logic to check and update `_coord_names` appropriately during the assignment process to ensure that it always correctly represents the dataset's current state.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `xarray/core/dataset.py`\n  - **Class:** Not specified, but related to dataset handling.\n  - **Method:** `__len__`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The `__len__` method must robustly calculate the dataset's length, returning a non-negative integer under all legitimate circumstances. Given the issue, there should be additional checks or a review of the logic used to calculate the length, ensuring that an inaccurate length (particularly a negative one) is not computed after operations like coordinate assignment. The method should be adjusted to correctly interpret the dataset's structure, even when it has been modified by functions like `assign_coords`, ensuring that the subtraction operation between the number of `_variables` and `_coord_names` doesn't lead to negative results. This might involve adding safeguards or revising the logic to more accurately reflect the dataset's state post-modification.\n\nThese modifications should ensure that assigning coordinates to a dataset, especially after operations like stacking, will not lead to an inconsistent state where the dataset length is incorrectly computed. Care must be taken to preserve the existing functionality and expected behavior of both `assign_coords` and `__len__`, ensuring that these changes do not inadvertently introduce new issues."
