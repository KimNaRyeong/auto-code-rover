The mentioned URL suggests the problematic code may reside in the `xarray.core.coordinates.py` file, specifically around line 389. We should examine this area to understand how `_coord_names` is being updated or not updated in this context.\n\n2. The issue occurs when using `assign_coords` on a dataset, resulting in a `ValueError` related to the dataset's length being less than zero. It seems related to how the length of a dataset is determined, potentially involving `_variables` and `_coord_names`.\n\nGiven these leads, we need to get more context around the `_coord_names` usage within `coordinates.py`, as well as how `assign_coords` and dataset length calculation (`__len__`) are implemented.\n\nLet's start with these API calls:\n- `get_code_around_line(\"xarray/core/coordinates.py\", 389, 10)`: This will give us context around the suspected problem area.\n- `search_method(\"assign_coords\")`: Since `assign_coords` is central to the issue, knowing more about its implementation can provide useful context.\n- `search_method(\"__len__\")`: Since there is an error with `len(stacked)` resulting in a `ValueError`, understanding how `__len__` is implemented for datasets might reveal why an incorrect length (less than zero) is being returned.\n\nThese calls should offer a good starting point for diagnosing the issue by providing insights into how coordinates and dataset lengths are handled in the project."
