Based on your request, I've adjusted the previous response to create a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that adheres to the specified requirements. This script will check for the issue you've detailed, regarding assigning coordinates to a Dataset with a MultiIndex in `xarray`, and will use the specified function to print stack traces. 

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import xarray as xr

    try:
        ds = xr.DataArray(
            [[[1, 1], [0, 0]], [[2, 2], [1, 1]]],
            dims=("lat", "year", "month"),
            coords={"lat": [-60, 60], "year": [2010, 2020], "month": [3, 6]},
            name="test",
        ).to_dataset()

        stacked = ds.stack(time=("year", "month"))
        # This line attempts to assign a new coordinate while preserving the MultiIndex, which is expected to trigger the issue if present
        stacked = stacked.assign_coords({"time": [y + m / 12 for y, m in stacked["time"].values]})

        # Assertions to verify the state post operation
        assert set(stacked._variables.keys()) == {"test", "time", "lat"}, "Variable keys mismatch"
        assert set(stacked._coord_names) == {"time", "lat"}, "Coord names mismatch"
        
        # Verify correct behavior
        print("Reproducer executed successfully, no issue detected.")
    
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script attempts to reproduce the issue described: after stacking dimensions in a `xarray.DataArray` and then assigning new coordinates, the dataset enters an inconsistent state, particularly in how its dimensions and coordinate names are handled. The script checks whether the resulting state of the dataset meets the expected criteria by asserting the correctness of variable keys and coordinate names, aiming to catch any discrepancies that align with the described issue. 

Execution will:
- Exit with `0` (the default exit code for a process that completes without raising an exception) when no issue is detected.
- Use the `print_stacktrace` function to print detailed traceback information and exit with `1` if an exception is encountered, indicating the presence of an issue or an unexpected error.

The script is structured to easily identify the problem spot and to ensure that the issue, if present, is concisely captured and reported, according to the requirements laid out in your instructions.
