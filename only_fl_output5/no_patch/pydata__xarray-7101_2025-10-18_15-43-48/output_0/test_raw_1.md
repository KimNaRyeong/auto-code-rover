Given the feedback and the request for a corrected standalone Python file that targets the reproduction of the specific issue, let's adjust the context to align with the request. Given the original problem description and the aim to reproduce an issue related to assigning coordinates to a multi-indexed dataset in xarray, the file below should correctly attempt to reproduce the issue. It retains the use of the `print_stacktrace` function for detailed error output.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import xarray as xr

    try:
        ds = xr.DataArray(
            [[[1, 1], [0, 0]], [[2, 2], [1, 1]]],
            dims=("lat", "year", "month"),
            coords={"lat": [-60, 60], "year": [2010, 2020], "month": [3, 6]},
            name="test",
        ).to_dataset()

        stacked = ds.stack(time=("year", "month"))
        stacked = stacked.assign_coords({"time": [y + m / 12 for y, m in stacked["time"].values]})

        # Expectations
        assert set(stacked._variables.keys()) == {"test", "time", "lat"}, "Incorrect variable keys after assign_coords"
        assert set(stacked._coord_names) == {"time", "lat"}, "Incorrect _coord_names after assign_coords"

        # The assertion below is for reproducting the issue
        assert len(stacked) >= 0, "Dataset length must be >= 0"
        print("Issue is not present: Dataset length is non-negative.")
    
    except ValueError as ve:
        print_stacktrace(ve)
        raise AssertionError("Failed due to an error that should not occur.")
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate assertion failure
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(2)  # Exit with code 2 to indicate unexpected errors

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this script, `main` performs operations that could lead to the initially described issue, checking for the state after assigning coordinates to a dataset created from a DataArray with stacked dimensions. It first confirms the variables and coordinates are as expected after the operation. It then asserts the condition where the dataset's length should not be negativeâ€”an attempt to directly hit the bug's manifestation.

Upon failure, respective error information is printed through `print_stacktrace`, and the script exits with a code indicating the type of failure (assertion failure or an unexpected error).
