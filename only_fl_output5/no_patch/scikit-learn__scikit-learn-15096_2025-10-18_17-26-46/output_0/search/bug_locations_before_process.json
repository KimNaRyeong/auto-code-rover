        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior at this location should ensure that before any estimator in the parameter grid is fitted, a clone of it is created and used for the fitting. This would prevent the save of fitted estimators into `cv_results_['params']` and ensure that `cv_results_` only contains references to the parameters as they were passed to the grid search, without any fitted instances. This can be achieved by ensuring that any estimator parameter passed through the grid is cloned using the `clone` utility method before fitting. This cloning process should be explicitly documented in the method implementation to clarify the behavior and intended usage, preserving the functionality of parameter grid handling while avoiding the unintended retention of fitted model instances in `cv_results_`."
