I set the param grid by inputing transformers or estimators at different steps of the pipeline, following the Pipeline documentation:\n> A step\u2019s estimator may be replaced entirely by setting the parameter with its name to another estimator, or a transformer removed by setting to None.\nI couldn't figure why dumping cv_results_ would take so much memory on disk. It happens that cv_results_['params'] and all cv_results_['param_*'] objects contains fitted estimators, as much as there are points on my grid.\nThis bug should happen only when n_jobs = 1 (which is my usecase).\nI don't think this is intended (else the arguments and attributes _refit_ and _best_\\__estimator_ wouldn't be used).\nMy guess is that during the grid search, those estimator's aren't cloned before use (which could be a problem if using the same grid search several times, because estimators passed in the next grid would be fitted...).\n#### Version: 0.19.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. GridSearchCV Class Definition Context\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n- The `GridSearchCV` class in `sklearn/model_selection/_search.py` is designed to perform exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator. The class constructors and some methods such as `_run_search` are part of the initial context, implying handling of estimator initialization and execution of the search algorithm.\n\n**What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n- The bug described involves `GridSearchCV`'s handling of parameter grids, especially when these parameters are estimators themselves. The presence of fitted estimators in `cv_results_['params']` might directly relate to how `GridSearchCV` manages the cloning and fitting of estimators passed into its parameter grid.\n\n**What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n- The intended behavior would likely involve cloning estimator parameters to prevent fitted instances from being stored or reused across different folds of cross-validation. This ensures isolation between different iterations of the parameter search process.\n\n#### 2. The `clone` Method Context\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n- The `clone` function in `sklearn/base.py` is designed to construct a new estimator with the same parameters as the original. It makes a deep copy of the model in an estimator without copying attached data, implying the creation of a new instance that hasn't been fit.\n\n**What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n- This method is crucial for the issue at hand since the bug may stem from the absence of cloning or improper cloning of estimators when used in the `GridSearchCV` parameter grid. It suggests that whenever an estimator is passed through the parameter grid, a clone of it should be made before fitting, thus possibly preventing fitted estimators from being stored in `cv_results_['params']`.\n\n**What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n- Ideally, `clone` should be invoked for each estimator parameter before it is fitted within the `GridSearchCV` process. This ensures that `cv_results_['params']` contains only unfitted, cloned estimators rather than the ones fitted during the search process.\n\n#### Further Investigation Needed\n\nGiven that we found no explicit usage of the `fit` method within the `GridSearchCV` class through API calls (which might be an oversight or limitation of the search API), it's necessary to investigate how `GridSearchCV` integrates with the `clone` utility. Specifically, how the `clone` method is used (or not used) when handling the parameter grid components that are estimators and how the `cv_results_` are populated post the fitting process.\n\n**Next steps could involve:**\n- A closer look at `_run_search` and other relevant methods in `GridSearchCV` to understand their role in populating `cv_results_`.\n- Searching for the implementation details of parameter handling within the `GridSearchCV.fit` method, despite the lack of direct API search results, might reveal the mechanics that lead to the observed behavior.\n\nA more detailed examination of `sklearn/model_selection/_search.py`, where `GridSearchCV` is defined and how it interacts with `clone`, would likely provide the needed insights to propose a solution for the bug."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Given the absence of `fit` method details from the search, the issue might be within `_run_search` or similar methods responsible for the fitting of estimators and handling of the parameter grid.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The intended behavior at this location should ensure that before any estimator in the parameter grid is fitted, a clone of it is created and used for the fitting. This would prevent the save of fitted estimators into `cv_results_['params']` and ensure that `cv_results_` only contains references to the parameters as they were passed to the grid search, without any fitted instances. This can be achieved by ensuring that any estimator parameter passed through the grid is cloned using the `clone` utility method before fitting. This cloning process should be explicitly documented in the method implementation to clarify the behavior and intended usage, preserving the functionality of parameter grid handling while avoiding the unintended retention of fitted model instances in `cv_results_`.\n\nThis resolution maintains the usability of `GridSearchCV` for optimizing hyperparameters across different transformers or estimators without undue memory consumption or unintended side effects from storing fitted models within `cv_results_`."
