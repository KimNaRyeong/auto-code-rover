This script is set to raise an `AssertionError` if the problematic behavior (the error message not including the problematic variable's name) is observed. It will print a detailed stack trace of where the error occurred by extracting the traceback and printing it alongside the exception type and message.

If the issue is resolved, such as an update to `xarray` or its dependencies that fixes this issue, the script will print a confirmation message stating that the issue has been fixed (assuming the fix includes mentioning the variable name in the error message), and it will exit with code `0`.

For the script to work as intended, the Python environment requires `xarray` to be installed. If `cftime` is not installed and its installation is required for dealing with times outside the pandas representable range, you would need to ensure it's installed as well, though the issue demonstrated here is with error message clarity rather than the handling of times directly.
