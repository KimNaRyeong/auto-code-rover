However, this error message will not indicate the problematic variable's name.  It would be nice if it did, because it would make it easier for users to determine the source of the error.\ncc: @durack1\nxref: Unidata/cftime#295\n### Example\nThis is a minimal example of the issue.  The error message gives no indication that `\"invalid_times\"` is the problem:\n```\n>>> import xarray as xr\n>>> TIME_ATTRS = {\"units\": \"days since 0001-01-01\", \"calendar\": \"noleap\"}\n>>> valid_times = xr.DataArray([0, 1], dims=[\"time\"], attrs=TIME_ATTRS, name=\"valid_times\")\n>>> invalid_times = xr.DataArray([1e36, 2e36], dims=[\"time\"], attrs=TIME_ATTRS, name=\"invalid_times\")\n>>> ds = xr.merge([valid_times, invalid_times])\n>>> xr.decode_cf(ds)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/Users/spencer/software/xarray/xarray/coding/times.py\", line 275, in decode_cf_datetime\ndates = _decode_datetime_with_pandas(flat_num_dates, units, calendar)\nFile \"/Users/spencer/software/xarray/xarray/coding/times.py\", line 210, in _decode_datetime_with_pandas\nraise OutOfBoundsDatetime(\npandas._libs.tslibs.np_datetime.OutOfBoundsDatetime: Cannot decode times from a non-standard calendar, 'noleap', using pandas.\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/Users/spencer/software/xarray/xarray/coding/times.py\", line 180, in _decode_cf_datetime_dtype\nresult = decode_cf_datetime(example_value, units, calendar, use_cftime)\nFile \"/Users/spencer/software/xarray/xarray/coding/times.py\", line 277, in decode_cf_datetime\ndates = _decode_datetime_with_cftime(\nFile \"/Users/spencer/software/xarray/xarray/coding/times.py\", line 202, in _decode_datetime_with_cftime\ncftime.num2date(num_dates, units, calendar, only_use_cftime_datetimes=True)\nFile \"src/cftime/_cftime.pyx\", line 605, in cftime._cftime.num2date\nFile \"src/cftime/_cftime.pyx\", line 404, in cftime._cftime.cast_to_int\nOverflowError: time values outside range of 64 bit signed integers\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nFile \"/Users/spencer/software/xarray/xarray/conventions.py\", line 655, in decode_cf\nvars, attrs, coord_names = decode_cf_variables(\nFile \"/Users/spencer/software/xarray/xarray/conventions.py\", line 521, in decode_cf_variables\nnew_vars[k] = decode_cf_variable(\nFile \"/Users/spencer/software/xarray/xarray/conventions.py\", line 369, in decode_cf_variable\nvar = times.CFDatetimeCoder(use_cftime=use_cftime).decode(var, name=name)\nFile \"/Users/spencer/software/xarray/xarray/coding/times.py\", line 687, in decode\ndtype = _decode_cf_datetime_dtype(data, units, calendar, self.use_cftime)\nFile \"/Users/spencer/software/xarray/xarray/coding/times.py\", line 190, in _decode_cf_datetime_dtype\nraise ValueError(msg)\nValueError: unable to decode time units 'days since 0001-01-01' with \"calendar 'noleap'\".

Specifically, we're interested in how time decoding is implemented and how errors are handled in that process. The traceback points to several key locations:\n- The `decode_cf_datetime` function in `times.py`.\n- The `_decode_datetime_with_pandas` and `_decode_datetime_with_cftime` functions in `times.py`.\n- Error handling within `decode_cf` in the `conventions.py` file, as it ultimately raises the ValueError without specifying the variable name.\n\nGiven this, we should fetch context from these functions and possibly look into how variables are decoded to see where we can inject the variable name into the error message.\n\nI'll start with fetching context for the mentioned methods and code snippets:\n\n1. `search_method(\"decode_cf_datetime\")` \u2014 To see the implementation or definition of `decode_cf_datetime`.\n2. `search_method(\"_decode_datetime_with_pandas\")` \u2014 To get context about handling pandas-related decoding.\n3. `search_method(\"_decode_datetime_with_cftime\")` \u2014 To see how cftime decoding is managed.\n4. `search_method_in_file(\"decode_cf\", \"conventions.py\")` \u2014 To inspect the `decode_cf` function in `conventions.py`, especially how it processes variables and raises errors."
