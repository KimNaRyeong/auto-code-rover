        "intended_behavior": "The `get_db_prep_value` method should incorporate a call to `self.get_prep_value(value)` before proceeding with its current logic to adapt the JSON value for the database. This change will ensure that custom `get_prep_value` methods defined in subclasses of `JSONField` are called as expected, allowing for pre-processing of the value before it's handed off to the database. To preserve existing functionality, this new call should seamlessly integrate with the method's logic, only modifying the value when a custom `get_prep_value` is actually defined and leaving the process unchanged otherwise."
