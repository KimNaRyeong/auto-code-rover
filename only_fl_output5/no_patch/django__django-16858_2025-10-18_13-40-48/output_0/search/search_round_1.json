        "content": "<issue>`get_prep_value` no longer called for JSONField\nDescription\n(last modified by Julie Rymer)\nHello, I just upgraded from django 4.1 to 4.2 and I have a custom JSONField with a get_prep_value() override that stopped working. After searching a bit, I saw that was because JSONField.get_prep_value() is no longer called in 4.2 (\u200b5c23d9f0c32f166c81ecb6f3f01d5077a6084318).\nI think this issue need a resolution either:\nJSONField should call get_prep_value() like all other fields type, because this is the method that the \u200bdocumentation tell us to override in custom fields.\nOtherwise we need to override get_db_prep_value() which is heavier and does not have the same purpose. I think simply replacing connection.ops.adapt_json_value(value, self.encoder) with connection.ops.adapt_json_value(self.get_prep_value(value), self.encoder) in JSONField.get_db_prep_value() would fix this\nIf there is a good reason to no longer call get_prep_value(), this exception for JSONField should be clearly documented in \u200bcustom get_prep_value() doc. It should also be added to \u200bBackwards incompatible changes in 4.2 release note because I got stuck with this issue with no warning when migrating.\nPS: #34397 seems to be related but in fact is about Django 3.2 so it is not the current issue\n</issue>"

Search for the `JSONField` class in the codebase to understand how it is currently implemented and to locate the file it is defined in.\n2. Since the issue mentions that `get_prep_value` is no longer called, and suggests the modification should be in `get_db_prep_value`, both these methods in context to `JSONField` should be investigated.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, let's consider each point in turn:\n\n### 1. Analysis of `JSONField` in Different Contexts\n\n#### django/forms/fields.py\n- **What it does**: Defines a form field for JSON data, equipped with basic validation and conversion features to handle JSON data in forms.\n- **Relation to the bug**: This class is not directly related to the bug since the issue concerns the `JSONField` used within models, specifically in database interaction, not forms.\n\n#### django/db/models/fields/json.py\n- **What it does**: Implements a model field for storing JSON data, including methods for preparing data to be saved into the database and converting database values back to Python objects.\n- **Relation to the bug**: This is the primary context for the reported issue. It contains the implementation details of how JSON data is prepared for the database (`get_db_prep_value`) but lacks the overridden `get_prep_value`, as the issue describes.\n\n#### django/contrib/postgres/fields/jsonb.py\n- **What it does**: Points users away from the now-removed PostgreSQL-specific JSONB field towards the standardized `JSONField` in `django.db.models`.\n- **Relation to the bug**: Like the forms class, this is tangential to the issue at hand. It indicates migration recommendations but is not directly involved in the behavior described in the issue.\n\n### 2. Absence of `get_prep_value` and Analysis of `get_db_prep_value`\n\nThe `get_prep_value` method not being found suggests it either doesn't exist in the Django `JSONField` implementation or wasn't overridden in the user's custom field as they intended. Since it's common for fields to define `get_prep_value` for preprocessing before database operations, its absence in the `JSONField` class is directly related to the issue.\n\nThe `get_db_prep_value` method:\n- **What it does**: Prepares the value of the `JSONField` for database insertion. The method checks if the value is wrapped in an `expressions.Value` instance, handles it accordingly, and finally calls `connection.ops.adapt_json_value(value, self.encoder)` to adapt the JSON value for the database, using an optional custom encoder if provided.\n- **Relation to the bug**: The method's current implementation directly relates to the bug as it skips calling `get_prep_value` entirely, opting instead to directly prepare the value for the database. This behavior diverges from traditional expectations where `get_prep_value` would be invoked to preprocess the value before any database-specific preparation.\n- **Intended behavior**: Given the issue description, the intended behavior appears to be the inclusion of a step where `get_prep_value` is called to allow custom fields to modify the value before it's handed off to database preparation routines. Specifically, inserting this call before the final line of `get_db_prep_value` would align with traditional field behavior across Django.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nBased on this analysis and the issue description, a potential resolution would involve modifying the implementation of `get_db_prep_value` within `django/db/models/fields/json.py` to:\n1. Call `self.get_prep_value(value)` prior to any database-specific value adaptation.\n2. Ensure such changes are consistent with Django's expectations for field behavior and do not inadvertently disrupt other parts of the ORM.\n\nTo advance this resolution, further context might not be strictly necessary from the codebase. Instead, the focus should shift towards implementing the described change and validating it against Django's ORM behaviors, considering backward compatibility and the potential need for adjustments in documentation or deprecation warnings."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This change will ensure that custom `get_prep_value` methods defined in subclasses of `JSONField` are called as expected, allowing for pre-processing of the value before it's handed off to the database. To preserve existing functionality, this new call should seamlessly integrate with the method's logic, only modifying the value when a custom `get_prep_value` is actually defined and leaving the process unchanged otherwise.\n\n   To achieve this, the method could be updated to include something like the following at a strategic point before any adaptation logic specific to database operations:\n\n   ```python\n   if not prepared:  # assuming changes are only needed when the value isn't already prepared\n       value = self.get_prep_value(value)\n   ```\n\n   This adjustment ensures that the existing functionality for database preparation of JSON values is maintained while restoring the expected behavior of `get_prep_value`. The update must be done in a way that doesn't disrupt the method's handling of different types of values, such as when dealing with instances already formatted as SQL or wrapped in `expressions.Value`."
