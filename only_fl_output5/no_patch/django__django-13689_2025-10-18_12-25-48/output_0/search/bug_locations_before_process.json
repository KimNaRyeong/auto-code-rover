        "intended_behavior": "The method `get_group_by_cols` should be revised to ensure that when an `ExpressionWrapper` contains an expression that affects grouping (e.g., when wrapping a `Q` object to produce a conditional expression like '\"bob_id\" IS NULL'), this expression is appropriately included in the `GROUP BY` clause of the generated SQL query. This change must preserve the method's ability to handle other expressions and maintain compatibility with expressions that do not directly affect grouping."

        "intended_behavior": "The `annotate` method should be inspected and possibly adjusted to better handle cases where annotated fields (especially those wrapped with `ExpressionWrapper`) are used with the `values` and `annotate` methods together in a queryset. Specifically, it should ensure that expressions affecting the `GROUP BY` clause, as defined in the `annotate` method call, are accurately represented in the SQL query. This involves preserving the logic for handling different types of expressions within `annotate` calls, ensuring that the final SQL query accurately reflects the intended groupings and aggregates."
