        "intended_behavior": "Introduce a step to convert the 'alphas' parameter values to floats if they are provided as integers. This conversion should happen before any computations that could lead to operations not supported for integers, such as raising to negative powers. Ensure that this conversion does not affect the external API. Users should still be able to pass in 'alphas' as either integers or floats without noticing any difference in how they call or interact with the method. Maintain or improve upon existing error checking and handling to provide meaningful errors or warnings if 'alphas' contains values that would lead to invalid computations after the conversion process. This change should be carefully tested to ensure it does not introduce any backward compatibility issues or impact the functionality of related components within the scikit-learn library."
