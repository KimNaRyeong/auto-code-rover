Given the task and the constraints, I understand that the initial reproduction script did not execute as intended due to environment setup issues rather than the specific issue it was meant to reproduce. Below, I've revised the `reproducer.py` script. It's crucial that this script is executed in a properly configured environment where scikit-learn is correctly installed. This script checks if the ValueError related to integer alphas in `RidgeCV` is thrown and prints detailed information about the error if it occurs.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeCV
        from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
        
        # Generate a regression problem
        X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=10, noise=0.1)
        
        # Attempt to fit RidgeCV with integer alphas
        ridge = RidgeCV(alphas=[1, 10, 100, 1000]).fit(X, y)

        # If the ValueError was not raised, we assume the issue is fixed.
        print("Execution successful - Issue appears to be fixed.")
        # Exiting with code 0 to indicate success
        exit(0)

    except ValueError as e:
        # If a ValueError is caught, display its stack trace.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Asserting False to raise an AssertionError indicating the issue is present.
        assert False, "ValueError issue encountered as described."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script must be run in an environment where scikit-learn and its dependencies are correctly installed. The purpose of the script is to identify a specific issue with the handling of integer alpha values in `RidgeCV`. If the script exits with code 0 and prints "Execution successful - Issue appears to be fixed.", it means the initially reported issue does not occur and is likely fixed. If the script prints the stack trace followed by an `AssertionError`, it signifies the problem persists as described.

Please ensure scikit-learn is correctly installed and the environment is suitable for running this script. You can generally ensure a proper setup by creating a fresh virtual environment and installing scikit-learn via pip (`pip install scikit-learn`) or conda (`conda install scikit-learn`), depending on your Python package management preference.
