Below, I've revised the `reproducer.py` script. It's crucial that this script is executed in a properly configured environment where scikit-learn is correctly installed. This script checks if the ValueError related to integer alphas in `RidgeCV` is thrown and prints detailed information about the error if it occurs.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeCV\n        from sklearn.datasets import make_regression\n        \n        # Generate a regression problem\n        X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=10, noise=0.1)\n        \n        # Attempt to fit RidgeCV with integer alphas\n        ridge = RidgeCV(alphas=[1, 10, 100, 1000]).fit(X, y)\n\n        # If the ValueError was not raised, we assume the issue is fixed.\n        print(\"Execution successful - Issue appears to be fixed.\")\n        # Exiting with code 0 to indicate success\n        exit(0)\n\n    except ValueError as e:\n        # If a ValueError is caught, display its stack trace.\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        # Asserting False to raise an AssertionError indicating the issue is present.\n        assert False, \"ValueError issue encountered as described.\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis script must be run in an environment where scikit-learn and its dependencies are correctly installed. The purpose of the script is to identify a specific issue with the handling of integer alpha values in `RidgeCV`. If the script exits with code 0 and prints \"Execution successful - Issue appears to be fixed.\", it means the initially reported issue does not occur and is likely fixed. If the script prints the stack trace followed by an `AssertionError`, it signifies the problem persists as described.\n\nPlease ensure scikit-learn is correctly installed and the environment is suitable for running this script. You can generally ensure a proper setup by creating a fresh virtual environment and installing scikit-learn via pip (`pip install scikit-learn`) or conda (`conda install scikit-learn`), depending on your Python package management preference."
