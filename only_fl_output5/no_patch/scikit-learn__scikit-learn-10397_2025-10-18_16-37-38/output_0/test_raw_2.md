Given the task and the feedback provided, it's understood that the original script's execution did not specifically address reproducing the issue as expected due to an environmental setup error, rather than focusing on reproducing the described issue. The requirement is to craft a Python script that intentionally reproduces the reported issue concerning integer powers within the `RidgeCV` class from scikit-learn, specifically when encountering a `ValueError` about integers to negative integer powers. This script should comply with the requested behavior of exiting with code 0 when the issue is resolved, and in the event the issue persists, it prints a detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function.

Below is an updated version of the `reproducer.py` script designed to fulfill the described requirements:

```python
# reproducerer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeCV
        from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
        
        X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=10, noise=0.1)
        
        # This will either pass silently or raise the ValueError if the issue exists
        ridge = RidgeCV(alphas=[1, 10, 100, 1000]).fit(X, y)
        
        # If no exception was raised, we consider the issue resolved.
        print("No issue encountered with integer alphas in RidgeCV.")
        exit(0)

    except ValueError as e:
        # If the specific ValueError is caught, it means the issue is present.
        if "Integers to negative integer powers are not allowed" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            assert False, "The issue with integer alphas in RidgeCV is present."
        else:
            # Reraise if it's a different ValueError than expected
            raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script attempts to reproduce the specific issue where passing integers as alphas in `RidgeCV` may lead to a `ValueError: Integers to negative integer powers are not allowed`. It correctly handles the scenario where this error is encountered by printing a detailed stack trace. Conversely, if the script execution is successful (indicating that the issue has been resolved or does not exist under the script's test conditions), it exits with code 0.
