        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, `GenericForeignKey` should either simulate the `empty_strings_allowed` attribute or provide a method to dynamically determine if the field can have empty string values based on the linked model fields (`ContentType` and the object ID field). A potential fix could involve adding a property or method that mimics the behavior of `empty_strings_allowed`, ensuring compatibility with `EmptyFieldListFilter`. This property could return `False` by default, given that a relation (even a generic one) might not inherently allow empty strings as a valid reference value. This adjustment would enable `EmptyFieldListFilter` to interact with `GenericForeignKey` without raising an AttributeError."

        "intended_behavior": "Modify `EmptyFieldListFilter` to gracefully handle cases where a field does not have the `empty_strings_allowed` attribute, such as when dealing with a `GenericForeignKey`. This could involve a try-except block around access to `empty_strings_allowed`, with fallback logic for fields lacking this attribute. The fallback logic could treat the field as not allowing empty strings, or better yet, determine if the field can be considered empty through other means, such as checking for `None` values or leveraging custom logic specific to `GenericForeignKey`. This change would preserve the existing functionality for all other field types while extending compatibility to `GenericForeignKey`."
