        "content": "<issue>No longer able to read BinnedTimeSeries with datetime column saved as ECSV after upgrading from 4.2.1 -> 5.0+\n### Description\nHi, [This commit](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/commit/e807dbff9a5c72bdc42d18c7d6712aae69a0bddc) merged in PR #11569 breaks my ability to read an ECSV file created using Astropy v 4.2.1, BinnedTimeSeries class's write method, which has a datetime64 column. Downgrading astropy back to 4.2.1 fixes the issue because the strict type checking in line 177 of ecsv.py is not there.\nIs there a reason why this strict type checking was added to ECSV? Is there a way to preserve reading and writing of ECSV files created with BinnedTimeSeries across versions? I am happy to make a PR on this if the strict type checking is allowed to be scaled back or we can add datetime64 as an allowed type.\n### Expected behavior\nThe file is read into a `BinnedTimeSeries` object from ecsv file without error.\n### Actual behavior\nValueError is produced and the file is not read because ECSV.py does not accept the datetime64 column.\n`ValueError: datatype 'datetime64' of column 'time_bin_start' is not in allowed values ('bool', 'int8', 'int16', 'int32', 'int64', 'uint8', 'uint16', 'uint32', 'uint64', 'float16', 'float32', 'float64', 'float128', 'string')`\n### Steps to Reproduce\nThe file is read using:\n`BinnedTimeSeries.read('<file_path>', format='ascii.ecsv')`\nwhich gives a long error.\nThe file in question is a binned time series created by  `astropy.timeseries.aggregate_downsample`. which itself is a binned version of an `astropy.timeseries.TimeSeries` instance with some TESS data. (loaded via TimeSeries.from_pandas(Tess.set_index('datetime')). I.e., it has a datetime64 index.  The file was written using the classes own .write method in Astropy V4.2.1 from an instance of said class:\n`myBinnedTimeSeries.write('<file_path>',format='ascii.ecsv',overwrite=True)`\nI'll attach a concatenated version of the file (as it contains private data). However, the relevant part from the header is on line 4:\n```\n# %ECSV 0.9\n# ---\n# datatype:\n# - {name: time_bin_start, datatype: datetime64}\n```\nas you can see, the datatype is datetime64. This works fine with ECSV V0.9 but not V1.0 as some sort of strict type checking was added.\n###\nFull error log:\n```\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\nInput In [3], in <module>\n---> 49 tsrbin = BinnedTimeSeries.read('../Photometry/tsr_bin.dat', format='ascii.ecsv')\nFile ~/Apps/miniconda3/envs/py310_latest/lib/python3.10/site-packages/astropy/timeseries/binned.py:285, in BinnedTimeSeries.read(self, filename, time_bin_start_column, time_bin_end_column, time_bin_size_column, time_bin_size_unit, time_format, time_scale, format, *args, **kwargs)\n230 \"\"\"\n231 Read and parse a file and returns a `astropy.timeseries.BinnedTimeSeries`.\n232\n(...)\n279\n280 \"\"\"\n282 try:\n283\n284     # First we try the readers defined for the BinnedTimeSeries class\n--> 285     return super().read(filename, format=format, *args, **kwargs)\n287 except TypeError:\n288\n289     # Otherwise we fall back to the default Table readers\n291     if time_bin_start_column is None:\nFile ~/Apps/miniconda3/envs/py310_latest/lib/python3.10/site-packages/astropy/table/connect.py:62, in TableRead.__call__(self, *args, **kwargs)\n59 units = kwargs.pop('units', None)\n60 descriptions = kwargs.pop('descriptions', None)\n---> 62 out = self.registry.read(cls, *args, **kwargs)\n64 # For some readers (e.g., ascii.ecsv), the returned `out` class is not\n65 # guaranteed to be the same as the desired output `cls`.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides crucial insights into the reported issue and the inner workings of Astropy, particularly how the ECSV format and `BinnedTimeSeries` are implemented and interact.\n\n### Analysis of ECSV Handling\n\nFrom the `EcsvHeader` class and the `get_cols` method snippet in `ecsv.py`, we understand that ECSV (Enhanced Character Separated Values) handling in Astropy involves specialized header processing for correct datatype interpretation. The `get_cols` method is crucial for initializing column objects from ECSV lines, implying where the strict datatype checking likely occurs. The error mentioned in the issue arises because `datetime64` is not recognized as a valid datatype during this process. This strict type checking is presumably what was introduced or altered in the commit mentioned in the issue, causing the breakage.\n\n### Relationship to the Bug\n\nThe key relationship between this part of the code and the bug is clear: the inability to recognize `datetime64` as a valid datatype directly results in the error encountered when reading ECSV files containing such datatypes. The code responsible for parsing and validating the datatypes within the ECSV headers doesn't account for `datetime64`, even though this was apparently not an issue in version 4.2.1 of Astropy.\n\n### Intended Behavior\n\nThe intended behavior appears to be for Astropy to seamlessly parse ECSV files with `datetime64` columns, reading them into appropriate Python/Astropy objects without error. This functionality is critical for users relying on Astropy for time-series data analysis, where `datetime64` is a common and essential datatype for time information.\n\n### `BinnedTimeSeries.read` Relationship\n\nThe `BinnedTimeSeries.read` method's code shows how Astropy attempts to read in data files to construct a `BinnedTimeSeries` object. It tries to use specific readers for `BinnedTimeSeries` and falls back on default Table readers if that fails, requiring the column names to be specified. This method's flexibility in handling different input formats is central to the issue, as it outlines how the format and column specification interact during the reading process. The error is raised during this phase when Astropy encounters an unrecognized `datetime64` datatype in the ECSV file, triggered by the strict type checking mechanism in the ECSV handling code.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the insights from the code snippets, we understand where and why the issue occurs. However, we lack information on the `write` method for `BinnedTimeSeries`, which could provide symmetry in understanding how `datetime64` data is serialized to ECSV format.\n\nTo gain complete context and propose a solution, the following additional steps are necessary:\n- Investigate further into how `datetime64` types are expected to be handled during serialization (writing to ECSV) in Astropy. Since the `write` method was not found for `BinnedTimeSeries`, examining the superclass from which it might inherit this method is the next logical step.\n- Understanding the design decisions behind the strict type checking introduced. It would be helpful to review the discussion or documentation around the commit causing the issue for any rationale or intended use cases that led to excluding `datetime64`.\n\n### Potential Solution Approach\n\nBased on the information gathered so far, a PR could aim to either introduce `datetime64` as an allowed datatype in the strict checking mechanism or propose a more flexible approach to datatype validation in ECSV processing, ensuring backward compatibility and functionality for `datetime64` data.\n\nBefore proceeding, further context on the `write` method's implementation and a review of the changes introduced in the problematic commit are necessary. Thus, another API call should be made to investigate the superclass of `BinnedTimeSeries` or to examine the commit history for changes related to `datetime64` and ECSV handling."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

        "content": "1. **do we need more context:** \n\nGiven the analysis, to fully address the issue we would benefit from understanding how the `BinnedTimeSeries` class handles the serialization of data, specifically regarding handling `datetime64` types or the absence of a direct `write` method in `BinnedTimeSeries` class. However, the crucial next steps involve lower-level handling of types in the ECSV module and understanding the rationale behind the introduction of strict type checking that does not account for `datetime64`. Therefore, rather than additional search API calls, a proposed resolution based on the current context should focus on enhancing type compatibility in `ECSV.py`. Any further specific API calls at this moment would target understanding or patching the identified issue area rather than gathering more context.\n\n2. **where are bug locations:**\n\n- **Location 1:** \n    - **File:** `astropy/io/ascii/ecsv.py`\n    - **Class:** `EcsvHeader`\n    - **Method:** `get_cols(self, lines)`\n    - **Intended Behavior:** The method's intended behavior should be expanded to include `datetime64` in the list of allowed data types or implement a more flexible datatype checking mechanism that can accommodate `datetime64` without compromising the existing functionality. The `get_cols` function is responsible for initializing column objects from table lines and enforcing datatype constraints. Allowing `datetime64` will enable compatibility with previously created ECSV files containing datetime data, thereby resolving the issue.\n    \nWithout explicit details of the `write` method implementation in `BinnedTimeSeries` or a directly related superclass method, addressing the strict type checking in `ECSV.py` appears to be the primary action point capable of resolving the reported error. This solution assumes that the handling of `datetime64` types was previously either more permissive or implicitly supported through a mechanism that did not enforce datatype constraints as strictly as the current implementation. Restoring or adapting this functionality to accommodate `datetime64` data will align with the expected behavior of being able to read ECSV files containing such datatype information."
