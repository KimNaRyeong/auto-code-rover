First, in the cache setting code, it runs:\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM %s\" % table)\nnum = cursor.fetchone()[0]\nnow = timezone.now()\nnow = now.replace(microsecond=0)\nif num > self._max_entries:\nself._cull(db, cursor, now)\n(\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/d06c5b358149c02a62da8a5469264d05f29ac659/django/core/cache/backends/db.py#L120-L131)\nThen in self._cull (the last line above) it runs:\ncursor.execute(\"DELETE FROM %s WHERE expires < %%s\" % table,\n[connection.ops.adapt_datetimefield_value(now)])\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM %s\" % table)\nnum = cursor.fetchone()[0]\nif num > self._max_entries:\n# Do culling routine here...\n(\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/d06c5b358149c02a62da8a5469264d05f29ac659/django/core/cache/backends/db.py#L254-L260)\nThe idea is that if the MAX_ENTRIES setting is exceeded, it'll cull the DB cache down by some percentage so it doesn't grow forever.\nI think that's fine, but given that the SELECT COUNT(*) query is slow, I wonder two things:\nWould a refactor to remove the second query be a good idea? If you pass the count from the first query into the _cull method, you can then do:\ndef _cull(self, db, cursor, now, count):\n...\ncursor.execute(\"DELETE FROM %s WHERE expires < %%s\" % table,\n[connection.ops.adapt_datetimefield_value(now)])\ndeleted_count = cursor.rowcount\nnum = count - deleted_count\nif num > self._max_entries:\n# Do culling routine here...\nThat seems like a simple win.\nIs it reasonable to not run the culling code *every* time that we set a value? Like, could we run it every tenth time or every 100th time or something?\nIf this is a good idea, does anybody have a proposal for how to count this? I'd be happy just doing it on a mod of the current millisecond, but there's probably a better way (randint?).\nWould a setting be a good idea here? We already have MAX_ENTRIES and CULL_FREQUENCY. CULL_FREQUENCY is \"the fraction of entries that are culled when MAX_ENTRIES is reached.\" That sounds more like it should have been named CULL_RATIO (regrets!), but maybe a new setting for this could be called \"CULL_EVERY_X\"?\nI think the first change is a no-brainer, but both changes seem like wins to me. Happy to implement either or both of these, but wanted buy-in first.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the `django/core/cache/backends/db.py` regarding the `DatabaseCache` class and the two specific methods, `_base_set` and `_cull`, we have corresponding sections of code involving a `SELECT COUNT(*)` query execution that are relevant to the reported issue. Let's break down each part regarding the three analytical questions posed.\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\n- **_base_set method**:\n  - This part of the code is likely responsible for setting (adding or updating) cache entries in the database. It queries the table to count the number of entries currently stored (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM %s`). This count is then used to determine if culling is needed to prevent the cache from exceeding a maximum number of entries specified by `_max_entries`. If the count exceeds `_max_entries`, some culling process is likely triggered.\n\n- **_cull method**:\n  - This method appears to be directly responsible for the culling process. Initially, it deletes entries from the cache that have expired based on the `expires` column (`DELETE FROM %s WHERE expires < %s`). Immediately following the deletion, it counts the total number of remaining entries with `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM %s`. This appears to be for the purpose of determining if further culling is needed to reduce the count to within the designated `_max_entries`.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe bug is specifically related to the performance penalty incurred by executing `SELECT COUNT(*)` queries twice during the cache update process, particularly when determining the need for and performing culling. The first count is used to trigger the culling process, and the second count is to determine the necessity of further action post-culling. This results in a performance issue because counting rows in a table can be expensive, especially as the number of entries grows.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior seems to be maintaining the cache size within predefined limits by culling when necessary. However, the issue points towards optimizing this behavior to reduce redundant costly operations (like counting the entire table twice). \n\n- Optimization would aim to avoid the second `SELECT COUNT(*)` after entries have been culled by calculating the new total based on the number of entries deleted (accessible via `cursor.rowcount` after the `DELETE` operation) and the count obtained before deletion.\n- Furthermore, it discusses whether it's necessary to perform this culling operation on every cache set operation and suggests introducing a setting to control how frequently culling should be attempted, which would further mitigate the performance penalty.\n\nBased on this analysis, the proposed patch would involve modifying the `_cull` method to accept the pre-culling count as an argument and use it along with the `cursor.rowcount` from the deletion operation to determine the necessity of further action without a second count operation. Additionally, contemplating the implementation of a culling frequency feature, which would reduce the frequency of these expensive operations, aligns with the intended behavior improvement described in the issue."

This removes the need for a second `SELECT COUNT(*)` query, reducing database load and improving performance. The method should determine if culling is required based on the cache size exceeding `_max_entries`, and if so, activate the culling process with the current count as a parameter.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - File: `django/core/cache/backends/db.py`\n  - Class: `DatabaseCache`\n  - Method: `_cull`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Modify the `_cull` method to accept an additional parameter, `pre_cull_count`, representing the count of entries before culling begins. After deletion of expired entries, calculate the new count by subtracting `cursor.rowcount` (the number of rows deleted) from `pre_cull_count`. This approach eliminates the need for a subsequent count query. The method proceeds with further culling if the recalculated count still exceeds `_max_entries`. This change aims to preserve the functionality of maintaining cache size within limits while significantly improving efficiency.\n\nThese adjustments aim to mitigate the performance issue reported in the bug by reducing redundant database operations, hence maintaining the cache operation's efficiency while keeping its functionality intact."
