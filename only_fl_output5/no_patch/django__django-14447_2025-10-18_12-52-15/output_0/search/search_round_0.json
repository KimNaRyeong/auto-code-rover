        "content": "<issue>Database cache counts the DB size twice at a performance penalty\nDescription\nWe have a lot of entries in the DB cache, and I've noticed that the following query shows up in my slow query log kind of a lot (Postgresql is slow at counting things):\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM cache_table;\nThis query is being run by the DB cache twice for every cache update in order to determine if culling is needed. First, in the cache setting code, it runs:\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM %s\" % table)\nnum = cursor.fetchone()[0]\nnow = timezone.now()\nnow = now.replace(microsecond=0)\nif num > self._max_entries:\nself._cull(db, cursor, now)\n(\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/d06c5b358149c02a62da8a5469264d05f29ac659/django/core/cache/backends/db.py#L120-L131)\nThen in self._cull (the last line above) it runs:\ncursor.execute(\"DELETE FROM %s WHERE expires < %%s\" % table,\n[connection.ops.adapt_datetimefield_value(now)])\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM %s\" % table)\nnum = cursor.fetchone()[0]\nif num > self._max_entries:\n# Do culling routine here...\n(\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/d06c5b358149c02a62da8a5469264d05f29ac659/django/core/cache/backends/db.py#L254-L260)\nThe idea is that if the MAX_ENTRIES setting is exceeded, it'll cull the DB cache down by some percentage so it doesn't grow forever.\nI think that's fine, but given that the SELECT COUNT(*) query is slow, I wonder two things:\nWould a refactor to remove the second query be a good idea? If you pass the count from the first query into the _cull method, you can then do:\ndef _cull(self, db, cursor, now, count):\n...\ncursor.execute(\"DELETE FROM %s WHERE expires < %%s\" % table,\n[connection.ops.adapt_datetimefield_value(now)])\ndeleted_count = cursor.rowcount\nnum = count - deleted_count\nif num > self._max_entries:\n# Do culling routine here...\nThat seems like a simple win.\nIs it reasonable to not run the culling code *every* time that we set a value? Like, could we run it every tenth time or every 100th time or something?\nIf this is a good idea, does anybody have a proposal for how to count this? I'd be happy just doing it on a mod of the current millisecond, but there's probably a better way (randint?).\nWould a setting be a good idea here? We already have MAX_ENTRIES and CULL_FREQUENCY. CULL_FREQUENCY is \"the fraction of entries that are culled when MAX_ENTRIES is reached.\" That sounds more like it should have been named CULL_RATIO (regrets!), but maybe a new setting for this could be called \"CULL_EVERY_X\"?\nI think the first change is a no-brainer, but both changes seem like wins to me. Happy to implement either or both of these, but wanted buy-in first.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue described, I will make the following API calls based on the provided information:\n\n1. **Search for the class where the issue is reported**:\n   - Since the issue describes a problem in the database cache backend, specifically mentioning Django, we need to find the class implementing DB cache. The description points to code snippets that are likely part of this class. The typical class name for such functionality might be something like `DatabaseCache`, but we will need to use the actual class name if different. Therefore, a search for the file mentioned in the URLs in the issue description to infer the correct class name is needed. However, given the constraints of the API and the information provided, the direct search for a class based on a filename is not possible. Thus, the initial step will be skipped in favor of a more feasible approach using the file path directly derived from the URLs in the issue description.\n\n2. **Search for methods within a specific file**:\n   - As the issue describes specific problems within methods, namely around cache setting and culling logic, we need to gather context about these methods from the described file.\n\nThe following API calls will provide necessary contexts:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"cull\", \"django/core/cache/backends/db.py\")`: This will find references to the `_cull` method where one of the redundant `SELECT COUNT(*)` queries is made according to the issue description.\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM\", \"django/core/cache/backends/db.py\")`: This will help gather contexts around both instances where the `SELECT COUNT(*)` query is executed, as mentioned in the issue.\n\nThese API calls are selected to directly address the components of the code described in the issue: the problematic SQL query executions and the culling method that follows one of them."
