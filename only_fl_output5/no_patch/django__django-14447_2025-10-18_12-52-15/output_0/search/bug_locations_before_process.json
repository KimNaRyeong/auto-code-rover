        "intended_behavior": "In the `_base_set` method, instead of querying the count of rows twice (before and after culling), optimize by passing the initial count obtained to the `_cull` method. This removes the need for a second `SELECT COUNT(*)` query, reducing database load and improving performance. The method should determine if culling is required based on the cache size exceeding `_max_entries`, and if so, activate the culling process with the current count as a parameter."

        "method": "_cull",
        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `_cull` method to accept an additional parameter, `pre_cull_count`, representing the count of entries before culling begins. After deletion of expired entries, calculate the new count by subtracting `cursor.rowcount` (the number of rows deleted) from `pre_cull_count`. This approach eliminates the need for a subsequent count query. The method proceeds with further culling if the recalculated count still exceeds `_max_entries`. This change aims to preserve the functionality of maintaining cache size within limits while significantly improving efficiency."
