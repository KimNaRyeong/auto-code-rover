Here are the API calls that will help us get the necessary information:\n\n1. Since the issue involves `tight_layout`, we should start by searching where this method is defined in the context of figures or subplots. \n    - `search_method(\"tight_layout\")`\n\n2. Next, we need to understand how the `figure.autolayout` setting from `rcParams` is accessed and affects layout adjustments. \n    - `search_code(\"rcParams['figure.autolayout']\")`\n\n3. The mention of `ncols=2` in the reproduction code suggests `subplots` function involvement, so it might be useful to see how `subplots` initializes the figure and if it somehow interacts with `tight_layout` or `figure.autolayout`.\n    - `search_method(\"subplots\")`\n\nThese API calls are aimed at gathering code context related to how tight layout parameters are processed in conjunction with automatic layout settings, and how the figure and its subplots are initialized and managed in Matplotlib 1.5.3."
