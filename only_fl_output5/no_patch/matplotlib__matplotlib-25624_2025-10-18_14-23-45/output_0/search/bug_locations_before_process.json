        "intended_behavior": "This method sets the tight layout parameters based on either the value of `tight` or the `rcParams['figure.autolayout']`. The intended behavior here should ensure that when `tight` is a dictionary (representing custom `kwargs` passed to `tight_layout`), these parameters are always applied, effectively overriding the default behavior induced by `figure.autolayout` being `True`. This modification should preserve the existing functionality for cases where `tight_layout` is called without parameters or `tight` is not a dictionary of parameters, thus maintaining backward compatibility and expected behavior when automatic layout adjustments are preferred without specific customizations."
