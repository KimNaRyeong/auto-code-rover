This adjustment aims to more accurately emulate the conditions under which the original issue is observed, specifically ensuring that the `AssertionError` correctly reflects the failure to apply `tight_layout` settings when `figure.autolayout` is set through `rcParams`.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib as mpl\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef check_layout_effectiveness():\n    try:\n        # Enabling figure.autolayout via matplotlib rc\n        mpl.rcParams['figure.autolayout'] = True\n        initial_rc_layout = mpl.rcParams['figure.autolayout']\n\n        # Creating a figure with 2 subplots\n        fig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=2)\n\n        # Capture initial positions to ensure there is a change\n        initial_positions = [ax.get_position().bounds for ax in axes]\n\n        # Applying tight_layout with specified padding which should have an effect\n        fig.tight_layout(w_pad=10)\n\n        # Post-application positions for comparison\n        after_positions = [ax.get_position().bounds for ax in axes]\n\n        # Assert to ensure the positions have changed reflecting tight_layout's effect\n        assert initial_positions != after_positions, \"tight_layout kwargs had no effect when figure.autolayout was set.\"\n\n        print(\"tight_layout's kwargs had the intended effect with figure.autolayout set. Exiting with code 0.\")\n        exit(0)\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    check_layout_effectiveness()\n```\n\nThis script adaptation focuses on striking the balance between emulating the issue and resolving the previous misinterpretation. The assertion now properly anticipates a change in subplot positions after `tight_layout` is applied, expecting that `w_pad=10` (or any other provided kwargs) should influence layout adjustments despite `figure.autolayout` being activated. Failure in asserting this change directly corresponds to the reported issue, leading to the execution of `print_stacktrace` function for clearer debugging insights."
