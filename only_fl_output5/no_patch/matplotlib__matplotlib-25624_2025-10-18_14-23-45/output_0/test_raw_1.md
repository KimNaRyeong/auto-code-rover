Given the clarification requested to ensure the script correctly reflects the issue reported and my previous attempt did not successfully replicate the issue as intended, I will revise the approach. This adjustment aims to more accurately emulate the conditions under which the original issue is observed, specifically ensuring that the `AssertionError` correctly reflects the failure to apply `tight_layout` settings when `figure.autolayout` is set through `rcParams`.

```python
# reproducer.py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_layout_effectiveness():
    try:
        # Enabling figure.autolayout via matplotlib rc
        mpl.rcParams['figure.autolayout'] = True
        initial_rc_layout = mpl.rcParams['figure.autolayout']

        # Creating a figure with 2 subplots
        fig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=2)

        # Capture initial positions to ensure there is a change
        initial_positions = [ax.get_position().bounds for ax in axes]

        # Applying tight_layout with specified padding which should have an effect
        fig.tight_layout(w_pad=10)

        # Post-application positions for comparison
        after_positions = [ax.get_position().bounds for ax in axes]

        # Assert to ensure the positions have changed reflecting tight_layout's effect
        assert initial_positions != after_positions, "tight_layout kwargs had no effect when figure.autolayout was set."

        print("tight_layout's kwargs had the intended effect with figure.autolayout set. Exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_layout_effectiveness()
```

This script adaptation focuses on striking the balance between emulating the issue and resolving the previous misinterpretation. The assertion now properly anticipates a change in subplot positions after `tight_layout` is applied, expecting that `w_pad=10` (or any other provided kwargs) should influence layout adjustments despite `figure.autolayout` being activated. Failure in asserting this change directly corresponds to the reported issue, leading to the execution of `print_stacktrace` function for clearer debugging insights.
