Given the requirements and the need to raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present, and to accurately track the behavior with respect to the `tight_layout` kwargs not having an effect when `rcParams['figure.autolayout']` is set to `True`, I'll write a more focused reproducible script. This script will explicitly check if the `tight_layout` changes are ignored due to `autolayout` being enabled, indicative of the issue described.

```python
# reproducer.py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Setup matplotlib to use the 'autolayout' option.
        mpl.rcParams['figure.autolayout'] = True

        # Create a figure with two subplots.
        fig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=2)
        
        # Store the original positions of the subplots.
        original_positions = [ax.get_position().bounds for ax in axes]
        
        # Apply tight_layout with a notable w_pad parameter to ensure
        # it would have a visible effect if working correctly.
        fig.tight_layout(w_pad=10)
        
        # Verify if any changes occurred to the subplot positions.
        new_positions = [ax.get_position().bounds for ax in axes]

        # Expecting that 'tight_layout' adjustments should be ignored due to 'autolayout' 
        # However, if new_positions != original_positions, it indicates the issue might have been fixed.
        if np.array_equal(original_positions, new_positions):
            raise AssertionError("tight_layout kwargs had no effect when 'figure.autolayout' is set, indicating the issue is present.")
        else:
            print("tight_layout's kwargs had an effect despite 'figure.autolayout' being set, indicating the issue may be fixed.")
            exit(0)

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script sets up an environment to replicate the issue reported with Matplotlib version 1.5.3, where `tight_layout` adjustments are expected to be ignored due to `autolayout` being set. Upon executing this script:

- It will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present (i.e., `tight_layout` adjustments are ignored).
- It successfully exits with code 0 if the issue is not encountered (indicating a potential fix or difference in behavior in the tested environment versus the reported environment).
- Utilizes the provided `print_stacktrace` function to clearly output any caught `Exception` details, enabling easier debugging and verification of the specific issue encountered.
