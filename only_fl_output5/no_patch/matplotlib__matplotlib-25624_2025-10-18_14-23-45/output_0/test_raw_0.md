This script first configures matplotlib to use autolayout through `mpl.rcParams['figure.autolayout'] = True`, which simulates the condition under which the bug appears as per the original issue description. It then creates a figure with two subplots and captures their positions before and after applying `tight_layout` with specified padding. If `tight_layout` does not have the intended effect (i.e., the subplot positions remain unchanged), the assertion fails, triggering the `print_stacktrace` function to output a detailed traceback. If the bug is fixed, the positions will change as expected, and the script prints a confirmation message and exits gracefully with code `0`.
