If `tight_layout` does not have the intended effect (i.e., the subplot positions remain unchanged), the assertion fails, triggering the `print_stacktrace` function to output a detailed traceback. If the bug is fixed, the positions will change as expected, and the script prints a confirmation message and exits gracefully with code `0`."
