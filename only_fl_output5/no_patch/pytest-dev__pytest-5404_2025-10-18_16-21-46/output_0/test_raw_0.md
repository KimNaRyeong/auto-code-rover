Here is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` to recreate the `KeyError: '__wrapped__'` issue as described. This script aims to mimic the conditions under which the error would occur based on the provided description. Note that since the error seems to be related to a combination of `pytest`, the `sty` module, and how Python's introspection might interact with wrapped objects or functions during testing, we will emulate an environment that might provoke this error directly through execution rather than through `pytest` or `tox`.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_import_sty_and_inspect():
    try:
        from sty import fg  # This simulates the line causing issues.
        import inspect
        
        # Simulating inspection as done by pytest's doctest plugin which seems to be a part of the traceback.
        result = inspect.unwrap(fg)
        assert result is not None, "Unwrap should not fail"

    except KeyError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("KeyError: '__wrapped__' issue detected.") from None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_import_sty_and_inspect()
        print("No issue detected.")
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print(ae)
```

This script attempts to import the `sty` module and use the `inspect.unwrap()` function, as the error traceback suggests an issue related to unwrapping a potentially wrapped object. The `inspect.unwrap` call here is a simplification, intending to trigger the KeyError under similar conditions to those in your provided error message.

Execute this script in the environment described (Python 3.6.5 or 3.7.1, without any specific virtual environment) using the command line:

```bash
python3 reproducer.py
```

This script will either:

- Print a detailed stack trace of the `KeyError: '__wrapped__'` issue if it's still present, or
- Print "No issue detected." indicating the conditions to reproduce the error aren't met (potentially because the actual cause might be more complex or due to specific interactions within the test environment set up by `pytest` or `tox`).

Please note that this is an approximation for reproducing the issue. The exact replication might require closer conditions to those present during a `pytest` or `tox` test run, which may involve more intricate setup or teardown procedures, mocking, or other interactions with the testing framework that aren't fully replicated here.
