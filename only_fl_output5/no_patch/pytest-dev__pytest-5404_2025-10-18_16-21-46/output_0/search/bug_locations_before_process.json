        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior in the adjustment or implementation of `pytest` hooks (`pytest_collection_modifyitems`) should ensure that any manipulation of test items or doctest items checks for and handles the existence of expected attributes safely. Specifically, when accessing or modifying attributes such as `__wrapped__`, the code should include checks to ensure the attribute exists, avoiding the `KeyError`."
