Given your recent test results indicating the issue wasn't reproduced using the previous approach and the need for a more targeted attempt to reproduce the `KeyError: '__wrapped__'` in a standalone manner, let's revise the strategy. Since the problem is tied to how pytest collects and handles tests, possibly due to interactions with imported modules or their attributes, we can mimic a pytest-like collection process. This new approach directly confronts the issue related to `__wrapped__` handling, leveraging Python's inspection and potentially importing mechanisms that are more aligned with the pytest collection phase scenarios.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    # Simulating the import statement that leads to KeyError in pytest collection phase.
    from sty import fg
    
    # Mimicking a part of the collection process of pytest that might trigger KeyError: '__wrapped__'.
    # This includes accessing attributes in a way similar to pytest's introspection, like accessing docstrings.
    print(fg.__doc__)

    # If we reached this point, then the AttributeError did not occur as expected.
    # This suggests the issue might not solely be replicable through the direct interaction modeled here.
    print("No error encountered. `__wrapped__` attribute seems to be handled correctly or the issue lies elsewhere.")

except KeyError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit("AssertionError: Issue encountered with `__wrapped__` attribute.")

except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit("An unexpected exception occurred, which might provide insights into the issue.")
```

This script takes a more nuanced approach towards replicating the pytest environment by performing operations that could more closely mimic the conditions under which the error occurred, specifically targeting attribute access patterns that could lead to a `KeyError` related to `__wrapped__`.

- **If the issue is successfully reproduced**, the script will print the stack trace explicitly tied to the `KeyError: '__wrapped__'` and exit with a message indicating the assertion error due to the encountered issue.
- **If the issue doesn't manifest**, indicating the AttributeError did not occur, it might suggest that the problem's cause is more complex or indirectly related to the way pytest's collection process interacts with certain modules or their attributes. It calls for a deeper inspection beyond simple attribute access or might be specific to the testing framework's internal behaviors.

Please place this script in the root directory of your project and execute it with `python3 reproducer.py` to see whether it can simulate the conditions that trigger the issue seen during the pytest collection phase.
