But the first connection will not be closed by browser for very long time.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context to address the issue related to `runserver` failing to close connections with the `--nothreading` option, it would be beneficial to locate the implementation of the `runserver` command and its handling of threading and connections. Given the information in the issue, we know that the problem might lie within the WSGI server component or the command that initiates it, within a Django environment. Hence, the following API calls would be necessary:\n\n1. Search for the `runserver` command within the Django codebase to understand how it is structured and where the threading options are parsed and applied. Since `runserver` is a management command, it might not be directly associated with a class or method that is easily discerned without context. \n\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"runserver --nothreading\")\n    ```\n\n2. Understanding how the WSGI server is initiated and how connections are handled, especially with respect to the `--nothreading` option, is crucial. Thus, searching for where the WSGI server gets configured might yield relevant code sections. There could be direct references to WSGI configurations or socket handling code that is pertinent to this issue. Since we don't have a specific method name, searching for snippets related to WSGI configuration might be the next best step.\n\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"WSGI server configuration\")\n    search_code(\"socket\")\n    search_code(\"keep-alive\")\n    ```\n\nThese searches aim to pinpoint where in the codebase the threading options for the `runserver` command influence connection handling and how the WSGI server is configured with those options. Understanding these parts of the codebase is vital for addressing the issue described."
