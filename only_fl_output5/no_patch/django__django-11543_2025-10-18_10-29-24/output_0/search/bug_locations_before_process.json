Specifically, when running with `--nothreading`, the server must be capable of terminating or recycling keep-alive connections to prevent a single connection from monopolizing the server. This could involve checking if a connection should be closed after a request completes and explicitly closing it if necessary, while still preserving the ability for a developer to use keep-alive for performance reasons during development."

        "intended_behavior": "In the context of non-threaded server operation, this file should implement a strategy for efficiently managing keep-alive connections, preventing the server from hanging when multiple keep-alive connections are initiated by modern web browsers. This might involve setting a timeout on idle keep-alive connections in the non-threaded mode or implementing a mechanism to prioritize accepting new connections when the server is operating without threading. The solution should maintain server responsiveness and ensure that new incoming connections can be served even when older connections are kept alive by the client."
