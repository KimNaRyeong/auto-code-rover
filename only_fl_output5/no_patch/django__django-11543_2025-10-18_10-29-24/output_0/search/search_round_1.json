Given the information in the issue, we know that the problem might lie within the WSGI server component or the command that initiates it, within a Django environment. Hence, the following API calls would be necessary:\n\n1. Search for the `runserver` command within the Django codebase to understand how it is structured and where the threading options are parsed and applied. Since `runserver` is a management command, it might not be directly associated with a class or method that is easily discerned without context. \n\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"runserver --nothreading\")\n    ```\n\n2. Understanding how the WSGI server is initiated and how connections are handled, especially with respect to the `--nothreading` option, is crucial. Thus, searching for where the WSGI server gets configured might yield relevant code sections. There could be direct references to WSGI configurations or socket handling code that is pertinent to this issue. Since we don't have a specific method name, searching for snippets related to WSGI configuration might be the next best step.\n\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"WSGI server configuration\")\n    search_code(\"socket\")\n    search_code(\"keep-alive\")\n    ```\n\nThese searches aim to pinpoint where in the codebase the threading options for the `runserver` command influence connection handling and how the WSGI server is configured with those options. Understanding these parts of the codebase is vital for addressing the issue described."

Given that the search for \"runserver --nothreading\" and \"WSGI server configuration\" returned no results and the search for \"keep-alive\" was also unfruitful, our focus shifts to the snippets containing `socket`. Interestingly, the search for `socket` returned meaningful results, notably within files related to server and email functionalities. \n\n1. **`django/core/management/commands/runserver.py`**  \n    - This file likely contains the implementation of the `runserver` command. The presence of `socket` related code here indicates this file could handle network connections, which is directly relevant to the issued behavior where multiple connections from the browser lead to the server not responding correctly under `--nothreading` option.\n    - **Relationship to the bug:** The code in this file is probably where Django sets up its development server, including how sockets are created, managed, and closed. Since the issue involves the server not responding when `--nothreading` is specified, it's possible there's a problem in how sockets are being handled in this non-threaded mode.\n    - **Intended behavior:** Ideally, even when `--nothreading` is specified, the server should efficiently manage multiple connections, possibly reusing or correctly closing sockets as needed to prevent hanging.\n\n2. **`django/core/servers/basehttp.py`**\n    - This file contains 7 matches for `socket`, indicating substantial interaction with socket programming, which could include opening, binding, listening, and closing socket connections. This is very likely where the lower-level handling of HTTP requests and connections occurs.\n    - **Relationship to the bug:** Due to the nature of the issue, which involves connections not being closed and causing the server to stop responding, the handling of sockets in this file is crucial. It could demonstrate that the keep-alive connections are not being managed correctly in the context of `--nothreading`.\n    - **Intended behavior:** This file should ensure that all connections, especially keep-alive connections, are handled appropriately \u2014 allowing new connections to be processed smoothly even when older ones are kept alive, particularly in scenarios where threading isn't utilized.\n\nBased on this analysis, our next steps should include a closer look at how connections and sockets are managed in `runserver.py` and `basehttp.py`, especially under the `--nothreading` option. The aim is to identify any code paths that might not be correctly handling the keep-alive connections or improperly managing the socket lifecycle in the absence of threading.\n\nTo proceed, a detailed inspection of the related sections in `django/core/management/commands/runserver.py` and `django/core/servers/basehttp.py` will be necessary to understand the current implementation and devise a targeted solution or patch for the issue. Considering the information at hand, we should:\n\n- Investigate how `runserver.py` handles the `--nothreading` option in relation to opening and closing connections.\n- Examine `basehttp.py` to understand the low-level socket operations, particularly how keep-alive connections are managed or terminated.\n\nTo achieve this, let's specifically look at code around the socket usage in `django/core/management/commands/runserver.py` and `django/core/servers/basehttp.py`. We should conduct a more focused search or fetch code from these files where `socket` is mentioned to get clarity on their roles in this issue."

Specifically, when running with `--nothreading`, the server must be capable of terminating or recycling keep-alive connections to prevent a single connection from monopolizing the server. This could involve checking if a connection should be closed after a request completes and explicitly closing it if necessary, while still preserving the ability for a developer to use keep-alive for performance reasons during development.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**  \n    - **File:** `django/core/servers/basehttp.py`  \n    - **Intended Behavior:** In the context of non-threaded server operation, this file should implement a strategy for efficiently managing keep-alive connections, preventing the server from hanging when multiple keep-alive connections are initiated by modern web browsers. This might involve setting a timeout on idle keep-alive connections in the non-threaded mode or implementing a mechanism to prioritize accepting new connections when the server is operating without threading. The solution should maintain server responsiveness and ensure that new incoming connections can be served even when older connections are kept alive by the client."
