runserver fails to close connection if --nothreading specified.

Client: Chrome 75.0.3770.100/Firefox 67.0.4 on macOS 10.14.5.
Server: macOS 10.14.5., Python 3.7.3, Django 2.2.3
Running runserver with the --nothreading option may stop responding.
This is because Web browser uses multiple connection, and all of them has Connection: keep-alive header by default.
When the first request is finished, wsgi server continue to read the socket first request used because the connection is keep-alive.
So, the second connection is kept waiting without accepted by wsgi server, until the fist connection is closed. But the first connection will not be closed by browser for very long time.
