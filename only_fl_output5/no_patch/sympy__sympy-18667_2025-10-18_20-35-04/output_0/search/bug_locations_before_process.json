        "intended_behavior": "Implement a new method `computeSchurNumber` within the `Partition` class. This method should define and execute the logic to calculate the Schur Number, S(k), which entails partitioning the interval [1, n] into k sum-free sets and identifying the largest possible n for these conditions. This method should effectively utilize the existing partition logic provided by the `Partition.partition` method while extending it to accommodate the requirements for identifying sum-free sets and maximizing n for any given k values. The implementation should ensure that the extension preserves the original partition functionality and seamlessly integrates with the broader mathematical and partition-focused utilities of the library."
