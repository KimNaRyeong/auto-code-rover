This might indicate that the feature is entirely new, and none of the scaffolding has been indexed yet or the names of the methods and classes involved differed from what was expected.\n\nGiven the issue description about adding a new feature related to Schur Numbers, including partition logic and test cases, there are a few steps we can take next:\n\n1. **Examine Related Methods and Classes:** The `partition` method has multiple occurrences across different files in the Sympy project, which suggests it's a general utility or functionality within the project. These locations likely provide general functionalities that could be leveraged or extended by the new feature. However, without a direct reference to Schur Numbers or the proposed logic for induction, it's difficult to assess the relationship to the issue. The lack of reference to Schur Numbers in the found `partition` methods may indicate the need for a new implementation specific to Schur Numbers.\n\n2. **Explore Schur Number Related Implementations:** Given the mathematical nature of Schur Numbers, exploring existing classes and methods that deal with mathematical partitions or number theory within the project could provide insights. Since the specific search for a SchurNumber class or related calculation methods returned no results, we may need to look into more general mathematical or combinatorial functionality within the project:\n   \n   - search_class(\"Combinatorics\")\n   - search_method_in_file(\"partition\", \"sympy/combinatorics/partitions.py\")\n\n3. **Locate Test Cases:** The inability to find test cases through a direct search for \"test Schur Number\" suggests that the naming conventions for the tests might differ or that the tests might be part of a larger testing framework or file:\n   \n   - search_code_in_file(\"Schur\", \"test_combinatorics.py\") \u2013 Assuming that tests related to combinatorial features, like partitions or Schur Numbers, would reside in a file that generally houses combinatorics tests.\n   \n4. **General Sympy Utility Exploration:** Since Sympy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics, it's possible that the feature involving Schur Numbers might use or extend existing symbolic or numeric utilities:\n   \n   - search_method_in_file(\"is_sum_free\", \"sympy/utilities/iterables.py\") \u2013 Hypothetically looking for a method that could be part of checking sum-free sets, which is relevant to partitioning sets in the context of Schur Numbers.\n\nThrough these steps, we aim to gather more context around mathematical combinatorics, partition logic, and possibly sum-free sets within the codebase, helping to piece together how the new Schur Number feature might integrate or need to be implemented."
