2676       function will return a parametric solution in terms of the given
2677       symbols. Those that are free will be returned unchanged. e.g. in
2678       the system below, `z` is returned as the solution for variable z;

</code><intended_behavior>The `linsolve` method should handle floating-point coefficients in a manner that ensures numerical stability and consistency in solutions, especially for nearly equivalent systems of equations. Considering the issue arises possibly due to the way floating-point arithmetic is handled, one intended behavior improvement could be the introduction of a numerical threshold that treats very close coefficients as equivalent or employs a more robust method for comparing floating-point numbers. This would preserve existing functionality while improving the method's ability to provide consistent solutions for systems that are mathematically equivalent but represented with slight numerical differences in their coefficients. Additionally, enhancing error checks or warnings when potentially unstable numeric conditions are detected could guide users in troubleshooting or reformulating their equation systems for better stability with floating-point arithmetic.</intended_behavior>]
