        "content": "To address the issue mentioned, we should gather more information about the `frac_field` method and the class it belongs to. The problem seems to revolve around the mathematical operation or property that involves fractions, possibly within a symbolic mathematics library such as SymPy. The issue suggests that when attempting to include `1/x` in a certain fractional field (potentially related to rational numbers or algebraic structures), it does not behave as expected. Based on this, we would want to focus on:\n\n1. Identifying the class that contains the `frac_field` method, as it is not explicitly given.\n2. Gathering code context around the `frac_field` method within its class to understand how it's supposed to work with elements like `1/x`.\n\nGiven these objectives, the following API calls would be useful:\n\n- `search_method(\"frac_field\")`: This will help us identify the class or classes that contain the `frac_field` method. Understanding in which classes this method is defined can give us insight into its purpose and potential issues.\n- `search_code(\"QQ.frac_field(1/x)\")`: Since the issue specifically mentions `QQ.frac_field(1/x)`, searching for this code snippet in the entire codebase could provide us with examples of its usage or potentially flawed implementations that need to be examined.\n\nThese API calls aim to collect enough context around the `frac_field` method and its usage, especially regarding the reported issue. This information will be crucial for understanding the bug and planning the next steps for its resolution."
