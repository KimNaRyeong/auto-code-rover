        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior within the `FractionField` class would involve ensuring that expressions like `1/x` are correctly included and represented in the fraction field. This may require implementing or modifying existing methods to better handle symbolic expressions or polynomial denominators:\n- Ensure that when an expression like `1/x` is added or included within a `FractionField` instance, it is accurately represented in the field's underlying structure, allowing for correct arithmetic and algebraic operations.\n- Update or add methods for better handling and normalization of fractions within the field, especially focusing on symbolic expressions that may not currently be managed correctly.\n- Preserve the existing functionality of the `FractionField`, ensuring that any changes do not detrimentally affect the handling of other elements or the field's algebraic properties.\n- Ensure compatibility with the broader SymPy library's ecosystem, particularly with how fractions and expressions are represented and manipulated across different domains and fields.\n\nThis approach targets enhancing `FractionField`'s ability to manage complex algebraic expressions, potentially resolving the reported issue without compromising the class's existing functionalities."
