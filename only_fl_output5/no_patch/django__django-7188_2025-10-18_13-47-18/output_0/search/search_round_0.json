        "content": "To tackle this issue, I will need to gather more context about the two main components mentioned in the issue: the `AuthenticationMiddleware` and the `auth context processor`. Specifically, I would need to understand how they are implemented and how they currently depend on the `django.contrib.auth` app being in `INSTALLED_APPS`. Here are the necessary API calls to gather this context:\n\n1. Search for the `AuthenticationMiddleware` class to understand how it's implemented and to check for any direct dependencies on other parts of the `django.contrib.auth` app.\n   - `search_class(\"AuthenticationMiddleware\")`\n\n2. Search for the implementation of the `auth` context processor to see how it interacts with the `django.contrib.auth` app.\n   - `search_method(\"auth\")`\n\n3. Given that we are also interested in ensuring that these components do not require `django.contrib.auth` to be in `INSTALLED_APPS`, searching for code snippets that check for `django.contrib.auth` in `INSTALLED_APPS` might provide insights into current checks.\n   - `search_code(\"django.contrib.auth in INSTALLED_APPS\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for understanding the dependencies and implementations of the authentication middleware and context processor and how they might be used without `django.contrib.auth` being in `INSTALLED_APPS`."
