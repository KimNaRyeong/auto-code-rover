        "intended_behavior": "The current implementation should be modified to dynamically import `AnonymousUser` in a way that does not fail if `django.contrib.auth` is not installed. A possible solution could involve a try-except block around the import statement for `AnonymousUser`. In the except block, a minimal fallback implementation of an anonymous user could be provided, or the application could be configured to handle the absence of an anonymous user in a manner that does not disrupt the application's overall functionality. Alternatively, checking for the presence of `django.contrib.auth` before attempting the import and adjusting the functionality accordingly could be another approach. This ensures that the context processor can function independently of the `django.contrib.auth` app's presence in `INSTALLED_APPS`, maintaining the existing functionality of providing user and permissions context to templates while allowing greater flexibility in Django project configurations."
