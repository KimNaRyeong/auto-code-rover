        "content": "<issue>Add support for adding non-key columns to indexes\nDescription\n(last modified by Hannes Ljungberg)\nPostgres got support for the INCLUDE clause in CREATE INDEX. This can be used to add non-key columns to the index.\nCREATE INDEX idx\nON t1 ( col1 )\nINCLUDE ( col2 );\nThis allows for Index Only Scans on queries like:\nSELECT col1, col2 FROM t1 WHERE t1 = 'foo';\nMore info:\n\u200bhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createindex.html\n\u200bhttps://use-the-index-luke.com/blog/2019-04/include-columns-in-btree-indexes\n\u200bhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-index-only-scans.html\nThe idea is to add an additional kwarg to Index to support this:\nIndex(\nname='some-idx',\nfields=['headline'],\ninclude=['pub_date']\n)\nOne of the biggest possibilities of this feature is to add included columns to unique indexes and use them to perform Index Only Scans. This would require adding the same kwarg to UniqueConstraint. The implementation would be a lot like the condition kwargs to both Index and UniqueConstraint.\nAt the moment the only Django-supported database that can use this feature is Postgres but it's also supported by Microsoft SQL Server and IBM Db2 with the same syntax. Because of this I think it shouldn't be implemented as a postgres only feature but exposed on BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor to ease the adding of support when/if sqlite or mariadb/mysql get it.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, I need to gather information from the Django project about the `Index` and `UniqueConstraint` classes, as well as any methods that might be involved in adding fields and includes to these index types. It's also essential to look into the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class to understand how it can support the new `INCLUDE` feature for indexes. Here are the API calls I will make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Index\")`: To get information on where the `Index` class is defined and its current implementation details.\n2. `search_class(\"UniqueConstraint\")`: To locate the `UniqueConstraint` class and its current functionalities.\n3. `search_class(\"BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor\")`: To find where the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class is defined and understand its structure and methods, particularly those related to handling indexes.\n\nThese calls should provide a solid starting point for understanding how indexes are currently implemented and where to add the new functionality."
