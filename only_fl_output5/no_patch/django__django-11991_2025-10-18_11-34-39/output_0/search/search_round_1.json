This can be used to add non-key columns to the index.\nCREATE INDEX idx\nON t1 ( col1 )\nINCLUDE ( col2 );\nThis allows for Index Only Scans on queries like:\nSELECT col1, col2 FROM t1 WHERE t1 = 'foo';\nMore info:\n\u200bhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createindex.html\n\u200bhttps://use-the-index-luke.com/blog/2019-04/include-columns-in-btree-indexes\n\u200bhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-index-only-scans.html\nThe idea is to add an additional kwarg to Index to support this:\nIndex(\nname='some-idx',\nfields=['headline'],\ninclude=['pub_date']\n)\nOne of the biggest possibilities of this feature is to add included columns to unique indexes and use them to perform Index Only Scans. This would require adding the same kwarg to UniqueConstraint. The implementation would be a lot like the condition kwargs to both Index and UniqueConstraint.\nAt the moment the only Django-supported database that can use this feature is Postgres but it's also supported by Microsoft SQL Server and IBM Db2 with the same syntax. Because of this I think it shouldn't be implemented as a postgres only feature but exposed on BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor to ease the adding of support when/if sqlite or mariadb/mysql get it.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context reveals the structure and capabilities of Django's `Index`, `UniqueConstraint`, and `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` classes, which are central to addressing the issue described. Here's an analysis based on the questions posed:\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\n- **Index Class (`django/db/models/indexes.py`):** This class handles the creation of database indexes. It allows specifying fields to be included in the index and contains methods for generating SQL statements to create and remove the index. Key methods include `create_sql`, which generates the SQL for index creation, and `__init__`, which initializes the index with specified fields and options.\n\n- **UniqueConstraint Class (`django/db/models/constraints.py`):** Handles the creation of unique constraints. It is similar to the `Index` class but enforces uniqueness across the specified fields. Its methods, like `create_sql`, generate SQL for adding and removing unique constraints.\n\n- **BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor Class (`django/db/backends/base/schema.py`):** A class that abstracts database operations, such as creating tables, adding columns, and creating indexes and constraints. It provides lower-level methods that the `Index` and `UniqueConstraint` classes use to interact with the database.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue requests the addition of non-key columns to indexes using the `INCLUDE` syntax, a feature supported by PostgreSQL (and other databases like SQL Server and Db2) to enhance Index Only Scans by including extra columns in the index without making them part of the key. This feature is not directly supported in Django's current implementation of the `Index` and `UniqueConstraint` classes or in the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class that would generate the actual SQL statements.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\n- **For the `Index` class:** It should accept an additional `include` keyword argument in its `__init__` method to specify non-key columns that should be included in the index. Its `create_sql` method must be adjusted to generate SQL that includes these extra columns using the `INCLUDE` clause.\n\n- **For the `UniqueConstraint` class:** Similar adjustments are needed to support the `include` argument, allowing non-key columns to be part of unique constraints without enforcing uniqueness on these included columns.\n\n- **In the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class:** Changes are required to support generating the correct SQL for creating indexes and unique constraints with included columns. Specifically, the `sql_create_index` and potentially other related SQL template strings and methods (`_create_index_sql`, `_create_unique_sql`, etc.) need to be updated to handle the `INCLUDE` clause.\n\nTo implement the feature, the development path involves modifying these three classes to support the new `include` argument, and ensuring that the SQL generation logic correctly incorporates this argument into the `CREATE INDEX` and `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` statements while considering cross-database support and backward compatibility."

Bug Locations:\n\n**Location 1:**\n- File: `django/db/models/indexes.py`\n- Class: `Index`\n- Intended Behavior: Modify the `__init__` method to accept an additional keyword argument `include`, which is a list of fields to be included in the index but not as key columns. Modify the `create_sql` method to generate SQL that appends the `INCLUDE` clause with the specified non-key columns. This change should preserve the existing functionality for databases that do not support the `INCLUDE` feature, defaulting to traditional index behavior in such cases.\n\n**Location 2:**\n- File: `django/db/models/constraints.py`\n- Class: `UniqueConstraint`\n- Intended Behavior: Similar to the `Index` class, the `UniqueConstraint` class's `__init__` method should be updated to accept an `include` argument. The `create_sql` method must be adapted to incorporate the `INCLUDE` clause when generating SQL for unique constraints. The implementation should ensure that this feature is optional and that the existing functionality remains intact for databases or scenarios where `INCLUDE` is not used or supported.\n\n**Location 3:**\n- File: `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`\n- Class: `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`\n- Intended Behavior: Update the class to support generating the correct SQL for indexes and unique constraints that include non-key columns. This could involve modifying or extending methods such as `_create_index_sql`, `_create_unique_sql`, and any other relevant method that prepares SQL statements for creating indexes and unique constraints, to detect and correctly handle the `INCLUDE` clause. The changes should maintain backward compatibility and should not affect the generation of SQL for indexes and constraints without included columns.\n\nIn each of these locations, the intended behavior seeks to expand the functionality of Django's model indexing and constraints to leverage advanced database features for performance optimization, without disrupting the current capabilities and expectations of the framework's ORM."
