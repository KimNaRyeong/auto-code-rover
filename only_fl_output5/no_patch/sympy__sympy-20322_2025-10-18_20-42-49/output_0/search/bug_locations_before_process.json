        "intended_behavior": "The `sympify` method needs to ensure consistent handling of the `evaluate` parameter, especially in cases involving functions like `ceiling`. The intended behavior here would be to ensure that when `evaluate=False`, expressions like `4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)` are kept unevaluated in a consistent manner across versions. This could involve inspecting how the AST transformation is applied when `evaluate=False` and ensuring that the logic does not inadvertently simplify or alter the structure of expressions involving `ceiling`. Additionally, it would be crucial to preserve existing functionalities for all other expressions and use cases, ensuring that any adjustments made do not affect the broader utility of `sympify`."

        "intended_behavior": "The `simplify` method(s) should exhibit consistent behavior when dealing with expressions passed from `sympify` with `evaluate=False`. This means ensuring that expressions involving `ceiling` are simplified appropriately without assuming that the expression has been pre-evaluated unless specified. The resolution would require a thorough review of how `simplify` interacts with expressions marked as unevaluated by `sympify` to identify any logic that might differ in handling such cases between SymPy versions 1.5.1 and 1.6.2. The goal would be to maintain the integrity of unevaluated expressions throughout the simplification process, ensuring consistent outcomes regardless of version changes."
