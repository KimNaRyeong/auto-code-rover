As I have [PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/) annotations (because I use `attrs`), I did not add types in the docstring., as per the style guide.\nWhen generating the documentation with `.. automodule::` from `autodoc`, with `napoleon`, the attributes are not typed. I tried using the `:undoc-members:` flag of `automodule`, but this resulted in duplicated attributes: one with the explanation, the other with the type-hint.\nWhile it is possible to not use type hints with `attrs` and replace `attr.s(auto_attribs=True)` by `attr.ib()`, this is not an option for e.g. [`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html). I also tried `napoleon_use_ivar=True`, which silenced sphinx's warnings but still resulted in two definition of the attribute in the documentation.\nIt would be nice if `napoleon` (or `autodoc`) extracted the type hint of the class, or merged the attributes when using `:undoc-members:`. That would avoid duplicated types definitions in either the code or the doc. Currently, either the code has an annotation and a type in the docstring, or the generated documentation has two entry for each attribute.\nThis might be related to #7582  and #4074 .\n**Additional info**\n- sphinx version `3.2.1`\n- [`conf.py`](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/docs/conf.py)\n- [code being autodocumented](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/src/pheres/exceptions.py)\n</issue>"

This necessitates a different approach to gathering the necessary context.\n\n**Next Steps for Context Gathering:**\n\n1. **General Sphinx Configuration and Use of Napoleon/Autodoc:**\n   Since we couldn't access the specific `conf.py`, exploring how Sphinx, Napoleon, and Autodoc are typically configured in Python projects can offer foundational insights. This can still provide us with clues about how these tools are supposed to interact with Python type hints and how they might fail to do so, given the described issue.\n\n2. **Understanding `attrs` and Python Type Annotations:**\n   The issue revolves around duplicate attributes in documentation when using `attrs` with type annotations. Investigating more generally how `attrs` are documented in Sphinx using Napoleon and Autodoc could hint at common pitfalls or undocumented features that might lead to the observed behavior.\n\nGiven these considerations, here are revised API calls that might offer useful insights despite the direct references being unavailable:\n\n- **Search API Calls for General Sphinx, Napoleon, and Autodoc Configuration:**\n  We aim to find any snippet or documentation practice examples in the project that relate to Napoleon, Autodoc, and possibly type hints.\n  - `search_code(\"napoleon\")`\n  - `search_code(\"autodoc\")`\n\n- **Search for Any Usage of `attrs` in the Project:**\n  This can help understand how `attrs` and type annotations are typically handled in the project's codebase.\n  - `search_code(\"attr.s\")`\n  - `search_code(\"@attr.s\")`\n\n- **Search for Dataclasses Documentation Practices:**\n  The issue mentions that the solution should also be applicable to dataclasses, hence understanding their documentation patterns could be insightful.\n  - `search_code(\"dataclasses\")`\n\nThese searches aim to provide a broad view of how Sphinx documentation is configured and used within the project, especially regarding `attrs` and type annotations, which are central to the reported issue."

        "content": "Given the inability to access specific configurations and code examples directly related to the issue, it's challenging to pinpoint exact bug locations or suggest clear intended behaviors without assumptions. However, based on the issue description and common practices around Sphinx, Napoleon, Autodoc, `attrs`, and type annotations, we can infer the following general direction for potential bug locations and their intended behaviors:\n\n### 1. Do we need more context?\n\n- **Yes**, specific API calls to search for generic practices around Sphinx, Napoleon, Autodoc configurations, and examples of `attrs` or dataclasses might still be needed. However, since the platform doesn't return results from the specified locations and respects the instructions not to issue more calls without certainty, we proceed to infer potential bug locations and their intended behaviors based on standard practices and the issue's description.\n\n### 2. Where are bug locations:\n\nWithout access to the specific `conf.py`, and `exceptions.py` files, and considering the platform\u2019s response, an exact bug location can\u2019t be pinpointed. However, locations that typically would need fixing in a scenario like this include:\n\n- **Location 1:**\n  - **File:** (Assumed) `conf.py` within the `docs` directory.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Ensure Sphinx's `conf.py` is configured to automatically detect type hints in attributes when using `napoleon` and `autodoc`. This might involve adjusting settings like `napoleon_use_ivar` or introducing custom extensions or logic to merge attribute documentation with type hints from the source code to avoid duplicate entries.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** (Assumed) `exceptions.py` or any file within the `src/pheres` directory containing `attrs`-decorated classes used with Sphinx documentation.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Classes should be annotated in a way that allows Sphinx to correctly parse and document attribute types from the source code without requiring redundant type specifications in the docstrings. This might involve implementing or adjusting docstring formats or adopting specific Sphinx extensions/tools that improve the integration of `attrs`, type hints, and Sphinx.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe core issue reported involves the Sphinx documentation generation process, specifically with Napoleon and Autodoc, not correctly handling or merging `attrs` attribute documentation with Python type annotations. The intended behavior, broadly speaking, is to adapt the Sphinx configuration and possibly the format of docstrings or annotations in the code to ensure that Sphinx generates documentation that includes attribute types directly from the source code annotations without duplicates. This would likely involve adjustments to `conf.py` for project-wide Sphinx behavior and potentially minor adjustments to how attributes are documented in code files using `attrs` and type annotations.\n\nFurther investigation with direct access to the codebase and Sphinx configuration is needed to provide more specific solutions."
