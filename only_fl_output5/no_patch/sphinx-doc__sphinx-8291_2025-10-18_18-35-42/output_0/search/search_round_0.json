        "content": "<issue>[Napoleon] Retrieve type of attributes from type hints when using google-style\nFollowing [google style guide for classes](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#384-classes), I added an `Attributes:` section my classes docstring. As I have [PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/) annotations (because I use `attrs`), I did not add types in the docstring., as per the style guide.\nWhen generating the documentation with `.. automodule::` from `autodoc`, with `napoleon`, the attributes are not typed. I tried using the `:undoc-members:` flag of `automodule`, but this resulted in duplicated attributes: one with the explanation, the other with the type-hint.\nWhile it is possible to not use type hints with `attrs` and replace `attr.s(auto_attribs=True)` by `attr.ib()`, this is not an option for e.g. [`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html). I also tried `napoleon_use_ivar=True`, which silenced sphinx's warnings but still resulted in two definition of the attribute in the documentation.\nIt would be nice if `napoleon` (or `autodoc`) extracted the type hint of the class, or merged the attributes when using `:undoc-members:`. That would avoid duplicated types definitions in either the code or the doc. Currently, either the code has an annotation and a type in the docstring, or the generated documentation has two entry for each attribute.\nThis might be related to #7582  and #4074 .\n**Additional info**\n- sphinx version `3.2.1`\n- [`conf.py`](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/docs/conf.py)\n- [code being autodocumented](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/src/pheres/exceptions.py)\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to analyze both the Sphinx configuration and the code that is being automatically documented, specifically looking at how `napoleon` and `autodoc` are used in relation to type hints and the `attrs` library. Let's break down what we'll search for:\n\n1. **Sphinx configuration** - The `conf.py` file in the project, as this will give us insights into how `napoleon` and `autodoc` are configured, which is crucial for understanding the root of the documentation issue.\n   \n2. **The code being auto-documented** - Specifically, classes in the `exceptions.py` file that utilize `attrs` and where the documentation generation issue is occurring.\n\nBased on this breakdown, I will execute the following API calls for the necessary information:\n\n1. **Search for the Sphinx configuration file** to examine any settings related to `napoleon` and `autodoc`: \n   - `search_code_in_file(\"napoleon\", \"docs/conf.py\")` - To get the configuration related to `napoleon`.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"autodoc\", \"docs/conf.py\")` - To check how `autodoc` is configured.\n\n2. **Search for classes within the specific file mentioned in the issue** to see how they are documented and how attributes are defined using `attrs`:\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"PheresBaseException\", \"src/pheres/exceptions.py\")` - This is a hypothetical class based on the context of `exceptions.py`. We are interested in any class to see how attributes are documented.\n   \nBy analyzing these details, we will gather sufficient context to understand how the documentation is being generated and identify potential solutions for the issue at hand."
