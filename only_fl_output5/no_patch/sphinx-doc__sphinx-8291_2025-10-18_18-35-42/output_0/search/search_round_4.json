As I have [PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/) annotations (because I use `attrs`), I did not add types in the docstring., as per the style guide.\nWhen generating the documentation with `.. automodule::` from `autodoc`, with `napoleon`, the attributes are not typed. I tried using the `:undoc-members:` flag of `automodule`, but this resulted in duplicated attributes: one with the explanation, the other with the type-hint.\nWhile it is possible to not use type hints with `attrs` and replace `attr.s(auto_attribs=True)` by `attr.ib()`, this is not an option for e.g. [`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html). I also tried `napoleon_use_ivar=True`, which silenced sphinx's warnings but still resulted in two definition of the attribute in the documentation.\nIt would be nice if `napoleon` (or `autodoc`) extracted the type hint of the class, or merged the attributes when using `:undoc-members:`. That would avoid duplicated types definitions in either the code or the doc. Currently, either the code has an annotation and a type in the docstring, or the generated documentation has two entry for each attribute.\nThis might be related to #7582  and #4074 .\n**Additional info**\n- sphinx version `3.2.1`\n- [`conf.py`](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/docs/conf.py)\n- [code being autodocumented](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/src/pheres/exceptions.py)\n</issue>"

This necessitates a different approach to gathering the necessary context.\n\n**Next Steps for Context Gathering:**\n\n1. **General Sphinx Configuration and Use of Napoleon/Autodoc:**\n   Since we couldn't access the specific `conf.py`, exploring how Sphinx, Napoleon, and Autodoc are typically configured in Python projects can offer foundational insights. This can still provide us with clues about how these tools are supposed to interact with Python type hints and how they might fail to do so, given the described issue.\n\n2. **Understanding `attrs` and Python Type Annotations:**\n   The issue revolves around duplicate attributes in documentation when using `attrs` with type annotations. Investigating more generally how `attrs` are documented in Sphinx using Napoleon and Autodoc could hint at common pitfalls or undocumented features that might lead to the observed behavior.\n\nGiven these considerations, here are revised API calls that might offer useful insights despite the direct references being unavailable:\n\n- **Search API Calls for General Sphinx, Napoleon, and Autodoc Configuration:**\n  We aim to find any snippet or documentation practice examples in the project that relate to Napoleon, Autodoc, and possibly type hints.\n  - `search_code(\"napoleon\")`\n  - `search_code(\"autodoc\")`\n\n- **Search for Any Usage of `attrs` in the Project:**\n  This can help understand how `attrs` and type annotations are typically handled in the project's codebase.\n  - `search_code(\"attr.s\")`\n  - `search_code(\"@attr.s\")`\n\n- **Search for Dataclasses Documentation Practices:**\n  The issue mentions that the solution should also be applicable to dataclasses, hence understanding their documentation patterns could be insightful.\n  - `search_code(\"dataclasses\")`\n\nThese searches aim to provide a broad view of how Sphinx documentation is configured and used within the project, especially regarding `attrs` and type annotations, which are central to the reported issue."

However, based on the issue description and common practices around Sphinx, Napoleon, Autodoc, `attrs`, and type annotations, we can infer the following general direction for potential bug locations and their intended behaviors:\n\n### 1. Do we need more context?\n\n- **Yes**, specific API calls to search for generic practices around Sphinx, Napoleon, Autodoc configurations, and examples of `attrs` or dataclasses might still be needed. However, since the platform doesn't return results from the specified locations and respects the instructions not to issue more calls without certainty, we proceed to infer potential bug locations and their intended behaviors based on standard practices and the issue's description.\n\n### 2. Where are bug locations:\n\nWithout access to the specific `conf.py`, and `exceptions.py` files, and considering the platform\u2019s response, an exact bug location can\u2019t be pinpointed. However, locations that typically would need fixing in a scenario like this include:\n\n- **Location 1:**\n  - **File:** (Assumed) `conf.py` within the `docs` directory.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Ensure Sphinx's `conf.py` is configured to automatically detect type hints in attributes when using `napoleon` and `autodoc`. This might involve adjusting settings like `napoleon_use_ivar` or introducing custom extensions or logic to merge attribute documentation with type hints from the source code to avoid duplicate entries.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** (Assumed) `exceptions.py` or any file within the `src/pheres` directory containing `attrs`-decorated classes used with Sphinx documentation.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Classes should be annotated in a way that allows Sphinx to correctly parse and document attribute types from the source code without requiring redundant type specifications in the docstrings. This might involve implementing or adjusting docstring formats or adopting specific Sphinx extensions/tools that improve the integration of `attrs`, type hints, and Sphinx.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe core issue reported involves the Sphinx documentation generation process, specifically with Napoleon and Autodoc, not correctly handling or merging `attrs` attribute documentation with Python type annotations. The intended behavior, broadly speaking, is to adapt the Sphinx configuration and possibly the format of docstrings or annotations in the code to ensure that Sphinx generates documentation that includes attribute types directly from the source code annotations without duplicates. This would likely involve adjustments to `conf.py` for project-wide Sphinx behavior and potentially minor adjustments to how attributes are documented in code files using `attrs` and type annotations.\n\nFurther investigation with direct access to the codebase and Sphinx configuration is needed to provide more specific solutions."

However, the described issue implies a need for changes in how documentation is generated by Sphinx, particularly in handling Python type annotations and `attrs`-defined class attributes within the scope of Sphinx's Napoleon and Autodoc extensions.\n\nSince specific code or configurations cannot be accessed, and further API calls for context are not yielding results, here's an inferred approach to addressing the issue based on common practices and the described problem:\n\n### Suggested Steps to Address the Issue:\n\n1. **Review Sphinx Configuration:**\n   Without direct access to `conf.py`, one would typically review the Sphinx configuration to ensure it's set up to handle type annotations and `attrs` efficiently. This includes checking for and potentially adjusting options related to `napoleon` and `autodoc`, such as `napoleon_use_ivar` or `autodoc_typehints`.\n\n2. **Custom Sphinx Extension or Adjustment:**\n   If Sphinx's default behavior doesn't merge type hints with attribute documentation in a satisfying manner, developing a custom Sphinx extension or adjusting existing tooling to explicitly support this feature may be necessary. This extension would ideally introspect classes defined with `attrs` (or standard Python classes with annotations), extracting type information and ensuring it's represented once and accurately in the generated documentation.\n\n3. **Collaboration with Sphinx or Python Community:**\n   Given the described issue touches on common tools (Sphinx, `attrs`, Python type annotations), reaching out to the Sphinx or `attrs` communities might reveal existing solutions or workarounds. Additionally, this problem could encourage contributions towards enhancing these tools to better support scenarios like the one described.\n\n4. **Documentation and Code Best Practices:**\n   Until a technical solution is implemented, adopting a documentation practice that minimizes the impact of the issue, such as a specific way of documenting `attrs` attributes or a guideline for combining docstrings with type annotations, might be a temporary workaround. This would involve drafting guidelines for developers on how to document classes and attributes to ensure the most seamless integration with Sphinx.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWithout direct access or the ability to execute more targeted searches, these general steps offer a pathway towards addressing the documentation generation issue with `attrs` and Python type annotations in the context of Sphinx. Further, direct investigation into the Sphinx configuration (`conf.py`) and the specific codebase setup would be essential steps in formulating a precise solution."

However, based on the instructions, I will refrain from submitting new API calls without exact parameters.\n\n2. **Search for `attrs` Usage Patterns:**\n   - Similarly, searching for `attrs` usage patterns could illuminate general practices within the codebase that might relate to the issue. Since direct file access is currently not yielding results, focusing on broader usage patterns may provide clues.\n\n3. **Explore Documentation Practices:**\n   - Without direct examples from `exceptions.py`, examining how documentation is typically approached in the project could offer insights. This could involve looking for patterns in how attributes and type hints are documented across various classes, not necessarily limited to those utilizing `attrs`.\n\n### Next Steps and Recommendations\n\nGiven the constraints mentioned, my ability to invoke search API calls with specific arguments is limited. However, were it possible, these steps and thematic searches might provide valuable context. In lieu of direct search API results, addressing the issue may involve the following conceptual steps based on the issue's nature and common Sphinx documentation practices:\n\n- **Manual Review of Sphinx Configuration (`conf.py`):** Since specific configurations couldn't be retrieved, manually checking the project's Sphinx configuration for settings related to `napoleon` and `autodoc` might yield opportunities to adjust how attribute types are handled and presented.\n\n- **Custom Extension or Script:** Considering the possibility of creating a custom Sphinx extension or script that better integrates `attrs`-defined attributes with type annotations into the generated documentation, thereby preventing duplication and ensuring types are accurately reflected.\n\n- **Community Engagement and Research:** Engaging with the Sphinx, `attrs`, and broader Python documentation communities could provide additional workarounds, plugins, or extensions that have addressed similar issues.\n\nWithout the ability to directly execute or refine API calls based on given constraints, these recommendations offer a pathway based on understanding the issue's core and general practices around Sphinx documentation generation."
