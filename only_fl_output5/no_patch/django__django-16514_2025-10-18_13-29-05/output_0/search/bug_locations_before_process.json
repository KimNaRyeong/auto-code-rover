A plausible approach could involve adding an additional parameter or context to these methods that allows passing information about the AdminSite. This added information could be stored in the LogEntry in an indirect manner (e.g., stored in the change_message as a serialized dict or utilizing a custom field that can encode this context). The challenge is to do this in a backward-compatible way, ensuring that existing functionality remains intact while providing the necessary hooks or information for AdminSite-specific LogEntry filtering."

There may be value in exploring mechanisms within this method to implicitly or explicitly tag LogEntry instances with AdminSite identification upon registration or action logging. This implies a broader strategy of integrating AdminSite context awareness into actions logged via the ModelAdmin methods above."
