It is confusing for users to access a specific site and see log entries for models they can't access.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue mentioned, we need to focus on the Django Admin Site mechanism, specifically how LogEntries are handled across different AdminSite instances. Since the problem revolves around LogEntries being visible across all AdminSites regardless of the registered models, we should start by investigating the classes and methods related to LogEntry management and how AdminSites are set up to filter or display these entries.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to grasp how LogEntries are linked or managed within the Django admin framework. The `LogEntry` model is a good start. Secondly, understanding how `AdminSite` is implemented would provide insights into how models are registered and possibly how LogEntry filtering could be integrated or improved. Thus, the following API calls are pertinent:\n\n1. To understand how `LogEntry` is implemented and how it could potentially relate to specific AdminSites or models, we'll need to search for the `LogEntry` class.\n   - `search_class(\"LogEntry\")`\n\n2. To comprehend the customization and filtration capabilities, if any, within the `AdminSite` class especially regarding registration and logging of activities, it's imperative to delve into the `AdminSite` class.\n   - `search_class(\"AdminSite\")`\n\n3. Since the issue talks about filtering log entries by models registered to specific admin sites, it's plausible that methods dedicated to handling log entries, like creation or retrieval in relation to the admin site or registered models, could provide a lead. Searching for methods that could be directly related to log entries within the `AdminSite` might unveil how they're currently processed or point towards where modifications are necessary.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"log_entry\", \"AdminSite\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"get_queryset\", \"AdminSite\")` \n\nThese searches aim to gather context around how log entries and admin sites interact within Django's admin framework, which is instrumental in proposing a suitable patch to ensure that only relevant log entries are displayed per admin site, based on the models registered with it."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context about `LogEntry` and `AdminSite` from the Django Admin framework gives us some foundational insight into the issue at hand and how we might approach a solution.\n\n### LogEntry Class Analysis\n\nThe `LogEntry` class records admin actions on models. Key fields include:\n- `action_time`: When the action occurred.\n- `user`: The user who performed the action.\n- `content_type`: Links the entry to the type of object that was changed.\n- `object_id`: The ID of the object that was modified.\n- `action_flag`: Indicates the type of action performed (addition, change, deletion).\n- Additional utility methods like `is_addition()`, `is_change()`, and `is_deletion()` help in determining the nature of the log entry.\n\n#### Relationship to the Bug:\n\nThe issue mentions that all `LogEntry` records are shown across all `AdminSite` instances, irrespective of the models registered with them. The structure of `LogEntry` lacks an explicit link to `AdminSite`, which hints at why filtering based on the admin site is not happening. \n\n#### Intended Behavior:\n\nIdeally, `LogEntry` should somehow be aware of which AdminSite an action belongs to, enabling the filtering of log entries per `AdminSite` instance based on the models registered within that site.\n\n### AdminSite Class Analysis\n\nThe `AdminSite` class manages the administration site settings and functionality. It includes methods for registering models (`register()`), checking permissions (`has_permission()`), and rendering various admin pages (`index()`, `login()`, etc.). It acts as a central hub for all admin-related functionalities but, based on the provided context, does not have built-in methods specifically for handling or filtering `LogEntry` records based on the registered models or the AdminSite instance.\n\n#### Relationship to the Bug:\n\nGiven the AdminSite class manages the registration of models, it's a key area where enhancement is needed to tie `LogEntry` records to specific AdminSite instances or at least to allow filtering of log entries by the models registered to a particular `AdminSite`.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\n\nModifications are necessary either in `LogEntry` handling or within the `AdminSite` class to allow `LogEntry` records to be associated with or filtered by the `AdminSite` they pertain to. This could mean enhancing how `LogEntry` records are created or retrieved, potentially involving adjustments in `AdminSite` methods or an extension of the `LogEntry` model.\n\n### Moving Forward:\n\nGiven the lack of direct methods relating to `LogEntry` filtering in `AdminSite` and nonexistent connections between `LogEntry` instances and `AdminSite`s, several strategies could be considered:\n- Investigate how `LogEntry` instances are created (`log_addition`, `log_change`, `log_deletion` methods could be relevant) and how these creations could include a reference to the originating `AdminSite`.\n  - `search_method_in_file(\"log_addition\", \"django/contrib/admin/options.py\")`\n  - `search_method_in_file(\"log_change\", \"django/contrib/admin/options.py\")`\n  - `search_method_in_file(\"log_deletion\", \"django/contrib/admin/options.py\")`\n- Examine the `register` method in `AdminSite` for opportunities to link registered models with `LogEntry` records in a way that facilitates filtering.\n  - `search_method_in_class(\"register\", \"AdminSite\")`\n- Consider if a custom `get_queryset` method for `LogEntry` querying within `AdminSite` or a related admin view could be introduced to filter by registered models.\n  - `search_code_in_file(\"get_queryset\", \"django/contrib/admin/views/main.py\")`\n\nThese approaches aim to discover potential hooks or extension points for customizing `LogEntry` management to address the issue described."

This requires altering the data model and might necessitate migrations. However, since `AdminSite` instances are not stored in the database, a direct foreign key relationship isn't feasible. An alternative approach could involve storing identifiers/key names of `AdminSite` instances within `LogEntry` and ensuring that these are updated upon log creation. An assessment of how to appropriately link these elements without causing a significant deviation from the existing design is necessary.\n\n- **File: `django/contrib/admin/sites.py`, Class: `AdminSite`**\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Implement or enhance methods for logging actions (additions, changes, deletions) that include context about the `AdminSite` instance. This could entail modifications to the methods that handle log entries, ensuring they are aware of the `AdminSite` context under which they are being recorded.\n  - Additionally, exploring a filtering mechanism where `LogEntry` queries (possibly via a custom manager or queryset method) are aware of the specific `AdminSite` instance could further align with the intended behavior. If a `get_queryset` mechanism for `LogEntry` is introduced or customized within `AdminSite` or a related admin class/view, this method should be capable of filtering log entries based on the `AdminSite` identifier/context and the models it has registered.\n\nThese enhancements aim to resolve the core issue of log entry visibility across admin sites by ensuring log entries are either tagged with `AdminSite` context or there is a capability to filter entries based on the site and its registered models, thereby maintaining the fidelity of the admin's logging functionality while introducing the desired filtering capability."
