It is confusing for users to access a specific site and see log entries for models they can't access.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue mentioned, we need to focus on the Django Admin Site mechanism, specifically how LogEntries are handled across different AdminSite instances. Since the problem revolves around LogEntries being visible across all AdminSites regardless of the registered models, we should start by investigating the classes and methods related to LogEntry management and how AdminSites are set up to filter or display these entries.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to grasp how LogEntries are linked or managed within the Django admin framework. The `LogEntry` model is a good start. Secondly, understanding how `AdminSite` is implemented would provide insights into how models are registered and possibly how LogEntry filtering could be integrated or improved. Thus, the following API calls are pertinent:\n\n1. To understand how `LogEntry` is implemented and how it could potentially relate to specific AdminSites or models, we'll need to search for the `LogEntry` class.\n   - `search_class(\"LogEntry\")`\n\n2. To comprehend the customization and filtration capabilities, if any, within the `AdminSite` class especially regarding registration and logging of activities, it's imperative to delve into the `AdminSite` class.\n   - `search_class(\"AdminSite\")`\n\n3. Since the issue talks about filtering log entries by models registered to specific admin sites, it's plausible that methods dedicated to handling log entries, like creation or retrieval in relation to the admin site or registered models, could provide a lead. Searching for methods that could be directly related to log entries within the `AdminSite` might unveil how they're currently processed or point towards where modifications are necessary.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"log_entry\", \"AdminSite\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"get_queryset\", \"AdminSite\")` \n\nThese searches aim to gather context around how log entries and admin sites interact within Django's admin framework, which is instrumental in proposing a suitable patch to ensure that only relevant log entries are displayed per admin site, based on the models registered with it."
