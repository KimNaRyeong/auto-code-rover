Given the feedback and aiming for accuracy with respect to the Python code and environments, I understand the issue is with reproducing a feature request rather than an explicit bug. The error encountered previously seems related to the scikit-learn build process rather than the script's logic. The revised script below captures the essence of the requested feature (including the `sparse=True` flag for `SplineTransformer` which doesn't exist as of my last update) and correctly handles errors, including the absence of the feature being a problem itself. 

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    try:
        from sklearn.preprocessing import SplineTransformer
        from scipy.sparse import issparse

        # The user desires to use a feature 'sparse=True' which is hypothetical at this context
        # Thus, the following line would ideally represent the feature request but will raise an AttributeError
        spline = SplineTransformer(degree=2, n_knots=3, sparse=True)

        # For the sake of reproducing the user's issue, we're assuming the above line should work
        # Define input matrix
        X = np.arange(6).reshape(6, 1)
        # Trying to fit and transform to check if the output is sparse
        transformed_X = spline.fit_transform(X)

        # Check if the output is indeed sparse
        assert issparse(transformed_X), "Output is not sparse."

    except AttributeError as e:
        # This block is expected to be executed due to the 'sparse' keyword being unsupported.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exits with error code indicating failure in feature presence.
    except Exception as e:
        # Handling other generic errors
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

    # No errors indicates the feature request is potentially fulfilled.
    print("Issue is fixed. The SplineTransformer now supports sparse output.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script assumes that the `SplineTransformer` class does not currently support a `sparse=True` parameter. Running this script in an environment where the feature is not incorporated will attempt to demonstrate the absence of the feature (hence an issue) and prints a detailed stack trace. The script exits with code 1, indicating the feature has not been implemented or there's a problem with the execution.

Once the feature is correctly implemented, this script should pass without error and exit with code 0, indicating the absence of the problem related to the feature request.
