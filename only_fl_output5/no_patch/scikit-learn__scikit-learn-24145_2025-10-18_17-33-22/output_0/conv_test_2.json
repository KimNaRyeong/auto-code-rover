The error encountered previously seems related to the scikit-learn build process rather than the script's logic. The revised script below captures the essence of the requested feature (including the `sparse=True` flag for `SplineTransformer` which doesn't exist as of my last update) and correctly handles errors, including the absence of the feature being a problem itself. \n\n```python\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef main():\n    import numpy as np\n    try:\n        from sklearn.preprocessing import SplineTransformer\n        from scipy.sparse import issparse\n\n        # The user desires to use a feature 'sparse=True' which is hypothetical at this context\n        # Thus, the following line would ideally represent the feature request but will raise an AttributeError\n        spline = SplineTransformer(degree=2, n_knots=3, sparse=True)\n\n        # For the sake of reproducing the user's issue, we're assuming the above line should work\n        # Define input matrix\n        X = np.arange(6).reshape(6, 1)\n        # Trying to fit and transform to check if the output is sparse\n        transformed_X = spline.fit_transform(X)\n\n        # Check if the output is indeed sparse\n        assert issparse(transformed_X), \"Output is not sparse.\"\n\n    except AttributeError as e:\n        # This block is expected to be executed due to the 'sparse' keyword being unsupported.\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)  # Exits with error code indicating failure in feature presence.\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Handling other generic errors\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)\n\n    # No errors indicates the feature request is potentially fulfilled.\n    print(\"Issue is fixed.

Running this script in an environment where the feature is not incorporated will attempt to demonstrate the absence of the feature (hence an issue) and prints a detailed stack trace. The script exits with code 1, indicating the feature has not been implemented or there's a problem with the execution.\n\nOnce the feature is correctly implemented, this script should pass without error and exit with code 0, indicating the absence of the problem related to the feature request."
