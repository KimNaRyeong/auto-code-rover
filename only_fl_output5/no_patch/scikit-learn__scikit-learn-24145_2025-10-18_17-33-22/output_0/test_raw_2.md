Based on your request and the information provided, I have crafted a standalone Python script intended to reproduce the issue where the `SplineTransformer` might not support returning a sparse matrix. This script checks for the presence of the requested feature and raises an `AssertionError` if the feature isn't implemented as desired. If the feature is implemented (hence, no `AssertionError`), it will exit with code 0. Here's how you could structure such a script:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.preprocessing import SplineTransformer
    from scipy import __version__ as scipy_version

    if scipy_version < '1.8':
        print("This script requires SciPy >= 1.8 for potential 'design_matrix' feature.")
        exit(1)

    try:
        # Attempt to use a non-existent 'sparse' parameter to trigger an error
        spline = SplineTransformer(degree=2, n_knots=3, sparse=True)
        X = np.arange(6).reshape(6, 1)
        transformed_X = spline.fit_transform(X)
        
        # Ideally, check if the output is a sparse matrix
        from scipy.sparse import issparse
        assert issparse(transformed_X), "The transformed_X should be a sparse matrix."
    except TypeError as e:
        # If 'sparse' parameter is unrecognized, TypeError is expected.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # This exit code signifies that the issue is indeed present.
    except AssertionError as ae:
        # Catching assertion error if the output isn't sparse but should be
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        # Handling unexpected errors
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    
    # Success path: the feature is implemented, and the output is sparse.
    print("The feature is implemented successfully, and the output is a sparse matrix.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The script assumes the required feature addition is that the `SplineTransformer` should accept a parameter named `sparse` that, when set to `True`, ensures the transformed output is a sparse matrix. The condition to check for `scipy_version` is to align with the proposition that SciPy >= 1.8 might be required for this functionality to be supported, given it might leverage enhancements or new features from SciPy's `design_matrix`.

Please replace this script in the project's root directory and run it using Python 3. This script will attempt to directly pinpoint the absence of the `sparse` parameter feature by throwing a `TypeError`, and for completeness, it checks if the output is sparse when no exception prevents it from running to completion.
