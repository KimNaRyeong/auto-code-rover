        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the SplineTransformer class in _polynomial.py needs to be enhanced to support an additional boolean parameter (e.g., sparse=False) in its constructor to allow users the option to specify if they want the output in a sparse matrix format. This does not alter any existing functionality but adds a new feature. As fit_transform is not explicitly defined and likely herits behavior from TransformerMixin, we might need to either override fit_transform or adjust both fit and transform methods to conditionally return a sparse matrix based on the new parameter. The transform method specifically should utilize the design_matrix function from scipy (with version >= 1.8) to generate the spline transformation matrix. When sparse=True, the output should be a sparse matrix. The implementation must check if scipy's version satisfies the >= 1.8 condition to use design_matrix method; otherwise, it should raise a version error or warning explaining the dependency requirement. The fit method may require adjustment to prepare or validate any parameters needed for producing a sparse output but does not directly participate in the sparse matrix generation. Ensure backward compatibility and default behavior (producing dense arrays) is preserved when sparse=False or is not specified by the user. Update the class documentation to describe the new sparse parameter and its effects on the output of the transform method."
