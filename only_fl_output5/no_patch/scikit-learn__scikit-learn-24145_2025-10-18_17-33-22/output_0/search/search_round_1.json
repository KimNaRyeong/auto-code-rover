This suggests the need to potentially override or extend `fit_transform` or both `fit` and `transform` methods to add sparse output functionality.\n\n3. **Usage of Scipy in the Codebase**:\n   - The `import scipy` search reveals widespread use of scipy across various files in the codebase, indicating that scipy functionality is integral to sklearn's operations, from utilities to specific algorithms. This widespread usage implies that adding a dependency on a newer feature of scipy (post version 1.8) for the `SplineTransformer` class should align well with existing practices, considering the version compatibility.\n\n4. **Absence of `design_matrix` Method**:\n   - The `design_matrix` method is not found in the existing codebase, highlighting that the proposed feature from scipy has not been integrated yet. Given that the method is part of a recent scipy pull request, its integration would introduce new functionality possibly relating to the generation of design matrices for splines, which is directly relevant to the `SplineTransformer`.\n\nGiven the issue description and the collected context, the intended behavior of modifying the `SplineTransformer` class involves enabling it to output a sparse matrix, leveraging the newly introduced `design_matrix` method from scipy (version >= 1.8) to efficiently generate said sparse matrix.\n\nTo integrate this feature, modifications will likely need to be made in the `fit`, `transform`, or a new `fit_transform` method within the `SplineTransformer` class, respecting the sklearn style of enabling optional behavior through constructor arguments (`sparse=True`).\n\nConsidering the absence of direct references to `fit_transform` within `SplineTransformer` and the lack of integration of the `design_matrix` functionality, the next steps could involve:\n- Ensuring that the scipy version requirement in sklearn's dependencies is updated to reflect the new minimum version.\n- Implementing logic within `fit`, `transform`, or directly within `fit_transform` (if decided to be explicitly defined) that utilizes `design_matrix` for creating and returning sparse matrices based on the `sparse` parameter.\n\nFurther exploration through API calls may involve:\n- Understanding how `TransformerMixin` implements `fit_transform` and if it suffices or needs specialization within `SplineTransformer`.\n- Looking into how scipy\u2019s `design_matrix` could be used within `transform` or `fit_transform`, including its parameters and expected inputs.\n- Assessing current uses of scipy within similar contexts (e.g., other transformers that handle sparse matrices) to align implementation strategies."

This does not alter any existing functionality but adds a new feature.\n    - As `fit_transform` is not explicitly defined and likely herits behavior from `TransformerMixin`, we might need to either override `fit_transform` or adjust both `fit` and `transform` methods to conditionally return a sparse matrix based on the new parameter.\n    - The `transform` method specifically should utilize the `design_matrix` function from scipy (with version >= 1.8) to generate the spline transformation matrix. When `sparse=True`, the output should be a sparse matrix. The implementation must check if scipy's version satisfies the >= 1.8 condition to use `design_matrix` method; otherwise, it should raise a version error or warning explaining the dependency requirement.\n    - The `fit` method may require adjustment to prepare or validate any parameters needed for producing a sparse output but does not directly participate in the sparse matrix generation.\n    - Ensure backward compatibility and default behavior (producing dense arrays) is preserved when `sparse=False` or is not specified by the user.\n    - Update the class documentation to describe the new `sparse` parameter and its effects on the output of the `transform` method."
