This will provide insights into where adjustments may be necessary to support sparse output.\n- `search_code(\"import scipy\"): To find files where scipy is being imported, as the solution involves using a feature from scipy (specifically with version >= 1.8). This will help identify where the new scipy functionality might be integrated.\n- `search_method(\"design_matrix\")`: To see if the `design_matrix` method from scipy is already being used anywhere in the codebase. This is relevant since the proposed solution involves using `design_matrix` from a recent scipy pull request."
