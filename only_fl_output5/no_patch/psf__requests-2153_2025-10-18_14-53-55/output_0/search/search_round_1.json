        "content": "<issue>Uncaught socket.timeout during post\nHallo requests devs (and thanks for an awesome lib)\nDuring a specific `requests.post` I most of the time get a `requests.exceptions.Timeout` (on timeouts) but I also sometimes get a `socket.timeout` exception. Since there is a requests exception for it, I assume that the socket exception was supposed to be caught and the requests one raise instead. The full stack trace is:\n``` python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"test.py\", line 132, in <module>\ntest_stuff()\nFile \"test.py\", line 113, in test_stuff\nbrowse_recursively()\nFile \"test.py\", line 106, in browse_recursively\nbrowse_recursively(new_item, level + 1)\nFile \"test.py\", line 106, in browse_recursively\nbrowse_recursively(new_item, level + 1)\nFile \"test.py\", line 106, in browse_recursively\nbrowse_recursively(new_item, level + 1)\nFile \"test.py\", line 106, in browse_recursively\nbrowse_recursively(new_item, level + 1)\nFile \"test.py\", line 101, in browse_recursively\nfor new_item in wimp.browse(item):\nFile \"/home/kenneth/code/soco/SoCo/soco/plugins/wimp.py\", line 207, in browse\nresponse = post(self._url, headers, body)\nFile \"/home/kenneth/code/soco/SoCo/soco/plugins/wimp.py\", line 40, in post\nout = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=body, timeout=1.0)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/api.py\", line 87, in post\nreturn request('post', url, data=data, **kwargs)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/api.py\", line 44, in request\nreturn session.request(method=method, url=url, **kwargs)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/sessions.py\", line 279, in request\nresp = self.send(prep, stream=stream, timeout=timeout, verify=verify, cert=cert, proxies=proxies)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/sessions.py\", line 374, in send\nr = adapter.send(request, **kwargs)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/adapters.py\", line 222, in send\nr.content\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/models.py\", line 550, in content\nself._content = bytes().join(self.iter_content(CONTENT_CHUNK_SIZE)) or bytes()\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/utils.py\", line 363, in stream_decompress\nfor chunk in iterator:\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/models.py\", line 496, in generate\nchunk = self.raw.read(chunk_size)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/urllib3/response.py\", line 146, in read\nreturn self._fp.read(amt)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/httplib.py\", line 567, in read\ns = self.fp.read(amt)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/socket.py\", line 380, in read\ndata = self._sock.recv(left)\nsocket.timeout: timed out\n```\nThe development is for a plugin for the music service Wimp for the [SoCo](https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo) project, which means that I could post code to reproduce, but you will not be able to run it without a Sonos speaker and a Wimp subscription.

        "content": "To analyze the issue and provide a resolution, we need to understand where and how the `requests.post` method invocation that leads to a `socket.timeout` exception is being handled. Let's focus on the traceback provided in the issue to trace our steps back in the source code.\n\n1. The full traceback shows that the timeout exception occurs during a `requests.post` call in a method named `post`, which seems to be defined in the `soco/plugins/wimp.py` file. First, we should look at this method to understand its implementation and how exceptions are being handled.\n\n2. It's also mentioned that the expected behavior is for a `requests.exceptions.Timeout` to be raised instead of a `socket.timeout`. Hence, examining how exceptions are caught and re-raised in the involved `post` method might give us insights into why this isn't happening as expected.\n\nGiven these points, the necessary search API calls to gather the relevant context are:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"post\", \"soco/plugins/wimp.py\")`: This will allow us to see the implementation of the `post` method where the `requests.post` is called. Specifically, we are interested in the exception handling part to see if `socket.timeout` exceptions are being caught and re-raised as `requests.exceptions.Timeout`.\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"requests.post\", \"soco/plugins/wimp.py\")`: Since the issue specifically involves the usage of `requests.post`, this search will help to directly pinpoint us to the part of the code where it is being used within the `post` method, to see if there's something immediately noticeable about how timeouts are being handled.\n\nThese searches should provide us with enough context around the part of the code where the issue originates to start crafting a solution."

The error could be related to how the `requests.post` call is wrapped or handled within the broader scope of the `requests` library usage in the project, or how exceptions are managed in the integration points.\n\nTo navigate this, considering the traceback and the information provided, we should:\n\n1. Examine how the `requests.post` method is generally used within the project to see if there's a common pattern or wrapper function that's used for making POST requests. This will help us understand if there's a centralized place where the conversion from `socket.timeout` to `requests.exceptions.Timeout` should be happening but isn't.\n\n2. Investigate how exceptions, specifically timeouts, are caught and handled in the project's usage of the `requests` library. This might give us insight into why a `socket.timeout` exception bypasses the expected conversion to `requests.exceptions.Timeout`.\n\nGiven this revised approach, the following search API calls seem pertinent:\n\n- `search_method(\"post\")`: This will help us find all occurrences of `post` method usages across the project to see if there's a pattern or specific handling that could lead to the observed behavior.\n\n- `search_code(\"requests.exceptions.Timeout\")`: By finding how the timeout exception from the `requests` library is handled throughout the project, we might uncover patterns or specific implementations that relate to the issue.\n\n- `search_code(\"socket.timeout\")`: This will help us identify all places where a `socket.timeout` exception is explicitly referenced, which could give clues about potential areas in the code where the issue of not catching and re-raising it as `requests.exceptions.Timeout` could occur.\n\nThese calls are designed to gather a broad view of how timeout management is implemented in the project, thereby offering a clearer path toward identifying the discrepancy noted in the issue."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Upon catching a `socket.timeout`, the code should either re-raise it as a `requests.exceptions.Timeout` or handle it in a manner consistent with how `requests.exceptions.Timeout` is handled. This ensures that the error handling around the project remains consistent and predictable, providing a clear path for managing timeouts across different parts of the codebase.\n\nWithout direct access to specific methods or classes that might be implicated in the issue, this response is necessarily general. The exact implementation would require knowing where the `requests.post` call is made that leads to an uncaught `socket.timeout` exception.\n\nFor projects relying heavily on the `requests` library for HTTP operations, ensuring that timeouts are clearly and consistently managed across the codebase is crucial for robust error handling and resilience. Catching and re-raising exceptions as needed allows developers and users of the library to have a consistent understanding of how timeouts are signaled within the application or library."
