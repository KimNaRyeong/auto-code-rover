        "content": "<issue>Uncaught socket.timeout during post\nHallo requests devs (and thanks for an awesome lib)\nDuring a specific `requests.post` I most of the time get a `requests.exceptions.Timeout` (on timeouts) but I also sometimes get a `socket.timeout` exception. Since there is a requests exception for it, I assume that the socket exception was supposed to be caught and the requests one raise instead. The full stack trace is:\n``` python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"test.py\", line 132, in <module>\ntest_stuff()\nFile \"test.py\", line 113, in test_stuff\nbrowse_recursively()\nFile \"test.py\", line 106, in browse_recursively\nbrowse_recursively(new_item, level + 1)\nFile \"test.py\", line 106, in browse_recursively\nbrowse_recursively(new_item, level + 1)\nFile \"test.py\", line 106, in browse_recursively\nbrowse_recursively(new_item, level + 1)\nFile \"test.py\", line 106, in browse_recursively\nbrowse_recursively(new_item, level + 1)\nFile \"test.py\", line 101, in browse_recursively\nfor new_item in wimp.browse(item):\nFile \"/home/kenneth/code/soco/SoCo/soco/plugins/wimp.py\", line 207, in browse\nresponse = post(self._url, headers, body)\nFile \"/home/kenneth/code/soco/SoCo/soco/plugins/wimp.py\", line 40, in post\nout = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=body, timeout=1.0)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/api.py\", line 87, in post\nreturn request('post', url, data=data, **kwargs)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/api.py\", line 44, in request\nreturn session.request(method=method, url=url, **kwargs)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/sessions.py\", line 279, in request\nresp = self.send(prep, stream=stream, timeout=timeout, verify=verify, cert=cert, proxies=proxies)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/sessions.py\", line 374, in send\nr = adapter.send(request, **kwargs)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/adapters.py\", line 222, in send\nr.content\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/models.py\", line 550, in content\nself._content = bytes().join(self.iter_content(CONTENT_CHUNK_SIZE)) or bytes()\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/utils.py\", line 363, in stream_decompress\nfor chunk in iterator:\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/models.py\", line 496, in generate\nchunk = self.raw.read(chunk_size)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/urllib3/response.py\", line 146, in read\nreturn self._fp.read(amt)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/httplib.py\", line 567, in read\ns = self.fp.read(amt)\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/socket.py\", line 380, in read\ndata = self._sock.recv(left)\nsocket.timeout: timed out\n```\nThe development is for a plugin for the music service Wimp for the [SoCo](https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo) project, which means that I could post code to reproduce, but you will not be able to run it without a Sonos speaker and a Wimp subscription. I understand if this difficulty to reproduce may mean that you cannot work with this issue.\nThanks in advance Kenneth\n</issue>"

        "content": "To analyze the issue and provide a resolution, we need to understand where and how the `requests.post` method invocation that leads to a `socket.timeout` exception is being handled. Let's focus on the traceback provided in the issue to trace our steps back in the source code.\n\n1. The full traceback shows that the timeout exception occurs during a `requests.post` call in a method named `post`, which seems to be defined in the `soco/plugins/wimp.py` file. First, we should look at this method to understand its implementation and how exceptions are being handled.\n\n2. It's also mentioned that the expected behavior is for a `requests.exceptions.Timeout` to be raised instead of a `socket.timeout`. Hence, examining how exceptions are caught and re-raised in the involved `post` method might give us insights into why this isn't happening as expected.\n\nGiven these points, the necessary search API calls to gather the relevant context are:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"post\", \"soco/plugins/wimp.py\")`: This will allow us to see the implementation of the `post` method where the `requests.post` is called. Specifically, we are interested in the exception handling part to see if `socket.timeout` exceptions are being caught and re-raised as `requests.exceptions.Timeout`.\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"requests.post\", \"soco/plugins/wimp.py\")`: Since the issue specifically involves the usage of `requests.post`, this search will help to directly pinpoint us to the part of the code where it is being used within the `post` method, to see if there's something immediately noticeable about how timeouts are being handled.\n\nThese searches should provide us with enough context around the part of the code where the issue originates to start crafting a solution."
