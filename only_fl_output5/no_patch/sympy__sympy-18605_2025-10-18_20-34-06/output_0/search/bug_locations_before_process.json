        "intended_behavior": "The validation logic within the `__new__` method needs to be refined to ensure that when a tuple is provided as a range, each element of the tuple (representing lower and upper bounds) must be an integer or an expression that is guaranteed to evaluate to an integer, excluding special cases like `Infinity` or `-Infinity`. This means enhancing the checks around lines 660-663 to not only check if the bound is not `Infinity` or `-Infinity` but also to confirm that any symbolic expressions are indeed guaranteed to be integers. This could involve checking for integer assumptions on the symbols (`bound.is_integer`) more robustly and raising a `TypeError` if these conditions are not met, thus preventing the instantiation of `Idx` objects with non-integer symbolic bounds. This update ensures the functionality of accepting integer bounds (including symbolic integers) remains intact while correctly rejecting real symbolic bounds that cannot ascertain their integer nature, aligning with the expectation described in the issue."
