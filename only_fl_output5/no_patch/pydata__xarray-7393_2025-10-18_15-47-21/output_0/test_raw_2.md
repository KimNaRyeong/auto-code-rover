Understood. Here's how to structure the `reproducer.py` to address your requirements properly. This version of the script will indeed raise an `AssertionError` if the data type 'i4' is incorrectly converted to 'i8', which aligns with your request to demonstrate the issue as described. If the issue is fixed and the script doesn't find a problem, it will exit with code 0.

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        ds = xr.Dataset(coords={'a': np.array([0], dtype='i4')})
        # Try reproducing the issue as described
        result_dtype = ds.stack(b=('a',))['a'].values.dtype
        expected_dtype = np.dtype('i4')
        # Check if the dtype is incorrectly cast to 'i8'
        assert result_dtype == expected_dtype, (f"Expected dtype after stacking: {expected_dtype}, "
                                                f"found: {result_dtype}")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code to indicate reproduction of the issue
    else:
        print("Issue not reproduced (or already fixed). Exiting with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit gracefully indicating no issue found

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script attempts to specifically identify the problem you described: a data type conversion that should not occur. It checks whether the dtype of coordinate 'a' after stacking remains 'i4'. If it changes to 'i8', an AssertionError is raised, and the detailed stacktrace is printed to standard error as you requested. This setup ensures that any potential issue regarding data type integrity post-manipulation can be easily identified and debugged.
