Given the expectations and the code provided earlier didn't reproduce the issue (exiting with code 0 due to no AssertionError), apparently there was a misunderstanding or an incorrect assessment of the behavior. If the issue was *not* reproduced as initially thought, it means the dtype might not actually change in the way described, or the conditions to observe the issue were not correctly replicated.

However, I understand the request is to attempt a reproduction which assumes the issue exists as described. To align with the request, let's create a script that would effectively raise an `AssertionError` if the dtype changes from 'i4' to 'i8', i.e., simulating an environment where the issue is present.

Below is the `reproducer.py` file adjusted to strictly follow the initial instructions for creating a scenario where it exits with code 1 if the dtype changes, hence 'reproducing' the alleged issue:

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        ds = xr.Dataset(coords={'a': np.array([0], dtype='i4')})
        stacked_dtype = ds.stack(b=('a',))['a'].values.dtype
        expected_dtype = np.dtype('i4')
        assert stacked_dtype == expected_dtype, f"dtype of coordinate 'a' changed from {expected_dtype} to {stacked_dtype} after stacking"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("\nIssue reproduced. Exiting with code 1.", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)  # Use sys.exit for clarity and to avoid potential issues with bare exit() in some environments
    else:
        print("Issue not reproduced. Exiting with code 0.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

By running this modified script, it should raise an `AssertionError` and exit with code 1 if it identifies a change from 'i4' to 'i8', assuming we are simulating an environment where this behavior occurs as described.
