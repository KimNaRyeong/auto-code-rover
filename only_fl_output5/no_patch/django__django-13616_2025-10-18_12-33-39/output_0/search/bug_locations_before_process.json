Instead of just stating the problem, it should guide the user towards a resolution, such as suggesting to check for the 'locale' directory within the app or root project directory or to ensure 'LOCALE_PATHS' is correctly set in the settings. Additionally, if the 'locale' directory is not found, instead of failing silently or giving a vague error, the command should explicitly check common directories (like the same directory where 'manage.py' resides) and suggest them as potential solutions or more explicitly require setting 'LOCALE_PATHS' in the settings."

This may involve providing a new method within this class responsible for performing these checks and offering help or documentation links directly in the error messages. This helps developers quickly understand and resolve the configuration issue."
