This behavior should preserve all existing functionality for other types of data while enhancing the method to handle datetime units effectively, thus ensuring that when `bottom` is a datetime object, the x-axis (for vertical bars) dynamically adjusts to represent time scales accurately."

This preserves the method's current capabilities while extending its functionality to support datetime objects, addressing the reported issue of incorrect datetime units representation in horizontal bar plots."
