        "content": "To gather sufficient context and potentially locate where to patch the issue described, we should consider the following API calls based on the information provided in the issue:\n\n1. Search for the `bar` and `barh` methods to understand how they are implemented and whether there's an explicit check or conversion for datetime objects in their parameters. The issue indicates that these methods fail to check if the axis needs a different converter when `bottom` or `left` parameters are used, which are datetime objects in this case.\n2. Search for any mentions or usage patterns of `date.converter` since setting `plt.rcParams['date.converter'] = 'concise'` appears to provide a workaround for the issue. This might give us insight into how datetime conversion is typically handled and whether there's a centralized mechanism that `bar` and `barh` could utilize or are failing to utilize.\n3. It could also be helpful to search specifically for the code that handles the `bottom` and `left` parameters in the `bar` and `barh` methods to see how these are processed and why datetime objects might not be triggering the expected behavior.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are the specific API calls we should make:\n\n- `search_method(\"bar\")`\n- `search_method(\"barh\")`\n- `search_code(\"plt.rcParams['date.converter'] = 'concise'\")`\n- `search_code(\"ax.barh\")`\n- `search_code(\"ax.bar\")`"
