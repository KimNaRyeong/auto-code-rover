        "intended_behavior": "The `resolve_expression` method needs to be implemented rather than raising a `NotImplementedError`. This implementation should allow parsing and handling of nested relations within the `condition` argument. It should construct a valid query expression that Django's ORM can use to generate the appropriate SQL, managing nested conditions in such a way that they are transformed into valid SQL expressions. This will involve ensuring that the method can traverse nested relations and translate them into a series of join operations and where clauses that reflect the intended filter criteria. The implementation must maintain compatibility with existing non-nested conditions to ensure backward compatibility."

        "intended_behavior": "The `as_sql` method should be capable of correctly interpreting and compiling nested relations transformed by the `resolve_expression` method into SQL. The method must ensure that it generates efficient and accurate SQL queries that include the necessary JOIN and WHERE clauses to reflect nested relational conditions. This could involve enhancing the method to recognize and correctly integrate these complex relationships into the query structure, ensuring the SQL execution is optimized for performance while achieving the desired filtering based on nested relationships. The changes should not affect the handling of conditions that do not involve nested relations, preserving the method's existing functionality."
