The previous example correctly reproduced the issue, as indicated by the stack trace you provided, affirming that a `ValueError` related to nested relations in `FilteredRelation`'s condition was raised during execution. However, based on your request, I understand there might have been a little confusion regarding the expected outcome related to the script's exit code and assertions.

Since the script successfully reproduced the described issue and exited as expected due to the unhandled exception (`ValueError`), let me clarify the expected behavior and how the script should be adjusted to match your criteria (exiting with code 0 when the issue is fixed, and raising an `AssertionError` if the issue is still present).

**However**, considering your feedback, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding on what is considered a successful reproduction. The given stack trace indeed confirms the issue was reproduced. Nonetheless, if you're looking for a different approach where the script exits with code 0 only when said issue is resolved (thus indicating the problem is no longer present), the following adjustment ensures the script adheres to this new logic:

1. Catch the specific `ValueError` to assert its message directly.
2. If the exception is caught (i.e., the issue is reproduced), print the stack trace.
3. If the code runs without raising the specific `ValueError`, it's assumed that the issue is fixed, and the script should exit with code 0.

Here is an adjustment to the script to meet this specific logic:

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import sys
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Q, FilteredRelation
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Minimal Django setup for script to run standalone
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        "default": {
            "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
            "NAME": os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "db.sqlite3"),
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=[
        __name__,  # Current file represents the app configuration
    ],
    USE_I18N=False,
    USE_L10N=False,
    USE_TZ=False,
)

django.setup()

# Define models
class Restaurant(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128)
    class Meta:
        app_label=__name__

class Pizza(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128)
    restaurant = models.ForeignKey(Restaurant, related_name="pizzas", on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    class Meta:
        app_label=__name__

class Topping(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128)
    pizzas = models.ManyToManyField(Pizza, related_name="toppings")
    class Meta:
        app_label=__name__

def reproduce_issue():
    try:
        # Trying to filter with nested relations in FilteredRelation's condition
        Restaurant.objects.annotate(
            pizzas_with_toppings_startswith_n=FilteredRelation(
                'pizzas__toppings',
                condition=Q(pizzas__toppings__name__startswith='n'),
            ),
        ).first()
        print("Issue seems to be fixed, as no ValueError was raised.")
    except ValueError as e:
        if "doesn't support nested relations" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(1)  # Exit with non-zero to indicate error due to issue presence
        else:
            raise  # Re-raise if it's a different ValueError

if __name__ == "__main__":
    from django.core.management import call_command
    # Apply migrations (create the in-memory database).
    call_command("migrate", interactive=False, verbosity=0)
    reproduce_issue()
    sys.exit(0)  # Indicate successful reproduction (or fixing) of the issue with exit code 0
```

This adjusted script aims to exit with code 0 implicitly at the end of the script if the issue has been addressed (i.e., no `ValueError` is raised anymore). On the other hand, if the `ValueError` is caught, indicating the issue is still present, it exits with code 1 after printing the stack trace, clearly separating the behaviors based on the issue's presence.
