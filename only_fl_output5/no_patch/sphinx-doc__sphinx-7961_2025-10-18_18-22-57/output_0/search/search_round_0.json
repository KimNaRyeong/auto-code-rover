It would be great to get this into the Sphinx MathJax extension.\nThe [MathJax upgrading docs](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/v2.html#upgrading-from-v2-to-v3) suggest that it will not be trivial to upgrade, but it may be worth it given the performance and modularity improvements. What do folks think?\n</issue>"

Search for the Sphinx MathJax extension class within the codebase to understand its current implementation and structure. Since the precise name of the class related to the MathJax extension in Sphinx is not mentioned directly, a broader search term like \"MathJax\" could potentially yield relevant classes or files.\n   - `search_class(\"MathJax\")`\n\n2. Look for mentions or uses of MathJax within the Sphinx extension code to identify how it is currently integrated.\n   - `search_code(\"MathJax\")`\n\n3. Since the upgrade from MathJax 2 to 3 involves significant changes, it would be useful to search for specific methods or code patterns that are likely to change based on the upgrade documentation. This includes initialization patterns, configuration settings, and loading mechanisms, but since we don't have specific method names from the provided issue, we'll start more broadly.\n   - `search_code(\"MathJax.Hub\")`\n   - `search_code(\"MathJax.config\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for understanding how MathJax is currently used within the project and what areas might need modification or attention during the upgrade process."
