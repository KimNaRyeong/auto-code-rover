        "intended_behavior": "This function is intended to add MathJax support to Sphinx-generated documentation. To resolve the issue, the code must be updated to facilitate the integration of MathJax 3.0, respecting the new initialization and configuration methods that MathJax 3.0 introduces. This involves replacing the use of `MathJax.Hub.Config` with the new configuration approaches suitable for MathJax 3.0. Furthermore, the method should ensure compatibility with MathJax 3.0's promise-based initialization system, and dynamically load the MathJax script with the properly updated paths and configuration options as per MathJax 3.0 documentation. The existing functionality, such as allowing users to customize MathJax configuration via Sphinx's `conf.py` and seamlessly rendering mathematical expressions in documents, must be preserved."
