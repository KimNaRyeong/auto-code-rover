Additionally, a `DEFAULT_LOG_DATE_FORMAT` is defined but is not of immediate concern for this issue.\n   - The second and third search results, from the same file, show the usage of `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` in the `pytest_addoption` function. This function seems to be configuring options for logging, allowing users to override the `log_format` and `log_file_format` with custom formats if desired.\n\n2. **Relationship with the Bug**:\n   - The issue requests changing the default logging format to include the module name (`name`) and possibly the filename's relative path. The current setup with `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` only uses filename, line number, and log level.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**:\n   - The intended behavior is to adjust `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` to include the module name and optionally the relative path of the file. This would improve log readability and usefulness by providing more context about where log messages originate in the codebase.\n\n### Analysis of `search_code(\"logging.basicConfig\")` Results:\n\n1. **Understanding the Code's Functionality**:\n   - The results from `testing/test_capture.py` show example usages of `logging.basicConfig` within test functions/classes. These snippets demonstrate how logging is configured for tests, presumably to capture and assess logging during test runs.\n\n2. **Relationship with the Bug**:\n   - While these results do not directly impact the logging format issue, they highlight how logging is configured in tests, possibly indicating that similar `basicConfig` calls or logging configurations might be found elsewhere in the project for the main application code.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**:\n   - Even though the basicConfig usages found are in test configurations and not directly related to the application's default logging setup, understanding this configuration mechanism is crucial. It underlines the importance of ensuring any changes made to `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` are compatible with how `logging.basicConfig` is used throughout the project, guaranteeing that the new format does not inadvertently break these configurations.\n\nGiven the direct relevance of `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT`, the next steps would involve crafting a change to this definition in `src/_pytest/logging.py` to include the `name` (module name) as requested. Additionally, considering the enhancement for incorporating the relative file path needs a careful approach, ensuring it does not excessively lengthen the log messages, thereby reducing readability. Adjusting or extending the format will need to consider how these changes affect existing configurations and usage in tests and potentially elsewhere in the application."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

The new format suggested in the issue, `\"%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s\"`, should replace the old format. This change will allow log messages to carry more contextual information (i.e., the module name along with the filename and line number), without significantly altering the existing functionality. The revised logging format will enhance debugging capabilities by making the logs more informative, showing not just where (filename and line number) but also in what context (module name) the log was generated, thereby adhering to the request for improved readability and usefulness in log messages."
