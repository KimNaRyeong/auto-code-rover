        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` to include the module name (`name`) and potentially explore reducing the length of the path while preserving essential parts of it. The new format suggested in the issue, \"%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s\", should replace the old format. This change will allow log messages to carry more contextual information (i.e., the module name along with the filename and line number), without significantly altering the existing functionality. The revised logging format will enhance debugging capabilities by making the logs more informative, showing not just where (filename and line number) but also in what context (module name) the log was generated, thereby adhering to the request for improved readability and usefulness in log messages."
