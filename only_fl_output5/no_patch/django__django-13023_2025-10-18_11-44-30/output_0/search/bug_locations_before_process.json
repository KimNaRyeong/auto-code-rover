        "intended_behavior": "The `to_python()` method in the `DecimalField` class of the Django ORM should be capable of identifying inputs that are not suitable for conversion into decimal values, such as dictionaries, and should raise a `ValidationError` in such cases. This behavior would ensure that data integrity issues are caught early, during model validation, and can be reported back to the developer or user in a more understandable way.\n\n- Before attempting to convert the input value to a decimal, the method should check if the input value is a type that could be sensibly converted to a decimal. If the value is of a type that clearly cannot be converted (like a dictionary), the method should raise a `ValidationError` instead of allowing a `TypeError` to occur.\n- This modification must preserve the current functionality for all valid inputs, meaning it should still correctly cast strings, integers, and floats to decimals without any change in behavior.\n- Additionally, the existing error handling for values that might be close to valid but still incorrect (like a string that doesn't represent a decimal number) should remain unaffected. This requires careful integration of the new type check to ensure it doesn't preempt the current validation logic that handles these near-miss cases.\n\nIn summary, the patch should introduce an additional validation layer that preempts the conversion process, specifically designed to catch types inherently incompatible with decimal conversion, thereby improving the robustness of the `to_python()` method's error handling."
