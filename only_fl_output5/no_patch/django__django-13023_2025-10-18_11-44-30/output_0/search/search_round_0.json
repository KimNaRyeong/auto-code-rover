This is a problem, for example, when you try to save a model object, and a decimal field got set to a dictionary by mistake. The TypeError exception that comes back makes it hard to track the problem to the field if the object has a lot of fields.\nI am proposing a patch to fix it:\n\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/13023\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue concerning `DecimalField.to_python()` raising `TypeError` on dict values, we need to gather more context about where and how `to_python()` is implemented and used within Django's codebase. The primary goal here is to locate the `DecimalField` class and the `to_python()` method within it. Here are the API calls that would help gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(class_name=\"DecimalField\")` - This will help us find where the `DecimalField` class is defined.\n2. `search_method(method_name=\"to_python\")` - This will provide a broad scope of where `to_python` methods are defined, which is crucial since we're focusing on the `to_python()` within `DecimalField`, but understanding its use in other contexts might also be insightful."
