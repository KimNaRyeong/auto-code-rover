Based on your previous attempt, it seems there was a misunderstanding or mismatch with the environment setup, specifically related to the version of xarray being used (0.12) versus the version where the issue is reported (0.16.1 and 0.16.2). Additionally, the failure was due to an incompatibility with NumPy's API change (`np.unicode_` was removed in favor of `np.str_`). To address the issue correctly, ensure that you're using a compatible environment with xarray version 0.16.2 or the master at that time, along with an appropriate version of NumPy.

The error message you encountered suggests that the failure to reproduce the issue might be related to the version mismatch or environmental setup rather than the original `decode_cf` failure. This emphasizes the importance of closely aligning the development or testing environment with the specific versions where the issue is reported.

Given these points, below is an attempt to revise `reproducer.py` with the assumption that the environment now appropriately matches the version of xarray where the issue occurs (0.16.2), and ensuring it addresses the specific problem of `decode_cf` failing when `scale_factor` is a length-1 list.

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_decode_with_scale_factor_as_list():
    try:
        ds = xr.DataArray([0, 1, 2], name='foo',
                          attrs={'scale_factor': [0.01],
                                 'add_offset': [1.0]}).to_dataset()
        xr.decode_cf(ds)
    except AttributeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("decode_cf fails when scale_factor is a length-1 list") from e
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An unexpected error occurred") from e
    else:
        print("No error encountered. The issue might be fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_decode_with_scale_factor_as_list()

This script is meant to run in an environment where xarray version 0.16.2 (or the master version around the time the issue was reported) is present. Before running this script, ensure you are using an appropriate environment setup with the correct xarray and NumPy versions. If this script still does not reproduce the issue accurately due to environmental setup errors, you may need to revisit and ensure the environment matches the reported issue's context closely.
