This might give us insights into expectations for operations involving `zoo`.\n   - `search_code(\"zoo\")`\n\n3. **Get the code around the problematic area**: The issue description points to a specific line in `integers.py`. To understand the context and control flow that leads to the error, we should examine the code around this location.\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py\", 333, 5)`\n\nThese API calls should provide us with a comprehensive understanding of how `frac` and `zoo` are managed within the SymPy project, enabling us to determine the most appropriate way to address the TypeError issue being encountered."
