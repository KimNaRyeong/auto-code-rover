        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. The `frac` method in `sympy/parsing/latex/_antlr/latexparser.py`\n\n- This search result might not be directly relevant to the issue at hand, which involves the `frac` function's behavior in a mathematical context, rather than parsing LaTeX. The `frac` function causing the issue likely resides in `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py`, as indicated by the traceback and the description of the issue. It's important to distinguish between different usages of `frac` across the codebase.\n\n#### 2. Occurrences of `zoo` in the codebase\n\n- The extensive presence of `zoo` across various modules suggests it's a well-integrated concept in SymPy, typically representing an infinite quantity in mathematical expressions. Its handling in functions like `mul`, `add`, or specific domains like `integrals` and `series` could provide insights on expected behaviors when `zoo` is involved, particularly regarding operations that could lead to undefined or indeterminate forms.\n- The presence of `zoo` in `core/numbers.py` and operations modules (e.g., `mul.py`, `add.py`) highlights the fundamental nature of infinity in arithmetic operations, potentially guiding how `frac` should handle `zoo`.\n\n#### 3. The problematic `frac` implementation in `integers.py`\n\n- The `eval` method within `frac` combines real and imaginary components, presumably to handle complex numbers by separating them into fractional parts. However, the error originates from an attempt to add `None` to `Zero`, suggesting that `_eval` returns `None` under certain conditions, possibly when it encounters `zoo`.\n- The traceback implies that `frac` doesn't properly handle cases when its input leads to an undefined or indeterminate fractional part. Given `zoo` represents infinity, and fractional parts of infinity are not well-defined, the current handling by `frac` is insufficient or incorrect.\n\n### Intended Behavior and Relationship to the Bug\n\nGiven the issue and the surrounding context:\n- **Intended Behavior**: The `frac` function should gracefully handle inputs like `zoo` without resulting in a TypeError. Instead of trying to compute a fractional part of infinity, which does not make sense, it should either return a sensible default (like `0`, `NaN`, or itself `zoo`) or perhaps raise a descriptive error explaining why the operation is invalid.\n- **Relationship with the Bug**: The bug arises because the code does not anticipate or correctly manage the case where the input is `zoo`. The operation attempts to proceed as with finite numbers, leading to an operation on `NoneType`.\n\n### Further Actions\nTo address the issue, the code needs to specifically check for inputs like `zoo` before attempting to break them into real and imaginary components or directly trying to evaluate their fractional part. A likely patch would involve:\n1. Detecting when `arg` is `zoo` (or when `_eval(real)` or `_eval(imag)` would lead to `None`) and deciding on a consistent, expected outcome for such cases.\n2. Implementing this check and response in a way that maintains consistency with the handling of infinity across the rest of the SymPy project.\n\nGiven the collected context, additional steps could involve reviewing how other functions handle `zoo` to ensure consistency with SymPy's overall design philosophy, possibly requiring a search in those files (`core/numbers.py`, `core/mul.py`, etc.) for specific handling logic for `zoo`."

The function should early check if the input is `zoo` or if during its processing, any component (real or imaginary) evaluates to `None` when encountering `zoo`.\n    - If `arg` is `zoo` or processing leads to an undefined state because of `zoo`, the function should either return a value that makes sense in the context of SymPy's handling of infinity (such as `NaN`, `0`, or `zoo` itself) or explicitly raise a meaningful exception. This behavior should be congruent with how undefined or infinite results are handled elsewhere in SymPy, particularly in functions that perform mathematical operations on complex numbers or infinity.\n    - This modification ensures `frac` gracefully handles all inputs, including `zoo`, maintaining the overall robustness and consistency of mathematical operations in SymPy."
