        "intended_behavior": "The `eval` function within `frac` should be enhanced to handle cases where the argument (`arg`) is `zoo` (or leads to an indeterminate situation like `None + Zero`). The function should early check if the input is `zoo` or if during its processing, any component (real or imaginary) evaluates to `None` when encountering `zoo`. If `arg` is `zoo` or processing leads to an undefined state because of `zoo`, the function should either return a value that makes sense in the context of SymPy's handling of infinity (such as `NaN`, `0`, or `zoo` itself) or explicitly raise a meaningful exception. This behavior should be congruent with how undefined or infinite results are handled elsewhere in SymPy, particularly in functions that perform mathematical operations on complex numbers or infinity. This modification ensures `frac` gracefully handles all inputs, including `zoo`, maintaining the overall robustness and consistency of mathematical operations in SymPy."
