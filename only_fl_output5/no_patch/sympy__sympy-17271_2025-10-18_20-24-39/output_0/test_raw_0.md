This script is designed to reproduce the issue described in the given context. It attempts to call `frac(zoo)` from the SymPy library, expecting a `TypeError` due to the unresolved behavior when dealing with `zoo` (complex infinity in SymPy). If the script catches a `TypeError`, it asserts that the error is expected, indicating the issue is successfully reproduced. If the issue is fixed in a future version of SymPy, the script would print the result and exit normally without raising an `AssertionError`.
