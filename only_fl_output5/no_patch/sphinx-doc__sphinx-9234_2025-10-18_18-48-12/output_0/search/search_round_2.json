This indicates that the functionality regarding link checking and redirect handling is likely more integrated into other parts of the code, and not isolated within specifically named classes or methods as initially guessed.\n\nFrom the successful search result, we identified the file `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` as potentially relevant. The mention of `output.txt` in this context suggests it's involved in generating output related to link checking, which is a key part of the feature request. This file, `linkcheck.py`, is very likely to contain the primary logic for the link checking function within the Sphinx project (given the naming and Sphinx's functionality related to documentation generation and link verification).\n\n### Analysis of the Results\n- **sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py**: Since this file was identified in relation to `output.txt`, it's reasonable to deduce that it deals with the logic for checking links as part of the build process. Sphinx is a tool that generates documentation, and part of that process involves verifying that links within documentation are valid. This file is probably central to the issue at hand because it likely contains logic to assess links, record outcomes (such as redirects), and generate the `output.txt` report. Given the issue description, we're interested in how this file handles redirects and reports on them. The intended behavior modification would involve making this component capable of discerning which redirects are permissible based on a predefined list of acceptable redirect pairs.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the identification of `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` as a crucial file, the next logical steps involve more detailed analysis of this file to understand how it currently processes links and handles redirects. This will help determine where to integrate the new feature that allows specifying allowed redirects.\n\n1. **Examine `linkcheck.py` for Current Link Checking Logic**:\n    - `search_code_in_file(\"check\", \"sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py\")`\n    - This search aims to find how links are currently checked in the file, possibly identifying methods or logic blocks where redirects are processed.\n\n2. **Look for Any Existing Redirect Handling**:\n    - `search_code_in_file(\"redirect\", \"sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py\")`\n    - This search is guided towards understanding how redirects are currently detected, logged, or handled within the link-check process.\n\nThese steps are aimed at getting deeper into understanding the exact mechanisms at play within `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` related to link checking and redirect handling. This closer look will provide the necessary context to plan the implementation of the requested feature effectively."

Currently, the process may lack the ability to differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable redirects.\n- **New Methods/Logic:** Implement a method or augment existing logic to:\n    - Parse and maintain a list of acceptable redirect URL pairs. This could involve reading from a configuration file or a section within an existing Sphinx configuration file that allows users to specify allowed redirects explicitly.\n    - During the link checking process, when a redirect is encountered, the method should compare the original URL and its redirect target against the list of acceptable redirects. If the pair matches an entry in the list, the redirect can be considered valid; otherwise, it should be flagged as an error.\n    - Update the reporting mechanism to include errors for redirects that do not match any acceptable pairs, in addition to the existing output. This ensures users are aware of which redirects need attention without completely blocking the use of valid redirects that are part of a well-maintained documentation ecosystem.\n\nThis approach preserves the existing functionality of the code by maintaining its ability to detect and report on broken links or redirects while adding the capability to enforce stricter rules about which redirects are considered acceptable.

Let's analyze the findings:\n\n### Analysis of `redirect` and `check` Searches in `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py`\n\n1. **Methods Mentioned for Redirect Searches:**\n   - `init`, `redirected`, `process_result`, `__init__`, and `run` methods have instances of handling redirects, each likely contributing to different aspects of setting up, detecting, and processing redirects during the link checking process.\n\n2. **Methods Mentioned for Check Searches:**\n   - A broader range of methods (`anchors_ignore`, `auth`, `to_ignore`, `check_thread`, `process_result`, `finish`, `__init__`, `invoke_threads`, `run`, `limit_rate`, `rewrite_github_anchor`, `setup`) touch on various stages of link checking, from initialization, authentication, rate limiting, and thread management, to the specific logic of link validity checking.\n\n### Relevance to the Issue:\n\n- **`redirected` and `process_result` Methods:**\n  - These methods seem directly involved in how redirects are detected and handled, making them critical points for introducing logic to discriminate between acceptable and unacceptable redirects. The `process_result` method, in particular, likely deals with the outcome of a link check, including the handling of redirects, making it a key area to insert new logic for checking against acceptable redirect pairs.\n  \n- **`run` Method:**\n  - Mentioned multiple times across both searches, this method likely serves as the main execution point for link checking. Modifications here may involve orchestrating the new functionality for stricter redirect handling.\n\n### Intended Behavior in the Context of the Issue:\n\nGiven the issue's requirement to enable prohibiting unknown redirects by listing all allowed redirects as pairs of URLs, the intended behavior can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Enhance Redirect Handling:**\n   - Integrate functionality within `redirected`, `process_result`, and potentially `run` methods to:\n     - Load a configurably specified list of allowed URL redirect pairs prior to the link checking process.\n     - When a redirect is encountered, compare it against these allowed pairs. If a match is found, the redirect is processed as valid; if not, the redirect is flagged as requiring action.\n    \n2. **Reporting:**\n   - Modify the `process_result` method to ensure that redirects not matching any of the allowed pairs are reported distinctly in the output, alerting users to potential issues needing correction.\n\n3. **Configuration Support:**\n   - It would also involve enhancing configuration file handling to allow users to specify allowed redirect pairs, affecting methods involved in initial setup or configuration loading (`init`, `__init__`, `setup`).\n\nThis analysis points to a development approach where enhancing specific methods to incorporate the feature can preserve and extend the existing functionality relating to link checking."

Upon encountering a redirect, the method would verify if the redirect matches any pair listed in the configuration. If it does, the redirect is considered valid. If not, the method should flag this as an error or warning in the final report, indicating the need for a review or update of the redirected URL. This keeps the essential function of link checking while introducing stricter validation for redirects.\n\n**Location 2:**\n- **File:** `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py`\n- **Method:** `redirected`\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\n- The `redirected` method's behavior should be updated to include logic for checking against the list of allowed redirect pairs before marking a link as successfully verified. This method likely handles the event of a link's redirection. Implementing a check here allows for early discrimination of redirects, ensuring only approved ones are processed further. \n\nBoth locations need modifications to align link checking functionality with the new requirement of handling redirects more judiciously. This involves cross-referencing redirects against a user-configurable list of allowed redirects to ensure that only those that are explicitly permitted are accepted. This feature adds a layer of control, helping maintain the integrity of documentation by preventing the unnoticed shift of links to potentially unrelated or unwanted destinations."
