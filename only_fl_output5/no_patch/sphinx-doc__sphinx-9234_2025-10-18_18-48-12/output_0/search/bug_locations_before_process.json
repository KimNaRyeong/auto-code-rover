Upon encountering a redirect, the method would verify if the redirect matches any pair listed in the configuration. If it does, the redirect is considered valid. If not, the method should flag this as an error or warning in the final report, indicating the need for a review or update of the redirected URL. This keeps the essential function of link checking while introducing stricter validation for redirects."
