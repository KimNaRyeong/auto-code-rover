Good websites will provide redirects to the correct new location or return an HTTP error code. Bad websites will redirect to an unrelated page or the root of the website.\nPreventing all redirects does not allow links to URLs like https://www.sphinx-doc.org/ which redirects to https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/. It needs to be possible to allow these redirects but disallow others.\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nIt should be possible to prohibit unknown redirects by listing all of the allowed redirects as pairs of URLs.\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nPost-process `linkcheck/output.txt` by removing filenames and line numbers then sorting it and comparing it with known good output.\n**Additional context**\nA link to https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/ (which used to work) now redirects to https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/. Linkcheck allows this but the original link is not valid and needs to be updated to the article's new URL of https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/.\nLinkcheck should be able to report an error for this redirect.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather context on the link check mechanism within the project. The feature request mentions managing redirects to ensure that only acceptable redirect pairs are allowed, and others are reported as errors. This requires understanding of the classes, methods, and possibly specific code snippets related to link checking and redirect handling.\n\nHere are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. **Search for the Link Checker Class**: It's likely that there is a class dedicated to link checking within the project. Without knowing the exact class name, a search term like \"LinkCheck\" or \"LinkChecker\" could be a good start.\n    - `search_class(\"LinkChecker\")`\n    - `search_class(\"LinkCheck\")`\n\n2. **Search for Methods Related to Handling Redirects**: Knowing how redirects are currently handled will be crucial for implementing the new feature.\n    - `search_method(\"handleRedirect\")`\n    - `search_method(\"checkRedirect\")`\n\n3. **Search for the Output File Handling Code**: Since the issue mentions post-processing `linkcheck/output.txt`, understanding how this file is generated and used could provide insights into where to integrate the new feature.\n    - `search_code(\"output.txt\")`\n\nGiven the API limitations and the need for targeted information, these calls should provide a decent starting point to understand how link checking and redirects are currently managed within the project. Subsequent searches may be required based on the results of these initial queries."
