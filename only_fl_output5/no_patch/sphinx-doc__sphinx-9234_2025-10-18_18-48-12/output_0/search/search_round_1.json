It needs to be possible to allow these redirects but disallow others.\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nIt should be possible to prohibit unknown redirects by listing all of the allowed redirects as pairs of URLs.\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nPost-process `linkcheck/output.txt` by removing filenames and line numbers then sorting it and comparing it with known good output.\n**Additional context**\nA link to https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/ (which used to work) now redirects to https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/.

        "content": "Given the results of the initial searches, it's clear that there might not be explicitly named classes or methods for `LinkChecker`, `LinkCheck`, `handleRedirect`, or `checkRedirect`. This indicates that the functionality regarding link checking and redirect handling is likely more integrated into other parts of the code, and not isolated within specifically named classes or methods as initially guessed.\n\nFrom the successful search result, we identified the file `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` as potentially relevant. The mention of `output.txt` in this context suggests it's involved in generating output related to link checking, which is a key part of the feature request. This file, `linkcheck.py`, is very likely to contain the primary logic for the link checking function within the Sphinx project (given the naming and Sphinx's functionality related to documentation generation and link verification).\n\n### Analysis of the Results\n- **sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py**: Since this file was identified in relation to `output.txt`, it's reasonable to deduce that it deals with the logic for checking links as part of the build process. Sphinx is a tool that generates documentation, and part of that process involves verifying that links within documentation are valid. This file is probably central to the issue at hand because it likely contains logic to assess links, record outcomes (such as redirects), and generate the `output.txt` report. Given the issue description, we're interested in how this file handles redirects and reports on them. The intended behavior modification would involve making this component capable of discerning which redirects are permissible based on a predefined list of acceptable redirect pairs.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the identification of `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` as a crucial file, the next logical steps involve more detailed analysis of this file to understand how it currently processes links and handles redirects. This will help determine where to integrate the new feature that allows specifying allowed redirects.\n\n1. **Examine `linkcheck.py` for Current Link Checking Logic**:\n    - `search_code_in_file(\"check\", \"sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py\")`\n    - This search aims to find how links are currently checked in the file, possibly identifying methods or logic blocks where redirects are processed.\n\n2. **Look for Any Existing Redirect Handling**:\n    - `search_code_in_file(\"redirect\", \"sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py\")`\n    - This search is guided towards understanding how redirects are currently detected, logged, or handled within the link-check process.\n\nThese steps are aimed at getting deeper into understanding the exact mechanisms at play within `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` related to link checking and redirect handling. This closer look will provide the necessary context to plan the implementation of the requested feature effectively."

Currently, the process may lack the ability to differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable redirects.\n- **New Methods/Logic:** Implement a method or augment existing logic to:\n    - Parse and maintain a list of acceptable redirect URL pairs. This could involve reading from a configuration file or a section within an existing Sphinx configuration file that allows users to specify allowed redirects explicitly.\n    - During the link checking process, when a redirect is encountered, the method should compare the original URL and its redirect target against the list of acceptable redirects. If the pair matches an entry in the list, the redirect can be considered valid; otherwise, it should be flagged as an error.\n    - Update the reporting mechanism to include errors for redirects that do not match any acceptable pairs, in addition to the existing output. This ensures users are aware of which redirects need attention without completely blocking the use of valid redirects that are part of a well-maintained documentation ecosystem.\n\nThis approach preserves the existing functionality of the code by maintaining its ability to detect and report on broken links or redirects while adding the capability to enforce stricter rules about which redirects are considered acceptable. This change aims to improve the utility of the link checker in maintaining high-quality documentation links."
