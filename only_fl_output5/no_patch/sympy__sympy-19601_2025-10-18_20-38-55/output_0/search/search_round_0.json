Thanks!\n</issue>"

Each API call must have concrete arguments as inputs."

        "content": "To start collecting the necessary code context for resolving the issue regarding the release of `sympy 1.6.1` and the fact that the patches submitted have been merged into SymPy master, it would be essential to look into how the version number is managed within the SymPy project and where the patches might have been applied. Due to the nature of the issue, which is more about release planning and integration of patches rather than a specific code bug, our focus should be on version management files or mechanisms and the location these patches could have been applied to.\n\nGiven this, we should:\n1. Search for files or code snippets that are responsible for defining the project's version. This often includes setup files or central configuration files.\n2. Identify any contribution or patch management guidelines, changelogs, or files that would indicate the integration of the mentioned patches.\n\nAssuming SymPy follows standard Python project practices, version information might be set in `setup.py` or possibly in a `__version__.py` file. Similarly, patch integrations are typically documented in `CHANGELOG` or `HISTORY` files, or directly within specific files if the project is structured around modular contributions. \n\nTherefore, I recommend the following API calls to start gathering the necessary context:\n- `search_code(\"version=\")`\n- `search_code(\"__version__\")`\n- `search_code(\"CHANGELOG\")`\n- `search_code(\"HISTORY\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to find where the versioning is defined and to locate any changelogs or historical documents that could provide insights into the versions and patches."
