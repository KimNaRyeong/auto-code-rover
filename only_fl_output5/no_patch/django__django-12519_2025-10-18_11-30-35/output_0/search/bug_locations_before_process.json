        "intended_behavior": "This method should be reviewed and potentially updated to ensure that all annotations, especially those resulting in subqueries, are correctly included in the 'GROUP BY' clause of the query. The method must gather and include these fields to preserve the distinctness of results, which was the behavior seen in earlier Django versions (e.g., 2.2.9). The adjustment should not remove or overlook any annotated fields, regardless of their complexity, ensuring that the SQL output is constructed to produce distinct results as intended."

This will ensure that such fields are correctly interpreted and included in query constructs, such as 'GROUP BY' clauses, when necessary. This adjustment facilitates the ORM\u2019s ability to handle complex annotations, maintaining the integrity and intended function of these queries."
