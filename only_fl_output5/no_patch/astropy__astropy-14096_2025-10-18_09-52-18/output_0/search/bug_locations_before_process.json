        "intended_behavior": "The `__getattr__` method should preserve its existing functionality of dynamically accessing attributes, handling frame attributes, accessing `_sky_coord_frame`, and frame transformation. However, the handling of the AttributeError needs to be enhanced to better distinguish between an attribute that truly doesn't exist on the object and an attribute that fails to be accessed by a custom property or method defined in subclasses. When a custom property or method attempts to access a non-existing attribute, the error message should accurately reflect the missing attribute (e.g., `random_attr`) rather than the intermediary property or method (e.g., `prop`). This could involve implementing a check to see if the AttributeError occurred during the access of a custom-defined property or method and, if so, adjust the error message accordingly. This approach aims to aid in debugging by ensuring that error messages accurately report the source of the error. A potential strategy for this could involve a mechanism within `__getattr__` or a decorator applied to custom properties/methods in subclasses to catch and re-raise AttributeError with modified messages that pinpoint the actual missing attribute. This modification should take care not to interfere with the dynamic attribute access and transformation capabilities already present in the SkyCoord class."
