Given the constraints and requirements, I'll provide you with an updated script. Please ensure that your Python environment is properly set up with the necessary dependencies, including `astropy` and `packaging`, as the error you encountered suggests an issue with the environment setup rather than the reproducibility code itself.

Here's a version of `reproducer.py` designed to test the specific issue with the subclass of `SkyCoord` and the misleading attribute access message. This script follows your request to exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed and to raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is still present.

```python
import sys

# Wrap the attempt to import astropy inside a try-except block to handle the possible import error gracefully.
try:
    import astropy.coordinates as coord
except ModuleNotFoundError as e:
    print("Required module 'astropy' not found. Please ensure it is installed in your environment.", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class CustomCoord(coord.SkyCoord):
    @property
    def prop(self):
        return self.random_attr

def main():
    try:
        c = CustomCoord('00h42m30s', '+41d12m00s', frame='icrs')
        c.prop
    except AttributeError as e:
        if "no attribute 'prop'" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("The misleading error message issue regarding 'prop' is present.")
        elif "no attribute 'random_attr'" in str(e):
            print("Correctly identifies the missing attribute 'random_attr'.")
            sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("An unexpected error occurred.", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)
    print("The issue appears to be resolved.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script ensures the test proceeds as intended:
- It tries to extend `SkyCoord` and access a non-existing attribute, which should trigger an `AttributeError`.
- It checks if the error message accurately reflects the root cause of the error (missing `random_attr` vs. the misleading message about `prop`).
- It uses the `print_stacktrace` function to print errors accurately for debugging purposes.

Again, ensure that all dependencies, including `astropy` and any others needed, are properly installed and available in your environment before running this script.
