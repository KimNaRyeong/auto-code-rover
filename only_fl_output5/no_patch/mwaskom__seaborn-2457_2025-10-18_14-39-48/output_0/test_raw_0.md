This script aims to check if the issue with `sns.lineplot` ignoring `ci=None` is still present by looking for a specific warning it should emit regarding `ci=None`. If the warning is not found, it raises an `AssertionError` indicating the problem is still present. If the script detects the issue has been fixed (i.e., no `AssertionError` is raised by `check_for_warning`), it will proceed and exit with code 0. However, since the actual implementation of `sns.lineplot` does not change the behavior and expectations dynamically, this script focuses on demonstrating how such an issue can be programmatically checked based on the description provided. 

Future modifications may be necessary to accurately reflect the evolving behavior of `seaborn` or adjustments to the issue's specifics.
