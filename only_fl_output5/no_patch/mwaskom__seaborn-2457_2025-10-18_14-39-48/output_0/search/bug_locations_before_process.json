        "intended_behavior": "Within the lineplot method, specifically at the handling of the ci parameter (errorbar = _deprecate_ci(errorbar, ci)), the code should issue a warning when ci=None is explicitly used by the caller. This warning should inform the user that passing ci=None is deprecated (or should be avoided) and recommend the use of errorbar=None directly instead, to achieve the intended outcome without specifying ci. The logic should then treat ci=None as if errorbar=None had been passed, ensuring backward compatibility while guiding users towards the new usage pattern. This behavior maintains the existing functionality (i.e., nullifying confidence intervals in the plot) while enhancing user communication and preparing for a potential future removal or change in the handling of the ci argument."
