Within the issue, it's indicated that the issue arises due to `LEVELNAME_FMT_REGEX` failing to match the log format string when the precision part is present.\n\nTo get started, we will:\n\n1. Search for the `ColoredLevelFormatter` class to understand its structure and to find where `LEVELNAME_FMT_REGEX` is defined.\n2. Look at the method(s) in the `ColoredLevelFormatter` class that utilizes `LEVELNAME_FMT_REGEX` to see how it's being used during log formatting.\n\nLet's start with these search API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"ColoredLevelFormatter\")`\n- `search_code(\"LEVELNAME_FMT_REGEX\")`"
