Certainly, here is how you could create a `reproducer.py` file to automate checking whether the `SeqFormula` output issue is present when running the script with Python 3 in the provided project environment. This script will attempt to reproduce the given issue by checking the string representation of the `SeqFormula` in Sympy for backslash-escaped square brackets.

```python
import sympy as sp

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    k, m, n = sp.symbols('k m n', integer=True)
    sp.init_printing()

    seq = sp.SeqFormula(n**2, (n, 0, sp.oo))
    seq_str = sp.pretty(seq)

    # We expect the square brackets to not be backslash-escaped
    expected_substr = "[0, 1, 4, 9, \\ldots ]"
    # This checks both issues: the presence of backslash-escaped brackets and the correct rendering of \ldots
    if '\\left\\[' in seq_str or '\\right\\]' in seq_str or expected_substr not in seq_str:
        error_message = 'SeqFormula() display issue: backslash-escaped brackets or incorrect sequence rendering.'
        try:
            assert '\\left\\[' not in seq_str and '\\right\\]' not in seq_str and expected_substr in seq_str, error_message
        except AssertionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1) # Exit code 1 for a failure state
    else:
        print("No issue detected with SeqFormula display.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script will do the following:
1. Initialize the required symbols with Sympy and create a `SeqFormula`.
2. Convert the `SeqFormula` to a string representation used typically in a Jupyter Notebook environment by using `sp.pretty()`.
3. Check if the string representation includes the specific backslash-escaped square brackets or does not contain the correctly rendered sequence without escaping.
4. If the issue is detected (either by identifying backslash escapes or by failing to find the correctly formatted string), it asserts an error, prints a stack trace, and exits with a non-zero status code to indicate failure.
5. If no problem is found, it prints a confirmation message and exits with a zero status code to indicate success.
