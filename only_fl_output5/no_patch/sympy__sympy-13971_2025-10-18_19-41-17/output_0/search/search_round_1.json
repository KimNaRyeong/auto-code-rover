        "content": "Analyzing the returned information, we have found the presence of the `SeqFormula` class within the `sympy/series/sequences.py` file. This class appears to manage the creation and operations on sequence formulas within the SymPy library. The information provided indicates that the class contains methods for creating new instances (`__new__`), accessing the formula (`formula` property), evaluating a coefficient for a given point (`_eval_coeff`), and operations for addition and multiplication (`_add`, `_mul`, and `coeff_mul`). These methods suggest that `SeqFormula` supports constructing mathematical sequence expressions and defines arithmetic operations on those sequences.\n\nGiven the issue description, the bug pertains to the formatting of `SeqFormula` output when rendered in Jupyter notebooks \u2013 particularly, the incorrect escaping of square brackets. Since neither `to_latex` nor `_repr_latex_` methods were found in `SeqFormula`, it implies that the LaTeX representation (used for rendering in Jupyter notebooks) is handled elsewhere. This could be managed by either a general rendering method that `SeqFormula` inherits from or by external functions responsible for converting SymPy objects to their LaTeX or other representational formats for display.\n\nGiven this context, my subsequent steps should focus on understanding how SymPy objects, specifically instances of `SeqFormula`, are converted into formats suitable for display in Jupyter. This includes:\n\n1. Investigating the inheritance hierarchy of `SeqFormula` to see if there is a parent class method responsible for the rendering. It's crucial since `SeqFormula` didn't directly implement `_repr_latex_`.\n2. Exploring any utility functions or external methods that handle the conversion of SymPy expressions to LaTeX strings, which might process or modify the expression representations, including how brackets are handled.\n\nTo address these points, I propose the following API calls:\n\n1. To explore the inheritance and potentially identify any relevant superclass implementations impacting rendering:\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"SeqExpr\", \"sympy/series/sequences.py\")`\n2. Since direct searches for `to_latex` and `_repr_latex_` in `SeqFormula` returned no results, investigating general mechanisms for LaTeX conversion in SymPy might be necessary:\n   - `search_method(\"to_latex\")`\n3. Additionally, exploring if there are any utility functions or configurations that govern how expressions are formatted for Jupyter notebooks:\n   - `search_code(\"latex\")`\nThese steps aim to uncover the mechanisms by which `SeqFormula` objects are rendered in Jupyter and identify where the issue with bracket escaping might originate."
