This could mean either properly escaping these characters or enhancing the error message to explain why two seemingly identical strings do not match. The aim is to preserve the functionality of using regular expressions for matching while improving user feedback for failed matches."

This method should test scenarios where the expected and actual error messages are visually identical but differ in ways that are not immediately obvious, such as escaped versus unescaped characters. It should verify that the output clarifies this distinction, possibly by indicating whether the comparison was done using literal strings or regex patterns."
