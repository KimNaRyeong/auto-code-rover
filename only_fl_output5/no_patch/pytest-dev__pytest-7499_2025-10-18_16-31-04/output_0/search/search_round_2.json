The issue describes a problem with how pytest's `raises` is comparing strings, possibly implying the need to look into pytest's own implementation or extensions/plugins that might be adapting its behavior. However, the issue is more likely related to the user's code and how they are using `pytest.raises`.\n\nGiven the information, it seems that the problem might not be with `pytest.raises` itself but with how the match is handled when comparing error messages, potentially an issue with handling regex patterns or string formatting. The user's example suggests a custom exception (`MismatchedIndexValueError`) and the usage of formatted strings.\n\nI'll perform the following searches to gather relevant context:\n\n1. **Search for the custom exception definition.** This will help understand if there's any custom handling of messages that might affect how `match` is used.\n\n2. **Inspect how `pytest.raises` usage is implemented in the provided context**, in case there are custom wrappers or utilities influencing its behavior.\n\n3. **Look for occurrences of similar string formatting** in 'with pytest.raises' statements to see if this issue is part of a broader pattern or an isolated case.\n\nGiven this, the API calls will be:\n\n- `search_class(\"MismatchedIndexValueError\")`: To find where this exception is defined and understand its structure.\n- `search_code(\"with pytest.raises\")`: To find usage patterns of pytest.raises in the codebase, focusing on how `match` is being used.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point to address the issue comprehensively."

MismatchedIndexValueError Class\n- **Result**: The search for the class `MismatchedIndexValueError` yielded no results.\n- **Implications**: Given that this error class isn't found in the project, it might be an external dependency, a user-defined exception that wasn't correctly referenced, or possibly a typo in the issue description. Without direct references to this class, we cannot immediately tie it to the reported bug, but this does suggest the issue might lie in how exceptions are being matched rather than in the definition of exceptions themselves.\n\n#### 2. Usage Patterns of `with pytest.raises`\n- **Result**: 204 snippets found containing `with pytest.raises` across various files, with a significant number located in `testing/python/raises.py` (29 matches).\n- **Analysis**:\n    - These snippets show how `pytest.raises` is commonly used throughout the codebase for exception testing. \n    - The reported bug involves a misunderstanding or a confusing behavior when it comes to matching exceptions, especially when the match is a dynamically formatted string.\n    - The high concentration of matches in `testing/python/raises.py` suggests this file is central to how pytest handles exceptions and matches them in tests.\n    - Given the user's confusion over seemingly identical strings not matching, the intended behavior would involve either improving error messaging to clarify why matches fail or adjusting the matching mechanism itself (for instance, by better handling special characters like parentheses in regex comparisons).\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context\n\nWhile the initial search provided a broad overview, specific follow-up looks are needed to better understand the detailed workings and potentially identify exactly where improvements could be made.\n\n1. **Review Implementation in `testing/python/raises.py`**\n    - Given the concentration of relevant code in this file, it's a prime candidate for closer inspection. Specifically, we need to understand how match parameters are processed and compared against raised exceptions.\n    - **API Call**: `search_code_in_file(\"match=\", \"testing/python/raises.py\")` to understand how match arguments are handled.\n\n2. **Check Error Formatting and Comparison Logic**\n    - Given the issue involves error message comparison, examining the code that handles these comparisons might reveal why seemingly identical strings do not match.\n    - **API Call**: `search_method(\"pytest.raises\")` to see if we can pinpoint the handling of the `match` parameter within a generic context.\n\nThese steps are aimed at identifying:\n- How `pytest.raises` matches error messages against the supplied pattern.\n- Whether there's specific logic that could lead to the described confusing behavior when matching formatted strings.\n- Potential areas where error messaging or the matching mechanism could be improved to avoid such confusion."

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. Use of `match=` in `testing/python/raises.py`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The snippets found in `testing/python/raises.py` related to `match=` are likely testing the `match` parameter's functionality within `pytest.raises`. This includes various scenarios: validating callable objects, handling falsey type errors, improper arguments, matching exceptions against a pattern, issues with string quoting in match failures, handling incorrect types for the `match` argument, and cases where the raised exception might be iterable.\n\n- **Relationship between this part of the code and the bug:**\n  The issue describes a scenario where `pytest.raises` with a `match` parameter doesn't behave as expected when the strings involved contain parentheses. The methods identified, particularly `test_raises_match` and `test_match_failure_string_quoting`, seem most directly related to this problem. They deal with how patterns are matched and potentially how special characters are handled or misinterpreted in such comparisons.\n\n- **Intended behavior of this part of the code:**\n  Given the issue, these tests and the underlying functionality they exercise should ensure that strings, especially those containing special characters (like parentheses), are correctly matched against exception messages. This could involve better handling of regex special characters or improving the clarity of error messages when matches fail. Essentially, the intended behavior here would be to allow users to easily see why a match failed, even in cases where the expected and actual messages look identical but may differ in aspects that aren't immediately obvious (e.g., regex-escaped characters vs. non-escaped).\n\n#### 2. Failure to Find `pytest.raises` Method Directly\n\n- **Implications of not finding `pytest.raises`:**\n  Not finding the method directly in the codebase suggests that `pytest.raises` is either implemented in a way that our search couldn't capture (e.g., dynamically defined or part of a plugin system) or that it exists in external dependencies not included in the direct codebase (like pytest's core library, separate from the project).\n\n- **Next steps for context:**\n  This finding underscores the potential need to explore `pytest`'s external codebase for the implementation of `pytest.raises` or to refine the search to better capture where and how it's wrapped or extended within this project. Since `pytest.raises` is a widely used fixture, its core implementation might be well-documented in pytest documentation, or it might be necessary to review pytest's source code directly if modifications or wrappers within this project aren't the root cause.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the findings, it's clear that `testing/python/raises.py` particularly with methods like `test_raises_match` and `test_match_failure_string_quoting`, holds the most relevance to the reported issue. A deeper dive into these methods, understanding how they work, and potentially improving how they handle comparison and error messaging for matches, will be key to resolving the issue.\n\nFor additional context not provided by the present searches, considering examining external pytest documentation or source code, or refining searches to target how `pytest.raises` is specifically implemented or extended within this project, may be necessary."

The aim is to preserve the functionality of using regular expressions for matching while improving user feedback for failed matches.\n\n- **Location 2**:\n  - **File:** `testing/python/raises.py`\n  - **Method:** `test_match_failure_string_quoting`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The intended adjustment here is to ensure that the error messages clearly differentiate between the literal string intended by the user and the regex pattern used for matching. This method should test scenarios where the expected and actual error messages are visually identical but differ in ways that are not immediately obvious, such as escaped versus unescaped characters. It should verify that the output clarifies this distinction, possibly by indicating whether the comparison was done using literal strings or regex patterns.\n\nThese adjustments should ensure that the functionality to match exception messages with given strings or regex patterns is preserved, while also providing users with clearer, more helpful feedback when a match fails.
