        "intended_behavior": "The Django package's `setup.py` should be updated to only configure one primary entry point for Django's command-line utility, favoring the `django-admin` (without `.py` extension) to align with Python's naming conventions for scripts. This implies removing or commenting out the `scripts` directive that includes `django-admin.py` and ensuring `entry_points` correctly maps `django-admin` to `django.core.management.execute_from_command_line`. This would mitigate the redundancy and potential confusion of maintaining two scripts with identical functionalities."
