        "content": "To resolve the issue described, we need to understand how Django serves the default 404 page in non-debug mode (`DEBUG=False`). Specifically, we're looking for the mechanism that generates or returns the 404 response. Knowing that Django is a web framework written in Python and understanding the issue description, let's target our search:\n\n1. **Search for where Django serves the default error pages:** Since this issue pertains to how Django serves a 404 page when `DEBUG` is set to `False`, it's likely handled by Django's views for HTTP error handling. In Django, views handling HTTP errors such as 404 or 500 errors could be defined in core files relating to HTTP response or views. An educated guess would suggest looking into files or methods that are directly responsible for handling HTTP error responses like a 404 error. \n\n2. **Search for the rendering mechanism of error pages:** Given the nature of the issue, we're also interested in the rendering mechanism that constructs the error page. This includes looking into templates or functions/methods that generate the HTML markup for these pages.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following API calls would be necessary to gather sufficient context for resolving the issue:\n\n- `search_method(\"page_not_found\")`: This should help us find the method responsible for handling 404 errors.\n- `search_code(\"DEBUG=False\")`: This should help us locate where the check for the debug mode happens in relation to serving error pages.\n- `search_method(\"render\")`: Considering that rendering a page usually involves a method like `render`, this search could lead us to how the final HTML for error pages is constructed.\n- `search_code(\"<h1>Not Found</h1>\")`: To find where the specific HTML for the 404 error page is defined or generated.\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of both the mechanisms that determine how error pages are served and how they are rendered, addressing the issue at hand."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context reveals important insights into how Django handles 404 error pages and its relationship with the described bug. Let\u2019s address the questions based on the search results:\n\n### 1. Analysis of `django/views/defaults.py` and `page_not_found` Function\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `page_not_found` function in `django/views/defaults.py` is Django's default handler for 404 errors. It attempts to render a template named by the `ERROR_404_TEMPLATE_NAME` constant. If it fails to find this template (e.g., because it does not exist), it falls back to a hardcoded string containing minimal HTML markup for a 404 response.\n\n#### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\nThe described bug relates directly to this function. In `DEBUG=False` mode, instead of serving a fully formed HTML page (with `<html>` and `<body>` tags) for a 404 error, it serves only the hardcoded string without these tags. This behavior is observed when the `ERROR_404_TEMPLATE_NAME` template is not found, or an error occurs during its rendering, which leads to the fallback mechanism being invoked.\n\n#### What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\nThe intended behavior, as described in the issue, would be to ensure that even the default or fallback error page (for 404s) includes a basic but complete HTML document structure (`<html>`, `<body>`, etc.), not just the `<h1>` and `<p>` tags. This would make the error page more compliant with web standards and possibly more user-friendly or customizable through CSS.\n\n### 2. Analysis of DEBUG=False Context\n\n#### What does this part of the code show?\nThe search for `DEBUG=False` returned snippets from `django/utils/log.py` and `django/views/csrf.py`, demonstrating how Django behaves differently depending on the `DEBUG` setting. For instance, logging behavior changes based on the `DEBUG` value, highlighting Django's differential handling of errors and logging depending on whether the app is in debug mode or not.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug?\nWhile these specific snippets do not directly address the handling of 404 pages, they contextualize how Django modifies behavior based on `DEBUG` settings. This differential behavior is crucial because it explains why the bug does not manifest when `DEBUG=True`\u2014as full, correct HTML pages are served in debug mode.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nGiven the findings:\n\n- The `page_not_found` function should be modified or extended to ensure that the fallback content is wrapped in a full HTML document structure. This requires adjusting the fallback mechanism to include the missing `<html>` and `<body>` tags.\n  \n- Considering customization, a check could be added to see if a user-customized 404 template exists and use it before falling back to the hardcoded response. This would allow developers to specify their error pages fully in `DEBUG=False` mode.\n\nTo patch the bug, we could enhance the fallback logic in `page_not_found` to produce a complete HTML document by default. Furthermore, documentation or guidance on creating a custom `404.html` could help developers ensure their error pages meet their standards and are fully formed HTML documents in production environments."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

This means wrapping the current `<h1>Not Found</h1><p>The requested resource was not found on this server.</p>` string within `<html>` and `<body>` tags. The modified part should look something like this:\n     ```python\n     template = Engine().from_string(\n     '''\n     <!DOCTYPE html>\n     <html lang=\"en\">\n     <head>\n         <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n         <title>Not Found</title>\n     </head>\n     <body>\n         <h1>Not Found</h1>\n         <p>The requested resource was not found on this server.</p>\n     </body>\n     </html>\n     ''')\n     ```\n     This change preserves the existing functionality by still providing a message for 404 errors but enhances the response to be a correct HTML document, adhering to web standards and improving the user experience even in non-debug modes."
