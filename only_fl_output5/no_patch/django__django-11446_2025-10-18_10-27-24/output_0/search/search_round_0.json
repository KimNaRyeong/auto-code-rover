        "content": "To resolve the issue described, we need to understand how Django serves the default 404 page in non-debug mode (`DEBUG=False`). Specifically, we're looking for the mechanism that generates or returns the 404 response. Knowing that Django is a web framework written in Python and understanding the issue description, let's target our search:\n\n1. **Search for where Django serves the default error pages:** Since this issue pertains to how Django serves a 404 page when `DEBUG` is set to `False`, it's likely handled by Django's views for HTTP error handling. In Django, views handling HTTP errors such as 404 or 500 errors could be defined in core files relating to HTTP response or views. An educated guess would suggest looking into files or methods that are directly responsible for handling HTTP error responses like a 404 error. \n\n2. **Search for the rendering mechanism of error pages:** Given the nature of the issue, we're also interested in the rendering mechanism that constructs the error page. This includes looking into templates or functions/methods that generate the HTML markup for these pages.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following API calls would be necessary to gather sufficient context for resolving the issue:\n\n- `search_method(\"page_not_found\")`: This should help us find the method responsible for handling 404 errors.\n- `search_code(\"DEBUG=False\")`: This should help us locate where the check for the debug mode happens in relation to serving error pages.\n- `search_method(\"render\")`: Considering that rendering a page usually involves a method like `render`, this search could lead us to how the final HTML for error pages is constructed.\n- `search_code(\"<h1>Not Found</h1>\")`: To find where the specific HTML for the 404 error page is defined or generated.\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of both the mechanisms that determine how error pages are served and how they are rendered, addressing the issue at hand."
