        "intended_behavior": "The `quantile` method is the right place to intercept the error since this is where `np.nanpercentile` is called, which operates on percentiles [0, 100] instead of quantiles [0, 1]. To resolve the issue without altering the existing functionality for computing quantiles, the method should validate the `q` value(s) to ensure they lie within the [0, 1] range before proceeding with the calculation. If the value is outside this range, the method should raise a `ValueError` with a corrected error message \"Quantiles must be in the range [0, 1]\" to accurately reflect the expected input. This change will provide users with an accurate error message that aligns with the xarray quantile computation expectations, thus preserving the method's existing functionality while enhancing error message clarity."
