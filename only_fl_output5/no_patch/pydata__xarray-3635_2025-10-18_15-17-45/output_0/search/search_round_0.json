        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to find where the `quantile` method is implemented for the `DataArray` class, as this is where the percentile value is being incorrectly checked. Also, it would be useful to see the use of `np.nanpercentile` since the issue indicates that the wrong value range check stems from wrapping this NumPy function. Here are the necessary API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"DataArray\")` - This will help us find where the `DataArray` class is defined within the xarray codebase.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"quantile\", \"DataArray\")` - To find the implementation of the `quantile` method within the `DataArray` class.\n3. `search_code(\"np.nanpercentile\")` - To locate where `np.nanpercentile` is used, which might directly relate to the error handling and the incorrect error message being raised."
