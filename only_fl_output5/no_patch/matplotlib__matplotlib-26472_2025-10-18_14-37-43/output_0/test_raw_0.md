This script attempts to replicate the issue in a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py`. It uses a context manager to switch the backend of matplotlib to `Qt5Agg` for GUI window creation and then tries to switch back to `inline` after plotting. It asserts that at least one matplotlib window should be present (assuming it does not close immediately due to the backend switch). If the assertion fails (meaning the issue is present, and a window was not found or was closed immediately), it prints the stack trace and exits with code 1. If the script runs successfully and the issue is resolved or not replicable, it exits with code 0.
