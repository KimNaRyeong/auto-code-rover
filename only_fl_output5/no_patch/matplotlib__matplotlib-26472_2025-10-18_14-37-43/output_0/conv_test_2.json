This makes it very difficult to switch cleanly between backends within a notebook. The two mediocre workarounds I can see are:\r\n - always specify the backend before plotting (since you can't automatically \"switch back\")\r\n - use `plt.show(block=True)` and switch back to `inline` after the user is done with the GUI figure. This has the downside of locking the Notebook execution while the figure is live.\r\n\r\n**Code for reproduction**\r\n\r\nThe linked gist shows what I'd like to accomplish which is a context manager that enables matplotlib plotting in a GUI window from within a Notebook that is otherwise using the `inline` backend. Basically I want the notebook to use inline (for a variety of reasons), but I occasionally wish I could interact with the data in a separate figure. \r\nhttps://gist.github.com/flutefreak7/65d824358122360911e2d4c43085007a\r\n\r\nAs a side note, easy switching between `inline` and `notebook`/`widget` backends would also scratch part of this itch, but the interactive notebook backends still don't enable full screen usage or easily throwing a plot on another monitor. `ipyvolume` has full screen figured out, so that seems doable.\r\n\r\nHere's the context manager I wish worked:\r\n```python\r\n# Paste your code here\r\n@contextmanager\r\ndef window(block=False):\r\n    %matplotlib qt5\r\n    plt.ioff()\r\n    yield\r\n    plt.show()\r\n    # The switch back to inline closes the qt5 plot\r\n    plt.ion()\r\n    %matplotlib inline\r\n\r\nwith window():\r\n    plt.plot([1, 3, 2])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Actual outcome**\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the above code is that a plot window flashes into existence for a split second, then is closed when the `%matplotlib inline` call is processed.\r\n\r\n**Expected outcome**\r\n\r\nIt would be great if plots created with the qt5 backend could stay visible while other plots with the inline backend were also being created.  If use `%gui qt` (to establish a reliable event loop) and create a bunch of Qt windows by other means, they live concurrently with the Notebook as long as the kernel is alive. I'd like matplotlib GUI figures to be able to live on regardless of the current backend.\r\n\r\n**Matplotlib version**\r\n<!--Please specify your platform and versions of the relevant libraries you are using:-->\r\n  * Operating system:\r\n  * Matplotlib version: 3.1.1\r\n  * Matplotlib backend (`print(matplotlib.get_backend())`): `inline` and `qt5agg`\r\n  * Python version: 3.7.3\r\n  * Jupyter version (if applicable):\r\n```\r\njupyter                           1.0.0\r\njupyter-client                    5.3.4\r\njupyter-console                   6.0.0\r\njupyter-contrib-core              0.3.3\r\njupyter-contrib-nbextensions      0.5.1\r\njupyter-core                      4.6.0\r\njupyter-highlight-selected-word   0.2.0\r\njupyter-latex-envs                1.4.6\r\njupyter-nbextensions-configurator 0.4.1\r\njupyterlab                        1.0.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--Please tell us how you installed matplotlib and python e.g., from source, pip, conda-->\r\n<!--If you installed from conda, please specify which channel you used if not the default-->\r\n\r\n\n"

        "content": "Given the context of the previous attempt and the encountered error regarding the interactive backend requirement for 'Qt5Agg', we face a challenge reproducing the original issue directly within a purely script-based context without an interactive GUI session like that provided by Jupyter Notebooks or an interactive Python session with GUI capabilities. \n\nThe error message `ImportError: Cannot load backend 'Qt5Agg'` indicates that the 'Qt5Agg' backend cannot be used in a headless environment where a GUI cannot be displayed. It seems the environment in which the `reproducer.py` script was executed does not support GUIs. This could be due to running the script in a headless server environment, for example, in a continuous integration pipeline, Docker container without GUI support, or SSH terminal without X11 forwarding. \n\nConsequently, reproducing this specific issue related to switching between matplotlib backends and observing GUI window behavior requires an environment where PyQt5 (or another compatible GUI toolkit) can create and display windows. This essentially necessitates an environment set up with a display server where matplotlib can interact with GUI toolkits.\n\nTo properly attempt a reproduction of the issue in an environment that would throw an `AssertionError` if the issue persists and exits cleanly (exit code 0) if fixed, a new approach is proposed. However, given the limitation described above, please note this proposed script still might not directly address the initially described GUI window issue but aims to outline a simplified approach for backend verification:\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\nimport sys\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef verify_backend_switch():\n    import matplotlib\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    initial_backend = matplotlib.get_backend()\n\n    # Attempt to switch to Qt5Agg (assuming GUI support is available)\n    try:\n        matplotlib.use('Qt5Agg', force=True)\n        qt_backend = matplotlib.get_backend()\n        assert qt_backend == 'Qt5Agg', \"Switch to Qt5Agg backend failed.\"\n    \n        # Switch back to the initial backend\n        matplotlib.use(initial_backend, force=True)\n        current_backend = matplotlib.get_backend()\n        assert current_backend == initial_backend, \"Switch back to the initial backend failed.\"\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate failure\n\n    print(f\"Success: Backend was switched from {initial_backend} to Qt5Agg and back again.\")\n    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate success\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    verify_backend_switch()\n```\n\nThis script attempts to switch matplotlib's backend to 'Qt5Agg' and back to its original state, verifying each switch with assertions. It presupposes that the execution environment supports a GUI display. If assertions fail or exceptions are raised due to backend incompatibilities, it will print the stack trace and exit with code 1."
