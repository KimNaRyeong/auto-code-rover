Given the context of the previous attempt and the encountered error regarding the interactive backend requirement for 'Qt5Agg', we face a challenge reproducing the original issue directly within a purely script-based context without an interactive GUI session like that provided by Jupyter Notebooks or an interactive Python session with GUI capabilities. 

The error message `ImportError: Cannot load backend 'Qt5Agg'` indicates that the 'Qt5Agg' backend cannot be used in a headless environment where a GUI cannot be displayed. It seems the environment in which the `reproducer.py` script was executed does not support GUIs. This could be due to running the script in a headless server environment, for example, in a continuous integration pipeline, Docker container without GUI support, or SSH terminal without X11 forwarding. 

Consequently, reproducing this specific issue related to switching between matplotlib backends and observing GUI window behavior requires an environment where PyQt5 (or another compatible GUI toolkit) can create and display windows. This essentially necessitates an environment set up with a display server where matplotlib can interact with GUI toolkits.

To properly attempt a reproduction of the issue in an environment that would throw an `AssertionError` if the issue persists and exits cleanly (exit code 0) if fixed, a new approach is proposed. However, given the limitation described above, please note this proposed script still might not directly address the initially described GUI window issue but aims to outline a simplified approach for backend verification:

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def verify_backend_switch():
    import matplotlib
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    initial_backend = matplotlib.get_backend()

    # Attempt to switch to Qt5Agg (assuming GUI support is available)
    try:
        matplotlib.use('Qt5Agg', force=True)
        qt_backend = matplotlib.get_backend()
        assert qt_backend == 'Qt5Agg', "Switch to Qt5Agg backend failed."
    
        # Switch back to the initial backend
        matplotlib.use(initial_backend, force=True)
        current_backend = matplotlib.get_backend()
        assert current_backend == initial_backend, "Switch back to the initial backend failed."
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate failure

    print(f"Success: Backend was switched from {initial_backend} to Qt5Agg and back again.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate success

if __name__ == "__main__":
    verify_backend_switch()
```

This script attempts to switch matplotlib's backend to 'Qt5Agg' and back to its original state, verifying each switch with assertions. It presupposes that the execution environment supports a GUI display. If assertions fail or exceptions are raised due to backend incompatibilities, it will print the stack trace and exit with code 1.
