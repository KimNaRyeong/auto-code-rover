        "content": "<issue>Switching to inline backend closes GUI windows\n### Bug report\n**Bug summary**\nWhen a plot is made with the `qt5` backend on and then the backend is changed to `inline`, the active plot window(s) are closed. This makes it very difficult to switch cleanly between backends within a notebook. The two mediocre workarounds I can see are:\n- always specify the backend before plotting (since you can't automatically \"switch back\")\n- use `plt.show(block=True)` and switch back to `inline` after the user is done with the GUI figure. This has the downside of locking the Notebook execution while the figure is live.\n**Code for reproduction**\nThe linked gist shows what I'd like to accomplish which is a context manager that enables matplotlib plotting in a GUI window from within a Notebook that is otherwise using the `inline` backend. Basically I want the notebook to use inline (for a variety of reasons), but I occasionally wish I could interact with the data in a separate figure.\nhttps://gist.github.com/flutefreak7/65d824358122360911e2d4c43085007a\nAs a side note, easy switching between `inline` and `notebook`/`widget` backends would also scratch part of this itch, but the interactive notebook backends still don't enable full screen usage or easily throwing a plot on another monitor. `ipyvolume` has full screen figured out, so that seems doable.\nHere's the context manager I wish worked:\n```python\n# Paste your code here\n@contextmanager\ndef window(block=False):\n%matplotlib qt5\nplt.ioff()\nyield\nplt.show()\n# The switch back to inline closes the qt5 plot\nplt.ion()\n%matplotlib inline\nwith window():\nplt.plot([1, 3, 2])\n```\n**Actual outcome**\nThe outcome of the above code is that a plot window flashes into existence for a split second, then is closed when the `%matplotlib inline` call is processed.\n**Expected outcome**\nIt would be great if plots created with the qt5 backend could stay visible while other plots with the inline backend were also being created.  If use `%gui qt` (to establish a reliable event loop) and create a bunch of Qt windows by other means, they live concurrently with the Notebook as long as the kernel is alive. I'd like matplotlib GUI figures to be able to live on regardless of the current backend.\n**Matplotlib version**\n* Operating system:\n* Matplotlib version: 3.1.1\n* Matplotlib backend (`print(matplotlib.get_backend())`): `inline` and `qt5agg`\n* Python version: 3.7.3\n* Jupyter version (if applicable):\n```\njupyter                           1.0.0\njupyter-client                    5.3.4\njupyter-console                   6.0.0\njupyter-contrib-core              0.3.3\njupyter-contrib-nbextensions      0.5.1\njupyter-core                      4.6.0\njupyter-highlight-selected-word   0.2.0\njupyter-latex-envs                1.4.6\njupyter-nbextensions-configurator 0.4.1\njupyterlab                        1.0.5\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context gives us an insight into how matplotlib interacts with backends, the interactive mode, and the presenting of figures, all of which are crucial for understanding the reported issue.\n\n### Analysis of the Collected Context\n\n1. **`matplotlib` Magic Command Not Found**: \n   - The search for the `matplotlib` method did not return any results. This likely means the command `%matplotlib` is part of IPython/Jupyter's special command set (magic commands) and not directly exposed as a method in matplotlib's codebase. The implementation detail of this command is more within the IPython or Jupyter notebook handling mechanism, not matplotlib itself. We might need to explore IPython's documentation or source code to understand how this command works in depth.\n\n2. **`show` Method Instances**:\n   - Multiple instances of a `show` method were found across various backend implementations (`_backend_gtk.py`, `_backend_tk.py`, `backend_qt.py`, etc.). This indicates that the `show` method's behavior is indeed backend-specific. Given the issue description, during the backend switch from `qt5` to `inline`, the `show` method relevant to the `qt5` context might be getting overridden or reinterpreted in a way that doesn't preserve the existing opened GUI window. We need to look into how these backend specifics can be managed to keep the GUI window persistent during a backend switch.\n\n3. **Interactive Mode (`ion()`, `ioff()`) Context**:\n   - The `ion()` and `ioff()` methods control whether matplotlib operates in interactive mode. When interactive mode is off (`ioff()`), figures do not automatically show until specifically instructed with `plt.show()`. These methods are integral to how figures are displayed in different contexts (e.g., inline in notebooks vs. external GUI windows). The issue likely stems from a misunderstanding or mishandling of the transition between these interactive modes when switching backends, affecting whether and how figures remain open.\n\n### Linking to the Reported Issue\n\n- The issue reports that switching from `qt5` to `inline` backend unintentionally closes GUI plot windows. Given the above context, this might be related to how the interactive mode is handled across backend switches and the behavior of `show` method under these circumstances. It looks like switching to `inline` backend might trigger something akin to an `ioff()`, which wouldn't normally close GUI windows but in the context of backend switching, it does.\n\n- **Intended Behavior in Relation to the Code**:\n  - Ideally, when working within a context that temporarily switches to `qt5` for GUI manipulation and then goes back to `inline` for notebook inline plotting, the previously opened GUI windows should persist beyond the backend transition. This would require a way to maintain interactive GUI windows independently of the backend currently in use for new plots. There's likely a need for more explicit control over the lifecycle of GUI windows across backend changes, possibly by preserving their interactive state or otherwise preventing their closure upon a backend switch.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context and Resolution\n\nGiven the insights and limitations in the current context:\n\n1. **Explore IPython/Jupyter Documentation or Source Code**: Specifically, how `%matplotlib` magic commands interact with matplotlib's backend switching to identify potential mechanisms to keep GUI windows open across backend transitions.\n  \n2. **Detailed Review of Backend `show` Methods**:\n   - Investigating further into the `show` method implementations for `qt5` and how it behaves with `plt.ion()` and `plt.ioff()` would help understand the mechanism that might be causing windows to close. This could illuminate potential hooks or workaround approaches for keeping the GUI windows responsive and visible even when switching back to the `inline` backend.\n  \n3. **Explore Handling of Interactive Mode Across Backends**:\n   - Understanding if there's a way to globally control or isolate the interactive state of GUI windows independently of the backend being used for new plots could offer a direct solution to the reported problem.\n\nGiven the complexity and specific interplay of components (Jupyter/IPython, matplotlib, backend specifics), the resolution might require a nuanced approach or even changes at multiple levels (usage pattern, matplotlib internals, or notebook environment)."

The intended behavior here is to modify or supplement the existing `show` method so that it can check whether a transition from `qt5` to `inline` (or vice versa) is about to occur and, if so, implement a mechanism to preserve any open GUI windows. This might involve flagging figure windows that should remain open or decoupling the figure visibility state from the backend state.\n\n- **Location 2**: File: `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py`, Method: `ion` and `ioff`. While not necessarily faulty, these functions play a critical role in the described issue. The intended behavior might involve ensuring that switching interactive mode on or off does not inadvertently close GUI windows that were intended to remain open across backend transitions. This could involve adding context awareness to these methods to differentiate between a user-initiated interactive mode change and one that results from backend switching."
