Specifically, it could benefit from a retry mechanism in case of identified concurrency conflicts, such as when a directory is expected to be present but is not due to actions from parallel processes. Implementing a delay between retries could also help mitigate immediate collisions. Moreover, incorporating a mechanism to generate directory names with a randomized component (while still maintaining predictability and order where necessary) can reduce the likelihood of name clashes in highly concurrent environments."

This includes an improved method for assessing whether a lock file is 'dead' which might involve additional checks to ensure that its removal (and thus the directory's deletion) will not interfere with ongoing operations. If a lock file does not exist when expected, this condition should be handled gracefully to avoid FileNotFoundError. A possible implementation is to catch this specific exception and treat it as an indication that another process has already handled the lock file, in which case the directory can be considered for deletion only if additional checks confirm it's safe to do so."
