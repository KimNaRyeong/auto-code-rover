Search for the class where the issue occurs. Since the PairGrid and scatterplot functionalities are mentioned, let's start with the `PairGrid` class.\n   - `search_class(\"PairGrid\")`\n\n2. The error traceback involves several methods across multiple modules. Let's focus on the specific methods and code snippets referenced in the traceback. The first key method in the traceback is `_lookup_single` from the `_core.py` module.\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"_lookup_single\", \"_core.py\")`\n\n3. From the same ``_core.py`` module, the `__call__` method of a color handling class seems to be involved, as indicated by `c = self._hue_map(data[\"hue\"])`.\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"__call__\", \"_core.py\")`\n\n4. Given that the error does not occur when the `hue` keyword is used at the PairGrid creation and relates to the handling of categorical data for hue, it would be prudent to look into how seaborn processes `hue` parameters in scatterplot.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"scatterplot\", \"PairGrid\")`\n   - `search_code(\"hue=iris[\\\"species\\\"]\")` to understand how the hue parameter is intended to work across seaborn functionalities.\n\n5. The error message indicates a problem with handling non-numeric data for hue, suggesting there might be a need to review how seaborn's scatterplot manages non-numeric hues.\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"scatterplot\", \"_decorators.py\")` based on the decorator used in the traceback.\n\n6. To understand the changes between seaborn version 0.11.0 and 0.11.1, which could have led to the issue, it would be helpful to look for any change logs or version comparison utilities within the project documentation or codebase. However, as my current capabilities do not include directly accessing external change logs or versions, this step is conceptual rather than actionable through the API. \n\nThese steps focus on gathering more context around how the `PairGrid` and `scatterplot` functionalities interact with the `hue` parameter and how errors are handled during plotting, especially for categorical data."

        "content": "Based on the collected context and the outcomes of the API calls, let's analyze the information we have:\n\n1. **Analysis of `PairGrid` class from `seaborn/axisgrid.py`:**\n   - The `PairGrid` class in Seaborn is designed to facilitate the creation of a grid of subplots based on pairs of variables in a dataset, supporting the plotting of relationships between two variables as well as distributions of single variables. The constructor accepts a range of parameters including `hue`, which allows splitting the data into subsets based on a categorical variable, and plotting these subsets with different colors.\n   - **Relationship with the bug:** The issue is rooted in attempting to use the `hue` parameter within the `map` method calls (specifically `sns.scatterplot`) after initializing a `PairGrid` without assigning a `hue` at the initialization phase. This approach previously allowed for scatterplot visuals with hue variations and regression lines without hue-split, which seems to conflict with changes in newer versions of seaborn.\n   - **Intended behavior:** Ideally, the `PairGrid` should be versatile enough to allow for both the mapping of aesthetics based on hues post-initialization and consistent application of aesthetic traits like color based on categorical data across its subplots, even when those aesthetics are applied through mapping functions instead of at the grid initialization.\n\n2. **Failed searches for `_lookup_single` and `__call__` in `_core.py`:**\n   - These methods likely relate to internal mechanisms for mapping data values (in this case, categories of the `hue` variable) to visual attributes (like color). The failure to locate these methods suggests that either the path is incorrect or that my querying was based on a misunderstanding of the internal structure or file organization within Seaborn.\n   - Without direct insights from these methods, it's challenging to pinpoint how the category-to-color mapping glitches found in the newer version, but the error message points towards an exception raised during this mapping process, especially for non-numeric `hue` values.\n   \n3. **`scatterplot` method not found in `PairGrid`:**\n   - The `scatterplot` is not a method of the `PairGrid` class but instead a plotting function that can be passed to `PairGrid.map()`. This may have led to confusion in my initial request; understanding the implementation of `scatterplot` would require searching the correct module or file where it's defined.\n   \n4. **Code search failure for \"hue=iris[\\\"species\\\"]\":**\n   - This indicates either a limitation in the search criteria (too specific or too general) or a lack of direct examples in the codebase that match this pattern. Adjusting the approach to search for more general patterns or understanding of how `hue` is typically processed in seaborn plots might be more productive.\n\n5. **No method `scatterplot` found in `_decorators.py`:**\n   - This suggests an error in understanding which file handles the implementation of `scatterplot`. The method is likely within a different module, perhaps one dedicated to relational plots or similar.\n\nGiven the information from the successful search and the failed ones, the next steps in gathering more context could involve:\n- Searching within a correct file or module for the `scatterplot` function, as it's central to the issue but was not found. Maybe, starting with searching it in the entire codebase would help (`search_method(\"scatterplot\")`).\n- Investigating how seaborn handles hue parameter mappings might still be relevant. Given the failed attempts, a more direct approach could be trying to find where seaborn processes the `hue` parameter more generally instead of focusing on those specific, unsuccessfully located methods.\n\nThese approaches would provide a broader understanding of how seaborn intended for hues to be handled in scatter plots and how the newer versions' changes have affected this functionality, directly addressing the user's issue."
