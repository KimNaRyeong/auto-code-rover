Based on the detailed instructions and the given function to print the stack trace, here is how you can write a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` to reproduce the mentioned issue with Seaborn's `PairGrid` when assigning `hue` in the `map` method. This script will follow your guidelines, aiming to raise an `AssertionError` if the issue occurs and exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed.

```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    import seaborn as sns

    # Attempt to reproduce the issue
    iris = sns.load_dataset("iris")
    g = sns.PairGrid(iris, y_vars=["sepal_length", "sepal_width"], x_vars=["petal_length", "petal_width"])
    g.map(sns.scatterplot, hue=iris["species"])
    g.map(sns.regplot, scatter=False)

    # If no error occurred, assume the issue is fixed
    print("The issue appears to be fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    # If an exception occurred, we check if it's the specific issue reported
    if isinstance(e, KeyError) or isinstance(e, TypeError):
        raise AssertionError("The issue is confirmed to be present.") from e
    else:
        # Other exceptions may not be related to the reported issue
        print("An unexpected exception occurred, which may not be related to the reported issue.")
        sys.exit(1)
```

This script checks for the specific conditions described in the reported issue: failure due to `KeyError` or `TypeError` when assigning hue in the `map` method of `PairGrid`. The key aspects of reproducing the issue include:
- Loading the Iris dataset using Seaborn.
- Setting up a `PairGrid` without specifying `hue` in the constructor to plot scatter plots across a grid.
- Attempting to specify `hue` directly in the `map` method with `sns.scatterplot`, aiming to assign color based on categories but plotting a single regression line, which is said to cause problems in the later version of Seaborn.

Please ensure Seaborn and all its dependencies are correctly installed in your environment before executing this script.
