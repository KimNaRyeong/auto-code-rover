I understand your request to rewrite the Python script, taking into account the requirements for a print function and proper handling of success or failure in detecting the reported issue. Here is a revised version of the `reproducer.py` designed to match your instructions more closely:

```python
import seaborn as sns
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    try:
        iris = sns.load_dataset("iris")
        g = sns.PairGrid(iris, y_vars=["sepal_length", "sepal_width"], x_vars=["petal_length", "petal_width"])
        # Adjusted to correctly use hue argument
        g.map(sns.scatterplot, hue="species")
        g.map(sns.regplot, scatter=False)
        # Assuming the absence of KeyError or TypeError indicates the issue is fixed
        print("No issue detected.")
        return 0 # Exit with code 0 to indicate success/no issue
    except AssertionError as ae:
        raise ae # For custom assertions within try block
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Assuming presence of KeyError or TypeError indicates issue presence
        # Change AssertionError to a custom message if needed
        raise AssertionError("The issue is still present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    status = reproduce_issue()
    sys.exit(status)
```

This code attempts to closely match what appears to be problematic behavior related to `PairGrid` mapping in Seaborn, which throws the exceptions as quoted in the stack trace you've encountered. Note that any modifications to the actual behavior should ensure that the `AssertionError` is raised only when the specific error conditions related to issue reproduction are met.

Additionally, it's worth mentioning:
- Seaborn requires matplotlib to plot graphs, so please make sure matplotlib is properly installed in your environment.
- If the error does not exactly match the conditions being tested (i.e., it's related to a different aspect of the plotting library), the exception handling and assertions might need adjustment.
