This modified script attempts to specifically reproduce the issue as detailed, testing both the failure of tensor product power simplification directly and the success/failure of similar operations with substitutions. Each test case is wrapped in a `try-except` block to capture and print a formatted stack trace using `print_stacktrace(e)` when it encounters an `AssertionError`, indicating the presence of the issue.
