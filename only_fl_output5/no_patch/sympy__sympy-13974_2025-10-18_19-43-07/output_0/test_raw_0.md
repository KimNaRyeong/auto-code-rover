This script tests the given issue by asserting the expected behavior of tensor product simplifications in SymPy. If the assertions do not hold, indicating an existing issue, the script generates a stack trace using the custom `print_stacktrace` function for each failed assertion, accurately indicating the lines causing the failures. The script exits with code 0 only if none of the assertions fail, which according to the provided logic, will not happen until the underlying issue is fixed.
