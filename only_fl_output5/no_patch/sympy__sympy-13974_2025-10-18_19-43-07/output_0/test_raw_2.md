Given the feedback and the requirements, here is an updated version of `reproducer.py` designed to follow the instructions closely, including raising an `AssertionError` when the issue is present. The script will now better reflect the expected outcome when the issue is fixed or present.

```python
# reproducer.py

def main():
    from sympy import Symbol
    from sympy.physics.quantum import TensorProduct as tp
    from sympy.physics.quantum import tensor_product_simp as tps
    from sympy.physics.paulialgebra import Pauli
    
    a = Symbol('a', commutative=False)

    # Test case 1: Direct simplification of tensor product powers for basic elements
    try:
        t1 = tp(1, 1) * tp(1, 1)
        result1 = tps(t1)
        expected1 = tp(1, 1)**2
        assert result1 == expected1, "Failed to simplify tensor product power for basic elements"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

    # Test case 2: Simplification with substitution for basic elements
    try:
        result2 = tps(tp(1, 1) * tp(1, a)).subs(a, 1)
        expected2 = tp(1, 1)
        assert result2 == expected2, "Simplification with substitution failed for basic elements"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

    # Test case 3: Direct simplification of tensor product powers for Pauli matrices
    try:
        t2 = tp(1, Pauli(3)) * tp(1, Pauli(3))
        result3 = tps(t2)
        expected3 = tp(1, Pauli(3))**2
        assert result3 == expected3, "Failed to simplify tensor product power for Pauli matrices"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

    # Test case 4: Simplification with substitution for Pauli matrices
    try:
        result4 = tps(tp(1, Pauli(3)) * tp(1, a)).subs(a, Pauli(3))
        expected4 = tp(1, 1)
        assert result4 == expected4, "Simplification with substitution failed for Pauli matrices"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script now attempts to capture and assert the exact problems as specified, aiming to identify the inability to properly simplify tensor product powers through `tensor_product_simp` function, as well as handling cases with substitutions. Each test case has been adjusted to assert against an expected outcome that reflects the simplification or the lack thereof accurately. If the issue persists, the script will raise and catch `AssertionError`s, printing the stack trace for each encountered issue to assist in diagnosing and demonstrating the problem's location within the code.
