I understand your request and the expectations. Let's revise the standalone Python file `reproducer.py` to specifically target the formatting issue with exporting an Astropy table to HTML, ensuring it can cleanly reproduce the problem and adhere to the structure you requested with proper error handling and output evaluation.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from astropy.table import Table
    from io import StringIO
    import html

    try:
        # generate table
        t = Table([(1.23875234858e-24, 3.2348748432e-15), (2, 4)], names=('a', 'b'))
        tc = t.copy()  # copy of the table for manipulation

        # setup StringIO to capture HTML output
        with StringIO() as sp:
            tc.write(sp, format="html", formats={"a": lambda x: f"{x:.2e}"})
            html_output = sp.getvalue()

            # Check if "1.24e-24" and "3.23e-15" are in the produced HTML
            # Using html.unescape to ensure HTML entities are not affecting comparison
            unescaped_html_output = html.unescape(html_output)
            assert "1.24e-24" in unescaped_html_output, "'1.24e-24' formatting not found in HTML output"
            assert "3.23e-15" in unescaped_html_output, "'3.23e-15' formatting not found in HTML output"
            print("Formatting is correctly applied in the HTML output.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except Exception:
        import sys
        # Exit code 1 to indicate the script has caught an issue
        sys.exit(1)
    # Exit code 0 to indicate success
    sys.exit(0)
```

This revised script `reproducer.py` now specifically checks that the expected formatted strings `"1.24e-24"` and `"3.23e-15"` are found within the HTML output from an Astropy table when the specified format is applied to a column. If the formatting is not applied correctly, the script raises an `AssertionError`, displaying where the problem lies with the expected stack trace for debugging.

Executing `python3 reproducer.py` in the project root directory will:
- Raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, along with a detailed stack trace.
- Exit with code `0` (success) if the issue is not found, indicating the HTML formatting is working as expected.

This refined approach should provide a clear and efficient pathway to identifying and later confirming the resolution of the described issue with Astropy's table HTML formatting functionality.
