This Python file is organized to demonstrate and validate the issue with formatting HTML output in `astropy` as described. When the described issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError`, showing that the actual output does not match the expected formatted output, and it will print a stack trace leading to the assertion line that failed. This script can be placed in the root directory of the associated project and executed with the command `python3 reproducer.py`. If executed when the issue is still present, it will exit with code 1. After the bug is addressed, the script should exit successfully with code 0, indicating that the issue has been fixed.
