        "intended_behavior": "The `write` method within the `HTML` class should be enhanced to support the `formats` argument. When generating the HTML content from an Astropy table, the method must iterate through each column of data, check if a specific format has been provided for that column in the `formats` dictionary, and apply this formatting to each element of the column before embedding it in the HTML code. This behavior entails: - Parsing and applying the `formats` specification to column data before the conversion to HTML strings takes place. - Ensuring this processing step does not interfere with existing functionalities related to HTML sanitization, CSS/JS application, or handling of multi-dimensional data columns. - Retaining the performance and security considerations, especially regarding data sanitization if the column values are modified by the `formats` specification. Importantly, this update should not affect users who do not use the `formats` argument, i.e., the default behavior (without specifying `formats`) remains unchanged."
