        "intended_behavior": "The `__new__` method should be adjusted to gracefully handle non-disjoint cycles by correctly applying them in a left-to-right sequence to construct the internal array form of the permutation. This involves modifying the validation logic that currently raises a `ValueError` for repeated elements in the input when non-disjoint cycles are provided. Instead, the method must merge these cycles appropriately, ensuring that they are treated as sequential transformations rather than simultaneous ones, which is key to preserving the identity permutation in the case of identical cycles. The preservation of existing functionality must be ensured, with the change applying only when cycles are specified as input, and not altering the behavior for other types of inputs."
