        "content": "Analyzing the information obtained from the search results, we gather that:\n\n1. **No `__init__` method**: The search for an `__init__` method in the `Permutation` class returned no results. This suggests that the constructor logic for the `Permutation` class is likely implemented within the `__new__` method, which is a common pattern in classes that inherit from immutable types in Python or which require control over instance creation. For immutable objects like those often encountered in mathematics or symbolic computation libraries (such as SymPy, where our `Permutation` class is found), `__new__` is used to control object creation.\n\n2. **The relationship to the bug**: Given the issue description, where constructing a `Permutation` object with non-disjoint cycles should result in a permutation that applies the cycles in left-to-right order, we need to review how cycles are processed and combined into a permutation within the `__new__` method or related methods. The reported error indicates that this process currently does not handle non-disjoint cycles as expected by the user. The constructor (or related functionality) should combine these cycles appropriately instead of raising a `ValueError`.\n\n3. **Intended behavior**: The intended behavior, as per the issue, is for `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` to construct the identity permutation. This means the logic for handling cycles in the `Permutation` class must be able to interpret and merge overlapping or non-disjoint cycles correctly, applying them in the specified order to produce the correct permutation. Essentially, this involves modifying or ensuring the internal logic can flatten and combine such cycles without rejecting them.\n\nTo advance, we need to delve into the `__new__` method implementation for the `Permutation` class, as this is likely where the logic for initializing a permutation with given cycles is implemented. Furthermore, we might also need to refer to any auxiliary methods that are utilized for processing the cycles into the internal representation of the permutation. This leads to the following actions:\n\n1. search_method_in_file(\"__new__\", \"sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py\")\n2. search_method_in_class(\"_af_new\", \"Permutation\")\n3. search_method_in_class(\"cyclic_form\", \"Permutation\")\n\nThese actions aim to unravel how permutations are constructed and how their cyclic forms are derived and stored, which will help us address the problem of handling non-disjoint cycles."
