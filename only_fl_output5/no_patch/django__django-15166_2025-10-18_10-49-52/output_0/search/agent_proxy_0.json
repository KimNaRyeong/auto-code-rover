            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we'll need to gather more context about where and how database fields are being quoted in queries, specifically for the DatabaseCache backend and how it might interact with databases like Snowflake that have specific requirements for quoting fields.\n\nGiven the information from the issue, here are the necessary API calls:\n\n1. Search the class `DatabaseCache` to understand its structure and the methods it includes. This will help us identify where the patch might be applied.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"DatabaseCache\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that Snowflake database requires all fields to be quoted and this functionality might not be correctly implemented, it would be beneficial to find methods related to query construction or execution within the `DatabaseCache` class.\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"make_key\", \"DatabaseCache\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"add\", \"DatabaseCache\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"get\", \"DatabaseCache\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"set\", \"DatabaseCache\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"delete\", \"DatabaseCache\")\n   ```\n\n3. Because we're concerned specifically with how queries are constructed and sent to the database, looking for any code snippets related to query execution or construction might also be useful, especially if there are any explicit mentions of field quoting.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"cursor.execute\")\n   ```\n\n4. Lastly, it might be helpful to understand how other parts of the system might interact with `DatabaseCache` or if there are any utilities or helpers related to database field quoting. This could reveal if there's an existing mechanism that's supposed to handle quoting but isn't being utilized correctly in the context of `DatabaseCache`.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"quote_name\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls are designed to provide a rounded understanding of where the issue might originate from and guide the development of a patch by identifying how database operations are handled within the `DatabaseCache` backend and how fields are quoted or supposed to be quoted in queries."
