        "intended_behavior": "The `isqrt` method's intended behavior is to accurately return the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`. To resolve the issue while preserving existing functionality, the immediate action is to adjust the conditional boundary inside this method. The decision to use `_sqrt` for fast computation should be limited to values of `n` where floating-point arithmetic does not introduce inaccuracies in the final integer result. Based on the analysis and the IEEE 754 binary64 format considerations mentioned in the issue description, the bound should be revised to a lower value that maintains accuracy across all platforms and input ranges. Adjusting the bound to `2**52` could be a starting point, considering the limitations of floating-point precision. Additionally, implementing a post-check to verify the correctness of the square root obtained from `_sqrt` before returning it could further ensure accuracy. If the squared result of the computed integer square root exceeds `n`, the method should then resort to the `integer_nthroot` for that computation to guarantee correctness. This approach preserves the method's performance for smaller numbers while ensuring accuracy for all possible inputs."
