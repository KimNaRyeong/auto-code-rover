Based on your request, here's how you can modify `reproducer.py` to execute under the conditions you described. This version is specifically tailored to ensure it captures and reports whether the `IndexError` due to `NaN` values in the groupby operation with `xarray` is present, leveraging the provided function for error reporting.

```python
# reproducer.py

import xarray as xr
import numpy as np
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def standardize(x):
    return (x - x.mean()) / x.std()

def main():
    ds = xr.Dataset()
    ds["variable"] = xr.DataArray(np.random.rand(4, 3, 5), 
                                  {"lat": np.arange(4), "lon":np.arange(3), "time":np.arange(5)},  
                                  ("lat", "lon", "time"))

    ds["id"] = xr.DataArray(np.arange(12.0).reshape((4, 3)),
                            {"lat": np.arange(4), "lon":np.arange(3)},
                            ("lat", "lon"))

    ds["id"].values[0, 0] = np.nan  # Introducing a NaN value

    try:
        result = ds.groupby("id").apply(standardize)
    except IndexError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert isinstance(e, IndexError)
        exit(0)  # Expected exception; indicates the issue is present
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle unexpected exceptions
        print("An unexpected error occurred.", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "An unexpected exception type was raised."
    else:
        # If no exception is raised, the function behaves as expected, which could mean the issue is resolved.
        # However, we need to verify the output to ensure it's correct.
        expected_group_count = len(ds["id"].values.flatten()) - 1  # Subtract one for the NaN entry
        actual_group_count = len(result.groupby("id").groups)
        assert actual_group_count == expected_group_count, "Output does not match expected group count."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script ensures the execution of the `groupby().apply()` operation with a preprocessing function on a sample `xarray` dataset. It explicitly tests for the presence of the aforementioned `IndexError` when handling NaN values within a group identifier. Adjustments based on the actual outcome will dictate the assertion's role:

1. **AssertionError is Raised**: If the script experiences an `AssertionError` due to incorrect output or an unexpected exception type, this indicates something went awry outside the anticipated issue scope.

2. **IndexError is Handled**: When the `IndexError` due to NaN values occurs, the script captures it, prints a detailed stack trace, and exits with code 0 indicating successful reproduction of the issue.

3. **No Error Encountered**: If the script executes successfully without catching any errors or exceptions, implying potential resolution of the issue, an additional check against the expected output ensures the correct functionality post-operation.

This approach provides a comprehensive validation mechanism to ascertain the persistence of the reported issue under examination or confirm its resolution, responding directly to the changing nature of software development and bug fixes over time.
