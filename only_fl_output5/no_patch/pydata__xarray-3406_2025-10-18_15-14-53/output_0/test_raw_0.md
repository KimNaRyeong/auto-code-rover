Certainly! Here's a `reproducer.py` script as per your requirements. This script will execute the provided code sample, attempt to reproduce the issue with the `groupby().apply()` operation on an `xarray` dataset when a variable contains NaNs, and print a detailed stack trace if the `IndexError` arises. 

```python
# reproducer.py

import xarray as xr
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def standardize(x):
    return (x - x.mean()) / x.std()

def main():
    ds = xr.Dataset()
    ds["variable"] = xr.DataArray(np.random.rand(4,3,5), 
                                   {"lat":np.arange(4), "lon":np.arange(3), "time":np.arange(5)}, 
                                   ("lat", "lon", "time"),
                                  )

    ds["id"] = xr.DataArray(np.arange(12.0).reshape((4,3)),
                             {"lat": np.arange(4), "lon":np.arange(3)},
                             ("lat", "lon"),
                            )

    ds["id"].values[0,0] = np.nan

    try:
        ds.groupby("id").apply(standardize)
        print("Issue not present or resolved.")
    except IndexError as e:
        print("Issue reproduced:", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The expected IndexError was caught.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as error:
        exit(0)  # Exit gracefully if AssertionError is raised, indicating the test failed as expected.
```

This script follows the instructions by attempting to replicate the `IndexError` when performing a `groupby().apply()` operation on data containing NaN values. If the issue arises, it captures the exception and prints the stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. 

If the code executed without raising an `IndexError`, indicating the issue is not present or has been resolved, the script prints a message saying so. If the script catches the `IndexError`, it prints the stack trace and exits with code 0, adhering to the specification that a successful exit in this context indicates the issue was correctly reproduced.
