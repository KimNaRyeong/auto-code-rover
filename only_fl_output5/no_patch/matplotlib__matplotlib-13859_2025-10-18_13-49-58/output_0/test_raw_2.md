Given the feedback and the requirements for a script to reproduce the previously described issue, capturing the specific exception related to `libpng` and the conditions under which it is raised or resolved, the following standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` can be used. Adjustments have been made to handle the specific exception and control the script's exit code based on the occurrence of the issue or its resolution.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(3, 0))
        plt.savefig("test.png")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        if "libpng" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("Issue reproduced: 'libpng signaled error'") from e
        else:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("Unexpected RuntimeError, not a libpng error.") from e
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An unexpected exception occurred.") from e
    else:
        print("The issue seems to be resolved, exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script is designed to verify the presence of the bug that causes `libpng` to signal an error when trying to save a figure with zero height in `matplotlib`. It does so by invoking `matplotlib.pyplot` to create and attempt to save such a figure, specifically catching `RuntimeError` that should be raised if the issue exists. If the error is related to `libpng`, it prints the stack trace using the given function and raises an `AssertionError` to signal the reproduction of the issue. If the script executes without encountering this specific error, it assumes the issue has been resolved and exits with code 0.
