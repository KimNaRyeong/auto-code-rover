Here are the relevant API calls to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. **Searching for the `savefig` method**: Given the crash occurs when trying to save a figure with a zero width, we need to look into how the `savefig` method is implemented. This will provide insights into any existing size validations or related processes that occur before saving to a PNG file.\n   - `search_method(\"savefig\")`\n\n2. **Understanding figure creation**: The bug report highlights the issue arises when creating a subplot with zero height. It would be useful to examine the implementation details of the `subplots` and/or figure initialization to check for size validations or adjustments.\n   - `search_method(\"subplots\")`\n   - `search_method(\"Figure\")` \u2013 This is assuming there is a `Figure` class where the initialization might occur.\n\n3. **Inspection of figure size setting**: Looking into how figure size is set or adjusted can reveal if there's a point at which the zero width could be caught and corrected or reported in a more controlled manner.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"set_size_inches\", \"Figure\")` \u2013 Considering there might be a method for setting figure dimensions in a `Figure` class.\n\nThese API calls aim to provide an overview of relevant components in the Matplotlib codebase that could be contributing to the reported bug."
