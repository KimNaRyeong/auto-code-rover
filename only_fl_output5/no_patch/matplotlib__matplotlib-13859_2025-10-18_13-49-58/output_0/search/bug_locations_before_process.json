If either dimension is less than or equal to zero, it should raise a ValueError with a descriptive message indicating that figure sizes must be positive. This validation will prevent figures with invalid dimensions from being created or modified, which in turn will avert the crash when attempting to save such figures."

        "intended_behavior": "While primarily a convenience method for creating subplots, an additional validation should be added here to preemptively check if the figsize argument (derived from subplot_kw and gridspec_kw indirectly or any direct dimension specification) results in figures with non-positive dimensions. This validation should be performed before creating the subplots. Similar to set_size_inches, if such dimensions are detected, an informative ValueError should be raised to notify users about the invalid figure dimensions. This will ensure that attempts to create subplots with zero width or height are caught early."
