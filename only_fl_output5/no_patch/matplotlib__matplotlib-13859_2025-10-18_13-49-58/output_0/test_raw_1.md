Considering the previous attempt faced a module not found error due to `matplotlib` missing, it's vital to ensure all dependencies are properly installed before executing the script. Here's an updated version of `reproducer.py` that includes an assertion check for the specific error raised due to the zero-width figure issue. To manage dependencies, especially for environments lacking `matplotlib`, you might consider adding an installation step or ensuring the environment where this script is intended to run already has `matplotlib` installed.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(3, 0))
        plt.savefig("test.png")
        # If the script reaches this point without an exception, the issue is assumed to be resolved
        print("The issue is resolved, exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        # If a RuntimeError is caught because of the libpng error, it's the expected outcome indicating the issue exists
        if "libpng signaled error" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate the reproduction of the issue
        # For any other exception, raise an AssertionError
        else:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("An unexpected exception occurred.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Before executing this script, ensure that `matplotlib` (along with its dependencies, including `libpng`) is installed in your Python environment. You can install `matplotlib` using pip:

```
pip install matplotlib
```

Or, if using a Conda environment:
```
conda install matplotlib
```

This script attempts to reproduce the issue where saving a zero-width figure causes a `RuntimeError` due to a libpng error. It catches exceptions related to this scenario, prints a detailed stack trace for diagnostic purposes, and uses the exit code to signal whether the issue was reproduced (code 1) or resolved (code 0).
