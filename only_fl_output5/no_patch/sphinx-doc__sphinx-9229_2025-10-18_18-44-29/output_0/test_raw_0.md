Below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` tailored to reproduce the reported issue regarding inconsistent behavior with type alias documentation in a Sphinx-generated documentation. Keep in mind that this script is designed to automate the setup and verification process as far as possible given the constraints of such scripting environments. It assumes a Sphinx environment is available and properly configured to use `sphinx.ext.autodoc`. Auto-generating the full Sphinx project setup and invoking Sphinx build commands directly from the script could have nuanced dependencies on the specific environment setup. This script focuses on verifying the presence of the issue by creating a simplified Sphinx project setup around the provided code sample and assessing the HTML output for correctness.

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys

# Function to print stack trace
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    # Trying to automate Sphinx docs setup and verification
    os.mkdir("docs")
    os.chdir("docs")

**Explanation and Caveats:**

1. **Assumptions**: The script assumes that Sphinx and necessary dependencies are properly installed and that the Python environment is set up to run Sphinx commands. Additionally, it assumes a Unix-like environment for certain file and directory operations, as well as the availability of commands like `make`.

2. **Sphinx Automation**: The script creates a basic Sphinx project with the necessary `conf.py` and `index.rst` files, then generates documentation for the provided sample Python file.

3. **Limitations**: Complete automation of verifying rendered HTML content for documentation accuracy is complex and environment-dependent. The script checks for the presence of specific docstring content in the generated HTML files, which may need refinement based on Sphinx themes or configurations.

4. **Adaptability**: Future changes in Sphinx, Python, or related tooling might necessitate adjustments to this script for continued efficacy.
