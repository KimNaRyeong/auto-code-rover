Sure, I'll provide a correct version of `reproducer.py` tailored to your specifications. This version aims to capture the exception and print a detailed stack trace using your provided `print_stacktrace` function. If the specific error related to "Invalid vmin or vmax" is detected, the script will raise an `AssertionError`. If the operation succeeds without raising the error (meaning the issue may have been fixed in the matplotlib version being used), the script will exit with code 0 denoting success and indicating the issue is fixed. 

Please make sure the environment has the specified version of matplotlib installed where the issue is expected to occur.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.colors import LogNorm
import numpy as np
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_matplotlib_bug():
    try:
        # create some random data to fill a 2d plot
        rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
        img = rng.uniform(1, 5, (25, 25))

        # plot it
        fig, ax = plt.subplots(layout="constrained")
        plot = ax.pcolormesh(img)
        cbar = fig.colorbar(plot, ax=ax)

        vmin = 1
        vmax = 5

        plt.ion()
        fig.show()
        plt.pause(0.5)

        plot.norm = LogNorm(vmin, vmax)
        plot.autoscale()
        plt.pause(0.5)
        
        print("The issue is fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating success
    except ValueError as e:
        if "Invalid vmin or vmax" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("The issue is present.") from e
        else:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise

To use this script:

1. Save it as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of the project.
2. Execute it via the command line using `python3 reproducer.py`.

- If the issue is present, the script will print the stack trace to standard error and raise an `AssertionError` with the message "The issue is present."
- If the issue is fixed (i.e., the operation succeeds without raising the expected ValueError), the script will print "The issue is fixed." to standard output and exit with code 0.
