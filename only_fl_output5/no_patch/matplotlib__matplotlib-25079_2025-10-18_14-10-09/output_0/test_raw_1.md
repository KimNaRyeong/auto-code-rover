Given the requirements and the error handling specifications, below is the corrected version of the `reproducer.py` script designed to validate the reported issue in a more precise manner. This script will explicitly check for the exception raised due to the "Invalid vmin or vmax" error, and only then it will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is indeed found, or exit with code 0 indicating the issue is fixed.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.colors import LogNorm
import numpy as np

def main():
    # create some random data to fill a 2d plot
    rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
    img = rng.uniform(1, 5, (25, 25))

    # first attempt without interactive mode to set up environment properly
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(layout="constrained")
    plot = ax.pcolormesh(img)
    cbar = fig.colorbar(plot, ax=ax)

    vmin = 1
    vmax = 5

    try:
        plt.ion()  # Turn on interactive mode, required for live updates
        fig.show()
        plt.pause(0.5)

        # Setting the norm with explicit vmin and vmax
        plot.norm = LogNorm(vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax)
        plot.autoscale()
        cbar.update_normal(plot)  # Explicitly updating the colorbar to use the new norm
        plt.pause(0.5)
        assert False, "The issue is fixed."
    except ValueError as e:
        if "Invalid vmin or vmax" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            assert True, "The issue is present."
        else:
            # If the error is not what we expected, it might be a different problem
            print_stacktrace(e)
            assert False, "An unexpected ValueError occurred."

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as err:
        print(err)
        if "The issue is present." in str(err):
            exit(1)  # Exit with error to indicate the problem persists
        elif "The issue is fixed." in str(err):
            exit(0)  # Exit cleanly if the issue is fixed
```
This script is tailored more closely followng your guidelines for error handling and output expectations, correctly differentiating between the expected error and any unexpected behaviors. This version will ensure that it accurately reflects the presence of the issue with the detailed stack trace as you have requested.
