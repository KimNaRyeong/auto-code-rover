        "intended_behavior": "When a normalization class's `__call__`, `autoscale`, or `autoscale_None` methods are invoked after a norm change, they should validate `vmin` and `vmax` taking into account the specific requirements of the new norm. For `LogNorm`, they should ensure `vmin` and `vmax` are positive and not equal to zero. Exception handling around these values should be robust enough to manage dynamic norm updates, especially in interactive settings or after initial plot creation."

        "intended_behavior": "Upon updating the normalization of an existing plot that already has a colorbar, the `colorbar` method should check if the associated mappable's norm has been updated (e.g., to `LogNorm` from another norm) and perform necessary updates to ensure the colorbar reflects the new scale correctly. This includes recalculating the colorbar's ticks and label positions if necessary, based on the new norm's scale, without triggering errors related to `vmin` and `vmax` values."
