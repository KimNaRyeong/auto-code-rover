The error message suggests there's a problem with setting the normalization (`norm`) on a mappable after a colorbar has been created, specifically with the `LogNorm` involving `vmin` and `vmax` values. Thus, the following API calls will help gather the necessary context:\n\n1. We need to investigate the `LogNorm` class to understand how it handles `vmin` and `vmax`, ensuring no recent changes have altered its behavior.\n2. The error stack trace mentions several methods and classes (`matplotlib/collections.py` in `update_scalarmappable` and `matplotlib/colors.py` in `__call__` of `LogNorm`). Understanding these methods can point us to how the normalization values are being validated and applied.\n3. Since the issue happens upon setting the norm to `LogNorm` after the colorbar has been created, we also need to understand the `colorbar` creation process and how it interacts with the `norm` settings.\n4. It would be useful to look into the `autoscale` method of whatever object `plot` is an instance of, to see how it affects the plot's scaling and if it interacts with the `norm` property in any way.\n\nGiven these observations, let's make these API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"LogNorm\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"update_scalarmappable\", \"Collection\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__call__\", \"LogNorm\")`\n- `search_method(\"autoscale\")`\n- `search_code(\"fig.colorbar(plot, ax=ax)\")`\n\nThese calls should give us a better understanding of the components involved and how they might contribute to the reported issue."

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. `update_scalarmappable` in `Collection`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThe `update_scalarmappable` method in `Collection` updates colors from the scalar mappable array. It assigns colors to edges and faces based on the array and/or colors that were directly set, checking if a scalar mappable (data array) is set. It also handles conditions related to alpha values for transparency and shapes of data arrays versus alpha arrays, converting data to colors using the `to_rgba` method.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug:**\n  \nThe bug report mentions that changing the normalization (`norm`) to `LogNorm` after creating a colorbar fails. The `update_scalarmappable` method could be central to this issue because it involves updating scalar mappable objects (like those representing data for pcolormesh plots) when properties like their normalization change. An error here could indicate problems in handling updates when the `norm` of the plot changes.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n\nWhen the normalization of a plot changes, `update_scalarmappable` should successfully update the colors of the plot to reflect the new normalization, respecting the new vmin and vmax values without raising an `Invalid vmin or vmax` error.\n\n#### 2. `LogNorm` class and `__call__` method\n\n- **What does this part of the code do? (Based on general knowledge, since no direct information was found)**\n\n`LogNorm` is a subclass of `Normalize` in Matplotlib, responsible for normalizing data using a logarithmic scale. Its `__call__` method is what actually applies this normalization, taking in data values and returning their normalized form according to log scale.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug:**\n\nThe bug occurs when setting `LogNorm` as the new norm for a plot, which implies an issue with how `LogNorm`'s `__call__` method interacts with current plot settings, specifically after a colorbar has been created. Given the error involves `Invalid vmin or vmax`, there may be an issue with how `LogNorm` validates or processes these parameters post-colorbar creation.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n\nUpon setting `LogNorm` with valid `vmin` and `vmax` values, the plot should update to reflect the logarithmic scaling correctly, without throwing errors related to `vmin` or `vmax` being invalid.\n\n#### 3. `autoscale` method\n\n- **General Observation:**\n\nWhile not directly pointed out by the bug report, understanding how `autoscale` works across different contexts in Matplotlib can give insight into how plots adjust their limits and scaling based on the data and normalization parameters. The method likely plays a role in adjusting the plot when new norms are set.\n\n#### Next Steps\n\nGiven the gaps in our findings, especially not finding information directly on `LogNorm`, we need more context on:\n\n1. The `LogNorm` implementation and how it handles `vmin` and `vmax` parameters. Since we couldn't find `LogNorm` directly, it's important to look closer at how normalization classes are structured or referenced in Matplotlib. Perhaps `LogNorm` is encapsulated in a file we didn't search or is dynamically imported in a way that our initial search missed.\n\n2. Understanding the `colorbar` creation and update mechanism. Since the issue mentions that the bug occurs after the colorbar has been created, we should investigate how colorbars interact with their associated mappable objects and how they respond to changes in normalization.\n\n3. We might also search for any recent changes between Matplotlib versions 3.6.2 and 3.6.3 related to `LogNorm`, `colorbar`, or mappable objects, as the issue appeared after an upgrade.\n\nTherefore, we should make additional API calls focused on:\n\n- More detail on the normalization process,\n- The `colorbar` creation and update process,\n- Specific information on how `vmin` and `vmax` are validated or used within the LogNorm normalization process.\n\nSpecific missing links are the implementation details for the `LogNorm` class and the connection between setting the `norm` and how the colorbar is updated in response."

Specifically, it should successfully handle updating without raising an `Invalid vmin or vmax` error when `LogNorm` is applied after a colorbar has been created. To resolve the issue, ensure `update_scalarmappable` checks if a new norm has been applied and recalculates colors based on the current `vmin` and `vmax` values that are valid for logarithmic scaling. This involves proper handling and validation of `vmin` and `vmax` within the context of `LogNorm`.\n\nSince we were unable to find direct references to `LogNorm`, which is crucial for addressing the bug, and the interaction of colorbars with updated norms, these components' detailed implementations and their impact on the issue remain unclear, necessitating further context gathering."
