Given the error message, it appears the issue was related to the environment and not the provided reproducer code snippet itself. Therefore, the original objective remains to create a script that reproduces the issue where `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` with `categorical_crossentropy` silently fails on binary classification, and it exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed. Given the specific request, let's revise and ensure the standalone python file is appropriate for execution:

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.experimental import enable_hist_gradient_boosting  # This line is required to use HistGradientBoosting
from sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingClassifier

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    X = np.array([[1, 0], [1, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1]])
    y = np.array([1, 1, 1, 0, 1])
    
    try:
        gb = HistGradientBoostingClassifier(loss='categorical_crossentropy', min_samples_leaf=1)
        gb.fit(X, y)
        prediction1 = gb.predict([[1, 0]])
        prediction2 = gb.predict([[0, 1]])
        
        if not (prediction1[0] == 1 and prediction2[0] == 0):
            raise AssertionError("categorical_crossentropy does not perform as expected on binary classification.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 indicating an error
    else:
        print("No error detected, the issue seems to be fixed.")
        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating success

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code is designed to be saved in a file named `reproducer.py` at the root of your project and executed with `python3 reproducer.py`. It includes a check to assert the behavior of `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` with the loss function `categorical_crossentropy` in a binary classification setup. If the classifier does not behave as expected, the script will raise an `AssertionError`, print a detailed stack trace of the error, and exit with code 1, signaling the issue. Conversely, if it finishes successfully without detecting the problem, it will print a confirmatory message and exit with code 0 to indicate the issue is fixed or not present.
