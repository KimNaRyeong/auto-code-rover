Certainly. Based on your requirements, here's a Python script named `reproducer.py` prepared to be executed in the root directory of the project. This script will attempt to reproduce the issue with `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` using `categorical_crossentropy` on binary classification. It will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present and print a detailed stack trace. Otherwise, it will exit with code 0, indicating the issue has been resolved or does not exist.

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.experimental import enable_hist_gradient_boosting  # noqa
from sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingClassifier

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    X = np.array([[1, 0], [1, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1]])
    y = np.array([1, 1, 1, 0, 1])

    try:
        gb = HistGradientBoostingClassifier(loss='categorical_crossentropy')
        gb.fit(X, y)
        predictions = gb.predict(np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]]))
        
        # Since `categorical_crossentropy` should not be used for binary classification in this way,
        # a successful prediction is not the expected behavior. We expect an error or incorrect predictions.
        
        if np.array_equal(predictions, np.array([1, 0])):
            print("Unexpectedly correct predictions. The issue might have been silently resolved.")
        else:
            print("Issue reproduced: Incorrect or unexpected predictions.")
            raise AssertionError("The classifier did not behave as expected with categorical_crossentropy on binary classification.")
    
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with an error code indicating failure to behave as expected

    # If the script reaches this point without exceptions, the behavior is as expected (or the issue was not triggered).
    print("No error detected or the issue could not be reproduced as described.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script checks for correct behavior under the assumption that using `categorical_crossentropy` for binary classification should either raise an error or not provide the correct binary outcomes (1, 0) for the sample inputs, as this loss function is generally intended for multi-class classification tasks and not for binary classification. If there has been a resolution to how `categorical_crossentropy` handles binary data in `HistGradientBoostingClassifier`, the script may need adjustments to accurately determine the presence of the originally reported issue.
