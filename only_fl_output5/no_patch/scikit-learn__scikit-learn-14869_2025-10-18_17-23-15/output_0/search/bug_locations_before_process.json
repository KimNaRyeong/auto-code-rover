        "intended_behavior": "The `_get_loss` method should include an additional check to ascertain whether `categorical_crossentropy` is being used in a binary classification scenario erroneously. Given the binary classification case (`n_trees_per_iteration_ == 1`), if `self.loss` is explicitly set to `categorical_crossentropy`, the method should raise a ValueError indicating the misuse and suggesting the use of `binary_crossentropy` or setting `loss='auto'` for automatic selection. This change ensures users are aware of the correct loss function usage in binary classification scenarios, preventing silent failures."

        "method": "fit",
        "intended_behavior": "During the `fit` method's execution, especially after the call to `_get_loss`, an additional validation step could be incorporated to check the suitability of the loss function chosen for the data it is being applied to. This may include verifying that the selected loss function aligns with the type of classification task being performed. While not directly necessary to fix the reported issue, this could enhance robustness and user guidance, preventing similar issues from arising in different contexts or with other parameters."
