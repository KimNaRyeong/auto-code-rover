        "intended_behavior": "Similarly, during the handling of migrations with the `--noinput` flag, if any operation is skipped or would fail due to the need for user interaction, an informative message should be displayed to the user indicating why the operation did not proceed. For instance, if `--noinput` causes the command to skip applying certain migrations that require manual confirmation (e.g., for potentially destructive actions), it should output a warning message to `stdout` or `stderr` indicating that some migrations were not applied due to the input requirement. This message should be clear and inform the user about what steps may need to be taken manually."
