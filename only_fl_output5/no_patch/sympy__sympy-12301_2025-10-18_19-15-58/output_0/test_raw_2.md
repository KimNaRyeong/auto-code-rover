Given the requirement to reproduce a specific issue within a SymPy test and the need to exit with code 0 only if the issue is fixed, we will create a standalone script designed to directly invoke the conditions described in the failing test case. This script will simulate the environment and the test invocation, specifically targeting the behavior described in the initial problem report.

Let's create `reproducer.py` to encapsulate this logic:

```python
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = '736538842'
    try:
        # Import SymPy and relevant components directly here:
        from sympy.simplify.cse_main import cse
        from sympy.abc import x, y
        from sympy import sin, cos, exp
        
        # Replicating the logic that would trigger the AssertionError
        # This is a direct interpretation based on the test name and commonly associated operations
        # Note: The original test condition is not provided, hence, we attempt a likely scenario
        result = cse([sin(x) + cos(x) + exp(x) + x, sin(y) + cos(y) + exp(y) + x])
        
        # Placeholder for assertion similar to the failing test
        # This could be tailored once we know the exact assertion
        assert not any(i.is_Mul for a in result for i in a.args), "Expected condition not met"

        print("Test passed; the issue has been fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero code to indicate failure/error
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(2)  # Exit with a specific code for unexpected errors

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This file should be put in the root directory of the SymPy project and executed with Python 3. It's important to note that this script uses a direct approach to trigger the suspected source of the `AssertionError`, based on the original Travis test failure related to `sympy/simplify/tests/test_cse.py:test_issue_11230`. However, without the exact assertion or the specific details of `test_issue_11230`, some liberties were taken in assuming the nature of the test and how it might fail.

The script starts by setting up the environment variable `PYTHONHASHSEED` as the original test scenario described, ensuring consistency in hash values across Python runs, which might be relevant to the failure. It then proceeds to import necessary components from SymPy and sets up a scenario that, based on interpretation, could resemble the failing test case's conditions.

The script concludes by executing an assertion to emulate the test condition that might produce the `AssertionError`. If this specific assertion passes, indicating the originally observed issue is resolved, the script exits with code 0. Otherwise, it captures the `AssertionError`, prints a detailed stack trace for debugging purposes, and exits with code 1, signaling the test case's failure condition.
