I will use the following search API calls to get information:\n\n1. Search for the file path of `test_cse.py` where the failing test resides to confirm its location within the codebase, since we need accurate file location to inspect the failing test and any related functions or classes:\n   - `search_code(\"test_issue_11230\")`\n\n2. Given the specific line mentioned in the traceback, we seek to understand the broader context of the failing assertion line, including the test definition and any relevant logic surrounding it:\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"sympy/simplify/tests/test_cse.py\", 433, 10)`\n\nThese API calls aim to identify the specific test function causing the failure and understand the logic leading to the assertion error, which is crucial for formulating a patch."
