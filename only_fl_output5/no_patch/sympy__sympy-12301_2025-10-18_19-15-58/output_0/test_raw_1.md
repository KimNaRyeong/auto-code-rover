Based on your feedback about the need for a more targeted approach to reproduce the issue and print a relevant stack trace if the error occurs, I'll adjust the script. This time, I'll ensure that it directly targets the specific test mentioned in your description (`test_issue_11230` within `sympy/simplify/tests/test_cse.py`) instead of running the entire test suite or the last split, potentially avoiding the timeout issue you encountered.

```python
import os
import traceback
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_specific_test():
    os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = '736538842'
    try:
        from sympy.simplify.tests.test_cse import test_issue_11230
        test_issue_11230()
        print("Test passed; the issue has been fixed.")
        return True
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if not run_specific_test():
        exit(1)
    else:
        exit(0)
```

This script specifically imports and runs the `test_issue_11230` function from the `test_cse.py` module within SymPy's test suite. It sets the `PYTHONHASHSEED` environment variable as required to recreate the environment where the issue was observed. If the `AssertionError` is raised during the test, indicating the issue is present, it will catch this, print a detailed stack trace using the `print_stacktrace` function, and exit with code 1. Conversely, if the test runs successfully without raising an error, this would indicate the issue has been addressed or is not present in this environment, and the script will then exit with code 0.

Please ensure that you have the SymPy library installed in your environment where this script is executed, and it's structured correctly to import `test_issue_11230`. Adjustments may be needed if there are differences in SymPy's version or directory structure that affect how tests are imported and run.
