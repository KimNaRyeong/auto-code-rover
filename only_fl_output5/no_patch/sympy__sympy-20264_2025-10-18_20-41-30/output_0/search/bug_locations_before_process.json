        "intended_behavior": "The `_print_Pow` method should incorporate a condition or modification to correctly handle expressions in the form of `Pow(Rational(1, n), -1, evaluate=False)` for `n` as a positive integer (or its equivalent for negative integers but with n < -1). When encountering such expressions, rather than possibly falling into a recursive conversion process, it should directly convert them into a simple LaTeX fraction format, `\\frac{n}{1}` or its appropriate form based on the sign and magnitude of `n`. This adjustment should be made in a way that respects the evaluate flag being False, ensuring no unintended simplification occurs in non-target cases."

        "intended_behavior": "The `_print_Mul` method may need adjustments to ensure that it can correctly handle and format the multiplication expressions especially arising from the conversion of `Pow` types that represent reciprocal or negative powers. Given the `RecursionError`, a potential solution involves implementing checks or mechanisms that prevent unnecessary or erroneous recursion when dealing with `Pow` expressions formatted by `_print_Pow`. Any fix here must seamlessly integrate with the handling of different types of multiplication expressions, maintaining the method's general utility while ensuring correct output for cases that previously led to errors."
