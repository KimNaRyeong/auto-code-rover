        "intended_behavior": "The method `prepare_url` in the `PreparedRequest` class must safely handle all cases that can lead to a `UnicodeError` when dealing with IDNA encoding of URLs, particularly for cases like `http://.example.com` where the hostname leads to an invalid label condition. The intended behavior is to catch scenarios where the URL could cause `UnicodeError` due to IDNA encoding issues and to ensure that an `InvalidURL` exception is raised instead, with a clear message indicating the nature of the problem. This behavior preserves the existing functionality of the code, which is designed to validate URLs and raise appropriate exceptions for invalid formats, but it enhances robustness and usability by ensuring that all potential encoding issues are caught and handled distinctly. This change would specifically involve: - Verifying if additional conditions exist under which `UnicodeError` is not properly caught and converted into an `InvalidURL` exception. - Enhancing the exception handling mechanism to cover all edge cases that might not be currently accounted for, especially considering URL labels that result in a `UnicodeError` upon IDNA encoding. - Improving the error message where necessary to provide actionable feedback to the library users about why the URL was considered invalid, facilitating error resolution on their end."
