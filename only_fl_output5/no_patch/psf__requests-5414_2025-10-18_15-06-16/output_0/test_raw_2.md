Certainly, based on the guidelines that you provided, here's a revised standalone Python script tailored to reproduce the issue with the `requests` library regarding the handling of invalid URLs, accurately and concisely including the function for clear stack trace printing upon encountering an exception. This script makes sure to capture the specific `UnicodeError` thrown when accessing `"http://.example.com"` and converts it to an assertion, which is the desired behavior for reproducing this issue.

```python
# reproducer.py
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_request():
    try:
        # Attempt to make a request to an invalid URL.
        requests.get("http://.example.com")
    except requests.exceptions.InvalidURL:
        print("The issue is resolved. Exiting with code 0.")
        return 0  # Exit code 0 indicates success (issue resolved).
    except UnicodeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # If a UnicodeError is caught, this indicates the issue is present.
        raise AssertionError("Issue detected: UnicodeError raised instead of InvalidURL.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError(f"Unexpected exception type: {e.__class__.__name__}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_request()
```

Running this script in the root directory of the project with the version of the `requests` library mentioned (or any version where this issue is reproducible) will automatically reproduce the reported issue when executed via `python3 reproducer.py`. It specifically tests for the bug concerning the `.example.com` URL, asserting that the appropriate exception (`InvalidURL`) should be thrown rather than a `UnicodeError`, as per the expected functionality outlined.

Ensure your Python environment matches the system and library versions given in the reported issue for accurate reproduction. This script will exit with code 0 indicating the correction of the issue when the `requests` library handles the error correctly by throwing an `InvalidURL` exception as expected. If the issue persists, an `AssertionError` will be raised, detailing that the identified problem is still present.
