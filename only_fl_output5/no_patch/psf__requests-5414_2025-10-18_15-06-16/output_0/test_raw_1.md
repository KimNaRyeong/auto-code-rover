Based on your requirements, the script below is designed to reproduce the described issue with the `requests` library. This version ensures that the correct exceptions are managed and that AssertionError or a zero exit code is provided based on whether the issue is reproduced or resolved, respectively. Please ensure that the `requests` library and dependencies are correctly installed in your environment.

```python
# reproducer.py
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        response = requests.get("http://.example.com")
    except UnicodeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Test failed due to UnicodeError as expected")
    except requests.exceptions.InvalidURL as e:
        print("The issue is resolved. Exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError(f"Test failed due to an unexpected exception: {e.__class__.__name__}")
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Test failed because no exception was raised")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Before running this script, ensure that your Python environment has the `requests` library at the version you wish to test against installed. The behavior of this script is consistent with described requirements: it attempts to catch a very specific issue with the `requests.get()` function call and manages exceptions as designed. If a `UnicodeError` is raised because of the faulty URL format, the script will catch this and raise an `AssertionError`, indicating that the issue persists. If the issue is resolved and an `InvalidURL` exception is raised instead, the script will exit with code 0. If no exception is raised or an unexpected exception is caught, the script raises an `AssertionError`, highlighting the error.
