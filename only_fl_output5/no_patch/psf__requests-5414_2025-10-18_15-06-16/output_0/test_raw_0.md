This script attempts to make a GET request to `http://.example.com` using the `requests` library. According to the described issue, such a request should raise an `InvalidUrl` exception rather than a `UnicodeError`. The script will:

- Use `try-except` blocks to catch exceptions raised during the request.
- Capture and print the stack trace if a `UnicodeError` is caught, using the provided `print_stacktrace` function, and assert a failure due to this error.
- Check for an `InvalidUrl` exception and, if caught, exit with code 0 to indicate the issue has been fixed.
- Assert a failure if no exception is raised or an unexpected exception occurs, providing the unexpected exceptionâ€™s type.
- Ensure readability of the error or stack trace by printing it to stderr.
