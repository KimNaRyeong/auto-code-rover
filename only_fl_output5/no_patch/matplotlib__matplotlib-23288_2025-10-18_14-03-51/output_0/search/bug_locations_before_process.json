This entails modifying or extending the processing of text elements to compute the correct coordinates for 'QuadPoints,' which accurately reflect the rotated text's boundaries. Importantly, this enhancement must keep the existing functionality intact for PDF viewers that do not support 'QuadPoints,' falling back on the standard Rect definition for clickable areas."

        "intended_behavior": "These methods must be adjusted or extended to calculate and pass 'QuadPoints' information to the PDF generation logic for text elements marked with URLs. When a text element includes a rotation and a URL, the method should calculate the 'QuadPoints' that describe the rotated text's actual clickable area. This information should then be used in the 'print_pdf' method to create PDF elements with correctly oriented clickable areas. The calculation of 'QuadPoints' should ensure compatibility with a broad range of PDF viewers, using Rect for the clickable area as a fallback mechanism where 'QuadPoints' are unsupported."
