QuadPoints\nshall be ignored if any coordinate in the array lies outside the region\nspecified by Rect.\nSo one would also need to provide a larger Rect, which, for viewers not supporting QuadPoints will lead to that the total rectangle outlined by the rotated text will be clickable.\nThis also holds for mathtexts.\n### Operating system\n_No response_\n### Matplotlib Version\nmain\n### Matplotlib Backend\n_No response_\n### Python version\n_No response_\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\ngit checkout\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, we can draw several conclusions and determine the next steps in gathering more context to address the issue.\n\n### Analysis of `FigureCanvasPdf`\nThe `FigureCanvasPdf` class in `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py` is evidently responsible for rendering figures to PDF format. It includes methods like `print_pdf` that directly deal with saving figures as PDF files. Given that our issue is related to PDF output and how clickable areas for URLs are handled, especially when text is rotated, this class is a central piece of the puzzle. The intended behavior for this part, in relation to the bug, would be to properly encode the clickable area for text, considering rotation, which it currently might not handle according to the bug report.\n\n### `savefig` method Relation\nThe presence of multiple `savefig` methods across different files including `backend_pdf.py` suggests that this method is how users typically save plots to files, including PDFs. The method in `backend_pdf.py` would be directly related to how PDF files are generated and is a likely place where adjustments might be needed to support rotated clickable text areas. The intended behavior here would involve ensuring that when saving a figure as a PDF, any text elements with URLs are properly accounted for in their transformed (rotated) state.\n\n### Context around `plt.text`\nThe `plt.text` function is used widely across various examples in the codebase to add text to plots. The issue description mentions using `plt.text` to add clickable text to a plot. While the examples where `plt.text` is used didn't directly address the problem, they highlight the common use cases of text in plots. The relevant context here would be how `plt.text` integrates with the plotting backend (e.g., PDF) to ensure that text properties such as rotation and URLs are correctly handled. The intended behavior would be that any rotation applied to the text is also reflected in the calculation of the clickable area for the associated URL.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context\nGiven the above analysis, further context is needed regarding how `FigureCanvasPdf` manages text elements, specifically how it deals with URLs and the clickable area for those URLs. Additionally, looking at how `savefig` in `backend_pdf.py` processes text and its properties during the save operation is critical. Finally, understanding how `plt.text` interactions are rendered into PDFs by Matplotlib's PDF backend will provide insight into where the logic might need to be adjusted.\n\nTo dive deeper, the following API calls are proposed to gain the necessary context:\n- search_method_in_file(\"print_pdf\", \"lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py\")\n- search_method_in_file(\"draw\", \"lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py\")\n- search_code_in_file(\"text\", \"lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py\")\n\nThese calls aim to explore how drawing and printing operations in `FigureCanvasPdf` deal with text elements and their attributes, which is critical for addressing the reported bug."

This should preserve the ability to click on the actual displayed text, regardless of its rotation. All existing functionality for saving figures to PDF should be preserved without altering how other elements are saved or how text without URLs is handled.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py`\n  - **Class:** `FigureCanvasPdf`\n  - **Method:** `draw`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Ensure that during the drawing phase, text elements with URLs are flagged or annotated in such a way that the 'print_pdf' method can correctly interpret their rotation and adjust the clickable areas accordingly. This method should identify and handle text elements with rotation and URLs so that subsequent processing steps can apply the necessary modifications for rotated clickable areas, without affecting the rendering of text that does not include URLs or is not rotated.\n\n- **General Intended Update:**\n  - In addition to specific method changes, an overall update to the handling of text elements with URLs in PDFs may be required, including possibly introducing new utility functions or methods for calculating the transformed clickable areas (\"QuadPoints\"). These updates would need to carefully balance between supporting new functionality (rotated clickable text areas) and maintaining backward compatibility and general functionality for all other figure elements in PDF outputs."
