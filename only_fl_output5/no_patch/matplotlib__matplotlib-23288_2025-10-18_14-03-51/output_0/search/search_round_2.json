QuadPoints\nshall be ignored if any coordinate in the array lies outside the region\nspecified by Rect.\nSo one would also need to provide a larger Rect, which, for viewers not supporting QuadPoints will lead to that the total rectangle outlined by the rotated text will be clickable.\nThis also holds for mathtexts.\n### Operating system\n_No response_\n### Matplotlib Version\nmain\n### Matplotlib Backend\n_No response_\n### Python version\n_No response_\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\ngit checkout\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, we can draw several conclusions and determine the next steps in gathering more context to address the issue.\n\n### Analysis of `FigureCanvasPdf`\nThe `FigureCanvasPdf` class in `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py` is evidently responsible for rendering figures to PDF format. It includes methods like `print_pdf` that directly deal with saving figures as PDF files. Given that our issue is related to PDF output and how clickable areas for URLs are handled, especially when text is rotated, this class is a central piece of the puzzle. The intended behavior for this part, in relation to the bug, would be to properly encode the clickable area for text, considering rotation, which it currently might not handle according to the bug report.\n\n### `savefig` method Relation\nThe presence of multiple `savefig` methods across different files including `backend_pdf.py` suggests that this method is how users typically save plots to files, including PDFs. The method in `backend_pdf.py` would be directly related to how PDF files are generated and is a likely place where adjustments might be needed to support rotated clickable text areas. The intended behavior here would involve ensuring that when saving a figure as a PDF, any text elements with URLs are properly accounted for in their transformed (rotated) state.\n\n### Context around `plt.text`\nThe `plt.text` function is used widely across various examples in the codebase to add text to plots. The issue description mentions using `plt.text` to add clickable text to a plot. While the examples where `plt.text` is used didn't directly address the problem, they highlight the common use cases of text in plots. The relevant context here would be how `plt.text` integrates with the plotting backend (e.g., PDF) to ensure that text properties such as rotation and URLs are correctly handled. The intended behavior would be that any rotation applied to the text is also reflected in the calculation of the clickable area for the associated URL.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context\nGiven the above analysis, further context is needed regarding how `FigureCanvasPdf` manages text elements, specifically how it deals with URLs and the clickable area for those URLs. Additionally, looking at how `savefig` in `backend_pdf.py` processes text and its properties during the save operation is critical. Finally, understanding how `plt.text` interactions are rendered into PDFs by Matplotlib's PDF backend will provide insight into where the logic might need to be adjusted.\n\nTo dive deeper, the following API calls are proposed to gain the necessary context:\n- search_method_in_file(\"print_pdf\", \"lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py\")\n- search_method_in_file(\"draw\", \"lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py\")\n- search_code_in_file(\"text\", \"lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py\")\n\nThese calls aim to explore how drawing and printing operations in `FigureCanvasPdf` deal with text elements and their attributes, which is critical for addressing the reported bug."

This should preserve the ability to click on the actual displayed text, regardless of its rotation. All existing functionality for saving figures to PDF should be preserved without altering how other elements are saved or how text without URLs is handled.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py`\n  - **Class:** `FigureCanvasPdf`\n  - **Method:** `draw`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Ensure that during the drawing phase, text elements with URLs are flagged or annotated in such a way that the 'print_pdf' method can correctly interpret their rotation and adjust the clickable areas accordingly. This method should identify and handle text elements with rotation and URLs so that subsequent processing steps can apply the necessary modifications for rotated clickable areas, without affecting the rendering of text that does not include URLs or is not rotated.\n\n- **General Intended Update:**\n  - In addition to specific method changes, an overall update to the handling of text elements with URLs in PDFs may be required, including possibly introducing new utility functions or methods for calculating the transformed clickable areas (\"QuadPoints\"). These updates would need to carefully balance between supporting new functionality (rotated clickable text areas) and maintaining backward compatibility and general functionality for all other figure elements in PDF outputs."

        "content": "The collected context from the `FigureCanvasPdf` class, especially from the `print_pdf` and `draw` methods, alongside the code snippets that mention \"text\" in `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py`, provides valuable insights into how the PDF backend of Matplotlib handles drawing operations, including those involving text with URLs. Here's the analysis based on the given questions:\n\n### Analysis of `print_pdf`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `print_pdf` method is responsible for generating a PDF page from the given figure, setting the DPI, preparing the page dimensions, and finalizing the PDF file after drawing the content. It converts the Matplotlib figures into a PDF document, ensuring that the figure's elements are rendered within the PDF according to the specified properties like size and DPI.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - This method encapsulates the process of generating PDF content from Matplotlib figures but does not explicitly address customizable handling of clickable areas for text, such as accounting for rotation. Given the issue with unrotated URL-sensitive areas in the PDF output, adjustments here could be necessary to incorporate handling for \"QuadPoints\" that would define rotated clickable areas.\n\n3. **Intended behavior?**\n   - It should ensure that when figures with text elements (involving URLs) are converted to PDF, the clickable area of these URLs respects the text's rotation. This might involve integrating the calculation of \"QuadPoints\" for each text element with a URL and ensuring compatibility with PDF viewers that support this feature, offering a fallback to the typical rectangular clickable area otherwise.\n\n### Analysis of `draw`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `draw` method triggers the figure drawing operation without rendering, which is particularly meaningful in contexts like generating a PDF where rendering has specific requirements different from on-screen rendering. It delegates to the base class's `draw` to perform the actual rendering tasks.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Since drawing operations are concerned, adjustments in or branching from this method could be necessary to ensure that objects like text have their attributes (like rotation) appropriately considered when determining their interactions in a generated PDF.\n\n3. **Intended behavior?**\n   - The `draw` method should ensure that text objects with URLs are flagged for special handling during PDF rendering, enabling their clickable areas to match the visual rotation. This could involve additional processing steps specific to PDF generation that respect the properties of text objects like rotation and URL association.\n\n### Analysis of `text` usage in `backend_pdf.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The references to \"text\" throughout `backend_pdf.py` reveal its involvement in various aspects of text rendering in PDFs, including font handling, positioning, and special cases like mathtext or tex. The `draw_text`, `draw_mathtext`, and `draw_tex` methods indicate direct handling of text drawing operations.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - These snippets highlight the mechanisms through which text is processed and rendered into PDFs by Matplotlib, directly tying into how clickable URLs associated with text would be handled. The issue likely arises from these sections not accounting for transformations like rotation in the creation of clickable areas.\n\n3. **Intended behavior?**\n   - Modifications in these areas should ensure that the rendering of text elements with URLs into PDFs involves calculating their clickable areas with any transformations (e.g., rotation) applied. This could mean enhancing `draw_text` (and related functions) to calculate and store \"QuadPoints\" for text objects when preparing PDF documents, ensuring that these enhancements are compatible with PDF viewers of different capabilities.\n\n### Conclusion\nTo address the issue effectively, modifications are likely required in the `print_pdf` method to handle advanced definitions of clickable areas in PDFs, along with potentially substantial adjustments in how text rendering is handled (`draw_text` and related methods) to incorporate the calculation and use of \"QuadPoints\" in the output document. Implementing these changes would ensure that the URLs in rotated text elements are correctly clickable as per their visual representation in PDFs generated by Matplotlib."

This entails modifying or extending the processing of text elements to compute the correct coordinates for \"QuadPoints,\" which accurately reflect the rotated text's boundaries. Importantly, this enhancement must keep the existing functionality intact for PDF viewers that do not support \"QuadPoints,\" falling back on the standard Rect definition for clickable areas.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py`\n  - **Method:** `draw_text`, `draw_mathtext`, `draw_tex` (the exact method to be modified depends on a detailed examination of how these methods interact with URL-handling in practice; however, `draw_text` is the primary candidate)\n  - **Intended Behavior:** These methods must be adjusted or extended to calculate and pass \"QuadPoints\" information to the PDF generation logic for text elements marked with URLs. When a text element includes a rotation and a URL, the method should calculate the \"QuadPoints\" that describe the rotated text's actual clickable area. This information should then be used in the `print_pdf` method to create PDF elements with correctly oriented clickable areas. The calculation of \"QuadPoints\" should ensure compatibility with a broad range of PDF viewers, using Rect for the clickable area as a fallback mechanism where \"QuadPoints\" are unsupported.\n\nThese modifications aim to ensure that the rendering of PDFs by Matplotlib's `backend_pdf` module correctly handles clickable URLs for rotated text, according to specifications in the PDF standard and the issue report. This fix needs to be implemented with care to maintain backward compatibility and existing functionality for all PDF documents generated by Matplotlib, regardless of whether they include rotatable, clickable text."
