This `reproducer.py` script follows the given instructions to try to simulate the detection of an issue with URL rotation in a PDF generated with Matplotlib. However, the `check_link_rotation` function is a placeholder and always assumes an issue exists, as inspecting and verifying the actual rotation of links within a PDF file is non-trivial and would require a more complex solution involving PDF parsing libraries like `PyPDF2`, and in-depth PDF structure knowledge.

For a real-world scenario, you'd expand `check_link_rotation` to open the generated PDF (`pdf_path`), analyze its structure to locate the text annotation corresponding to the link, and verify whether its orientation matches the expected rotation. This would involve understanding the PDF format deeply, likely requiring reference to the PDF specification, and is beyond the scope of this simple example.
