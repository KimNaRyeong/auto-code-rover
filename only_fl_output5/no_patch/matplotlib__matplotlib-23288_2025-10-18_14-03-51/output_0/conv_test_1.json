QuadPoints\r\nshall be ignored if any coordinate in the array lies outside the region\r\nspecified by Rect.\r\n\r\nSo one would also need to provide a larger Rect, which, for viewers not supporting QuadPoints will lead to that the total rectangle outlined by the rotated text will be clickable.\r\n\r\nThis also holds for mathtexts.\n\n### Operating system\n\n_No response_\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\nmain\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\n_No response_\n\n### Python version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\ngit checkout\n"

However, the `check_link_rotation` function is a placeholder and always assumes an issue exists, as inspecting and verifying the actual rotation of links within a PDF file is non-trivial and would require a more complex solution involving PDF parsing libraries like `PyPDF2`, and in-depth PDF structure knowledge.\n\nFor a real-world scenario, you'd expand `check_link_rotation` to open the generated PDF (`pdf_path`), analyze its structure to locate the text annotation corresponding to the link, and verify whether its orientation matches the expected rotation. This would involve understanding the PDF format deeply, likely requiring reference to the PDF specification, and is beyond the scope of this simple example."
