        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### `expand_trig` Method in `sympy/core/function.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `expand_trig` function is a wrapper around the `expand` method, specifically utilizing the `trig` hint. It simplifies trigonometric expressions by expanding them, as shown in the provided example where `sin(x+y)*(x+y)` is expanded into `(x + y)*(sin(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*cos(x))`.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue pertains to `expand_trig` not expanding `csch(x + y)` and `sech(x + y)` into their corresponding expanded forms. The method's logic likely lacks handling or specific rules for expanding hyperbolic trigonometric functions like `csch` and `sech`. \n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be for `expand_trig` to expand `csch` and `sech` in a similar manner to how `csc` and `sec` are expanded. This implies adding logic to handle these cases, ideally following trigonometric identities that allow for their expansion.\n\n#### `TrigonometricFunction` Class in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - This class likely defines common properties and methods for trigonometric functions within SymPy. Its methods (`_eval_is_rational`, `_eval_is_algebraic`, etc.) suggest functionality for determining characteristics of these functions or expanding them in different forms.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Since `csch` and `sech` are hyperbolic trigonometric functions, they likely inherit from or are closely related to this class or a similar one for hyperbolic functions. Thus, the mechanism for their expansion could involve extending or modifying `TrigonometricFunction` or a comparable base class to incorporate expansion logic for `csch` and `sech`.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The class should facilitate or support the expansion of all trigonometric functions, including hyperbolic ones. This would mean possibly adding or modifying methods within this class or a related class to ensure `csch` and `sech` can be expanded via `expand_trig`.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps would involve:\n\n- Searching for the implementation of `csch` and `sech` functions to understand their current behavior and how they are defined.\n- Investigating how `expand` identifies and applies expansion rules for trigonometric functions, focusing on the mechanism that enables `expand_trig` to expand expressions involving `csc` and `sec`.\n- Exploring if there's a specific file or class handling the expansion logic for trigonometric functions, particularly looking at how functions are identified and expanded based on their trigonometric properties.\n\nFurther API calls could include searching for implementations of `csch` and `sech` and any methods or classes directly responsible for trigonometric expansions within SymPy."

This involves understanding and applying the trigonometric identities for `csch(x + y)` and `sech(x + y)` similarly to how `csc` and `sec` are expanded. The method needs to preserve its current functionality for other trigonometric functions while adding new cases for `csch` and `sech`. These cases should transform `csch(x + y)` and `sech(x + y)` into their expanded forms using the appropriate identities, enhancing the method's utility for a broader range of trigonometric expressions.\n\n   - **Location 2:**\n     - **File:** `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`\n     - **Class:** Potentially within `TrigonometricFunction` or a class specific to hyperbolic functions if such exists.\n     - **Intended Behavior:** If the expansion logic for `csch` and `sech` functions directly relates to their class definitions (for example, through a method that is used by `expand_trig`), it may be necessary to modify this class or an associated hyperbolic function class. This could involve adding or improving methods to support the expansion of these functions, making sure the behavior is consistent with trigonometric identities.\n\nThe solution involves accurately implementing the trigonometric identities for `csch` and `sech` during their expansion process without affecting the broader functionality of the `expand_trig` method or the trigonometric function classes."
