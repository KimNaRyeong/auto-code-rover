        "intended_behavior": "This file and specifically the classes or methods handling `csch` and `sech` should be modified to include logic that allows the `expand_trig` function to expand these functions correctly. This includes identifying the trigonometric identities for `csch` and `sech` that allow them to be expanded in a manner similar to `csc` and `sec`. The intended behavior is to ensure that when `expand_trig` is called with an expression involving `csch` or `sech`, the function returns an expanded form based on the appropriate identities, thus extending the `expand_trig` utility to cover these hyperbolic functions."

        "intended_behavior": "Although the primary logic to expand `csch` and `sech` might reside in `hyperbolic.py`, the `expand_trig` method itself may require adjustments or enhancements to ensure it correctly invokes the relevant expansion rules for hyperbolic functions. The method should be capable of recognizing when an expression contains `csch` or `sech` and apply the expansion logic defined in their respective implementations. This ensures that `expand_trig` remains a comprehensive tool for expanding trigonometric expressions, including both traditional and hyperbolic trigonometric functions."
