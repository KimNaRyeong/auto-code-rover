It simplifies trigonometric expressions by expanding them, as shown in the provided example where `sin(x+y)*(x+y)` is expanded into `(x + y)*(sin(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*cos(x))`.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue pertains to `expand_trig` not expanding `csch(x + y)` and `sech(x + y)` into their corresponding expanded forms. The method's logic likely lacks handling or specific rules for expanding hyperbolic trigonometric functions like `csch` and `sech`. \n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be for `expand_trig` to expand `csch` and `sech` in a similar manner to how `csc` and `sec` are expanded. This implies adding logic to handle these cases, ideally following trigonometric identities that allow for their expansion.\n\n#### `TrigonometricFunction` Class in `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - This class likely defines common properties and methods for trigonometric functions within SymPy. Its methods (`_eval_is_rational`, `_eval_is_algebraic`, etc.) suggest functionality for determining characteristics of these functions or expanding them in different forms.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Since `csch` and `sech` are hyperbolic trigonometric functions, they likely inherit from or are closely related to this class or a similar one for hyperbolic functions. Thus, the mechanism for their expansion could involve extending or modifying `TrigonometricFunction` or a comparable base class to incorporate expansion logic for `csch` and `sech`.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The class should facilitate or support the expansion of all trigonometric functions, including hyperbolic ones. This would mean possibly adding or modifying methods within this class or a related class to ensure `csch` and `sech` can be expanded via `expand_trig`.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps would involve:\n\n- Searching for the implementation of `csch` and `sech` functions to understand their current behavior and how they are defined.\n- Investigating how `expand` identifies and applies expansion rules for trigonometric functions, focusing on the mechanism that enables `expand_trig` to expand expressions involving `csc` and `sec`.\n- Exploring if there's a specific file or class handling the expansion logic for trigonometric functions, particularly looking at how functions are identified and expanded based on their trigonometric properties.\n\nFurther API calls could include searching for implementations of `csch` and `sech` and any methods or classes directly responsible for trigonometric expansions within SymPy."

This leads us to consider alternative strategies for gathering context and identifying where the logic for expanding these functions should be implemented or enhanced.\n\n### Adjusted Analysis Strategy\n\n1. **Exploring the SymPy Library Structure for Hyperbolic Functions:**\n   - Since `csch` and `sech` are hyperbolic trigonometric functions, their implementation and expansion logic might reside within a broader class or module dedicated to hyperbolic functions rather than discrete, easily searchable methods.\n\n2. **Searching for Trigonometric Function Expansion Logic:**\n   - Given the `expand_trig` function's reliance on certain hints and rules to expand expressions, it's possible that the expansion logic for `csch` and `sech` needs to be integrated into the existing framework for treating trigonometric expressions. This could involve modifying an internal rule set or adding new cases to handle these specific functions.\n\n### Next Steps for More Context\n\nGiven that the direct search for `csch` and `sech` methods did not yield results, the next logical step is to explore how hyperbolic functions, in general, are handled within SymPy. Here are some potential search API calls to make:\n\n- **Search for Hyperbolic Function Classes or Modules:**\n  - It could be useful to understand how hyperbolic functions are categorized or stored in the SymPy library. This might require a look into documentation or exploring the codebase's file structure for hints on hyperbolic function handling.\n  - Search for keywords or files related to hyperbolic functions: `search_code(\"hyperbolic\")` or similar API calls might reveal where functions like `csch` and `sech` are implemented or handled.\n\n- **Investigate the Expansion Framework:**\n  - Understanding the framework within which trigonometric expressions are expanded might provide insights into where and how to integrate the expansion logic for `csch` and `sech`.\n  - Searching for the underlying system that manages expansion rules or hints can be insightful: an API call targeting the architecture or rules related to expansion could be `search_code(\"expansion rules\")` or `search_code(\"trig expand\")`.\n\nThese strategies aim to uncover the underlying system of function implementation and expansion within SymPy, which is crucial for pinpointing where the logic for `csch` and `sech` expansion should be implemented to resolve the issue. Given the lack of direct references to `csch` and `sech`, the resolution likely involves a more nuanced understanding of SymPy's architecture rather than a straightforward bug fix in a single method."
