This script tests for the correct expansion of trigonometric hyperbolic functions `csch` and `sech` using the `expand_trig` function from `sympy`. It asserts the expected behavior against the currently observed behavior and prints a detailed stack trace if the behavior is not as expected, fulfilling the requirements for a reproducer script as described.
