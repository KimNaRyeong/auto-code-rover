        "intended_behavior": "This method needs to be updated to correctly handle the case when limiting operations involve the `bell` function with the limit approaching infinity (`oo`). The updated logic should recognize this specific scenario and return `oo` instead of `bell(oo)`, effectively evaluating the infinite limit of the Bell numbers as infinity. The update must preserve the method's ability to handle all other types of limits as it currently does, without introducing regressions for other functions or expressions."
