Below is the standalone Python script `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue with the `bell` function in SymPy not correctly handling the limit when `n` approaches infinity. The script contains an assertion to check if the issue persists by comparing the output with the expected result, which is infinity in this case. The script also includes the `print_stacktrace` function as provided, to print a stack trace if an `AssertionError` is caught. This script should be placed in the root directory of the project and executed with Python 3.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_bell_limit():
    from sympy import Symbol, bell, oo
    n = Symbol('n')
    result = bell(n).limit(n, oo)
    expected = oo  # Expected result is infinity
    assert result == expected, "Limit of bell(n) as n->oo should be oo, found {}".format(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_bell_limit()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise SystemExit(1)
    else:
        print("Test passed. The issue is fixed.")
        raise SystemExit(0)
```

When you run this script using Python 3:

- If the issue is present (the output of `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` is not infinity), an `AssertionError` will be raised, and the stack trace will be printed.
- If the issue is fixed, it prints "Test passed. The issue is fixed." and exits with the code 0.

This approach ensures the script behaves as specified, raising an error when the issue is present and exiting gracefully when the issue is not found.
