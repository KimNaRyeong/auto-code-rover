        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to missing checks and attributes in `sympy.stats`, we need to focus on the classes and methods within that module which deal with distributions. The issue doesn't specify which distributions are affected or what kind of checks and attributes are missing. Therefore, a generic approach to understanding the structure and current state of checks and attributes in the `sympy.stats` distributions is required. I will start by searching for classes within the `sympy.stats` module that are related to distributions, as well as looking for common methods where checks might be missing or attributes might need to be added.\n\nGiven that the issue is general and talks about enhancements and missing checks and attributes in various distributions but lacks specifics, the following API searches can help us gather a broad context:\n\n1. **Search for classes in `sympy.stats` related to distributions.** Since distribution classes are often named after the distribution they implement (e.g., `Normal`, `Binomial`), searching for specific class names might not be fruitful without knowing which distributions are being referenced in the issue. Instead, looking for common methods or attributes might provide a more useful overview.\n\n2. **Search for commonly used methods in distribution classes.** Methods such as `check`, `pdf`, or `set` are likely candidates for where missing checks or attributes would be added, as they often deal with parameter validation and setting properties of the distributions.\n\n3. **Look for any snippets indicating common patterns or declarations in distributions.** This might include searching for snippets that show how parameters are checked or how attributes are currently being set across different classes in `sympy.stats`.\n\nBased on the stated goal and the broad nature of the issue, my API calls would be:\n\n- search_code(\"sympy.stats\")\n- search_method(\"check\")\n- search_code(\"pdf\")\n\nThese calls aim to reveal how distributions are generally structured within `sympy.stats`, where checks might be missing, and how probability density functions are defined and handled, assuming that `check` and `pdf` methods are central to parameter validation and distribution definition, respectively."
