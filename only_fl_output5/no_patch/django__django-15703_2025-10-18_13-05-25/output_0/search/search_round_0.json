This involves finding occurrences and implementations of `index_together` and `indexes`, as well as how models are currently defined.\n\n1. **Search for Usage of `index_together`**: To understand how `index_together` is currently implemented across various models, we should look for its usage in the codebase.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"index_together\")\n```\n\n2. **Search for Usage of `indexes` and the `Index` Class**: To contrast with `index_together` and to get examples of the current or intended use of `indexes` and the `Index` class, we need to find their occurrences.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"indexes\")\nsearch_code(\"Index\")\n```\n\n3. **Find Model Definitions**: Since `index_together` and `indexes` are options within the `Meta` class of a Django model, understanding how models are generally structured will provide necessary context for recommending changes.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"class Meta:\")\n```\n\nThese searches aim to provide a comprehensive view of how indexing is currently handled in models and how it's planned to be transitioned. This context will help in forming a strategy to migrate from using `index_together` to `indexes` effectively."
