        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to CSRF failure on file upload when there's a storage problem, we need to explore various parts of the Django project codebase mentioned in the issue. The mentioned modifications and usages within `settings.py`, `models.py`, and `admin.py` provide a clear path for our initial search queries. Additionally, understanding how Django handles file uploads and CSRF verification will be crucial, which might involve the `FileField` handling and possible areas where the CSRF protection mechanism intersects with file handling and storage error handling.\n\nGiven the information from the issue, here are the specific API calls we should make:\n\n1. To understand how the `File` model is defined and used, since it's directly involved in the upload process:\n   - `search_class(\"File\")`\n\n2. Since the error seems related to CSRF verification but is triggered by storage issues, it would be beneficial to explore how CSRF is enforced or checked during the file upload process. This involves looking into Django's file upload mechanisms and CSRF middleware or decorators if there's any specific manipulation for uploads:\n   - `search_code(\"CSRF\")`\n   - `search_method(\"FileField\")`\n\n3. The settings related to file upload and media storage are crucial, especially the `FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE`, `MEDIA_ROOT`, and `FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR` settings. Examining their usage could reveal misconfigurations or problematic interactions leading to the error:\n   - `search_code(\"FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE\")`\n   - `search_code(\"MEDIA_ROOT\")`\n   - `search_code(\"FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR\")`\n\nThese search queries are aimed to give us a well-rounded context on how file uploads are managed, how CSRF protection is implemented in relation to file uploads, and how specific settings affect file handling in the project. This context will likely reveal clues on where the handling might be failing and leading to an incorrect CSRF failure message."
