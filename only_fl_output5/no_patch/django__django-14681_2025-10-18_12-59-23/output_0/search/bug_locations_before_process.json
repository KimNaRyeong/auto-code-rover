If a filesystem error is detected, such as inability to create or write to the FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR, raise a specific exception related to file storage instead of indirectly causing a CSRF verification failure. Preserve the existing functionality of determining whether the upload should be kept in memory or moved to filesystem based on size."

Ensure that CSRF verification failures are reported correctly as such, and other exceptions or errors (like those related to file storage or directory permissions) are not mistakenly reported as CSRF errors. This might involve adjusting error handling or exception catching in the middleware to discriminate between different types of errors more effectively."
