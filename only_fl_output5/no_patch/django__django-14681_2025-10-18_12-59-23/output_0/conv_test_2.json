        "content": "Unfortunately, the scenario you provided involves interaction with Django's file upload mechanism and admin interface, which inherently relies on Django's ORM, middleware, and settings configuration. A `.py` script that attempts to directly interact with these components but stands outside the Django app context would not be executable in a meaningful way to reproduce the issue as described.\n\nThe primary reason is that Django's functionality like handling file uploads, CSRF token verification, and interaction with models requires the Django server to be running and a configured project environment. This context includes settings like `MEDIA_ROOT`, `MEDIA_URL`, and CSRF middleware, which cannot be effectively simulated or interacted with purely through a standalone script without initializing Django's environment.\n\nTo properly reproduce the issue, you would typically write a test case within Django's testing framework which involves creating a test environment, simulating the file upload under different scenarios, and then checking the response for the expected error messages. This would require using Django's `Client` class for simulating web requests, including handling CSRF tokens and session data.\n\nHere is an illustrative example of how one could approach writing a test within Django's framework. It should be noted, however, that this is not a standalone script and it requires being part of a Django project where it can utilize Django's testing framework.\n\n```python\nfrom django.core.files.uploadedfile import SimpleUploadedFile\nfrom django.test import TestCase, override_settings\nfrom django.urls import reverse\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\n\nclass FileUploadTest(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Set up a user for logging in\n        self.user = User.objects.create_superuser(username='admin', email='admin@example.com', password='password')\n        self.client.login(username='admin', password='password')\n\n    def test_file_upload(self):\n        # Scenario 1: File upload under default conditions\n        with self.settings(MEDIA_ROOT='media/', FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR='media/tmp'):\n            self._upload_file_and_check_response()\n\n        # Scenario 2: Missing media/tmp directory\n        with self.settings(MEDIA_ROOT='media/', FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR='media/tmp_does_not_exist'):\n            self._upload_file_and_check_response(expected_failure=True)\n\n        # Scenario 3: Missing whole media directory might need different handling or manual testing\n        # as Django's settings might not be able to simulate missing MEDIA_ROOT during runtime\n\n    def _upload_file_and_check_response(self, expected_failure=False):\n        url = reverse('admin:yourapp_yourmodel_add')\n        file_data = {'file': SimpleUploadedFile('test.txt', b'abc')}\n        \n        response = self.client.post(url, file_data)\n\n        if expected_failure:\n            self.assertNotEqual(response.status_code, 200)\n        else:\n            self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)\n\n```\n\nThis code illustrates a Django test that attempts to login and upload a file under different configurations for `MEDIA_ROOT` and `FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR`. The actual implementation might require adjustments, especially in how you define the URL for file uploading (`reverse('admin:yourapp_yourmodel_add')`) and how the expected outcome is determined, particularly under failure conditions. This approach, integrated within a Django app, allows for running tests that encompass the app's file upload mechanics, CSRF protection, and the specific environment setup to replicate the issue described."
