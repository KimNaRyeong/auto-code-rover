        "intended_behavior": "The existing functionality ensures that aliases do not overlap; however, it does not account for scenarios where the change map results in sequential aliases, which could lead to an assert failure when keys intersect with values. The intended behavior should include enhanced logic to detect and resolve potential intersections of alias changes more dynamically. Specifically, it should increment the suffix for new aliases if a potential for overlap is detected, thus preventing the AssertionError. This modification should maintain the integrity of alias replacement while ensuring that alias updates do not inadvertently create a loop or conflict situation."

        "method": "combine",
        "intended_behavior": "Currently, combine intelligently merges two queries, considering aspects like model consistency, distinct clauses, and alias management. However, the issue highlights a flaw in how combined queries might manage aliases, particularly regarding ensuring that alias changes from the right-hand side (rhs) query do not interfere with or incorrectly overlap with those from the left-hand side. The intended behavior should include a more robust alias management strategy when merging queries, especially in handling aliases that can potentially interfere with each other. This involves revisiting the alias relabeling logic to prevent assertion errors due to overlapping alias changes, particularly focusing on scenarios where queries are combined using OR connectors, which present a higher risk for such conflicts."
