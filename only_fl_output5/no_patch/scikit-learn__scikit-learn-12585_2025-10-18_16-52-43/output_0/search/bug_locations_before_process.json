        "intended_behavior": "The `clone` method is intended to create a deep copy of an estimator with the same parameters. To resolve the issue, the method should be updated to properly handle cases where the `estimator` parameter is a class rather than an instance of a class. Specifically, before attempting to call `get_params` on the `estimator`, the method should check if `estimator` is a type. If it is, the method should either handle the type directly in a manner that is sensible for cloning (e.g., by returning the class itself without calling `get_params`, or by instantiating the class with default parameters if that aligns with the clone's intended usage). This ensures that when cloning an estimator type, the function does not fail because it tries to call an instance method (`get_params`) on a class. This behavior would preserve existing functionality while extending `clone`'s use to also cover estimator types, accommodating the specific use case mentioned in the issue without breaking existing expectations for instances of estimators."
