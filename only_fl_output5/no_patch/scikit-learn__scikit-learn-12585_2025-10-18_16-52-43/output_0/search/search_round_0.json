I'd happily submit a PR if this change is desired.\n#### Versions\nsklearn: 0.20.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about the implementation of the `clone` function as well as how the `StandardScaler` class is defined within the scikit-learn project. We will search for the method definition and usage of `clone`, examine the `StandardScaler` class to understand its structure, and look into how parameters are managed. Specifically, we'll need to look at `get_params` method which seems to be causing the problem when `clone` is called with a class instead of an instance.\n\nHere are the API calls that will be helpful:\n\n1. Search for the `clone` method in the entire codebase. This will help us find where `clone` is defined and possibly its implementation details.\n2. Search for the class `StandardScaler` to understand its structure and to verify if it indeed uses the `get_params` method which the traceback suggests is causing the issue.\n3. Since the issue mentions a specific line in a file (`File \"...\\lib\\site-packages\\sklearn\\base.py\", line 62,...`), although we don't have the exact file path, it's clear that it's within `sklearn\\base.py`. We will retrieve the code around the specified line to better understand the context of the error.\n\nAPI calls I'll make:\n\n- `search_method(\"clone\")`\n- `search_class(\"StandardScaler\")`\n- `get_code_around_line(\"sklearn/base.py\", 62, 10)`"
