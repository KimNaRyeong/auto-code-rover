To accurately reproduce the issue as described, involving `clone` failing when estimator classes are used as parameters, the following `reproducer.py` script is crafted. This script aims to directly mimic the steps provided in the problem statement, specifically calling `clone` on an estimator class (`StandardScaler` in this case) where one of its parameters is set incorrectly to another class. Upon execution, it will function as requested: an `AssertionError` is raised if the issue persists, notably catching and detailing the associated exception and stack trace. Conversely, should the issue be resolved, it will exit with code 0 without raising an error.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    from sklearn.base import clone
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    try:
        # Attempt to clone a StandardScaler with an incorrect parameter: a class instead of an instance
        # This line is intentionally flawed to reproduce the described error
        clone(StandardScaler(with_mean=StandardScaler))
        print("No error, the issue seems to be fixed or not reproducible.")
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("clone failed for parameters that are estimator types.")
```

**Instructions for Use:**

- Place `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project.
- Run the script using the command `python3 reproducer.py`.

This script is strictly aligned with the described use-case, where an estimator class itself is mistakenly passed as an argument to one of its parameters during the cloning process, which is not a standard or expected operation for `clone`. The outcome of this script directly demonstrates the behavior observed in the issue, providing a clear and structured way to assess the problem's presence and debug accordingly.
