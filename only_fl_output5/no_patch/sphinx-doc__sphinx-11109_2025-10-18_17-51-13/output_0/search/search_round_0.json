Instead, it is much cleaner to display them using the PEP 604 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0604/) syntax:\n`Union[X, Y, Z]` -> `X | Y | Z`\n`Optional[X]` -> `X | None`\nAdditionally, for `Literal` it is cleaner to strip the text \"Literal\" and just display the literal value with normal Python syntax highlighting:\n`Literal[\"X\"]` -> `\"X\"`\nThis is implemented in the tensorstore documentation via an ast transformation:\nhttps://github.com/google/tensorstore/blob/1a59fcb310bc1feb13569f03f7134b4c3a5fa5f4/docs/tensorstore_sphinx_ext/autodoc.py#L259\nThis should be supported in Sphinx via a config option.  The other improvement, of using syntax highlighting for constants, should also be integrated.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To get the necessary context to address the issue described, the following API calls are pertinent:\n\n1. Since the issue mentions `sphinx.domains.python._parse_annotation` as needing improvements for formatting `Union`, `Optional`, and `Literal`, it's essential to find the exact location and implementation details of `_parse_annotation`. Therefore:\n   - `search_method(\"_parse_annotation\")`\n\n2. Considering the request for a configuration option to support this feature in Sphinx, it's important to understand how configuration options are defined and parsed within Sphinx. It might be related to the Sphinx setup configuration or a specific sphinx extension handling configuration:\n   - `search_code(\"config.add\")`\n   - `search_code(\"setup(app)\")`\n\n3. The issue reference to the tensorstore documentation's implementation of an AST transformation hints at a possible similar requirement in Sphinx. Investigating how extensions or transformations are currently implemented in Sphinx might provide insights into integrating the new formatting logic:\n   - `search_code(\"visit_\")` (This is based on the assumption that AST node visitors in Sphinx extensions might use a similar naming convention as in the tensorstore documentation example provided.)\n\n4. Additionally, it's important to see how type annotations are currently formatted within the Sphinx codebase to ensure compatibility and identify where changes are most critical. For this, looking up how Sphinx deals with type hint rendering could be helpful:\n   - `search_code(\"format_annotation\")`\n\nThe results from these API calls will offer a broader insight into where and how to integrate the requested improvements and how Sphinx's extension mechanism could be leveraged to incorporate these changes effectively."
