This means transforming Union[X, Y] into X | Y and Optional[X] into X | None. This involves enhancing the logic within the _unparse_pep_604_annotation function and ensuring it's called appropriately when Union and Optional types are encountered. 2. Improve the display of Literal types by removing the 'Literal' prefix and displaying only the literal value, with appropriate syntax highlighting as necessary. This requires modifying how Literal types are detected and processed within the method, specifically in the sections where ast.Subscript nodes are handled. 3. Ensure that all changes respect a new configuration option that controls this behavior, enabling the project to preserve backward compatibility. This means the changes must check this configuration before applying the new formatting rules."

Defining the new configuration option with a sensible default that preserves current behavior. 2. Ensuring _parse_annotation and potentially other relevant methods or functions check this configuration option before applying the new formatting logic. 3. Documenting the new configuration option appropriately to inform users of its availability and effects."
