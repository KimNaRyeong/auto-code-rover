When processing the `**kwargs` within `tick_params`, the method should apply the specified `fontfamily` to both the x-axis and y-axis tick labels, ensuring that if `fontfamily` is specified, it is respected and applied correctly to the ticks as specified by the `axis` argument. This enhancement must ensure backward compatibility, thus, if `fontfamily` is not specified, the default behavior (using the plot's or the system's default font family) remains unchanged."

        "intended_behavior": "Update the `tick_params` method to accept and correctly apply a `fontfamily` keyword argument for the 'x', 'y', and crucially, the 'z' axis, considering the 3D context. As with the 2D scenario, ensure that specifying `fontfamily` changes the font family of the tick labels according to the user's input while keeping all other functionalities intact. Special attention should be paid to integrating this functionality within the 3D plotting constraints and ensuring compatibility with the generalized matplotlib styles and options framework. Furthermore, since the 3D method calls its 2D counterpart for the 'x' and 'y' axes, care must be taken to harmonize the handling of `fontfamily` between these implementations."
