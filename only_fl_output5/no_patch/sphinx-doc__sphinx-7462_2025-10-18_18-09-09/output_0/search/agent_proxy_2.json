This involves adding a conditional check before each `result.pop()` invocation. The modification is aimed at handling the case where Sphinx tries to unparse Python type annotations that result in no output (e.g., an empty tuple `Tuple[()]`), ensuring that the `pop` operation is only called on lists that have elements to be popped, effectively preventing the index error. This safeguard allows Sphinx to accurately represent empty tuples and other similar constructs in documentation without raising exceptions due to trying to remove non-existent trailing characters (like commas or brackets) in the textual representation being constructed.\n\nThe modification would ensure that operations which assume the presence of elements in the list, notably the `pop()` method, are only executed when the list indeed contains items, thus preserving the existing functionality while preventing runtime exceptions for edge cases such as empty tuple type annotations."
