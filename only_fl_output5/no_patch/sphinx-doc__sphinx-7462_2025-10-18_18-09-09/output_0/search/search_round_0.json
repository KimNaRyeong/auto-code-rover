Write contents of snippet to module and set it to be explorable by sphinx.\n2. Install dependencies, in my `docs/requirements.txt`:\n```txt\nSphinx>=2.0.1\nsphinx-rtd-theme>=0.4.3\n```\n2. Build docs.\n**Expected behavior**\nDocs are built and there is `foo` with valid type annotations.\n**Your project**\nhttps://github.com/lycantropos/robust/tree/1c7b74e0cc39c1843a89583b8c245f08039a3978\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Windows 10, but also reproduces on [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/shewchuk/builds/10817256/).\n- Python version: 3.8.0\n- Sphinx version: 3.0.1\n- Sphinx extensions:  `['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'sphinx.ext.viewcode']`\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue at hand effectively, we'll need to understand the scope and utilization of the problematic code snippet within the Sphinx extension as outlined in the issue description. Particularly, understanding how Sphinx processes type annotations and where the `IndexError: pop from empty list` originates. Given that we have a specific trace to the `sphinx.domains.python.py` file and a line number, the approach should focus around gathering more context around the implementation of `unparse` method and its usage, as well as how the project defines and uses empty tuple type annotations.\n\nLet's perform the following API calls to gather the required context:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"def unparse(\", \"sphinx/domains/python.py\")`: This will allow us to locate the implementation details of the `unparse` method within the Sphinx domain for Python, to better understand the logic that leads to attempting to pop from an empty list.\n  \n- `search_method_in_file(\"foo\", \"path/to/your/module\")`: Since the exact module path isn't provided, this example call intends to find the definition of the function `foo` within the project. An actual invocation must replace `\"path/to/your/module\"` with the concrete path of the Python file mentioned in the steps to reproduce the issue. This call is representative - to find real instances, replace the path with the actual file path where `foo` is defined.\n\nUnfortunately, without precise file names or class names related to the Sphinx extension's handling of type annotations and the specifics of the `robust` project structure, we are constrained in making more targeted API calls. Further direction and specific filenames or classes associated with this issue would enable a more directed inquiry."
