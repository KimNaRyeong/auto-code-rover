Given the feedback and the specifics of the task, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the execution context or the expected outcome in my previous response. Let's adjust the approach based on the corrected understanding that the AssertionError should only be raised when the issue is unsolved and not otherwise. Here's a revised version of the `reproducer.py` file accounting for these considerations:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    from sympy import symbols, acsc, asec, latex, Function
    x = symbols('x')
    
    # Incorrect function names workaround
    class acsc_fixed(Function):
        @classmethod
        def eval(cls, arg):
            return acsc(arg)
    
    class asec_fixed(Function):
        @classmethod
        def eval(cls, arg):
            return asec(arg)
    
    # Test for full inverse trig function names
    try:
        latex_acsc_full = latex(acsc_fixed(x), inv_trig_style="full")
        expected_acsc = '\\arccsc{\\left (x \\right )}'
        latex_asec_full = latex(asec_fixed(x), inv_trig_style="full")
        expected_asec = '\\arcsec{\\left (x \\right )}'

        assert latex_acsc_full == expected_acsc, f"Expected {expected_acsc}, got {latex_acsc_full}"
        assert latex_asec_full == expected_asec, f"Expected {expected_asec}, got {latex_asec_full}"
        print("Issue fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

This script adjusts for the oversight in capturing the issue presence vs. its resolution and is designed to raise an `AssertionError` accurately when the bug is present in the system. The script should execute successfully (exit code 0) when the issue is fixed, adhering to the specified requirement.
