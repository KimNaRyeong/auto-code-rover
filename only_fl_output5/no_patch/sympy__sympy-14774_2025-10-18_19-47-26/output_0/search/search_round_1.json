This method appears to be responsible for generating LaTeX representations of function expressions in SymPy.\n   - Inside this method, an `inv_trig_table` list is defined (line 743), containing the abbreviated names of some inverse trigonometric functions: `[\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]`.\n   - Following the definition of `inv_trig_table`, there is conditional logic to handle the style (`abbreviated` or `full`) of inverse trigonometric functions based on their presence in `inv_trig_table`.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue reported is that the `LatexPrinter` does not support full names for the inverse trigonometric functions `acsc` and `asec` when the `inv_trig_style` option is set to `\"full\"`. The reason behind this behavior is because `acsc` and `asec` are missing from the `inv_trig_table`, preventing the `LatexPrinter` from recognizing them as inverse trigonometric functions requiring special handling for their full names.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be for the `LatexPrinter` to correctly handle both `acsc` and `asec` functions in the same manner as `asin`, `acos`, `atan`, and `acot` when generating their LaTeX representations. Specifically, when `inv_trig_style` is set to `\"full\"`, the printer should output their full names (`arccsc` and `arcsec`, respectively) instead of defaulting to a more generic representation.\n   - To achieve this, based on the issue description, the `inv_trig_table` needs to be updated to include `acsc` and `asec`, thus allowing the conditional logic to process these functions correctly for both abbreviated and full naming styles.\n\nGiven the context and analysis above, the fix proposed in the issue description (to update `inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acsc\", \"asec\", \"acot\"]`) addresses the problem directly by extending the `inv_trig_table` to recognize `acsc` and `asec`. This would enable the appropriate handling of these functions within the `_print_Function` method, ensuring that their full names are used when the `inv_trig_style` is set to `\"full\"`."

Bug location:\n   - File: `sympy/printing/latex.py`\n   - Class: `LatexPrinter`\n   - Method: `_print_Function`\n   \n   Intended behavior: The method `_print_Function` within the `LatexPrinter` class is meant to generate LaTeX representations for function expressions in SymPy. The intended behavior, with regards to resolving the issue, is to ensure that when the `inv_trig_style` is set to `\"full\"`, the full names for `acsc` and `asec` (`arccsc` and `arcsec` respectively) are correctly returned. To achieve this, the `inv_trig_table` variable within the method should be updated to include `acsc` and `asec` entries. This will allow the conditional logic that handles the formatting of inverse trigonometric functions to recognize and process `acsc` and `asec` correctly, preserving the existing functionality for other inverse trigonometric functions, while ensuring that `acsc` and `asec` are no longer omitted when their full names are requested through the `inv_trig_style=\"full\"` option."
