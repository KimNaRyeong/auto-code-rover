        "intended_behavior": "The method `_print_Function` within the `LatexPrinter` class is meant to generate LaTeX representations for function expressions in SymPy. The intended behavior, with regards to resolving the issue, is to ensure that when the `inv_trig_style` is set to `\"full\"`, the full names for `acsc` and `asec` (`arccsc` and `arcsec` respectively) are correctly returned. To achieve this, the `inv_trig_table` variable within the method should be updated to include `acsc` and `asec` entries. This will allow the conditional logic that handles the formatting of inverse trigonometric functions to recognize and process `acsc` and `asec` correctly, preserving the existing functionality for other inverse trigonometric functions, while ensuring that `acsc` and `asec` are no longer omitted when their full names are requested through the `inv_trig_style=\"full\"` option."
