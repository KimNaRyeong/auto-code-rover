        "content": "<issue>[ENH]: use new style format strings for colorbar ticks\n### Problem\nAt the moment, the default format strings in colorbar are old style ones, as in their init there is:\nhttps://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/67e18148d87db04d2c8d4293ff12c56fbbb7fde8/lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py#L489-L492\nwhich is a different convention from the one of a normal axis, which was introduced in #16715.\n### Proposed solution\nAs in `update_ticks` we pass the colorbar's formatter to the long axis,\nhttps://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/67e18148d87db04d2c8d4293ff12c56fbbb7fde8/lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py#L801\nthe `if` statement above may be removed to keep the default logic only in `Axis`. Right now one can pass a callable directly (although that's not documented), and the default behaviour from #16715 is triggered. However, I guess making this change for format strings would imply a deprecation cycle, as it breaks current behaviour. Another option would be to check in `Axis._set_formatter`  for what kind of string format we've been passed (unsure how, although there must be way).\n### Additional context and prior art\n_No response_\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue adequately, we should first understand how the current formatting logic for colorbar ticks is implemented and then see how it interacts with the default axis formatting logic introduced in the mentioned pull request (#16715). Based on the information from the issue submission, I will make the following API calls to gather the required context:\n\n1. Gather context around the initialization of the default format strings in the `Colorbar` class, specifically in `colorbar.py`.\n```python\nget_code_around_line(\"lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py\", 489, 5)\n```\n\n2. Understand how the `update_ticks` method works within the `Colorbar` class, and how it passes the formatter to the long axis.\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"update_ticks\", \"lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py\")\n```\n\n3. Since the issue suggests that a deprecation cycle might be necessary due to potential backward compatibility concerns, we need to see if `Axis._set_formatter` can indeed check the format string type. This requires understanding its current implementation.\n```python\nsearch_method(\"_set_formatter\")\n```\n\nThese API calls will give us the needed context on how format strings are currently handled within colorbars and axes, and how a shift to the new style format strings could be managed."
