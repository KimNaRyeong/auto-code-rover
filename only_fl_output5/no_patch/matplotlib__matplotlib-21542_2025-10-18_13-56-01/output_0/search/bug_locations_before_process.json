The __init__ method should either directly use or mirror the logic seen in Axis._set_formatter to support new-style format strings by default. This change ensures that format strings used in colorbars are handled in the same versatile and flexible manner as those in axes, which already support new-style format strings following enhancement #16715."

        "intended_behavior": "While not directly a \"bug,\" the current implementation does not clearly support or document the ability for users to pass callable formatters directly to the colorbar's format parameter. With the intended change in how format strings are processed (moving to new-style format strings), it's also an opportunity to align and potentially enhance the documentation or code comments regarding the use of callable formatters in colorbar initialization, ensuring users are aware of this capability and its intended usage aligns with the broader matplotlib formatting logic."
