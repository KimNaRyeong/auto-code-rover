Right now one can pass a callable directly (although that's not documented), and the default behaviour from #16715 is triggered. However, I guess making this change for format strings would imply a deprecation cycle, as it breaks current behaviour. Another option would be to check in `Axis._set_formatter`  for what kind of string format we've been passed (unsure how, although there must be way).\n### Additional context and prior art\n_No response_\n</issue>"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Analyzing the returned code snippets and their relation to the issue at hand:\n\n### 1. Initialization of Default Format Strings in `Colorbar`\n\n#### Snippet Analysis:\nThe code from `lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py` around line 489 shows how the `Colorbar` class deals with the `format` argument during initialization. If `format` is a string, it initializes a `FormatStrFormatter` with it; otherwise, it assumes `format` is a `Formatter` instance or `None`.\n\n#### Relation to the Issue:\nThe issue reports that the colorbar currently uses old-style format strings as default, which is underlined by the explicit creation of `FormatStrFormatter` when a string is provided. This approach contrasts with the new formatting convention used elsewhere, following enhancement #16715.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\nConsidering the issue description, the intended behavior would suggest a move towards new-style format strings or at least consistency with the formatting logic applied in the `Axis` class, to avoid using the old-style format string by default.\n\n### 2. The `update_ticks` Method in `Colorbar`\n\n#### Snippet Analysis:\nThe `update_ticks` method calls `_get_ticker_locator_formatter` and then applies the `locator`, `minorlocator`, and `formatter` to what is referred to as the `_long_axis()`. This design shows how the colorbar's tick formatting and positioning are deeply coupled with its underlying axis mechanism.\n\n#### Relation to the Issue:\nThis portion of the code is directly mentioned in the issue because it highlights how the formatting for colorbar ticks is currently applied. The issue suggests removing dependency on old-style formatters in this process, aligning it more closely with how axes handle their formatting post-#16715 enhancement.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\nTo align with the issue's proposal, `update_ticks` might not need any modification itself but would be affected by changes in how `self.formatter` is initialized and handled, especially if the system switches to a new-style formatting by default or enhances `Axis._set_formatter` handling.\n\n### 3. `_set_formatter` Method in `Axis`\n\n#### Snippet Analysis:\nIn `lib/matplotlib/axis.py`, the `_set_formatter` method shows flexibility in handling different types of `formatter`: if it is a string, `StrMethodFormatter` is used (supporting new-style string formatting); if callable, `FuncFormatter` is applied; otherwise, it checks if the formatter complies with being an instance of `mticker.Formatter`.\n\n#### Relation to the Issue:\nThis method is pivotal to understanding how the new-style format strings could be integrated or already support within axes, following the enhancement from #16715. It also points out how a string is implicitly treated as new-style (via `StrMethodFormatter`) contrary to the old-style found in `Colorbar`.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\nIn light of the issue, the intended behavior could lean towards ensuring `Colorbar` utilizes `Axis._set_formatter` (or a similar approach) to apply formats, thus benefiting from its flexible handling of formatters, including new-style format strings.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the snippets and their analyses, the resolution of the issue would likely involve refactoring the `Colorbar` initialization and possibly its interaction with `update_ticks` to embrace the new-style formatting by leveraging the more versatile `_set_formatter` logic found in `Axis`. This change aims to achieve consistency across the library, making a clear move from old-style to new-style format strings as per the issue's enhancement proposal. Further steps could involve testing these changes for backward compatibility and considering a deprecation cycle if old behavior is significantly altered."

The `__init__` method should either directly use or mirror the logic seen in `Axis._set_formatter` to support new-style format strings by default. This change ensures that format strings used in colorbars are handled in the same versatile and flexible manner as those in axes, which already support new-style format strings following enhancement #16715.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**  \n  - **File:** `lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py`  \n  - **Context for enhancement:** While not directly a \"bug,\" the current implementation does not clearly support or document the ability for users to pass callable formatters directly to the colorbar's `format` parameter. With the intended change in how format strings are processed (moving to new-style format strings), it's also an opportunity to align and potentially enhance the documentation or code comments regarding the use of callable formatters in colorbar initialization, ensuring users are aware of this capability and its intended usage aligns with the broader matplotlib formatting logic.   \n\n- **Additional Consideration for Deprecation:**  \n  Given the potential impact on existing codebases relying on the current default behavior (i.e., the use of old-style formatting strings in colorbars), it may be necessary to introduce these changes as part of a deprecation cycle. This approach would involve clearly communicating the upcoming change, providing users with warnings when old-style format strings are used, and offering guidance on transitioning to the new-style formats. This deprecation logic doesn't reside in a specific method but would need to be incorporated where old and new behaviors diverge---most likely within the `__init__` method and wherever the format handling is adjusted."
