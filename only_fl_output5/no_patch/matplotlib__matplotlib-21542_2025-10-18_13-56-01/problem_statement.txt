[ENH]: use new style format strings for colorbar ticks
### Problem

At the moment, the default format strings in colorbar are old style ones, as in their init there is:

https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/67e18148d87db04d2c8d4293ff12c56fbbb7fde8/lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py#L489-L492

which is a different convention from the one of a normal axis, which was introduced in #16715. 

### Proposed solution

As in `update_ticks` we pass the colorbar's formatter to the long axis,

https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/67e18148d87db04d2c8d4293ff12c56fbbb7fde8/lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py#L801

the `if` statement above may be removed to keep the default logic only in `Axis`. Right now one can pass a callable directly (although that's not documented), and the default behaviour from #16715 is triggered. However, I guess making this change for format strings would imply a deprecation cycle, as it breaks current behaviour. Another option would be to check in `Axis._set_formatter`  for what kind of string format we've been passed (unsure how, although there must be way).
