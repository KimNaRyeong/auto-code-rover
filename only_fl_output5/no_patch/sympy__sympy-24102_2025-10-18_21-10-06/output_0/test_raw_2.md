This script aims to reproduce the specific issue reported concerning the `parse_mathematica` function's inability to parse Greek characters in `SymPy`. It is designed to be executed in the root directory of the project and will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, thus failing as expected. When the issue is fixed (i.e., the function can parse Greek characters without throwing an error), the script should raise a different `AssertionError` stating that the method should not have successfully parsed a Greek character, indicating that the failure to reproduce the issue is due to the resolution of the bug. This distinction ensures that the script accurately reflects the state of the issue at any given time.
