        "content": "Based on the issue description involving the `parse_mathematica` function which cannot parse Greek characters in SymPy v. 1.11, we need to gather information and context related to this function and possibly the class it resides in within the `sympy.parsing.mathematica` package. Here are the specific API calls that would be useful:\n\n1. `search_method(\"parse_mathematica\")` - This call is crucial to locate the `parse_mathematica` method within the codebase. Understanding its implementation will help in identifying why it fails to parse Greek characters.\n\n2. `search_code(\"from sympy.parsing.mathematica import parse_mathematica\")` - This call will help locate files importing or using `parse_mathematica`, which might lead to additional contexts on how this function is expected to be used within the project.\n\n3. `search_class(\"mathematica\")` - Although the issue mentions that the `mathematica` function is deprecated in favour of `parse_mathematica`, understanding the class in which it was a method (assuming it was part of a class) can provide insights into the intended functionality and possibly why the new implementation does not perform as expected."
