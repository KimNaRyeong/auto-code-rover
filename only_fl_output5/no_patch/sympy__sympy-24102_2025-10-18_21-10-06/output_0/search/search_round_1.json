It supports both standard Mathematica input and full form expressions, transforming them to their SymPy counterparts if possible or creating an expression similar to Mathematica's \"FullForm\" using SymPy `Function` objects otherwise.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The issue at hand is that `parse_mathematica` fails to parse Greek characters, which suggests a problem in how the function interprets or processes non-standard characters or symbols within the input string.\n- **Intended Behavior:** Given the use case illustrated in the issue, the `parse_mathematica` function is expected to accurately parse expressions containing Greek characters and possibly other non-standard characters, converting them into their equivalent SymPy expressions without raising a syntax error.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Understanding `parse_mathematica` and the Bug:** The `parse_mathematica` function's main task is parsing and transforming Mathematica expressions into SymPy expressions. The bug indicates a shortfall in handling Greek characters, which were presumably handled correctly by the deprecated `mathematica` function or method.\n\n2. **Code Mechanics:** The function utilizes a `MathematicaParser` object, invoking the `.parse(s)` method on it. The core of the issue likely lies within this parser's implementation and its capability (or lack thereof) to translate symbols or characters outside the typical English alphabet or ASCII range.\n\n3. **Related Components:** Since the `MathematicaParser` class or object is utilized directly in the `parse_mathematica` method (see line 81 in the snippet), the implementation details of this parser are crucial for resolving the bug. Specifically, how it processes and converts input strings into AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) elements or nodes that can be interpreted and represented within SymPy's symbolic mathematics context.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nTo proceed towards a resolution, we need to inspect the `MathematicaParser` object's implementation, particularly focusing on:\n- Its method for handling and parsing input strings (`parse(s)` method),\n- Any specialized handling for Greek or non-ASCII characters,\n- The mechanism employed for transforming Mathematica expressions into SymPy equivalent forms, especially in cases involving symbols or characters that might have different representations or no direct counterparts between the two systems.\n\nGiven this analysis, the immediate next step would be to look into the `MathematicaParser` class or object and its methods, specifically how it handles parsing.\n\n#### Required API Calls for Further Context\n- `search_class(\"MathematicaParser\")`: This will provide insights into the parser's implementation which is directly invoked by `parse_mathematica`.\n  \nThis direction will potentially uncover the technical limitations or oversight within the parsing logic that leads to the inability to process Greek characters, offering a concrete pathway towards developing a fix."

This includes correctly parsing these characters as valid symbols or function names in the context of SymPy expressions, thereby preserving the functionality to handle a broader spectrum of Mathematica input. The parser should maintain all existing functionalities for translating Mathematica syntax and constructs into SymPy but also correctly handle the full range of Mathematica's character set, including Greek letters and other special symbols, without throwing syntax errors. The solution should ensure that inputs like `'\u03bb'` are correctly parsed into their SymPy equivalents, in this case perhaps as `Symbol('\u03bb')`, thus maintaining compatibility with Mathematica inputs that exploit the full range of its symbolic representation capabilities."
