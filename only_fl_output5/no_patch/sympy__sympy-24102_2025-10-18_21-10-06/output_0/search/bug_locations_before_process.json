        "intended_behavior": "The class should be enhanced to ensure Greek characters and other non-ASCII symbols are accurately recognized and converted into equivalent SymPy expressions without loss of information or functionality. This might involve adding additional entries to the _atom_conversions dictionary for Greek characters, ensuring the tokenizer correctly identifies these characters as valid parts of an expression, and updating any transformation rules that might misinterpret or incorrectly handle these symbols. The overall goal is to maintain the parser's functionality while extending its character handling capabilities to include Greek symbols and possibly other non-ASCII characters seamlessly."
