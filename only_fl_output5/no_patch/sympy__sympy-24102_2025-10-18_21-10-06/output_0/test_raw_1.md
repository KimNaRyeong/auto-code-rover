This script is designed to reproduce the reported issue where `parse_mathematica` from the `sympy.parsing.mathematica` module cannot parse Greek characters. It will catch and assert an error if the issue persists, and it will print a detailed stack trace using the `print_stacktrace` function provided. If the issue has been resolved, it will print a message indicating no error was encountered and exit gracefully with code 0.
