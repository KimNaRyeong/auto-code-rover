This script tries to parse a Greek character (λ) with the `parse_mathematica` function from SymPy to reproduce the reported issue. It contains an assertion to raise an error if the function unexpectedly succeeds, which could indicate that the issue has been fixed.

The `print_stacktrace` function is used to print out the stack trace clearly if an exception occurs, providing details on where the error happened. The script exits with code 0 to indicate that the error was expected and correctly triggered due to the current issue.
