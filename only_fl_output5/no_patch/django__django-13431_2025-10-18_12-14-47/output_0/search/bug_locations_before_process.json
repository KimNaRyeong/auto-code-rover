        "intended_behavior": "This method should correctly handle the aliases provided by earlier annotate calls in the query construction process to ensure that the SQL generated does not reference incorrect or non-existent fields. Specifically, when aggregating on an annotated field, the aggregation should reference the alias of the field rather than its original name if an alias is provided. This behavior must preserve the method's existing functionality to support aggregation on both annotated and non-annotated fields without causing SQL errors. The resolution may involve enhancing how the query builder interprets and translates field references in the presence of aliases, ensuring that the final SQL query accurately reflects the logical structure defined within the Django ORM."

        "intended_behavior": "This location is hypothesized as a potential debug point rather than a confirmed bug location. Given the nature of the issue, ensuring that _validate_values_are_expressions can accurately recognize and validate expressions that include aliases might be crucial. The method should ensure that expressions, particularly those involving aliases (as created by annotate and consumed by aggregate), are correctly identified as valid. While this method might not directly contribute to the error described, ensuring its capability to handle expressions involving aliases can be seen as a preventive measure against possible misinterpretations of such expressions within the aggregation process. This would ensure the robustness of field validation in complex query constructions, preserving and extending existing functional behavior to cover edge cases introduced by field aliasing."
