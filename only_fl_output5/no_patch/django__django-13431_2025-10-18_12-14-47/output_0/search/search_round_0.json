Specifically, understanding the implementation of the SQL generation process within these methods will be crucial. \n\nBelow are the API calls that would help in gathering the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"QuerySet\")`: This will provide a broad overview of the QuerySet class, where both aggregate() and annotate() methods should reside or be closely related.\n   \n2. `search_method(\"aggregate\")`: Since the issue occurs during the use of the aggregate() method, getting more context on its implementation will help.\n   \n3. `search_method(\"annotate\")`: Similarly, because annotate() is also mentioned as part of the process that leads to the error, understanding its implementation is essential.\n\nThe combination of information from these API calls should provide a good starting point for resolving the issue described."
