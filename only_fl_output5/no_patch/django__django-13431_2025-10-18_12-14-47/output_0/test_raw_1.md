Given the constraints and the requirements, let me correct the approach and focus on creating a script that mimics the original environment more closely, ensuring it utilizes SQLite for simplicity and adheres to the given task without depending on external database setups. This change aims to circumvent the MySQL dependency issue, acknowledging that the direct replication of the SQL error related to MySQL might not be fully achievable with SQLite. However, the script will attempt to highlight the aggregation and annotation process with Django ORM, which should closely align with the intended use case.

```python
# reproducer.py

import os
import sys
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models, OperationalError
from django.db.models import Max, Sum, F

# Setup minimal Django Configuration
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=(
        '__main__',
    ),
    USE_TZ=True,
)

django.setup()

# Define the model
class T(models.Model):
    id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    foo = models.IntegerField()

    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    trace = sys.exc_info()[2]
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    while trace is not None:
        filename = trace.tb_frame.f_code.co_filename
        lineno = trace.tb_lineno
        print(f'  File "{filename}", line {lineno}', file=sys.stderr)
        trace = trace.tb_next
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Initialize the model table
    try:
        with django.db.connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:
            schema_editor.create_model(T)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

    # Insert sample data
    try:
        T.objects.bulk_create([T(foo=10), T(foo=20)])
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

    # Perform the query that is suspected to be problematic
    try:
        result = T.objects.annotate(anon=F('foo')).aggregate(foo=Max('anon'), sum=Sum('foo'))
    except OperationalError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("\nFailed due to OperationalError, which indicates the issue is present.")
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("\nFailed due to an unexpected error.")
        exit(1)

    # Assuming reaching this point means the OperationalError was not encountered
    assert 'foo' in result and 'sum' in result, "Expected keys are missing in the result."
    print("Result keys are present, indicating the issue might not be replicable with SQLite.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Please note: This adapted script is designed to bypass the MySQL-specific dependency and issue replication by utilizing SQLite. Given that the original problem is database-specific, the behavior might not be accurately replicated in SQLite. However, it attempts to retain the core focus on annotating and aggregating fields, demonstrating how to script a problem reproduction in a simplified environment.
