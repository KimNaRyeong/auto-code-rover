Here is a standalone `reproducer.py` file tailored to more precisely follow the described issue and utilize the supplied function for printing the stack trace. This script is crafted under the assumption that Django and a compatible database backend are properly configured. Since the original issue is specific to how Django's ORM translates a complex query involving annotations and aggregations into SQL, and it may specifically require a MySQL database to fully reproduce the SQL error mentioned, the script does not attempt to switch or configure a database backend. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure your Django project is already set up with a MySQL database to accurately replicate the reported issue.

```python
# reproducer.py
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models, OperationalError
from django.db.models import Max, Sum, F
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

            'USER': 'YOUR_DATABASE_USER',
            'PASSWORD': 'YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD',
            'HOST': 'YOUR_DATABASE_HOST',  # Or an IP Address that your DB is hosted on
            'PORT': 'YOUR_DATABASE_PORT',
        }

        app_label = '__main__'


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):

    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)

        print(result)  # This is expected to fail or produce incorrect results based on the issue description
        # If the error is production-specific and does not raise an exception, 
        # an additional assertion might be required to validate the output consistency.
    except OperationalError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue has been reproduced.") from e

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        run_reproducer()
    except AssertionError as ae:
        # The AssertionError indicates the presence of the issue.
        print(str(ae))
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    else:
        # No errors encountered; assume the issue has been fixed or cannot be replicated.
        print("Execution completed successfully; the issue may not have been replicated or may have been fixed.")
        exit(0)
```

Before running this script, please adjust the database settings (`YOUR_DATABASE_NAME`, `YOUR_DATABASE_USER`, etc.) to match your MySQL setup. Note that the `migrate` call in `run_reproducer()` is used to create the table for model `T` at runtime, ensuring the environment is correctly set up for the test.

The script aims to trigger an `OperationalError` by attempting to reproduce the issue as described. Upon such an error, it will use the `print_stacktrace` function to clearly indicate where and why the error occurred, meeting the criteria for printing a stack trace of the issue.
