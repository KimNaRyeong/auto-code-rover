To run this script, you will need to have Django installed and a minimal setup may be required (although for the sake of this reproducer, an attempt has been made to bypass Django's typical project setup by faking the settings module). The script should be executed in an environment where the Django library is available and it's assumed that the described issue with the `CharField` initialization and `MaxLengthValidator` is current in the version of Django being used.

When the issue is fixed, as per the scenario described, the script intends to exit with code 0 without raising any exceptions, assuming the modification to the `CharField.__init__` method correctly bypasses adding the `MaxLengthValidator` if `max_length` is `None`.
