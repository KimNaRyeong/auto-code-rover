        "intended_behavior": "Modify the __init__ method of the CharField to conditionally include the MaxLengthValidator based on whether self.max_length is not None. This ensures that the MaxLengthValidator is only appended when max_length has a valid (non-None) value. The validation for max_length should remain intact for fields where a max_length is explicitly defined, thus preserving the existing functionality for such cases. The amendment prevents type errors during validation phases where a MaxLengthValidator might be invoked without a meaningful comparison possibility due to the absence of max_length. This change directly addresses the root cause of the reported issue while ensuring that the CharField's flexibility and functionality are maintained within its intended operational context."
