Given your requirements, here's a revised version of `reproducer.py`. This script simulates a simple Django environment within itself to avoid dependencies on a specific project's setup, focusing directly on the issue at hand.

Please note, you should still adjust the script slightly to use the correct model fields for your specific model (`MyModel` and `my_datetime_field`). For this example, I'll assume a minimal setup where `MyModel` is a model with a `DateTimeField`.

This script will programmatically create a Django app, a temporary database (SQLite for simplicity), and a model to work with. It'll then attempt to reproduce the issue mentioned, asserting the behavior of `filter(...__date=...)` under the conditions described.

### Instructions and Considerations
1. **Adjust the Import Statement**: If this script doesn't work as intended, you may need to adapt the model import method or ensure the correct Django settings (in this case, a dynamic model is used, which may have limitations).
2. **SQLite Usage**: This script uses an SQLite memory database for simplicity and to ensure it's standalone. Your issue mentions MySQL; behavior might differ due to database specifics. If necessary, adjust the `DATABASES` setting to reflect your actual database backend, keeping in mind additional setup might be required.
3. **Django Setup**: This script dynamically sets up a Django environment which might not perfectly reflect your setup. Ensure the relevant Django version and settings align with your project.
4. **Execution**: Run this script using `python3 reproducer.py` in a virtual environment where Django is installed.
