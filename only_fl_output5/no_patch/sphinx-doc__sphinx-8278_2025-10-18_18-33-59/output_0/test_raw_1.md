Given the feedback, it appears that the issue was not reproduced due to the absence of the Sphinx-build tool in the environment where the script was run. This suggests that either Sphinx wasn't installed in that environment, or it was not available in the system path. Below is an updated version of the script that includes checks and instructions for ensuring Sphinx is installed and properly configured before attempting to reproduce the issue. Please ensure Sphinx is installed and accessible in your environment before running this updated script.

    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

This script first checks if `sphinx-build` exists in the environment. If not, it immediately exits with an error message prompting the user to ensure Sphinx is installed and properly set up. Assuming Sphinx is available, it then proceeds to generate a module and its documentation, subsequently checking to ensure that the generated documentation correctly includes the hexadecimal default argument as specified.

**Important Considerations:**

- Ensure Sphinx is installed (`pip install sphinx`) in your Python environment before running this script.
- The script assumes that `sphinx-build` can be called directly from the command line, which means Sphinx needs to be in your system's PATH.
