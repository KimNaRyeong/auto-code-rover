The same for example goes for e.g. specifying access rights for files (`chmod`)\n**Screenshots**\n![Screenshot 2020-09-30 at 14 32 21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55204/94685496-c777ed00-0329-11eb-9ce1-d6f452d790ad.png)\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Mac OS X 10.14.6\n- Python version: 3.8.5\n- Sphinx version: 3.2.1\n- Sphinx extensions:  None\n- Extra tools: None\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue with Sphinx changing the number system from hexadecimal to decimal for function default arguments, we should focus on the parts of the Sphinx code that handle the rendering of function signatures, especially where default arguments are processed and converted into strings for documentation.\n\nFirst, we know Sphinx is a Python documentation generator, so it's likely we'll need to look at how Sphinx parses and renders docstrings. The issue seems to stem from a specific rendering behavior, probably within the code handling either the parsing of Python function signatures or the conversion of these signatures into HTML documentation.\n\nThe relevant pieces of information from the issue are:\n- Sphinx version: 3.2.1\n- Python version: 3.8.5\n- The problem occurs when documenting a function with hexadecimal default arguments.\n\nGiven this information, we might not have the exact filenames or class names where the issue occurs, but we can make educated guesses and look for relevant parts of the Sphinx codebase related to function documentation rendering.\n\nI would start by searching for methods or code snippets that deal with parsing function signatures or rendering them into HTML. Specific keywords to look for might be related to \"function\", \"default arguments\", \"signature\", \"render\", or \"documentation\".\n\nLet's perform the following search API calls to get more context about where Sphinx might handle these function signatures and their formatting:\n\n1. search_method(\"render\")\n2. search_code(\"function signature\")\n3. search_code(\"default argument\")"
