The code should detect when a default value is expressed in hexadecimal format and ensure that this format is maintained in the output documentation, rather than converting it to decimal. This will involve checking the format of default arguments and applying a condition to preserve the original format (hexadecimal, octal, etc.) in the rendered documentation."

        "intended_behavior": "In the `_pseudo_parse_arglist` method, which is involved in parsing function arguments and their annotations, care should be taken to accurately parse and maintain the representation of default arguments. If a default argument is specified in hexadecimal (or any non-decimal base), this method should ensure that the original representation is preserved in the documentation output. This might require including logic to detect the format of the default value and ensuring that this format is not altered during the documentation generation process."
