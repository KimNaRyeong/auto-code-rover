The same for example goes for e.g. specifying access rights for files (`chmod`)\n**Screenshots**\n![Screenshot 2020-09-30 at 14 32 21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55204/94685496-c777ed00-0329-11eb-9ce1-d6f452d790ad.png)\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Mac OS X 10.14.6\n- Python version: 3.8.5\n- Sphinx version: 3.2.1\n- Sphinx extensions:  None\n- Extra tools: None\n</issue>"

The issue seems to stem from a specific rendering behavior, probably within the code handling either the parsing of Python function signatures or the conversion of these signatures into HTML documentation.\n\nThe relevant pieces of information from the issue are:\n- Sphinx version: 3.2.1\n- Python version: 3.8.5\n- The problem occurs when documenting a function with hexadecimal default arguments.\n\nGiven this information, we might not have the exact filenames or class names where the issue occurs, but we can make educated guesses and look for relevant parts of the Sphinx codebase related to function documentation rendering.\n\nI would start by searching for methods or code snippets that deal with parsing function signatures or rendering them into HTML.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search API results, we can piece together a preliminary understanding of where and how Sphinx processes function signatures, particularly regarding default arguments and their presentation in documentation.\n\n### Analysis of `render` Method Search Results\nThe search for \"render\" methods returned several results across different modules:\n- **sphinx/application.py**\n- **sphinx/jinja2glue.py**\n- **sphinx/writers/latex.py**\n- **sphinx/cmd/quickstart.py**\n- **sphinx/util/template.py**\n- **sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py**\n- **sphinx/builders/gettext.py**\n\nThese instances of `render` methods suggest various points in the Sphinx codebase where content is being prepared for output, possibly including the rendering of documentation from docstrings to HTML or other formats. However, without specific insight into which of these are directly involved in formatting function signatures and their default arguments, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact relevance to our issue.\n\n### Analysis of \"function signature\" Code Snippets\nThe search for \"function signature\" yielded results in:\n- **sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py**\n- **sphinx/ext/autosummary/__init__.py**\n\nGiven that autodoc and autosummary are both Sphinx extensions designed for automatic documentation generation from docstrings, these files are highly relevant. They likely contain logic for parsing Python code and extracting function signatures, including handling of default values. Especially, **sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py** seems like a promising file to investigate further, as it may contain the logic that translates function signatures, including hexadecimal values, into a format for documentation.\n\n### Analysis of \"default argument\" Code Snippet\nThe search for \"default argument\" returned a snippet from:\n- **sphinx/domains/python.py** in the function `_pseudo_parse_arglist`\n\nThis snippet hints at parsing arguments for functions, where arguments can have optional annotations and default values. The mention of handling default argument values, even within string literals, suggests that this part of the code deals with recognizing and possibly manipulating the representation of default arguments in the generated documentation.\n\n### Relating to the Bug\nThe issue at hand involves Sphinx changing the number system of default arguments from hexadecimal to decimal. The intended behavior would be to preserve the number system as specified by the user in the function signature. Given this, our focus should narrow to code that deals explicitly with parsing and rendering function signatures and their default arguments.\n\n- **sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py** and **sphinx/domains/python.py** are most likely to contain the logic where the bug resides, considering they deal with function signature parsing and rendering in the documentation. The bug may involve the parsing logic incorrectly interpreting hexadecimal default arguments or the rendering logic converting these arguments into a decimal representation unintendedly.\n\nBased on this analysis, the next step would be to inspect the specific sections of code within these files where default arguments are parsed and rendered, to identify where the conversion from hexadecimal to decimal is occurring and to implement a fix that preserves the original number system specified by the user.\n\n### Next Steps for Investigation\n- Further inspect **sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py** to see how it handles parsing and rendering of default arguments in function signatures.\n- Investigate **sphinx/domains/python.py**, particularly the `_pseudo_parse_arglist` function, to understand its role in parsing function signatures and handling of default values."

        "content": "1. \n\n2. **Bug Locations:**\n\n- **Location 1:**\n  - File: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`\n  - Description of Intended Behavior: This file, particularly in the section related to function signature processing, should be modified to correctly handle and preserve hexadecimal default values in function signatures when generating documentation. The code should detect when a default value is expressed in hexadecimal format and ensure that this format is maintained in the output documentation, rather than converting it to decimal. This will involve checking the format of default arguments and applying a condition to preserve the original format (hexadecimal, octal, etc.) in the rendered documentation.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - File: `sphinx/domains/python.py`\n  - Method: `_pseudo_parse_arglist`\n  - Description of Intended Behavior: In the `_pseudo_parse_arglist` method, which is involved in parsing function arguments and their annotations, care should be taken to accurately parse and maintain the representation of default arguments. If a default argument is specified in hexadecimal (or any non-decimal base), this method should ensure that the original representation is preserved in the documentation output. This might require including logic to detect the format of the default value and ensuring that this format is not altered during the documentation generation process.\n\n**Overall Intended Behavior across Locations:** The overarching goal is to enhance Sphinx's handling of default argument values in function signatures, particularly for non-decimal bases like hexadecimal, by preserving the original format specified by the user. This would not only improve the accuracy of the generated documentation but also enhance its readability, especially in cases where the specific numeric base (e.g., hexadecimal for colors or permissions) is more intuitive or industry-standard."
