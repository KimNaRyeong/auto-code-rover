        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `formfield` method should ensure that when `limit_choices_to` is applied, especially with a `Q` object that requires a join, the resulting queryset should apply a `.distinct()` operation to prevent the rendering of duplicate choices in the formfield. This change must be carefully tested to ensure it does not introduce performance regressions or unintended behavior for existing use cases where duplicates are not a concern. The modification should preserve the existing functionality of allowing custom querysets for form fields while ensuring that choices are unique when necessary."
