        "content": "Given the issue description, we're dealing with a feature or a bug related to the `__isnull` lookup in Django's ORM (Object Relational Mapper). This lookup is typically used in query expressions to filter based on whether a field is `NULL` (or `None` in Python terms) in the database. To effectively gather the context needed for addressing this issue, we need to pinpoint where `__isnull` lookups are processed or validated in Django's codebase.\n\nHere are the API calls that would likely yield useful information towards resolving the issue:\n\n1. Search the entire codebase for mentions of the `__isnull` lookup to identify relevant classes or methods.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"__isnull\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the description mentions a concern with non-boolean values being used with `__isnull`, checking how Django's ORM handles query parameters might be pertinent. There's likely a method or class responsible for building or parsing query parameters. Without specific names, we have to guess based on common Django ORM naming conventions. Let's look for something related to query handling, such as `QuerySet` or `Filter`.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"QuerySet\")\n   search_method(\"filter\")\n   ```\n\n3. The issue discusses how the use of non-boolean values doesn't switch an INNER JOIN to an OUTER JOIN correctly. This suggests that the behavior is related to the JOIN operations in SQL construction. Django uses a complex ORM system to build SQL queries, so identifying the class or method responsible for this might provide insight into where the validation for `__isnull` values should be added or is missing.\n   ```\n   search_method(\"build_query\")\n   search_class(\"SQLCompiler\")\n   ```\n\nThese calls aim to gather enough context to understand where the `__isnull` lookup is processed, how query parameters are validated, and how JOIN operations are constructed, which are all potentially relevant to resolving the issue."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, especially around the use of `__isnull`, and considering the project structure (Django ORM in this case), let's go through the questions:\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\n- **django/db/models/query.py & QuerySet class**: This is a core component of Django's ORM, responsible for constructing, sending, and interpreting database queries through an object-oriented interface. `QuerySet` contains methods that allow developers to perform database queries, filter data sets, and manipulate the database contents.\n- **django/db/models/sql/query.py & SQLCompiler class**: These files and classes deal with converting Django ORM queries (`QuerySet` operations) into raw SQL queries. `SQLCompiler` specifically is responsible for compiling Django ORM expressions into SQL code that can be executed by a database engine.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue at hand is about restricting the `__isnull` lookup to only accept boolean values to prevent unexpected behaviors and ensure consistency. Understanding how `__isnull` queries are compiled into SQL and how query parameters are validated in Django ORM is crucial for addressing the issue.\n\n- **Usage of `__isnull` in `QuerySet` methods**: It is likely to be found in filtering methods, such as `.filter()` or `.exclude()`, where `__isnull` would be used to generate SQL conditions.\n- **SQLCompiler Translation**: It converts the ORM query expressions (including `__isnull` logic) into the corresponding SQL syntax. How `__isnull` is handled here could be key to enforcing the expected behavior.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\n- **Validation of `__isnull` values in `QuerySet` or deeper in the stack**: The intended behavior would be to introduce a check within the Django ORM's query construction mechanisms (possibly within `QuerySet`'s filtering methods or even at a lower level, like in the `SQLCompiler`) that ensures values provided with the `__isnull` lookup are strictly boolean (`True` or `False`) and raise an error when encountering non-boolean values.\n- **Preventing incorrect SQL construction**: Since using non-boolean values with `__isnull` doesn't correctly switch JOIN types among other potential issues, part of the intended behavior would be ensuring the generated SQL is both accurate and reflective of the developer's intention when they use `__isnull` with a boolean value.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps could involve examining how `__isnull` lookups are currently processed within `QuerySet` filtering methods and exploring how the `SQLCompiler` translates these lookups into SQL. Specifically, identifying the pathway through which `__isnull` lookups pass from the `QuerySet` method call to the SQL generation might reveal where to enforce the boolean value constraint.\n\nFurther investigation routes could involve:\n- Searching for the implementation or usage of `__isnull` within `django/db/models/query.py` or `django/db/models/sql/query.py` to pinpoint exact logic handling.\n- Exploring method calls within those files that deal with parameter validation, where a boolean type check could logically be inserted."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

If a non-boolean value is detected, the method should raise a `ValueError` with a clear message indicating that `__isnull` only accepts boolean values. This preserves the existing functionality of allowing to filter querysets based on whether a field is `NULL` or not, but enforces correct usage and prevents the misuse of the lookup with unintended value types.\n\n### Bug Location 2:\n- **File**: django/db/models/sql/query.py\n- **Class**: SQLCompiler\n- **Intended Behavior**: While not directly modifying this class for the boolean validation, ensuring that the `SQLCompiler` has access to the validation logic or error raised in `QuerySet`'s methods might help with broader error handling and messaging. The actual change would be in the queryset filtering logic, but attention should be given here to ensure that errors are gracefully handled and correctly propagate up to developers when incorrect `__isnull` usage is attempted. The intended behavior is not so much an alteration of `SQLCompiler` but an acknowledgment that changes in `QuerySet` logic may affect how SQL compilation errors are caught and reported.\n\nThese locations and intended behaviors address the core of the issue: enforcing correct usage of the `__isnull` lookup to improve code reliability and maintainability while also providing clearer guidelines and error messages for Django developers."
