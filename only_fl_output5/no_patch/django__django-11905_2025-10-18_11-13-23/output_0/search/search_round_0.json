Using truthy/falsey doesn't promote INNER JOIN to an OUTER JOIN but works fine for a simple queries. Using non-boolean values is \u200bundocumented and untested.

        "content": "Given the issue description, we're dealing with a feature or a bug related to the `__isnull` lookup in Django's ORM (Object Relational Mapper). This lookup is typically used in query expressions to filter based on whether a field is `NULL` (or `None` in Python terms) in the database. To effectively gather the context needed for addressing this issue, we need to pinpoint where `__isnull` lookups are processed or validated in Django's codebase.\n\nHere are the API calls that would likely yield useful information towards resolving the issue:\n\n1. Search the entire codebase for mentions of the `__isnull` lookup to identify relevant classes or methods.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"__isnull\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the description mentions a concern with non-boolean values being used with `__isnull`, checking how Django's ORM handles query parameters might be pertinent. There's likely a method or class responsible for building or parsing query parameters. Without specific names, we have to guess based on common Django ORM naming conventions. Let's look for something related to query handling, such as `QuerySet` or `Filter`.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"QuerySet\")\n   search_method(\"filter\")\n   ```\n\n3. The issue discusses how the use of non-boolean values doesn't switch an INNER JOIN to an OUTER JOIN correctly. This suggests that the behavior is related to the JOIN operations in SQL construction. Django uses a complex ORM system to build SQL queries, so identifying the class or method responsible for this might provide insight into where the validation for `__isnull` values should be added or is missing.\n   ```\n   search_method(\"build_query\")\n   search_class(\"SQLCompiler\")\n   ```\n\nThese calls aim to gather enough context to understand where the `__isnull` lookup is processed, how query parameters are validated, and how JOIN operations are constructed, which are all potentially relevant to resolving the issue."
