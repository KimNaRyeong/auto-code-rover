        "content": "<issue>Reject requests earlier if the CSRF cookie token has the wrong format\nDescription\n(last modified by Chris Jerdonek)\n(This issue is similar to #32795 but for the cookie token rather than for the non-cookie token.)\nI noticed in CsrfViewMiddleware.process_view() that if the CSRF cookie has the wrong format (i.e. wrong length or contains invalid characters), then the code will do a fair amount of unnecessary work. Specifically, the code will proceed inside _get_token() at \u200bthis line to use Python's secrets module twice to generate both a new token and a mask for the token. But this new token will only be used for the purposes of later calling _compare_masked_tokens() in a way that will be guaranteed to fail (since the cookie being used will be brand new and so won't match). And then it will call _compare_masked_tokens() with that value.\nInstead, if the CSRF cookie is found at that line to have the wrong format, the middleware could reject the request outright similar to how #32795 does it if the token has the wrong format (as well as similar to how the code currently handles a missing cookie in the \u200blines after). I think this will simplify CsrfViewMiddleware and make it easier to understand because it will eliminate a number of steps that aren't needed for security. In particular, one thing this will do is cut down on the number of places where _get_new_csrf_token() is called, which will make it clearer where a new value is really needed / used. Similar to #32795, it will also make troubleshooting easier because the rejection messages will be more specific.\nI think this could be implemented as follows. After #32795 is merged, \u200b_get_token() could be changed to allow InvalidTokenFormat to bubble up instead of handling it. Then the InvalidTokenFormat exception could be handled differently in the two places _get_token() is called: (1) In process_request(), it could be handled by calling _get_new_csrf_token() (_get_token()'s current behavior). (2) In process_view(), it could be handled similar to how #32795 handles it. Namely, reject the request using the InvalidTokenFormat's reason string.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, I will need to gather sufficient context about the relevant pieces of code mentioned in the issue description. Based on the details provided, I will make the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `CsrfViewMiddleware` class to understand its structure and the methods it contains. This will help in finding where exactly the adjustments need to be made.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"CsrfViewMiddleware\")\n   ```\n\n2. Locate the `process_view` method within the `CsrfViewMiddleware` class. Since this is where the issue is observed, it's crucial to understand its current implementation.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"process_view\", \"CsrfViewMiddleware\")\n   ```\n\n3. Find the `_get_token` method, as it's mentioned that an error in token format checking occurs there. This method's behavior needs to be analyzed to understand how it's currently handling tokens.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"_get_token\", \"CsrfViewMiddleware\")\n   ```\n\n4. Look into how `InvalidTokenFormat` is currently being handled across the codebase, to ensure that after modifications, the handling of this exception is consistent with the overall project's error handling strategy.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_code(\"InvalidTokenFormat\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive context around the `CsrfViewMiddleware` class and its methods relevant to the issue. Additionally, understanding the handling of the `InvalidTokenFormat` exception will guide how to adjust the error handling to reject requests with improperly formatted CSRF tokens earlier."
