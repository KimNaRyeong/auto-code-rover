Specifically, the code will proceed inside _get_token() at \u200bthis line to use Python's secrets module twice to generate both a new token and a mask for the token. But this new token will only be used for the purposes of later calling _compare_masked_tokens() in a way that will be guaranteed to fail (since the cookie being used will be brand new and so won't match). And then it will call _compare_masked_tokens() with that value.\nInstead, if the CSRF cookie is found at that line to have the wrong format, the middleware could reject the request outright similar to how #32795 does it if the token has the wrong format (as well as similar to how the code currently handles a missing cookie in the \u200blines after). I think this will simplify CsrfViewMiddleware and make it easier to understand because it will eliminate a number of steps that aren't needed for security. In particular, one thing this will do is cut down on the number of places where _get_new_csrf_token() is called, which will make it clearer where a new value is really needed / used. Similar to #32795, it will also make troubleshooting easier because the rejection messages will be more specific.\nI think this could be implemented as follows. After #32795 is merged, \u200b_get_token() could be changed to allow InvalidTokenFormat to bubble up instead of handling it. Then the InvalidTokenFormat exception could be handled differently in the two places _get_token() is called: (1) In process_request(), it could be handled by calling _get_new_csrf_token() (_get_token()'s current behavior). (2) In process_view(), it could be handled similar to how #32795 handles it. Namely, reject the request using the InvalidTokenFormat's reason string.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context reveals several key insights related to the CSRF token handling in Django's `CsrfViewMiddleware`, particularly how the system interacts with improperly formatted CSRF tokens.\n\n### Analysis of `CsrfViewMiddleware`\n\n#### Current Behavior of `_get_token`\n\n1. **What it does:** The `_get_token` method is responsible for retrieving the CSRF token from the session or cookie. If the CSRF uses sessions, it tries to fetch the token from the session. If sessions are not used, it attempts to get the token from a cookie. If the cookie token is missing or improperly formatted (caught by a specific `InvalidTokenFormat` exception), `_get_token` will generate a new CSRF token.\n   \n2. **Relationship to the bug:** The identified issue arises from the way `_get_token` handles the `InvalidTokenFormat` exception. Currently, when encountering an invalid token format, `_get_token` generates a new CSRF token instead of rejecting the request outright. This results in unnecessary processing for requests that will ultimately fail CSRF verification.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:** Ideally, upon detecting an invalid CSRF cookie token format, `_get_token` should not attempt to replace it with a new token for the purpose of CSRF comparison. Instead, it should allow the `InvalidTokenFormat` exception to propagate or handle it in such a way that leads to the request being rejected earlier.\n\n#### `process_view` Method's Interaction with CSRF Token Handling\n\n1. **What it does:** The `process_view` method performs several checks to ensure that requests are properly vetted for CSRF protection. This includes verifying the request method, the origin header, the referer header for HTTPS requests, and the CSRF token's presence and correctness.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug:** Given the flow of operations in `process_view`, the handling of CSRF tokens (especially the retrieval and validation steps) is central to its functionality. The inefficiency described in the issue arises when an invalid CSRF cookie token leads to unnecessary processing due to the generation of a new token that will not be used effectively since the request should fail CSRF check based on the invalid original token.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:** In the context of the issue, the intended modification for `process_view` (after adjustments to `_get_token`) is to ensure that any invalid CSRF cookie token format is caught early, ideally leading to an immediate rejection of the request without further processing or token generation operations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe relationship between `_get_token`, its handling of `InvalidTokenFormat`, and the `process_view` method's role in CSRF protection highlights where the inefficiency occurs and suggests a clear area for improvement. The intended behavior is to streamline the CSRF token handling process by ensuring that requests with invalidly formatted CSRF tokens are rejected as early as possible, minimizing unnecessary computation and making the middleware's operation more efficient and easier to understand. \n\n**Next steps** would include modifying the exception handling for `InvalidTokenFormat` in `_get_token` to either propagate the exception or to modify the handling in `process_view` to properly reject the request early based on the exception."

This would avoid unnecessary generation of a new token when an invalid token format is detected. Instead of silently generating a new token (which results in unnecessary processing), the method should let the exception be caught by the calling context (`process_view`), where specific handling can decide whether to reject the request outright.\n\n   - **Location 2:**\n     - **File:** django/middleware/csrf.py\n     - **Class:** CsrfViewMiddleware\n     - **Method:** process_view\n   - **Intended Behavior:** This method should include specific handling for the `InvalidTokenFormat` exception that may bubble up from `_get_token`. When this exception is caught, the middleware should early-reject the request using the exception's reason string (similar to handling in other parts of the CSRF middleware where invalid conditions lead to a request rejection). This ensures that requests with improper CSRF tokens are efficiently rejected before more processing is undertaken, streamlining CSRF security checks and improving both performance and troubleshootability.\n\nThese adjustments collectively aim to reject requests with incorrectly formatted CSRF tokens sooner in the request-handling process, reducing unnecessary work and aligning with the issue's requested optimizations."
