Instead of silently generating a new token (which results in unnecessary processing), the method should let the exception be caught by the calling context (`process_view`), where specific handling can decide whether to reject the request outright."

        "intended_behavior": "This method should include specific handling for the `InvalidTokenFormat` exception that may bubble up from `_get_token`. When this exception is caught, the middleware should early-reject the request using the exception's reason string (similar to handling in other parts of the CSRF middleware where invalid conditions lead to a request rejection). This ensures that requests with improper CSRF tokens are efficiently rejected before more processing is undertaken, streamlining CSRF security checks and improving both performance and troubleshootability."
