        "intended_behavior": "The `filter` method should be enhanced to interpret and apply expressions created by objects like those from the `F` class. This includes parsing expressions for field references and comparison operations (e.g., equality checks, lower/upper transformations). The method must preserve its existing functionality of accepting keyword arguments for filtering while extending support for these expression objects. The enhancement should allow the expressions to dynamically construct query conditions without breaking backward compatibility with the method's current signature and expected argument types."

        "intended_behavior": "While the `F` class itself might not be buggy, enhancements or additional methods could be required to support interoperability with the enhanced `filter` method. This may involve defining how the `F` class expressions serialize to SQL or how they interact with the ORM's query construction process more broadly. The goal is to ensure that expressions involving `F` class instances can be smoothly integrated into the query conditions constructed by the `filter` method. This could involve developing a standardized representation of these expressions that the `filter` method can understand and efficiently translate into SQL."
