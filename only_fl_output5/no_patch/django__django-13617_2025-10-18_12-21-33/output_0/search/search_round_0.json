        "content": "<issue>Aggregation over subquery annotation GROUP BY produces wrong results\nDescription\n(last modified by Christian Klus)\nStarting in django 3.0.7, specifically after patch #31566 I noticed some of my more complex queries returning incorrect results. I think I've narrowed it down to a simpler test case:\nExample query:\nBook.objects.all().annotate(\npub_year=TruncYear('pubdate')\n).order_by().values('pub_year').annotate(\ntotal_pages=Sum('pages'),\ntop_rating=Subquery(\nBook.objects.filter(\npubdate__year=OuterRef('pub_year')\n).order_by('rating').values('rating')[:1]\n)\n).values('pub_year', 'total_pages', 'top_rating')\nGenerated SQL on 3.0.6:\nSELECT\ndjango_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\") AS \"pub_year\",\nSUM(\"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pages\") AS \"total_pages\",\n(\nSELECT U0.\"rating\"\nFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\" U0\nWHERE\ndjango_date_extract('year', U0.\"pubdate\") = django_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\")\nORDER BY U0.\"rating\" ASC LIMIT 1\n) AS \"top_rating\"\nFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\"\nGROUP BY\ndjango_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\"),\n\"top_rating\"\nGenerated SQL on current master:\nSELECT\ndjango_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL) AS \"pub_year\",\nSUM(\"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pages\") AS \"total_pages\",\n(\nSELECT U0.\"rating\"\nFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\" U0\nWHERE\ndjango_date_extract('year', U0.\"pubdate\") = django_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL)\nORDER BY U0.\"rating\" ASC LIMIT 1\n) AS \"top_rating\"\nFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\"\nGROUP BY\ndjango_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL),\n(\nSELECT U0.\"rating\"\nFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\" U0\nWHERE\ndjango_date_extract('year', U0.\"pubdate\") = django_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL)\nORDER BY U0.\"rating\" ASC LIMIT 1\n),\n\"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\"\nI see two separate issues here:\n\"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\" is being added to the group by clause incorrectly (this issue probably predates the patch mentioned above)\nEven though the subquery is in the select statement, the alias is not being used and instead the subquery is reevaluated. This nearly doubles the cost of one of my queries that is experiencing this problem.\nI don't know much about the ORM internals, but here is my naive patch for the second issue:\ndiff --git a/django/db/models/sql/query.py b/django/db/models/sql/query.py\nindex ee98984826..6ea287d6cb 100644\n--- a/django/db/models/sql/query.py\n+++ b/django/db/models/sql/query.py\n@@ -2220,7 +2220,7 @@ class Query(BaseExpression):\n# the selected fields anymore.\ngroup_by = []\nfor expr in self.group_by:\n-\t\t\t\tif isinstance(expr, Ref) and expr.refs not in field_names:\n+\t\t\t\tif isinstance(expr, Ref) and expr.refs not in field_names + annotation_names:\nexpr = self.annotations[expr.refs]\ngroup_by.append(expr)\nself.group_by = tuple(group_by)\nI'd appreciate anyone with deeper knowlege of the ORM to chime in and let me know if I'm on the right track. Tests are passing locally.\nThe resulting query on master:\nSELECT\ndjango_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL) AS \"pub_year\",\nSUM(\"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pages\") AS \"total_pages\",\n(\nSELECT U0.\"rating\"\nFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\" U0\nWHERE\ndjango_date_extract('year', U0.\"pubdate\") = django_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL)\nORDER BY U0.\"rating\" ASC LIMIT 1\n) AS \"top_rating\"\nFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\"\nGROUP BY\ndjango_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL),\n\"top_rating\"\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue, we need to focus on the areas of Django's ORM related to queries, grouping, and specifically the handling of annotations and subqueries. The issue describes a problem that arose after a patch, affecting group by behavior and the evaluation of subqueries in annotations. Given the details from the issue, here are the relevant API calls:\n\n1. To understand how the grouping is being manipulated and potentially mishandled, it's important to look into the `Query` class where the grouping and annotations logic are likely handled. Thus, we'll search for the `Query` class in the codebase:\n   - `search_class(\"Query\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a specific change in the `Query` class's behavior and provides a diff snippet, it's crucial to see the context around the modified lines to better understand the attempted fix and how it integrates with the existing logic. The diff shows modifications to a section of code within the `Query` class; however, we need the exact location (file and line numbers) for a more focused investigation. First, let's find out which file the `Query` class is defined in:\n   - `search_class(\"Query\")` (repeated intentionally to identify the file path for subsequent steps)\n\n3. Examining the specific change mentioned in the issue, we need to view the code around the modified lines to understand the related logic. Since the issue offers a diff without specific line numbers, we'll need the context around the implementation of grouping logic and annotation handling in the `Query` class. Although we don't have exact line numbers from the issue, once we know the file path from the previous step, we can search for the changed code snippet within that file to identify the surrounding code. We're looking for the modification that involves changing the condition inside a loop related to `self.group_by`. Let's assume a line of the provided diff to search within that file:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"if isinstance(expr, Ref) and expr.refs not in field_names + annotation_names:\", \"django/db/models/sql/query.py\")`\n\n4. Given the issue's emphasis on what seems to be an improper use of generated SQL queries especially concerning group by clauses and annotations\u2014particularly around the `django_date_trunc` and `django_date_extract` functions, it would be useful to gather some context on how these specific functions are invoked within queries. These might be part of either the `Query` class or related utility functions/classes that handle date truncation and extraction:\n   - `search_method(\"django_date_trunc\")`\n   - `search_method(\"django_date_extract\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a good starting point to understand the issue's context, particularly how Django's ORM handles annotations with subqueries and the specified grouping logic that leads to the erroneous inclusion of fields in the GROUP BY clause and the potential inefficient evaluation of subqueries. This insight is crucial for devising an appropriate fix."
