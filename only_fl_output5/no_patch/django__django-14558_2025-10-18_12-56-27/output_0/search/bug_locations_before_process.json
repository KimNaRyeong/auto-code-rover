        "intended_behavior": "The `bound_data` method should be updated to gracefully handle `None` as an input argument without raising a `TypeError`. When `data` is `None`, the method should return `None` instead of attempting to load it as JSON data, thus preserving the functionality of allowing forms to be rendered even when no data is provided for `JSONField`. This modification ensures that when a form is bound with a `JSONField` that has not received any input, the application does not crash due to a failed attempt to parse `None` as JSON. This will maintain the existing functionality for cases where `data` is not `None` and can be normally parsed as valid JSON."
