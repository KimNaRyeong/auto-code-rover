        "content": "To gather the required context for resolving the issue about `JSONField.bound_data` raising a `TypeError` when the data is `None`, the following API calls would be necessary:\n\n1. Search for the `JSONField` class to understand its implementation and find which file it is defined in. This will help in locating the `bound_data` method if it exists or is implicitly called through another mechanism within the class.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"JSONField\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a problem when a bound form with no value for the `JSONField` is rendered, it will be helpful to look at the `Form` class implementation and any references to `bound_data` or JSON serialization mechanisms there.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"Form\")\n   ```\n\n3. The description also specifically mentions the need for fixing a bug related to rendering forms without provided values for `JSONField`. Therefore, investigating how form data is bound and prepared for rendering might reveal the code path that leads to the error. This involves checking methods that might handle or interact with `bound_data` directly or indirectly in both `JSONField` and `Form` classes.\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"bound_data\", \"JSONField\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"as_p\", \"Form\")\n   ```\n\nBased on these searches, we would aim to collect the necessary context around how `JSONField` and its `bound_data` method are implemented and how they interact within the form binding and rendering process. This information will be critical for identifying the root cause of the `TypeError` and formulating a patch."
