Understood, let's attempt to create a new standalone Python script that properly reproduces the issue as described. This time, I will use a direct approach without trying to dynamically configure Django, and ensure that Django's form system is minimally set up to reproduce the described `TypeError`. This script assumes you have Django installed in your environment.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys
from django.conf import settings
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

# Setup Django if not already set up
if not settings.configured:
    settings.configure(
        DATABASES={'default': {'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3', 'NAME': ':memory:'}},
        INSTALLED_APPS=('django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions',),
        SECRET_KEY='reproducer_secret_key',
    )

import django
from django import forms
django.setup()

# Define the function to print the exception stack trace.
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Define a simple Django form with a JSONField.
class JSONForm(forms.Form):
    json_field = forms.JSONField(required=False)

def reproduce_issue():
    form = JSONForm({})
    try:
        # Trying to render the form to HTML (which accesses bound_data on the JSONField)
        rendered_form = form.as_p()
        print("No TypeError encountered. If you expected an error, this may indicate the issue has been fixed.")
    except TypeError as e:
        print("TypeError encountered as expected:", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Non-zero exit code indicates script ran into the expected issue
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected exception occurred:", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Non-zero exit code for unexpected exceptions
    else:
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit code 0 indicates no issues encountered (or the issue has been fixed)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    reproduce_issue()
```

This script is a minimal reproducer for the issue, directly targeting the scenario described (attempting to render a form containing a `JSONField` with `None` as its data causing a `TypeError`). It avoids assuming the presence of a Django project structure by explicitly setting minimal necessary Django settings. Run this script in an environment where Django is installed. Ensure the Django version corresponds to the one where the issue is present.

To execute the script, ensure you have Django installed in your Python environment (`pip install django`) and then run `python3 reproducer.py`. The expected behavior is described in the comments: it should exit with code 1 upon encountering the specific `TypeError`, suggesting the issue is present.
