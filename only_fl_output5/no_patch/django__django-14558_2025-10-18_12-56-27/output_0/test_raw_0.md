Ensure to replace `'your_project.settings'` with the actual path to your Django project settings. This script attempts to reproduce a TypeError that occurs when a `JSONField` in a Django form is bound with `None` (or no data) and rendered. This script will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue doesn't manifest (meaning the problem might have been fixed or is not being accurately reproduced) or will print a stack trace and exit with code 1 if it does capture the exception, indicating the issue was reproduced.
