        "intended_behavior": "Modify or extend the Sum class to include an optional parameter that allows specifying a default value for cases where the result of the sum operation is NULL. This could involve either directly integrating COALESCE functionality within the class or providing an interface for the user to specify the desired behavior when encountering NULL values. The preservation of existing functionality is crucial; hence, the default behavior (without specifying a default value) should remain unchanged, returning NULL for empty sets or no values to sum. Adding this feature would enhance Sum by making it more flexible for various use cases, particularly those where a 0 is more desirable than NULL when no records are found."

The intended behavior here would not necessarily be a direct modification but rather ensuring compatibility\u2014that annotate can seamlessly pass through any additional parameters specified for Sum (or similar aggregated functions) to handle NULL values appropriately. This may involve adjustments in how parameters are handled or passed to aggregated functions within annotate to allow for the application of default values via COALESCE or similar mechanisms implicitly or explicitly specified by the developer."
