        "content": "To gather sufficient context for addressing the issue regarding adding support for a default value in aggregation functions like `Sum`, I would start by looking into the relevant classes and methods involved in the aggregation and annotation functionalities of Django ORM (since the description mentions `annotate(sum_field = Sum(...))`). This suggests we are dealing with Django's querying mechanism, specifically the aggregation and annotation part of it.\n\nHere are the API calls I propose:\n\n1. **Search for the `Sum` class**: This will help us understand how the `Sum` aggregation function is implemented and where we could potentially add a default value when the summed value is `NULL`.\n   - `search_class(\"Sum\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `annotate` method**: Since the issue describes an issue with the way `annotate` behaves with `Sum`, finding the implementation of `annotate` could help us understand where and how the aggregation results are processed.\n   - `search_method(\"annotate\")`\n\n3. **Search for the usage of `COALESCE`**: The issue mentions a monkey patch using `COALESCE` to treat `NULL` as `0`. Searching for existing implementations or mentions of `COALESCE` could provide insights into potential integration points or existing patterns for handling `NULL` values in aggregations.\n   - `search_code(\"COALESCE\")`\n\nThese searches should help us gather necessary code context to understand where and how to implement the requested feature of supporting a default value for `Sum` and potentially other aggregation functions in Django's ORM."
