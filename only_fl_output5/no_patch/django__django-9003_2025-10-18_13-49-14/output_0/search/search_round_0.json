But when I examine change_map, its content does indeed change from reload to reload - I suppose this may have something to do with the order of dicts/sets the combine() algorithm is using.\nHere comes some code, I cut out a bunch of unused stuff, but otherwise it's the same:\nclass Invoice(models.Model):\ncustomer = models.ForeignKey(Customer)\ndate_created = models.DateField(default=datetime.date.today, db_index=True)\ndate_sent = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_due = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_paid = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_credited = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_collect = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ninvoice_type = models.CharField(default=\"invoice\", max_length=32)\nreminders = models.ManyToManyField(\"Invoice\", related_name=\"reminded_set\", blank=True)\nreminder_counter = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)\nThat's the model, and in the view:\nimport datetime\nfrom django.db.models import Q\ndate = datetime.datetime.now()\ninvoices = Invoice.objects.filter(\nQ(date_created__lte=date),\nQ(date_paid__gt=date) | Q(date_paid=None),\nQ(date_credited__gt=date) | Q(date_credited=None),\ncustomer=1,\n)\nfiltered_invoices = Invoice.objects.none()\nnot_due = Q(date_due__gte=date) | Q(date_due=None)\nnot_reminded_yet = ~Q(reminders__date_created__lte=date)\nnot_collected = Q(date_collect__gt=date) | Q(date_collect=None)\nfiltered_invoices |= invoices.filter(not_due, not_collected, date_sent__lte=date, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfiltered_invoices |= invoices.filter(not_collected, not_reminded_yet, date_sent__lte=date, date_due__lt=date, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfor r in [1, 2, 3]:\nqs = invoices.filter(not_collected, reminders__date_created__lte=date, reminders__reminder_counter=r, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfor i in range(r + 1, 3 + 1):\nqs = qs.filter(~Q(reminders__reminder_counter=i) | Q(reminders__reminder_counter=i, reminders__date_created__gt=date))\nfiltered_invoices |= qs\nI realize it's pretty complicated but I'm not sure what's essential and what's not. I hope someone knowledgeable of how combine() works can figure out why ordering in some cases matters.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the non-deterministic crash in `django.db.models.sql.Query.combine()` and gather enough context for a potential patch, I would perform the following API calls targeting specific areas of the code base as described within the issue:\n\n1. Search for the implementation of the `combine` method within the `Query` class to understand how it merges two querysets, particularly focusing on the handling of `change_map` which is mentioned to sometimes contain circular references leading to assertion errors.\n2. Look for occurrences of the `Invoice` model in the codebase since the issue seems to manifest during complex query operations involving this model. This could provide insights into the model's structure and any custom methods that might interact with the `combine` method indirectly.\n3. Search for the use of the `combine` method or its invocations indirectly through queryset API calls that might lead to complex queryset combinations. This could include chaining filters or excludes, particularly with Q objects.\n4. Given the mention of \"order of dicts/sets,\" investigating any custom queryset methods or utility functions that manipulate the order of querysets, apply transformations to them, or directly manipulate the `change_map` might be valuable.\n\nAccordingly, here are the concrete API calls:\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"combine\", \"Query\")`\n- `search_class(\"Invoice\")`\n- `search_code(\"Invoice.objects.filter\")`\n- `search_code(\"change_map\")`\n\nThese searches aim to track down the source of the bug by looking into how `combine` operates, identifying potential misuse or edge cases in the queryset construction, and assessing model-specific queries that appear related to the crash."
