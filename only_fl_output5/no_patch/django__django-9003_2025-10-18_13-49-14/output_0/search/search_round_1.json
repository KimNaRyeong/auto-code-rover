But when I examine change_map, its content does indeed change from reload to reload - I suppose this may have something to do with the order of dicts/sets the combine() algorithm is using.\nHere comes some code, I cut out a bunch of unused stuff, but otherwise it's the same:\nclass Invoice(models.Model):\ncustomer = models.ForeignKey(Customer)\ndate_created = models.DateField(default=datetime.date.today, db_index=True)\ndate_sent = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_due = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_paid = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_credited = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_collect = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ninvoice_type = models.CharField(default=\"invoice\", max_length=32)\nreminders = models.ManyToManyField(\"Invoice\", related_name=\"reminded_set\", blank=True)\nreminder_counter = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)\nThat's the model, and in the view:\nimport datetime\nfrom django.db.models import Q\ndate = datetime.datetime.now()\ninvoices = Invoice.objects.filter(\nQ(date_created__lte=date),\nQ(date_paid__gt=date) | Q(date_paid=None),\nQ(date_credited__gt=date) | Q(date_credited=None),\ncustomer=1,\n)\nfiltered_invoices = Invoice.objects.none()\nnot_due = Q(date_due__gte=date) | Q(date_due=None)\nnot_reminded_yet = ~Q(reminders__date_created__lte=date)\nnot_collected = Q(date_collect__gt=date) | Q(date_collect=None)\nfiltered_invoices |= invoices.filter(not_due, not_collected, date_sent__lte=date, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfiltered_invoices |= invoices.filter(not_collected, not_reminded_yet, date_sent__lte=date, date_due__lt=date, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfor r in [1, 2, 3]:\nqs = invoices.filter(not_collected, reminders__date_created__lte=date, reminders__reminder_counter=r, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfor i in range(r + 1, 3 + 1):\nqs = qs.filter(~Q(reminders__reminder_counter=i) | Q(reminders__reminder_counter=i, reminders__date_created__gt=date))\nfiltered_invoices |= qs\nI realize it's pretty complicated but I'm not sure what's essential and what's not.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the API calls about the `combine` method in `django.db/models/sql/query.py`, the usage of `change_map` across Django's ORM layer, and the lack of direct references to the `Invoice` model and specific `Invoice.objects.filter` usage within the provided results, let's examine the three points for each relevant part.\n\n### 1. `combine` Method in `Query`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `combine` method is responsible for merging two `Query` objects (`self` and `rhs` for right-hand side), which represent database queries. The method ensures that the two queries are compatible (e.g., targeting the same model, both are either distinct or not, and if they use distinct, they target the same fields). It then decides how to merge based on the specified connector (AND/OR), handles aliasing to avoid conflicts between table names in different queries, and finally merges conditions, selected columns, and ordering from `rhs` into `self`.\n\n#### Relationship with the Bug\nThe issue description points to a non-deterministic crash due to an assertion error that checks for circular references within `change_map`. This map is modified during the process of alias relabeling to avoid clashes between table joins of the combined queries. A circular reference in this map suggests that there's a logical bug in how aliases are being renamed and managed, particularly in how the queries are merged and how their conditions are combined.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nThe intended behavior of `combine` would be to seamlessly merge the two queries, ensuring all aliases are unique and avoiding any circular dependencies that would make the query logically inconsistent or cause runtime errors. The assertion that fails is there to catch these scenarios, so the intended behavior would also include robust handling or prevention of such circular references.\n\n### 2. Usage of `change_map` Across the ORM\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n`change_map` is used in various parts of the ORM to track changes in alias names, particularly in scenarios where query parts are being combined or rewritten, and aliases might conflict. It ensures that each table alias is unique and correctly mapped from one query context to another.\n\n#### Relationship with the Bug\nGiven the bug involves an assertion failing related to `change_map`, understanding its usage across the ORM can provide insights into where the logic might be failing. Specifically, the issue might stem from how these aliases are generated, reused, or combined across different queries, possibly influenced by complex query structures like those mentioned in the issue (many-to-many self-joins and OR conditions).\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nThe purpose of using `change_map` is to maintain query integrity by ensuring that table aliases do not conflict, which is crucial for the SQL to be valid and for Django's ORM to generate correct SQL queries. The intended behavior would involve generating a `change_map` that accurately reflects the new aliases without circular references or conflicts, thus avoiding any crashes.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven the lack of direct references to the `Invoice` model and specific filter use cases within the results, and focusing on the identified problem area within `Query.combine`, the next steps should involve:\n\n1. Further investigation into how `Query.combine` handles complex queryset operations that might lead to changes in `change_map` resulting in circular references. Understanding the conditions under which `change_map` is modified could reveal the scenario causing the bug.\n2. Since no direct reference to the `Invoice` model and the specific filter usage was found in the codebase through the initial API calls, it suggests these are dynamically generated queries that might be influenced by user input or other dynamic factors.\n3. Considering the assertion error and the involvement of `change_map`, exploring more about how aliases are generated, managed, and cleaned up during query combination could be crucial. This might involve reviewing how aliases interact with many-to-many relationships, self-joins, and the use of OR conditions. \n\nTo advance the investigation, additional API calls could target:\n- The creation and management of aliases in queries, specifically looking into methods involved in alias generation, relabeling, and cleanup.\n- How `change_map` is constructed and modified in places other than `combine`, to understand if there's a specific pattern or operation leading to circular references."

This implies that while merging two queries, especially in complex scenarios involving self-joins, many-to-many relationships, and use of OR conditions, the method must handle alias renaming and reuse in such a way that it avoids creating aliases that reference themselves or create a loop. This could involve enhancing the logic that detects reusable aliases and decides when to create new aliases versus reusing existing ones. The assertion that checks for circular references in `change_map` highlights the need for more robust alias management. A potential fix could involve introducing additional checks or redesigning parts of the alias management process to identify and prevent the conditions that lead to these circular references, while preserving the method's functionality to combine queries accurately and efficiently.\n  \nThe focus is on enhancing the alias handling logic within the `combine` method to prevent the generation of circular references, which is critical for maintaining the method's ability to merge queries correctly without leading to crashes. This involves a careful review and possibly restructuring of how `change_map` is populated and used, ensuring that the integrity and uniqueness of aliases are maintained throughout the process."
