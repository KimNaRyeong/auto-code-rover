        "intended_behavior": "The `default` method should be modified or extended to incorporate logic for handling `Decimal` types appropriately. In addition to the existing functionality, it should include a condition that checks if the object `o` is an instance of `decimal.Decimal`. If so, it should return a serialized form compatible with JSON (e.g., converting the `Decimal` to a string). This modification ensures that `Decimal` types are correctly serialized when converting Python objects to JSON strings, thus accommodating the use case presented in the issue without breaking or modifying the current handling of other types, especially datetime objects. This approach preserves the existing functionality while extending support for `Decimal`, aligning with Flask's versatility in handling various data types for JSON serialization."
