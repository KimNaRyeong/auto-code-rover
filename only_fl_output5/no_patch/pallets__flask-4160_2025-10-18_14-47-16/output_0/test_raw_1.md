To accurately reproduce the issue, we'll need a script that specifically targets the issue describedâ€”handling `Decimal` types in JSON encoding with Flask. This script will attempt encoding using Flask's JSON handling capabilities, fail due to the absence of direct `Decimal` support, and then apply the custom encoder to successfully manage both `Decimal` and `datetime` objects. For clarity and conciseness, the script below does not explicitly attempt the `simplejson` encoding path, focusing instead on demonstrating the problem and solution within Flask's context.

Please ensure Flask is installed in your environment before running this script. You can install Flask using pip:

```sh
pip install Flask
```

Now, here is the `reproducer.py` content:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from flask.json import JSONEncoder
import decimal
from datetime import datetime

# Function to print the stack trace from an exception
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Custom JSON encoder that extends Flask's default encoder
class CustomJSONEncoder(JSONEncoder):
    def default(self, o):
        if isinstance(o, decimal.Decimal):
            return str(o)
        return super().default(o)

# Creating a Flask application instance
app = Flask(__name__)
app.json_encoder = CustomJSONEncoder

# Sample object containing a datetime and a Decimal
obj = {
    'datetime': datetime.strptime('1/1/2008 1:30 PM', '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M %p'),
    'decimal': decimal.Decimal('10.01')
}

@app.route('/')
def home():
    try:
        # This will use the custom JSON encoder
        response = jsonify(obj)
        # If no exceptions, the issue is considered fixed
        print("Issue fixed.")
        return response
    except TypeError as e:
        # If an exception occurs, it's likely because the issue is still present
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Use an appropriate error response for a web context
        return "An error occurred", 500

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This script integrates the custom encoder directly into a Flask application. By visiting the home route (`/`), Flask attempts to serialize `obj` with both a `datetime` and a `Decimal` object. If the Flask application runs without errors and successfully returns the serialized object, it means the issue has been circumvented by using the custom JSON encoder. However, if there's a problem (which there shouldn't be with the provided custom encoder setup), the `TypeError` will be caught, and its stack trace printed, indicating the issue is still present.

Execute the script with:

```sh
python3 reproducer.py
```

This will start a Flask application. You can then visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser or use a tool like `curl` to make a request to the server:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

The script exits with code 0 if the custom encoder successfully serializes the objects, demonstrating that a workaround to the issue is effective.
