        "intended_behavior": "This class should be augmented with a new method, `get_response_async`, to enable asynchronous handling of static file requests. The `get_response_async` method should asynchronously process incoming requests, match if the request is for a static file, and if so, serve this file asynchronously or pass the request to the next layer if not. The method should utilize `async/await` syntax to ensure it operates asynchronously, preserving the existing request handling functionality but in an asynchronous context. This would directly address the TypeError and allow `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` to operate as intended in an ASGI environment.\nThe addition of `get_response_async` method should faithfully implement the same logic as the synchronous `get_response`, but structured to work within Python's async framework. This may involve calling async versions of any utility functions used for file handling, and ensuring that the method properly awaits any asynchronous operations within it, thus fulfilling Django's requirements for ASGI application structures."
