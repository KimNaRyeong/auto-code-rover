        "content": "To address the issue mentioned, we need to obtain more context on specific parts of the Django project where the problem originates. Specifically, we\u2019re looking at implementing or fixing the `get_response_async` method for `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` and understanding how it interacts with `StaticFilesHandlerMixin`. The stack trace points us to a few key files and classes. Here is a list of the API calls that would be most relevant to gathering the needed context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ASGIStaticFilesHandler\")`: This will help us find where `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` is defined within the Django project, providing a starting point for understanding how it's implemented and perhaps why the `get_response_async` method is not being found.\n\n2. `search_class(\"StaticFilesHandlerMixin\")`: Since the issue description mentions that this mixin is missing the async response function, getting more information about this class will help us understand what methods it currently implements and how it intersects with `ASGIStaticFilesHandler`.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"get_response_async\", \"ASGIStaticFilesHandler\")`: This call will check if `get_response_async` is defined in `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` and give us some insight into how it's supposed to work or why its absence is causing an issue.\n\n4. `search_method(\"get_response_async\")`: To get a broader picture of how `get_response_async` is used throughout the codebase, this search might reveal other handlers or classes that successfully implement this method, providing a blueprint for fixing the issue in `ASGIStaticFilesHandler`.\n\n5. `search_code_in_file(\"await self._middleware_chain(request)\", \"django/core/handlers/base.py\")`: Since the traceback points to a failure in invoking the middleware chain asynchronously, it's crucial to understand how this is intended to work within the context of the base handler. This might reveal assumptions or requirements for `get_response_async` to function correctly.\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive view of the problem at hand and potentially guide the development of a patch that resolves the issue."
