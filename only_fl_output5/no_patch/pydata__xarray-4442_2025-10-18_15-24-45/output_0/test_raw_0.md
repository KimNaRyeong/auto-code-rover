Here's a `reproducer.py` script that tries to reproduce the described issue. It will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, showing a detailed stack trace, including line numbers and code context. If the issue is fixed, it will silently exit with code 0, indicating no errors.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_to_dataframe_series_with_multiindex():
    import xarray as xr
    try:
        # Create a DataArray with multiple dimensions and stack two of them
        da = xr.DataArray([[[1]]], dims=["a", "b", "c"]).stack(ab=["a", "b"])
        # Attempt to convert it to a Pandas Series
        _ = da.to_series()
        # Attempt to convert it to a Pandas DataFrame with a named column
        _ = da.to_dataframe("A")
    except NotImplementedError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_to_dataframe_series_with_multiindex()
    except AssertionError as e:
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate an error due to the issue being present.
    print("No issue detected.")  # If no exception was raised, the issue is considered fixed.
    exit(0)
```

This script should be run in a Python 3 environment, especially since Python 2.7 is no longer supported and the traceback might not work as expected in Python 2.7. It is aimed to reproduce the issue with `xarray` and `pandas` where converting a DataArray with one MultiIndex dimension and another regular dimension to a DataFrame or Series fails. Please adjust the environment or dependencies accordingly to ensure compatibility.
