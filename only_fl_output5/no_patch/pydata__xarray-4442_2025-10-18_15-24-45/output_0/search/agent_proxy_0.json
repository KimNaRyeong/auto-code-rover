It seems the bug surfaces when these methods are called on a DataArray object that has one or more dimensions stacked into a MultiIndex and additional dimensions.\n\nHere are the necessary API calls to gather more information:\n\n1. Search for the `to_series` method in the entire codebase to understand how it's implemented and to identify any potential points where it fails to handle MultiIndex cases properly.\n   \n2. Search for the `to_dataframe` method in the entire codebase for the same reasons as outlined above for `to_series`.\n\nGiven that the issue description does not mention the specific classes containing these methods and considering that Xarray's `DataArray` is likely where they are defined or where their behavior is directly relevant, starting with a broad search across the entire codebase for these method implementations is logical.\n\n- `search_method(\"to_series\")`\n- `search_method(\"to_dataframe\")`"
