These are typically handled in documentation or markup processing libraries. Without specific knowledge of the project's structure, I'll make some educated guesses for API calls to find relevant information:\n\n1. Since `:dedent:` seems related to a feature similar to what is found in Python's `textwrap.dedent`, it might be implemented as a method or within a class that handles directives or text processing. Let's start with searching for classes related to directives handling.\n    - `search_class(\"Directive\")`\n    - `search_class(\"CodeBlock\")`\n    - `search_class(\"LiteralInclude\")`\n\n2. It might also be beneficial to look for methods that specifically deal with parsing or applying options such as `:dedent:` to text blocks.\n    - `search_method(\"applyDedent\")`\n    - `search_method(\"parseOptions\")`\n\n3. If the project structure or naming conventions are not standard, searching directly for code snippets that mention `:dedent:` might also yield useful results to understand how it's currently implemented or where it should be extended.\n    - `search_code(\":dedent:\")`\n\nThese calls are designed to gather enough context around the handling of `:dedent:` and related directive processing. They should help us figure out where and how to extend the functionality as requested in the issue."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results, we have information on two classes: `CodeBlock` and `LiteralInclude`, both located in `sphinx/directives/code.py`. These classes define the structure and options for code blocks and literal include directives in Sphinx documentation, which correlates directly with the issue at hand. Given the details from the results, let's consider the questions:\n\n### CodeBlock and LiteralInclude Class Analysis\n\n#### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\n- Both `CodeBlock` and `LiteralInclude` classes derive from `SphinxDirective` and are used to handle specific directive types in Sphinx documentation.\n- They define options that can be set on these directives, including `dedent`, which is currently defined as an integer. This setting presumably controls how much indentation is removed from the included or defined code block.\n- The `option_spec` dictionary within both classes specifies the configuration options for the directives, mentioning `dedent` alongside other settings like `linenos`, `caption`, and `language`.\n\n#### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\n- The issue mentions extending the behavior of the `:dedent:` option to mimic Python's `textwrap.dedent`, which suggests that the current implementation only allows for a fixed amount of dedentation, specified as an integer value. \n- The presence of `'dedent': int` in both `CodeBlock` and `LiteralInclude` option specifications confirms they currently require an integer to dictate how many spaces to remove.\n- The issue's request implies that when no specific dedent value is provided, it should dedent all leading whitespace, similar to the behavior of `textwrap.dedent` in Python. This behavior is not currently described, indicating a potential area for the enhancement.\n\n#### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\n- The intended behavior would be modifying the handling of the `dedent` option within both `CodeBlock` and `LiteralInclude` to allow for a more flexible dedentation mechanism. \n- Specifically, if no `dedent` value is provided (or if a specific keyword or value is set to trigger this behavior), the directive should automatically dedent the code block to the level of the least indented line, effectively stripping all common leading whitespace.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context\n\nGiven the direct relationship between these classes and the issue, the next logical step is to look deeper into how these options, particularly `dedent`, are currently processed. This could involve:\n\n- Investigating the implementation of the `run` method of both `CodeBlock` and `LiteralInclude` classes to understand how the `dedent` option is applied.\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"run\", \"CodeBlock\")`\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"run\", \"LiteralInclude\")`\n\n- Exploring if there is any utility function or method that is already being used to apply dedentation, but wasn't captured by the initial search terms.\n    - This could involve a more targeted search around the `option_spec` handling or the directive processing pipeline to find where the dedent option's value is consumed.\n    - Since direct searches for `applyDedent` and `parseOptions` didn\u2019t yield results, understanding how `dedent` is currently applied requires examining the method(s) that consume the `option_spec`.\n\nThese steps should provide a clearer picture of how `dedent` is currently implemented and offer insights into where and how the code should be modified to achieve the requested functionality extension."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

Specifically, if `dedent` is not provided or a special value is given, it should dedent the code block content to match the least indented line's level. This change should preserve the current functionality when a specific `dedent` value is provided, only altering behavior to add the option for full dedentation when required by the user.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** sphinx/directives/code.py\n  - **Class:** LiteralInclude\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Similar to the CodeBlock class, modify or extend the `run` method (or the related option processing part) to adjust the `dedent` option's handling. When the `dedent` option is not specified or triggers the new behavior, apply full dedentation to the included file content by removing the amount of leading whitespace equivalent to the least indented line. This enhancement should maintain the existing functionality for cases where the `dedent` integer value is explicitly defined. \n\nBoth modifications require ensuring that the default or unspecified behavior of the `dedent` option cleverly decides how much indentation to remove, staying backward compatible with existing directive usages that supply an integer value."
