Specifically, if `dedent` is not provided or a special value is given, it should dedent the code block content to match the least indented line's level. This change should preserve the current functionality when a specific `dedent` value is provided, only altering behavior to add the option for full dedentation when required by the user."

When the `dedent` option is not specified or triggers the new behavior, apply full dedentation to the included file content by removing the amount of leading whitespace equivalent to the least indented line. This enhancement should maintain the existing functionality for cases where the `dedent` integer value is explicitly defined."
