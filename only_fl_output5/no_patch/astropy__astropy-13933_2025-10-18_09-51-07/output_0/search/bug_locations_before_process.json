        "intended_behavior": "The `to_string` method needs to correctly handle and display angle units in sexagesimal notation both before and after an `Angle` object is pickled and unpickled. This indicates the method must correctly interpret the unit of the angle (e.g., degree, hourangle) without failure post-unpickling. This might involve ensuring that all unit information is fully restored upon deserialization and that the `to_string` method has robust logic for dealing with unit representation consistency. The intended behavior is to assure that the method succeeds in all instances, preserving the angle's unit integrity across serialization."
