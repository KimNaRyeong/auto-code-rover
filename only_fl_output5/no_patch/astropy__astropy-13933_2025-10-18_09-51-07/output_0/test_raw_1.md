Given the feedback, it looks like the error encountered was due to missing dependencies rather than the expected behavior related to the Angle instance's `to_string` method failing post-pickling. To address the dependency issue (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'packaging'`), make sure all required packages are installed in your environment. However, assuming the environment is correctly set up now, the following standalone `reproducer.py` should test for the specific issue as described:

```python
import astropy.coordinates
import pickle
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    ang = astropy.coordinates.Angle(0.25 * astropy.units.hourangle)
    pang = pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(ang))
    original_string = ang.to_string()
    try:
        unpickled_string = pang.to_string()
        assert original_string == unpickled_string, "Unpickled Angle's to_string does not match original"
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate the issue is present.
    else:
        print("Test passed: Unpickled Angle's to_string matches original.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating the issue is not present (fixed).

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This script attempts to directly reproduce the issue as described. 

1. It creates an `Angle` instance.
2. It pickles and then unpickles this instance.
3. It asserts that the `to_string()` method produces the same output for both the original and unpickled instance. 

The script makes use of the provided function to print a stack trace if the assertion fails due to the `to_string()` method behaving unexpectedly after unpickling, specifically if it raises a `ValueError` due to the units being unrepresentable in sexagesimal notation.
