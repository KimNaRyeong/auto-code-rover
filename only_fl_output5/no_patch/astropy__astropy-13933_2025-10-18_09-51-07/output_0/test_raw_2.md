Apologies for any confusion previously. To address the specific issue raised regarding the `.to_string()` method of the `Astropy` `Angle` object after pickling and unpickling, here is the corrected approach for a standalone `reproducer.py` script. This script correctly integrates the provided stack trace printing function and checks specifically for the failure of the `to_string()` method as noted in the issue description.

```python
import astropy.coordinates as coord
import astropy.units as u
import pickle
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    angle_original = coord.Angle(0.25 * u.hourangle)
    pickle_data = pickle.dumps(angle_original)
    angle_unpickled = pickle.loads(pickle_data)

    try:
        original_str = angle_original.to_string()
        unpickled_str = angle_unpickled.to_string()
        # Assert that the original and the unpickled Angle objects produce the same string.
        assert original_str == unpickled_str, "Unpickled Angle's to_string does not match original"
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print("AssertionError: ", ae)
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit code 1 to indicate the issue is present.
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # General error encountered.
    else:
        print("Success: Unpickled Angle's to_string matches the original.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit code 0 to indicate no issue found (or it is fixed).

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script is specifically designed to test the identified issue: confirming whether the `Angle.to_string()` operation can be successfully performed on an object that has been serialized with `pickle` and then deserialized. It incorporates the necessary try-except structure to capture and print detailed stack traces for failures directly related to the issue, as well as any other unexpected exceptions.
