Below is the `reproducer.py` script prepared to reproduce the described issue. When you run this script as instructed, it will check for the absence of `numbersep` in the output of `latex(Mul(6, S.Half, evaluate=False))`. An `AssertionError` will be raised if the issue is present, printing a detailed stack trace that helps in locating the source of the issue.

```python
from sympy import Mul, S
from sympy.printing.latex import latex

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Generating the LaTeX form of an unevaluated multiplication
        result = latex(Mul(6, S.Half, evaluate=False))
        # Testing if the textual form has the expected space (numbersep) between numbers
        expected_output = "6 \\frac{1}{2}" # Using \\ to escape backlash in the expected LaTeX command
        assert result == expected_output, f"Output '{result}' does not match expected '{expected_output}'"
        print("Test passed: The issue is fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e from None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script verifies if the issue where `latex(Mul(6, S.Half, evaluate=False))` did not correctly format the output with a separator between the number and the fraction is fixed. If the output does not match the expected LaTeX command representing "6 followed by 1/2" with an appropriate space or separator, the script will print the stack trace of the AssertionError, aiding in debugging and locating the issue within the code.
