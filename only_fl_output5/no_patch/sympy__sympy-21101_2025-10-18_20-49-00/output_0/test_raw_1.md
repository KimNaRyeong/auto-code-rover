Given the requirements and the clarification sought, it seems my previous response didn't accurately address the intended issue reproduction. Let me correct that by adjusting the script to actively check for the specific problem described: the lack of `numbersep` in the output of `latex(Mul(6, S.Half, evaluate=False))`, which should incorrectly give `6 1/2` without appropriate spacing or separator for LaTeX. The corrected script below is designed to fail if it encounters the specific issue described and succeed otherwise.

```python
from sympy import Mul, S
from sympy.printing.latex import latex

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Generating the LaTeX form of an unevaluated multiplication
        result = latex(Mul(6, S.Half, evaluate=False))
        # Testing if the textual form lacks appropriate spacing (numbersep) between numbers
        expected_incorrect_output = "6 1/2"
        assert result != expected_incorrect_output, "Issue present: Generated LaTeX matches the incorrect pattern."
        print("Test passed: The issue is fixed or not detected.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e from None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note: This script is now designed to pass (exit with code 0) if the issue is fixed (i.e., the issue of missing `numbersep` does not manifest), and to fail otherwise, demonstrating the presence of the issue by matching the incorrect output `6 1/2` directly. If run in an environment where the issue has been fixed, it will indicate that the test passed; if the problem persists, it will print a stack trace derived from the AssertionError, thereby fulfilling the revised request.
