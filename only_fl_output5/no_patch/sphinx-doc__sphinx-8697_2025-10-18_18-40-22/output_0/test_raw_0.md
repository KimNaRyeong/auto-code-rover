Given the specificity of the issue (working with Sphinx documentation tool on a Python environment), producing a standalone Python script to replicate the described behavior requires setting up a minimal Sphinx project within the script, then executing Sphinx build commands, and finally inspecting the output directory to confirm if the issue occurs. The following `reproducer.py` script attempts to automate this process:

```python
import os
import shutil
import subprocess
import sys

def setup_sphinx_environment():
    # Create minimal Sphinx project structure
    if not os.path.exists('source'):
        os.makedirs('source/document/downloads')
    with open('source/index.rst', 'w') as f:
        f.write(
'''
:download:`downloads/archive.zip`
:download:`/document/downloads/archive.zip`
:download:`../document/downloads/archive.zip`
'''
        )
    with open('source/conf.py', 'w') as f:
        f.write(
'''
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))
project = 'TestProject'
master_doc = 'index'
html_theme = 'alabaster'
'''
        )
    # Dummy archive file
    open('source/document/downloads/archive.zip', 'a').close()

def cleanup():
    # Clean up function to remove Sphinx environment after check
    shutil.rmtree('source', ignore_errors=True)
    shutil.rmtree('build', ignore_errors=True)

def build_sphinx():
    # Build the Sphinx project
    result = subprocess.run(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', 'source', 'build'], capture_output=True, text=True)
    if result.returncode != 0:
        print("Failed to build Sphinx project:", result.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

def assert_issue():
    # Check if the issue is replicated by counting archive files
    try:
        files = os.listdir('build/_downloads')
        archive_files = [f for f in files if f.startswith('archive')]
        assert len(archive_files) == 1, f"Expected 1 archive, found {len(archive_files)}."
        print("The issue has been fixed.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        cleanup()
        sys.exit(1)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    setup_sphinx_environment()
    try:
        build_sphinx()
        assert_issue()
    finally:
        cleanup()
    sys.exit(0)
```

Important notes:
1. This script assumes that Sphinx is installed in the environment where it's being run (`sphinx-build` must be accessible). If Sphinx is not installed, prior installation is needed by running `pip install Sphinx`.
2. The paths and styles match the instructions provided, but some elements, like the Sphinx configuration (`conf.py`), are minimal for the build to proceed.
3. The script creates necessary directories and files, then attempts to build the documentation, and finally checks the `_downloads` directory for duplicates. An `AssertionError` will be raised if the issue is present.
4. After the script runs, it cleans up the created environment regardless of the outcome.

Test this script in an environment where you suspect this issue might occur to confirm its presence. Note that referencing files across directories in Sphinx projects, especially concerning the handling of static resources like downloads, should be consistent with the project's structure and relative paths to avoid unexpected behavior.
