        "content": "To resolve the issue described, we need to understand how Sphinx handles file references and how the paths are normalized (or not normalized, as mentioned in the issue). Since the issue points towards path normalization and involves handling of file paths for resources such as `archive.zip` in the example, we'll need to look into how Sphinx processes these directives and paths.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, it's likely related to the Sphinx code that processes directives like `:download:` and possibly the handling of static files or documents. However, without knowing the specific classes or methods Sphinx uses for this, a logical starting point would be to search for code related to the handling of paths, particularly with directives and static content.\n\nHere are a few search API calls that can help gather necessary context:\n\n1. Search for code snippets that might relate to the normalization of paths or handling of the `:download:` directive.\n   - `search_code(\"normpath\")`\n   - `search_code(\":download:`\")\n\n2. If the `:download:` directive processes are managed by a specific class or method (which is likely), we should look for those. However, without immediate knowledge of what these classes or methods could be called, we focus on what we know might be involved in file handling (`normpath`, path normalization, etc.).\n   \n3. Given the mention of issues with both the `:download:` and figure directives, searching for common handling functions for resources could also be insightful. Since these might be more generic, they could be involved in file-handling utilities.\n\n4. Lastly, if Sphinx maintains a standard way of handling file directives, it might involve some form of utility or service class. Without an exact name, we look for classes related to documents or static files handling.\n   - `search_class(\"Document\")`\n   - `search_class(\"StaticFile\")`\n\nThese calls aim to uncover how path normalization is currently handled and pinpoint where the duplication issue might arise from. The results should guide us toward the parts of the codebase that require a patch to normalize paths effectively, ensuring that references to the same file are recognized as such, regardless of how they're specified in rst files."
