The following `reproducer.py` script attempts to automate this process:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport shutil\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\ndef setup_sphinx_environment():\n    # Create minimal Sphinx project structure\n    if not os.path.exists('source'):\n        os.makedirs('source/document/downloads')\n    with open('source/index.rst', 'w') as f:\n        f.write(\n'''\n:download:`downloads/archive.zip`\n:download:`/document/downloads/archive.zip`\n:download:`../document/downloads/archive.zip`\n'''\n        )\n    with open('source/conf.py', 'w') as f:\n        f.write(\n'''\nimport os\nimport sys\nsys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))\nproject = 'TestProject'\nmaster_doc = 'index'\nhtml_theme = 'alabaster'\n'''\n        )\n    # Dummy archive file\n    open('source/document/downloads/archive.zip', 'a').close()\n\ndef cleanup():\n    # Clean up function to remove Sphinx environment after check\n    shutil.rmtree('source', ignore_errors=True)\n    shutil.rmtree('build', ignore_errors=True)\n\ndef build_sphinx():\n    # Build the Sphinx project\n    result = subprocess.run(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', 'source', 'build'], capture_output=True, text=True)\n    if result.returncode != 0:\n        print(\"Failed to build Sphinx project:\", result.stderr)\n        sys.exit(1)\n\ndef assert_issue():\n    # Check if the issue is replicated by counting archive files\n    try:\n        files = os.listdir('build/_downloads')\n        archive_files = [f for f in files if f.startswith('archive')]\n        assert len(archive_files) == 1, f\"Expected 1 archive, found {len(archive_files)}.\"\n        print(\"The issue has been fixed.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        cleanup()\n        sys.exit(1)\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    setup_sphinx_environment()\n    try:\n        build_sphinx()\n        assert_issue()\n    finally:\n        cleanup()\n    sys.exit(0)\n```\n\nImportant notes:\n1. This script assumes that Sphinx is installed in the environment where it's being run (`sphinx-build` must be accessible). If Sphinx is not installed, prior installation is needed by running `pip install Sphinx`.\n2. The paths and styles match the instructions provided, but some elements, like the Sphinx configuration (`conf.py`), are minimal for the build to proceed.\n3. The script creates necessary directories and files, then attempts to build the documentation, and finally checks the `_downloads` directory for duplicates. An `AssertionError` will be raised if the issue is present.\n4. After the script runs, it cleans up the created environment regardless of the outcome.\n\nTest this script in an environment where you suspect this issue might occur to confirm its presence. Note that referencing files across directories in Sphinx projects, especially concerning the handling of static resources like downloads, should be consistent with the project's structure and relative paths to avoid unexpected behavior."
