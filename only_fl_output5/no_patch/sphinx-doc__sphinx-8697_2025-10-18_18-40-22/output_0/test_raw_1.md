Given the encountered error and the request for a revised approach, crafting a reliable reproducer script for a Sphinx-based documentation scenario considering the error related to Jinja2's `environmentfilter` and other potential issues requires careful setup. Below, I present an updated script that aims to create a minimal Sphinx project and then build it. This script pays special attention to handling Python imports and potential differences in library versions or behavior.

We ensure that we capture any exceptions thrown during the Sphinx build process or the subsequent checks for duplicated output files. This script will be adjusted for Python 3 and assumes that the Sphinx package along with its dependencies is correctly installed in the environment where the script is executed.

```python
import os
import shutil
import subprocess
import sys

def setup_sphinx_environment():
    if not os.path.exists('source'):
        os.makedirs('source/document/downloads')
    with open('source/index.rst', 'w') as index_file:
        index_file.write(
'''
:download:`downloads/archive.zip`
:download:`/document/downloads/archive.zip`
:download:`../document/downloads/archive.zip`
'''
        )
    with open('source/conf.py', 'w') as conf_file:
        conf_file.write(
'''
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))
project = 'TestProject'
master_doc = 'index'
html_theme = 'alabaster'
'''
        )
    # Create a dummy archive file
    open('source/document/downloads/archive.zip', 'a').close()

def build_sphinx():
    try:
        subprocess.check_call(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', 'source', 'build'])
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print("Failed to build Sphinx project")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

def assert_no_duplicate_downloads():
    try:
        downloads_folder = 'build/_downloads'
        archives = [f for f in os.listdir(downloads_folder) if f.startswith('archive') and f.endswith('.zip')]
        assert len(archives) == 1, f"Expected 1 archive, found: {len(archives)}"
        print("The issue has been fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def cleanup():
    shutil.rmtree('source', ignore_errors=True)
    shutil.rmtree('build', ignore_errors=True)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    setup_sphinx_environment()
    try:
        build_sphinx()
        assert_no_duplicate_downloads()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    finally:
        cleanup()
    sys.exit(0)
```

**Notes:**

- The script first sets up a minimal Sphinx project, then it invokes Sphinx to build the HTML documentation, and finally checks for duplicate downloads in the build output directory.
  
- The `sphinx-build` command assumes that Sphinx is installed. If the command fails due to missing dependencies or other issues, the script will print an error message and exit. Ensure Sphinx is correctly installed in your environment (`pip install Sphinx`) and is compatible with your Python version.

- Keep in mind, this script is designed to run in environments where Python 3 is the default Python interpreter due to its compatibility with modern Python and Sphinx versions.

- After execution, it cleans up the directories it created, attempting to leave no traces behind.
