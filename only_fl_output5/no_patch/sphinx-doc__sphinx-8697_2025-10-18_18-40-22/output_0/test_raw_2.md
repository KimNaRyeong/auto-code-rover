Understanding the requirements and given the error that needs to be reproduced, it's important to adapt the script for potential Sphinx and Python environment peculiarities. Below is a standalone Python script designed to demonstrate the specified issue of Sphinx treating references to the same file as duplicates under a Windows 7 64-bit machine, Python 2.7.3, and Sphinx 1.1.3. 

As your environment might differ, and Python 2.7 is significantly outdated, this script will be penned for Python 3, acknowledging that your actual testing scenario or context might necessitate adaptions for older Python versions or specific Sphinx behavior. The script will create a simple Sphinx project, insert the problematic references, and then build the project. After the build, it checks for duplicated files in the expected directory and asserts the condition reflecting the issue. It gracefully handles exceptions, as you requested, providing detailed stack traces in case of errors.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import shutil
import sys

# Function to print stacktrace for exceptions
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_project():
    # Creating the required directories and files
    os.makedirs('source/document/downloads', exist_ok=True)
    with open('source/document/downloads/archive.zip', 'w') as f:
        f.write('dummy content')
        
    with open('source/index.rst', 'w') as f:
        f.write(

    with open('source/conf.py', 'w') as f:
        f.write(

master_doc = 'index'
""")

def build_sphinx():
    result = subprocess.run(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', 'source', 'build'], capture_output=True, text=True)
    if result.returncode != 0:
        print("Failed to build Sphinx project:", file=sys.stderr)
        print(result.stdout, file=sys.stderr)
        print(result.stderr, file=sys.stderr)
        raise Exception("Sphinx build failed")

def assert_no_duplicates():
    """Check for duplicate downloads."""
    downloads_dir = 'build/_downloads'
    try:
        downloads = os.listdir(downloads_dir)
        if not len(downloads) == 1:
            raise AssertionError(f"Duplicate files found: {downloads}")
        print("No duplicates found. Issue might have been fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

def cleanup():
    shutil.rmtree('source', ignore_errors=True)
    shutil.rmtree('build', ignore_errors=True)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    setup_sphinx_project()
    try:
        build_sphinx()
        assert_no_duplicates()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    finally:
        cleanup()
    sys.exit(0)
```
This script should be executed in an environment where Sphinx is installed and configured for Python 3. Note that the script creates necessary files and directories, performs the build, asserts the output for duplications, and finally cleans up by removing the temporary files and directories. Adjustments may be necessary depending on the Sphinx version or Python environment specifics.
