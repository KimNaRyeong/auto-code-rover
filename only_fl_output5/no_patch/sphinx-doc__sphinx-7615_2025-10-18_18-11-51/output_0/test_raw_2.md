Creating a reproducer for the described Sphinx issue requires integrating Sphinx into a Python script that will attempt to build documents containing the specified number of backslashes. We will leverage Sphinx's Python API to create a minimal project, generate its documentation, and then inspect the generated files for the correct handling of backslashes. 

Below is an example script that aims to test the specific rendering issue with Sphinx. The script will generate a temporary Sphinx project with a single document including consecutive backslashes as described in the reported issue. After building the documentation, it analyses the HTML files produced to verify whether the backslashes are rendered as expected. If not, it raises an `AssertionError`.

```python
import sys
import tempfile
import shutil
from sphinx.application import Sphinx
from pathlib import Path

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Create a temporary directory to house the Sphinx project
        temp_dir = Path(tempfile.mkdtemp())
        try:
            src_dir = temp_dir / 'source'
            build_dir = temp_dir / 'build'
            src_dir.mkdir()
            (src_dir / 'conf.py').write_text("project = 'BackslashTest'\n")
            (src_dir / 'index.rst').write_text("""

""", encoding='utf-8')

            # Create a Sphinx application instance
            app = Sphinx(str(src_dir), str(src_dir), str(build_dir), str(build_dir / 'doctrees'), 'html')
            app.build(force_all=True)

            # Check the output HTML for correct backslash escape sequences
            index_html = build_dir / 'index.html'
            if not index_html.exists():
                raise AssertionError("index.html was not created")

            content = index_html.read_text()
            if not ("\\\\\\" in content and "\\\\\\\\" in content and "\\\\\\\\\\\\" in content):
                raise AssertionError("Backslash rendering issue detected")

        finally:
            # Clean up the temporary directory
            shutil.rmtree(temp_dir)

        print("Test passed. No issue detected with backslash rendering.")
    
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script takes advantage of Sphinx's Python API to programmatically create and build a documentation project. It checks for the presence of specific backslash escape sequences in the generated `index.html` file to confirm if Sphinx behaves as expected regarding the issue described. If the proper sequences are not found, it concludes that the issue is present and raises an `AssertionError`.

The script uses temporary directories for its Sphinx project, ensuring no side effects on your filesystem and that it works in a clean environment every time it runs. Make sure you have Sphinx installed (`pip install sphinx`) in your environment before running the script, as it uses Sphinx's internal Python API.
