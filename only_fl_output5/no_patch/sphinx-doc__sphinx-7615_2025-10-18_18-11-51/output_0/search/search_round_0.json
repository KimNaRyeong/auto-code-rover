In pure Docutils, they are renderer properly according with RST spec.\n**To Reproduce**\nThe following snippet demonstrantes buggy rendering.\n```\nTwo \\\\\nThree \\\\\\\nFour \\\\\\\\\nFive \\\\\\\\\\\nSix \\\\\\\\\\\\\n```\n**Expected behavior**\nTwo backslashes should be rendered as `\\`. Three still as `\\`. Four and five as `\\\\`. Six as `\\\\\\` and so on. This is how it works in Docutils.\n**Screenshots**\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/383059/80948942-5cb29c00-8df3-11ea-8fe9-ca4bc390eef9.png)\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Linux\n- Python version: 3.6\n- Sphinx version: 3.0.2\n- Sphinx extensions:  none\n</issue>"

        "content": "To analyze the issue reported for Sphinx regarding the incorrect rendering of consecutive backslashes and to differentiate it from the expected behavior in docutils, we need to understand how Sphinx processes text for rendering and where this processing diverges from docutils' handling of backslashes in reStructuredText (.rst) files. Specific focus areas include the parsing and rendering mechanisms that could be responsible for this difference in handling backslashes.\n\nGiven the details of the issue, here are the sequences of API calls we should make to gather relevant code context from the Sphinx project:\n\n1. Locate where Sphinx handles rendering or parsing of text that could affect how backslashes are interpreted. Since Sphinx extends docutils, it may override or extend certain docutils classes or methods related to text processing or rendering:\n\n   - `search_class(\"RSTParser\")`\n   - `search_class(\"TextElement\")`\n\n2. If the specific class or method names are not known or if these searches are too broad, we might need to search directly for code specific to handling backslashes or parsing inline literals which is where the issue might arise:\n\n   - `search_code(\"backslash\")`\n   - `search_code(\"\\\\\\\\\")`\n\n3. Given Sphinx's extensible nature through extensions and the potential for custom rendering or text processing within these, it would be prudent to also check if the issue stems from a default extension provided with Sphinx. However, without knowing specific extensions that could be related, this step might be more speculative:\n\n   - `search_code(\"extensions\")`\n\n4. Since the issue mentions that this behavior differs from that observed with docutils, examining any Sphinx documentation or methods that explicitly mention differences from docutils would be beneficial. These differences might be documented in the code comments or in Sphinx documentation stored within the codebase:\n\n   - `search_code(\"docutils\")`\n   - `search_code(\"difference from docutils\")`\n\n5. The issue occurs in Sphinx version 3.0.2 on Linux with Python 3.6, but without a specific traceback or error message, focusing on handling of literal blocks or escaped characters in general processing or in the rendering pipeline of Sphinx might be where the solution lies:\n\n   - `search_method(\"visit_literal_block\")`\n   - `search_method(\"escape\")`\n\n6. Lastly, to ensure we have covered all bases for potential areas where the rendering diverges due to Sphinx's interpretation of backslashes, it might be necessary to look into the configuration or setup files of Sphinx if they offer any related settings:\n\n   - `search_code(\"conf.py\")`\n   - `search_code(\"setup()\")`\n\nExecuting these searches will help in gathering sufficient context around how Sphinx handles rendering of backslashes versus docutils, potentially pinpointing where the rendering behavior diverges and what changes might be necessary to align Sphinx's rendering with that of docutils."
