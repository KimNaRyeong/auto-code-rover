In pure Docutils, they are renderer properly according with RST spec.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nThe following snippet demonstrantes buggy rendering. \r\n```\r\nTwo \\\\\r\n\r\nThree \\\\\\\r\n\r\nFour \\\\\\\\\r\n\r\nFive \\\\\\\\\\\r\n\r\nSix \\\\\\\\\\\\\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nTwo backslashes should be rendered as `\\`. Three still as `\\`. Four and five as `\\\\`. Six as `\\\\\\` and so on. This is how it works in Docutils.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/383059/80948942-5cb29c00-8df3-11ea-8fe9-ca4bc390eef9.png)\r\n\r\n**Environment info**\r\n- OS: Linux\r\n- Python version: 3.6\r\n- Sphinx version: 3.0.2\r\n- Sphinx extensions:  none\n"

        "content": "Given the previous interaction didn't produce the expected result and considering the need to adjust based on the feedback, we need a more robust approach to reproduce the issue while also ensuring we capture the environment setup or potential import issues into the error handling mechanism. \n\nSince the initial script failed due to an import error, possibly due to a mismatch in `jinja2` version compatibility with Sphinx, the revised script will include some changes. However, directly reproducing rendering issues outside a running Sphinx environment, purely via script, is inherently challenging, as Sphinx rendering intricacies depend highly on the Sphinx environment itself, including configuration and extension mechanisms. The revised script, therefore, aims to simulate the environment as closely as possible.\n\nHere's an updated version of `reproducer.py` that should be more aligned with capturing the Sphinx rendering issue around backslashes:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\n# This function attempts to install Sphinx via pip, ensuring the environment is correctly setup for Sphinx\ndef ensure_sphinx_installed():\n    try:\n        import sphinx\n    except ImportError as e:\n        print(\"Sphinx is not installed. Attempting to install Sphinx...\", file=sys.stderr)\n        subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, \"-m\", \"pip\", \"install\", \"sphinx\"])\n        print(\"Sphinx installed successfully.\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef generate_documentation_with_backslashes():\n    # Setup minimal Sphinx configuration\n    conf_py = \"\"\"\nproject = 'Backslash Test Project'\nmaster_doc = 'index'\nhtml_theme = 'alabaster'\n\"\"\"\n\n    index_rst = \"\"\"\nTwo \\\\\\\\\n\nThree \\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nFour \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nFive \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nSix \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\"\"\"\n    os.makedirs('docs', exist_ok=True)\n    with open('docs/conf.py', 'w') as f:\n        f.write(conf_py)\n\n    with open('docs/index.rst', 'w') as f:\n        f.write(index_rst)\n\n    # Run sphinx-build\n    return_code = subprocess.call(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', 'docs', 'docs/_build'])\n    if return_code != 0:\n        raise RuntimeError(\"Sphinx documentation generation failed\")\n\n    # Read the generated HTML content\n    with open('docs/_build/index.html', 'r') as f:\n        content = f.read()\n\n    # Assertions to verify the backslash rendering\n    assert \"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in content, \"Four and five backslashes not rendered correctly (expecting two rendered backslashes)\"\n    assert \"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in content, \"Six backslashes not rendered correctly (expecting three rendered backslashes)\"\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        ensure_sphinx_installed()\n        generate_documentation_with_backslashes()\n        print(\"Documentation generated successfully. No rendering issue detected.\")\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        sys.exit(1)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        sys.exit(1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nImportant points to note:\n- This script now includes a step to check if Sphinx is installed and attempts to install it if not. This addition aims to eliminate issues arising from an absence of Sphinx in the test environment.\n- It dynamically creates a Sphinx documentation project, fills it with content designed to test the rendering of backslashes, builds the documentation, and verifies the generated HTML output for the correct rendering of backslashes as described in the original issue.\n- If the output doesn't match the expected pattern (indicating incorrect rendering), it raises an `AssertionError`.\n- To cover broader potential issues and ensure a smooth execution, the script now includes better error handling and diagnostics output."
