Below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue as requested. This script will programmatically create a Sphinx project, generate documentation that includes the specified reStructuredText content, and then check the output for correct backslash rendering according to the spec. If it finds the issue, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace.

Please note, this script requires Sphinx to be installed in the environment where it is run. You can install Sphinx using pip: `pip install sphinx`.

```python
import os
import sys
import subprocess
from sphinx.application import Sphinx


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

This script initializes a basic Sphinx project with an `index.rst` containing the specific backslash patterns mentioned in the issue. After building the project's documentation, it checks the HTML output for the correct number of backslashes. If the output does not match expected behavior, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints the stack trace, as requested.
