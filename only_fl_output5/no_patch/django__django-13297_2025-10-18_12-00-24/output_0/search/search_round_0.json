        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we will need to gather more context about the key components and code structures mentioned in the issue description. Here is a list of API calls that would help in collecting the necessary information:\n\n1. To understand how `TemplateView` and its method `get_context_data` are structured and potentially customized in the project, it would be helpful to search for the `TemplateView` class and the mentioned method. Since `TemplateView` is a Django built-in class, we're likely looking for a subclass or modifications in the project:\n   - `search_class(\"OfferView\")`\n\n2. The second part of the issue describes the explicit conversion of `kwargs.get()` result to a string to force the resolution of `SimpleLazyObject`. Understanding if and how `get_context_data` is modified to handle these `kwargs` across the codebase would provide further insight:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"get_context_data\", \"OfferView\")`\n\n3. To grasp how URLs are configured with the `OfferView` and ensure that the described issue is consistent across all relevant parts of the application (and not limited to a specific misconfiguration), examining the URL configuration is necessary:\n   - `search_code(\"path(\\\"/offers/<slug:offer_slug>/\\\", OfferView.as_view(), name=\\\"offer_view\\\")\")\n\n4. Since the issue cites a backend error specifically from a SQLite operation, understanding where `get_object_or_404` is used with the `Account` model and `slug` may illuminate more instances of this problem or reveal more about the context in which this error occurs. We should check how `get_object_or_404` is utilized particularly regarding fetching an `Account` by slug:\n   - `search_code(\"get_object_or_404(Account, slug=\")`\n\n5. Lastly, it might be valuable to gather context on how `SimpleLazyObject` interacts within the codebase, especially where it's expected or handled explicitly. This could help in identifying a broader pattern or solution to the problem:\n   - `search_code(\"SimpleLazyObject\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive view of how the described issue fits within the larger project context, clarifying potential paths to a solution."
