        "intended_behavior": "The `get_context_data` method should explicitly handle `SimpleLazyObject` instances that may be passed as keyword arguments. This means ensuring that any `SimpleLazyObject` (such as those derived from URL parameters) is evaluated before being used in database queries or other type-sensitive operations. Specifically, for handling slugs or other simple data types passed via URLs, applying an explicit `str()` conversion or a similar explicit casting method to resolve the `SimpleLazyObject` before its use would avoid the \"unsupported type\" errors currently encountered. The resolution should be applied judiciously to ensure it doesn't inadvertently impact other functionality or the lazy loading benefits of `SimpleLazyObject`."
