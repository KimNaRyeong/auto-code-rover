This `reproducer.py` script is designed to run within the root directory of your project where the working environment has the appropriate version of `sklearn` installed. When executed with Python 3, the script will try to compute the NDCG score with a binary relevance list containing only one element.

- If the issue is present (i.e., the scikit-learn version does not support computing the NDCG score for a single element binary list correctly), the script will catch the `ValueError` and use the helper function `print_stacktrace` to print the stack trace of the issue, confirming the condition that leads to this specific error.
- The script also contains an assertion that is expected to fail if the computation unexpectedly succeeds, indicating the issue has been fixed (which would contradict the current expectations as of the knowledge cutoff in December 2023).
- If the computation raises the expected `ValueError`, indicating that NDCG calculation does not support single-element lists with binary relevance, it catches the exception, prints the stack trace for diagnostic purposes, and explains the expected failure through a printed message.

Remember to adjust the environment and dependencies as necessary for this script to run correctly.
