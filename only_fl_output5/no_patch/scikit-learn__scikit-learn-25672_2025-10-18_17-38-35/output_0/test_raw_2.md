Certainly! Below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue as specified. This script includes additional error handling to exit gracefully should the issue be fixed, raising an `AssertionError` if the problem persists or printing a stack trace for clarity in debugging when the error occurs.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sklearn.metrics import ndcg_score
    y_true = [[1]]
    y_pred = [[0]]  # Using the original binary relevance example

    try:
        # Attempt to compute the NDCG score
        score = ndcg_score(y_true, y_pred)
        print(f"Successfully computed NDCG score: {score}")
        # If no error is thrown, we assume the issue has been fixed
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        # Check if the specific error related to binary relevance with single element exists
        if isinstance(e, ValueError) and \
           "Only ('multilabel-indicator', 'continuous-multioutput', 'multiclass-multioutput') formats are supported." in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("Issue present: NDCG score doesn't work with binary relevance and a list of 1 element.")
        else:
            # If another error occurs, print the stack trace and exit
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please ensure the following when running the script:
