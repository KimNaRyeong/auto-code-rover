        "intended_behavior": "The `ndcg_score` method should handle cases where `y_true` is a binary relevance list or a list with a single element without raising an error. To resolve the issue, the method can include a pre-check for these specific cases and apply an appropriate handling logic that computes NDCG in a meaningful way when faced with a single-element list. This adaptation will preserve the existing functionality while extending support for binary relevance inputs. An initial step could involve bypassing the `_check_dcg_target_type` validation under these conditions or modifying the validation to accept these cases, ensuring the calculation of NDCG can proceed."

        "method": "_check_dcg_target_type",
        "intended_behavior": "The `_check_dcg_target_type` method should be modified to allow for binary relevance or single-element lists as valid formats when computing NDCG. The modification could be to add a conditional check that effectively bypasses the error raise if the input is determined to be a valid format for NDCG calculation in these specific contexts. This change enables the validation process to be more accommodating of diverse input scenarios while maintaining the integrity and intended use of the NDCG metric calculation."
