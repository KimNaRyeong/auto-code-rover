First, we should identify files and segments of code where `SparseSeries` is mentioned. Then, based on those findings, we might need to look into relevant classes or methods that interact with `SparseSeries` to properly plan how to transition to using a `Series` with sparse values instead.\n\nHere are the specific API calls we should make to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for code snippets that mention `SparseSeries` to understand where it's used.\n2. Based on the results from the first step, we might need to delve into specific files or classes that frequently interact with `SparseSeries`.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n- search_code(\"SparseSeries\")"
