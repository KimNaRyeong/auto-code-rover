        "intended_behavior": "Currently, the `type_of_target` function identifies and rejects `SparseSeries` explicitly by raising a ValueError. To resolve the issue while preserving existing functionality, this behavior should be updated. Instead of checking for and rejecting `SparseSeries`, the method should:\n- Be updated to recognize and accept a pandas `Series` with sparse values as valid input.\n- Ensure that this adjustment does not affect the method's ability to classify the type of target correctly, whether the data is sparse or not. This could involve leveraging pandas' capabilities to detect sparsity in a `Series` object.\n- The error message and condition should be adapted or extended to guide the user correctly if a deprecated or unsupported data structure is passed, informing them of the new expected format (if such guidance is deemed necessary).\n- The change should aim to maintain backward compatibility with non-deprecated structures and versions of pandas that still support `SparseSeries`, if possible, given the project's compatibility policies."
