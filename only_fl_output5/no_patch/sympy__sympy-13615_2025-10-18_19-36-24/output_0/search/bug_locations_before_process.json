        "intended_behavior": "The method should carefully distinguish between numeric and symbolic elements when computing a complement with an `Interval`. For numeric elements, it should compute their exclusion based on the interval's bounds. For symbolic elements, since they do not have a numeric value that can be compared against an interval's bounds, these should remain part of the resulting set without being affected by the numeric bounds of the interval. This ensures that operations involving a mix of symbols and numbers retain their symbolic components post-computation."

        "method": "_complement",
        "intended_behavior": "The method, when dealing with a `FiniteSet` that includes both numeric and symbolic elements as the 'other' set, needs to ensure that numeric elements are correctly evaluated for exclusion based on the interval's numeric bounds. Symbolic elements should be bypassed or treated in a manner that reflects their inability to be bound by numeric comparisons, essentially leaving them intact in the resulting set from the complement operation. This adjustment ensures the method's alignment with set-theoretic principles in handling mixed element types."
