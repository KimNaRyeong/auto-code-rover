This method likely defines how to compute the complement of a `FiniteSet` with another set.\n\n### Interval Class\n- **Location**: `sympy/sets/sets.py`\n- **Relevant Methods**: Similar to `FiniteSet`, the `Interval` class also contains an `_complement` method. Given that the issue mentions a failure in handling the complement operation when the inputs involve both `Interval` and `FiniteSet` instances, this method could also be crucial.\n\n### Relationship to the Bug\nThe problem occurs when computing the complement of a combination of `FiniteSet` and `Interval`. Specifically, the expected behavior when subtracting `Interval(-10, 10)` from `FiniteSet(x, y, 2)` should result in `{x, y} \\ [-10,10]`. However, the reported output is `{x, y}`, indicating that the operation ignores the numeric part contained within the `FiniteSet`.\n\n### Intended Behavior and Analysis\n1. **FiniteSet `_complement`**: Should intelligently handle numeric elements when computing against an `Interval`, considering the numeric bounds of the `Interval`. \n2. **Interval `_complement`**: Should correctly interpret symbolic elements (e.g., `x`, `y`) as part of the complement calculation.\n\nBased on this analysis, it's critical to examine the implementation of both `_complement` methods within `FiniteSet` and `Interval` classes to identify why the numeric element `2` within the `FiniteSet` is not correctly contributing to the output of the complement operation. Furthermore, the failure to find the `Complement` method in the initial search suggests that the complement operation might be handled indirectly or polymorphically through methods defined within these classes or through another layer of abstraction that overrides or extends base functionality.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo rectify this bug, we need to inspect the implementation details of both `_complement` methods. Thus, the following search API calls should be made:\n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"_complement\", \"sympy/sets/sets.py\")` - Since both `FiniteSet` and `Interval` classes are located within the same file, this single call should return relevant excerpts from both methods.\n2. Given the absence of a direct `Complement` method discovery, it might also be useful to search for where these `_complement` methods are being invoked or how the `Complement` operation is mapped onto these methods, suggesting a deeper dive into the file where these classes are defined or examining any superclass methods that might dynamically resolve method calls based on the instance types involved.\n\nAssuming `Complement` behavior is achieved through polymorphic `_complement` methods within each class or through another overarching mechanism, inspecting these method implementations will be pivotal in identifying and addressing the reported issue."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).
