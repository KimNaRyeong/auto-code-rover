This method likely defines how to compute the complement of a `FiniteSet` with another set.\n\n### Interval Class\n- **Location**: `sympy/sets/sets.py`\n- **Relevant Methods**: Similar to `FiniteSet`, the `Interval` class also contains an `_complement` method. Given that the issue mentions a failure in handling the complement operation when the inputs involve both `Interval` and `FiniteSet` instances, this method could also be crucial.\n\n### Relationship to the Bug\nThe problem occurs when computing the complement of a combination of `FiniteSet` and `Interval`. Specifically, the expected behavior when subtracting `Interval(-10, 10)` from `FiniteSet(x, y, 2)` should result in `{x, y} \\ [-10,10]`. However, the reported output is `{x, y}`, indicating that the operation ignores the numeric part contained within the `FiniteSet`.\n\n### Intended Behavior and Analysis\n1. **FiniteSet `_complement`**: Should intelligently handle numeric elements when computing against an `Interval`, considering the numeric bounds of the `Interval`. \n2. **Interval `_complement`**: Should correctly interpret symbolic elements (e.g., `x`, `y`) as part of the complement calculation.\n\nBased on this analysis, it's critical to examine the implementation of both `_complement` methods within `FiniteSet` and `Interval` classes to identify why the numeric element `2` within the `FiniteSet` is not correctly contributing to the output of the complement operation. Furthermore, the failure to find the `Complement` method in the initial search suggests that the complement operation might be handled indirectly or polymorphically through methods defined within these classes or through another layer of abstraction that overrides or extends base functionality.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo rectify this bug, we need to inspect the implementation details of both `_complement` methods. Thus, the following search API calls should be made:\n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"_complement\", \"sympy/sets/sets.py\")` - Since both `FiniteSet` and `Interval` classes are located within the same file, this single call should return relevant excerpts from both methods.\n2. Given the absence of a direct `Complement` method discovery, it might also be useful to search for where these `_complement` methods are being invoked or how the `Complement` operation is mapped onto these methods, suggesting a deeper dive into the file where these classes are defined or examining any superclass methods that might dynamically resolve method calls based on the instance types involved.\n\nAssuming `Complement` behavior is achieved through polymorphic `_complement` methods within each class or through another overarching mechanism, inspecting these method implementations will be pivotal in identifying and addressing the reported issue."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

        "content": "The collected context provides insights into how the `_complement` method is implemented within different classes such as `FiniteSet`, `Interval`, `Union`, `EmptySet`, and `UniversalSet` in the `sympy/sets/sets.py` file. Let\u2019s analyze the relevant findings and their relationship to the reported issue:\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **FiniteSet `_complement` Implementation**: \n   - It sorts number and symbol elements when dealing with an `Interval` and creates intervals between the numbers, excluding symbols if the other set is `S.Reals`. \n   - For `FiniteSet` as the \"other\", it filters elements based on membership tests. \n\n2. **Interval `_complement` Implementation**: \n   - Creates two intervals excluding the current interval when the \"other\" is `S.Reals`. \n   - Processes numeric elements of a `FiniteSet` to determine their inclusion, effectively ignoring non-numeric elements.\n\n3. **Union, EmptySet, UniversalSet `_complement` Implementation**: \n   - These implementations show generic handling of complements in union sets (using DeMorgan's Law), treating any set as the entire universe in the case of `EmptySet`, and returning an empty set for `UniversalSet`, indicating these are special cases with broader behaviors aimed at handling universe and emptiness concepts within the sets.\n\n### Relationship to the Bug\n\nThe core issue is the incorrect calculation or exclusion of elements when a `FiniteSet` containing both symbols and numbers is complemented with an `Interval`. The expectation is that the operation `{x, y} \\ [-10, 10]` would consider numerical bounds for numbers and appropriately handle symbolic elements, leaving `{x, y}` as part of the output, instead of the incorrect `{x, y}` outcome.\n\n- **FiniteSet's `_complement` With Interval**: When dealing with `Interval` as another set, it seems that numerical values are handled correctly, but there might be a mismatch in how symbolic elements are considered within the operation.\n  \n- **Interval's `_complement`**: Correctly handling the case where the other set is `S.Reals` but might not fully consider `FiniteSet` elements beyond numeric ones, especially symbols which do not contribute to interval calculations directly.\n\n### Intended Behavior\n\n1. **In `FiniteSet`\u2019s `_complement`**: When `FiniteSet` interacts with an `Interval`, it should ensure that:\n   - Numeric elements within the `FiniteSet` are evaluated against the interval bounds properly.\n   - Symbolic elements are preserved since they do not directly interact with the numeric nature of intervals but are still distinct elements that should remain after the complement operation with an interval.\n\n2. **In `Interval`\u2019s `_complement`**: For intervals complemented by a `FiniteSet`, it needs to:\n   - Exclude numeric elements of the `FiniteSet` that fall within the interval bounds.\n   - Consider symbolic elements of the `FiniteSet` as untouched by the numeric bounds of the interval, thus preserving them in the output.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe issue likely resides within the interplay between `FiniteSet` and `Interval`, especially in how `_complement` operations are designed to handle mixed sets of symbols and numbers. The intended behavior should ensure that:\n- Numeric elements of a `FiniteSet` that fall outside the bounds of an interval are correctly handled.\n- Symbolic elements are preserved irrespective of numeric operations, reflecting a proper set-theoretic complement operation between mixed symbolic and numeric sets and intervals.\n\n**Bug Locations**:\n- **File**: `sympy/sets/sets.py`\n  - **Class**: `FiniteSet`\n    - **Method**: `_complement`\n  - **Class**: `Interval`\n    - **Method**: `_complement`\n\nTo resolve the issue, adjustments in both `FiniteSet` and `Interval` `_complement` methods are required to accurately reflect the set-theoretic principles when dealing with mixed types of elements (symbols and numbers) during complement operations."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

For numeric elements, it should compute their exclusion based on the interval's bounds. For symbolic elements, since they do not have a numeric value that can be compared against an interval's bounds, these should remain part of the resulting set without being affected by the numeric bounds of the interval. This ensures that operations involving a mix of symbols and numbers retain their symbolic components post-computation.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**:\n  - **File**: `sympy/sets/sets.py`\n  - **Class**: `Interval`\n  - **Method**: `_complement`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: The method, when dealing with a `FiniteSet` that includes both numeric and symbolic elements as the \"other\" set, needs to ensure that numeric elements are correctly evaluated for exclusion based on the interval's numeric bounds. Symbolic elements should be bypassed or treated in a manner that reflects their inability to be bound by numeric comparisons, essentially leaving them intact in the resulting set from the complement operation. This adjustment ensures the method's alignment with set-theoretic principles in handling mixed element types.\n\nThese adjustments will preserve the existing functionality for scenarios only involving numerical elements while correcting the handling of symbolic elements in complement operations between `FiniteSet` and `Interval` objects, thus resolving the reported issue."
