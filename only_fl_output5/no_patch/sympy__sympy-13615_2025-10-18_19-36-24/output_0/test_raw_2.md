Given the goal is to accurately reproduce and highlight the issue with the `Complement` operation in a standalone Python file, taking into account the previous feedback and the desired outcome, here is a corrected approach. This time, the assertion will properly reflect the expected behavior of the `Complement` function as described, aiming to assert an error when the actual behavior deviates from the expected `{x, y} \ [-10,10]`.

Here's the `reproducer.py` file tailored to meet these requirements:

```python
from sympy import symbols, Interval, FiniteSet, Complement

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    x, y = symbols('x y')
    a = FiniteSet(x, y, 2)
    b = Interval(-10, 10)
    result = Complement(a, b)
    try:
        assert result == FiniteSet(x, y), "The result does not match the expected output when the issue is present."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script explicitly checks for the condition that reveals the issue. The desired behavior, according to the initial complaint, suggests that performing a complement operation where one set includes a mixture of symbols and numbers against an interval does not behave as expected. The assert statement is intended to raise an exception specifically when the output does not match the expected `{x, y}`, considering the context that the real expectation is to handle the symbolic representation along with numeric intervals correctly, thus highlighting the issue more accurately.
