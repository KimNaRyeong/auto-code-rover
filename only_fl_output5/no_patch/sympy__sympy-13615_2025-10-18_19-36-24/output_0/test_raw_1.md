This revised script now correctly leverages the comparison logic to determine if the `Complement` operation behaves unexpectedly, specifically focusing on the issue as described without relying on `UnevaluatedEquality`, which was improperly utilized in the previous version. It aims to trigger an `AssertionError` if the complement between a finite set of symbols (and numbers) and an interval doesn't return the expected outcome reflecting the issue's core problem. If the issue is correctly identified, it prints a detailed stack trace; otherwise, it exits with code 0 signaling no issue detected based on the script's logic adjustments.
