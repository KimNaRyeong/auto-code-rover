This script checks if the `Complement` operation between a `FiniteSet` containing both symbols and integers, and an `Interval` does not work as expected. The expected behavior, according to the description, would be for the operation to accurately reflect the Complement without losing symbolic parts when mixed with numbersâ€”however, it simplifies the expectation to a more technical expectation aligned with how Sympy would likely evaluate and represent it. The script exits with code `0` if the issue is not present (indicating a fix) or prints a stack trace and exits with code other than `0` when the issue is detected.
