To address the requirements and correct the previous oversight, I've adjusted the standalone Python file named `reproducer.py`. This script will now correctly import necessary modules, ensuring that `sys` is available for the exit calls, and attempt to highlight the issue regarding the inheritance of documentation for overridden class methods without directly running Sphinx.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import inspect
    import sys  # Ensure sys is imported for exit calls

    class Parent:
        @classmethod
        def method(cls) -> int:
            """Return an integer."""
            return 17

    class Child(Parent):
        @classmethod
        def method(cls):
            return 42

    try:
        docstring = inspect.getdoc(Child.method)
        expected_doc = "Return an integer."
        assert docstring == expected_doc, "Docstring not inherited from Parent.method"

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 indicating the presence of the issue

    print("Issue not present, documentation correctly inherited.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating the issue is fixed or not present

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script checks the presence of a docstring for an overridden class method without additional documentation in the child class. If the assertion fails (meaning the docstring was not inherited as expected), the script will raise an `AssertionError`. The `print_stacktrace()` function is used to clearly present the error's context. The script exits with code 1 if the issue is present, indicating failure, or exits with code 0 if documentation inheritance works as expected, indicating success.

Run this script with `python3 reproducer.py` to check the behavior regarding docstring inheritance for classmethods, specifically in the context mentioned in your issue.
