        "intended_behavior": "The `astype` method should allow for type conversion of the data contained within a `DataArray` instance, mirroring the functionality seen in NumPy arrays. This method should include the `order` parameter to control the memory layout of the result. The intended fix would involve reinstating this parameter if it was removed, or providing a compatible interface that re-enables control over the memory layout as part of type conversion, ensuring consistency with NumPy and preserving existing functionality."
