If we provide a CSS style to draw a border around a `<kbd>` element, so single keystrokes are displayed correctly, then in the second example we'd get a double border (borders around the child elements, and another border around the parent element).\nIf you want to have borders around single keystrokes, and only around the child `<kbd>` elements in compound keystrokes, as shown on the screenshot below, the only way is to differentiate the container and child `<kbd>` elements with a CSS class.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/698770/103331868-9091ae80-4ab3-11eb-980a-94743f279511.png)\n**Expected behavior**\nSingle keystrokes are fine as they are, no change needed:\n```html\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">A</kbd>\n```\nFor compound keystrokes, the container `<kbd>` element should be marked with a CSS class (e.g. `compound`) so it can be styled differently than the child `<kbd>` elements:\n```html\n<kbd class=\"kbd compound docutils literal notranslate\">\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">Shift</kbd>+\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">X</kbd>\n</kbd>\n```\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Windows\n- Python version: 3.9.1\n- Sphinx version: 3.4.0\n- Sphinx extensions: -\n- Extra tools: -\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to the `:kbd:` role generating HTML that is difficult to style for compound keystrokes, we need to find the code responsible for generating the `<kbd>` elements. This involves identifying how Sphinx processes the `:kbd:` role and generates HTML from it. The issue description does not specify the exact class or method responsible for this, so let's break down the information gathering into steps:\n\n1. **Identify how Sphinx processes roles:** First, we need to understand how Sphinx processes roles like `:kbd:` in the documentation. This likely involves a specific method or class dedicated to roles processing.\n2. **Find the implementation for the `:kbd:` role:** Once we understand the general mechanism for role processing, we need to find the specific implementation for the `:kbd:` role.\n\nGiven these steps, here are the API calls we should make:\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify the processing mechanism.\n  - We can start by looking for a class or method that might be responsible for handling roles in general, as Sphinx uses roles for markup. A plausible starting point is searching for anything related to roles, so `search_class(\"Role\")` and `search_method(\"process_role\")` might help us find the right direction.\n\n- **Step 2:** Find specifics about the `:kbd:` role implementation.\n  - Once we have a better understanding of how roles are processed, we can narrow our search to specifically find how the `:kbd:` role is processed and generates HTML. It might not be named directly after `kbd`, so we need to look for methods or possible configurations that handle custom role processing. I will search for a method or code snippet that specifically mentions or is likely related to handling of `:kbd:` or roles leading to HTML transformation. `search_code(\":kbd:\")` might return too broad results, but it's a start to see if there's any direct reference in the code.\n\nBased on the described strategy, the needed API calls are:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Role\")`\n2. `search_method(\"process_role\")`\n3. `search_code(\":kbd:\")`"
