        "intended_behavior": "The `run` method of the `KeyboardTransform` class should be modified to recognize and differently handle compound keystrokes (e.g., \"Control+X\"). When it detects a compound keystroke (i.e., one that is split into parts by `-`, `+`, `^`, or space), it should wrap these parts in an additional `<literal>` (or equivalent) element with a new class (suggested `compound-kbd`). This container will allow for differentiated styling from single keystrokes. Preservation: Single keystrokes remain unaffected and continue to be represented as is, with the class `kbd`. Extension: Compound keystrokes should now be distinguishable in the HTML output, as they would be wrapped in a container with a class that identifies them as compound. This container should only wrap the entire compound keystroke, and not each individual key, allowing for CSS targeting of compound keystrokes as a whole versus their individual parts."
