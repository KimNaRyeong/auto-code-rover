If we provide a CSS style to draw a border around a `<kbd>` element, so single keystrokes are displayed correctly, then in the second example we'd get a double border (borders around the child elements, and another border around the parent element).\nIf you want to have borders around single keystrokes, and only around the child `<kbd>` elements in compound keystrokes, as shown on the screenshot below, the only way is to differentiate the container and child `<kbd>` elements with a CSS class.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/698770/103331868-9091ae80-4ab3-11eb-980a-94743f279511.png)\n**Expected behavior**\nSingle keystrokes are fine as they are, no change needed:\n```html\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">A</kbd>\n```\nFor compound keystrokes, the container `<kbd>` element should be marked with a CSS class (e.g. `compound`) so it can be styled differently than the child `<kbd>` elements:\n```html\n<kbd class=\"kbd compound docutils literal notranslate\">\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">Shift</kbd>+\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">X</kbd>\n</kbd>\n```\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Windows\n- Python version: 3.9.1\n- Sphinx version: 3.4.0\n- Sphinx extensions: -\n- Extra tools: -\n</issue>"

This involves identifying how Sphinx processes the `:kbd:` role and generates HTML from it. The issue description does not specify the exact class or method responsible for this, so let's break down the information gathering into steps:\n\n1. **Identify how Sphinx processes roles:** First, we need to understand how Sphinx processes roles like `:kbd:` in the documentation. This likely involves a specific method or class dedicated to roles processing.\n2. **Find the implementation for the `:kbd:` role:** Once we understand the general mechanism for role processing, we need to find the specific implementation for the `:kbd:` role.\n\nGiven these steps, here are the API calls we should make:\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify the processing mechanism.\n  - We can start by looking for a class or method that might be responsible for handling roles in general, as Sphinx uses roles for markup. A plausible starting point is searching for anything related to roles, so `search_class(\"Role\")` and `search_method(\"process_role\")` might help us find the right direction.\n\n- **Step 2:** Find specifics about the `:kbd:` role implementation.\n  - Once we have a better understanding of how roles are processed, we can narrow our search to specifically find how the `:kbd:` role is processed and generates HTML. It might not be named directly after `kbd`, so we need to look for methods or possible configurations that handle custom role processing. I will search for a method or code snippet that specifically mentions or is likely related to handling of `:kbd:` or roles leading to HTML transformation. `search_code(\":kbd:\")` might return too broad results, but it's a start to see if there's any direct reference in the code.\n\nBased on the described strategy, the needed API calls are:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Role\")`\n2. `search_method(\"process_role\")`\n3. `search_code(\":kbd:\")`"

Although the snippet is limited, the class name and its location suggest that it is responsible for transforming the `:kbd:` role into a more detailed form in the HTML output of Sphinx documentation. The class name and its comment indicate that it specifically processes keyboard input representations (`:kbd:`) during the Sphinx document building process, potentially altering or augmenting how these representations are converted to HTML.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Given the bug involves issues with how `:kbd:` roles are transformed into HTML (especially regarding styling challenges with compound keystrokes vs. individual keystrokes), the `KeyboardTransform` class is most likely directly involved. The bug complains about the lack of differentiation (via CSS classes) between parent and child `<kbd>` elements in the HTML generated from compound keystrokes. This class, therefore, is where the transformation logic that needs adjustment resides.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would involve modifying the `KeyboardTransform` class to ensure that when it processes compound `:kbd:` roles, it applies an additional CSS class (e.g., `compound`) to the outer `<kbd>` element. This modification would allow for distinct styling of compound keystroke representations versus individual ones, resolving the reported issue. Specifically, the HTML output for compound keystrokes should include a distinguishing CSS class for the outer `<kbd>` element, as described in the issue's expected behavior section.\n\nGiven these insights, further actions should involve diving deeper into the implementation of `KeyboardTransform` class to understand and eventually modify its transformation logic for the `:kbd:` role. This necessitates accessing the class definition and exploring its methods, particularly those responsible for generating the HTML output. \n\nThe next steps, therefore, would be to:\n\n1. Explore the full content of the `KeyboardTransform` class to understand its current logic for transforming `:kbd:` roles into HTML.\n2. Identify the method(s) within `KeyboardTransform` that specifically handle the generation of `<kbd>` HTML elements.\n   \nTo accomplish these steps, the following API calls are needed:\n\n1. `search_class_in_file(\"KeyboardTransform\", \"sphinx/builders/html/transforms.py\")` to get the full definition and implementation details of the `KeyboardTransform` class.\n2. Depending on the structure revealed from the first call, we might then need to look at specific methods within the class that handle `:kbd:` transformation, potentially `search_method_in_class` if there's a specific method name hinted at or discernable from the class definition."

Specifically, it takes text input that represents keyboard shortcuts (e.g., \"Control-X\") and splits them into individual components, each wrapped in a `<literal class=\"kbd\">` element. Compound keystrokes that involve multiple keys (e.g., \"Control-X\") are split by characters like `-`, `+`, `^`, or spaces, and each key part gets its own `<literal class=\"kbd\">`. This transformation is detailed in the class documentation.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The bug is directly related to how this transformation is handled. Specifically, the issue arises from the transformation not differentiating between the overall compound keystroke's container `<kbd>` and the individual keys' `<kbd>` elements within that compound keystroke. The existing implementation wraps all keystrokes, whether individual or part of a compound, in a `<literal class=\"kbd\">` without distinguishing the more comprehensive compound container. Hence, any CSS styling applied to `.kbd` classes affects both the individual keystrokes and the enclosing element equally, making it difficult to style compound keystrokes differently.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior here would involve modifying the transformation logic to apply a different or additional class to the outer `<kbd>` element that wraps compound keystrokes. This could mean introducing a new class (e.g., `compound-kbd`) for the parent container of compound keystrokes. The code would need to detect when it is processing a compound keystroke (i.e., when `len(parts) > 1`) and apply this new class to the outermost wrapping element to differentiate it from the individual keystroke elements.\n       - Maintain the existing functionality where individual keystrokes are wrapped in `<literal class=\"kbd\">`.\n       - Extend functionality to add a distinguishing class to the outer `<literal>` or similar element when handling compound keystrokes, allowing these to be styled distinctly from single keystrokes.\n\nThe modification to introduce such behavior would likely involve adjusting the logic inside the `run` method, especially around where nodes are created and added (`node += nodes.literal('', key, classes=[\"kbd\"])`). For compound keystrokes, before adding individual key nodes, it would involve creating or delineating an outer node with the new class to indicate it's a compound keystroke container."

This container will allow for differentiated styling from single keystrokes. This behavior ensures that:\n       - **Preservation:** Single keystrokes remain unaffected and continue to be represented as is, with the class `kbd`.\n       - **Extension:** Compound keystrokes should now be distinguishable in the HTML output, as they would be wrapped in a container with a class that identifies them as compound.
