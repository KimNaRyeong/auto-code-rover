Below is the Python script `reproducer.py` that follows your requirements. The script attempts to reproduce the issue as described, raising an `AssertionError` when the performance problem is present, identified by checking the execution time of the operation. If the modified implementation fixes the issue, it exits with code 0.

Copy this script into the root directory of your Django project, and run it using `python3 reproducer.py`. Ensure you have Django installed in your environment or virtual environment where you run this script.

```python
import datetime
from django.forms import Media

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_media(MediaClass):
    '''Creates a simple Media object with only one or two items.'''
    return MediaClass(css={'all': ['main.css']}, js=['main.js'])

class CustomMedia(Media):
    def __add__(self, other):
        combined = CustomMedia()
        if len(self._css_lists) + len(other._css_lists) > 1000:
            combined._css_lists = [self._css, other._css]
        else:
            combined._css_lists = self._css_lists + other._css_lists

        if len(self._js_lists) + len(other._js_lists) > 1000:
            combined._js_lists = [self._js, other._js]
        else:
            combined._js_lists = self._js_lists + other._js_lists

        return combined

def measure_performance_of_addition(MediaClass, additions=100000):
    media = create_media(MediaClass)
    start = datetime.datetime.now()
    for i in range(additions):
        media = media + create_media(MediaClass)
    duration = datetime.datetime.now() - start
    return duration

try:
    original_duration = measure_performance_of_addition(Media)
    modified_duration = measure_performance_of_addition(CustomMedia)

    # Define a threshold in seconds to consider the test as failed
    threshold = datetime.timedelta(seconds=5)

    # We assume that if the modified version takes less time than the threshold and significantly less than the original version, the issue is fixed
    if original_duration > modified_duration + threshold and modified_duration < threshold:
        print("The performance issue is likely fixed.")
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Performance issue is still present.")
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exit with error code if an assertion fails or another exception occurred

exit(0)  # Exit with success code if everything is fine
```

Remember, this script assumes that the main issue is with the performance of the `Media.__add__` method. The script calculates the execution time required to execute a large number of additions of `Media` objects. If the modified `CustomMedia` class significantly improves the performance (determined here by a hardcoded threshold of 5 seconds for practical reasons), it is considered that the issue has been successfully mitigated. Adjust the `threshold` and `additions` values as necessary based on your specific needs or system capabilities.
