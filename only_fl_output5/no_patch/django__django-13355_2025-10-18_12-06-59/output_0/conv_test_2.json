        "content": "Here is an issue:\n\nOptimize django.forms.widgets.Media.__add__.\nDescription\n\t\nWhile working with another project that make extensive use of django.forms.widgets.Media I discovered that the fix for ticket #30153 has unintended consequences on the performance of Media.__add__. If the number of Media objects added grows beyond a certain point (not sure it may be machine specific) then the performance of all subsequent Media.__add__ calls becomes terrible.\nThis was causing page load times of several minutes on my development machine. I agree that you need to delay as long as possible as #30153 intends but it seems that there probably should be an upper bound on this so that performance does not suddenly decrease.\nHere is some sample code that can reproduce the issue:\nfrom django.forms import Media\nimport datetime\ndef create_media(MediaClass):\n\t'''Creates a simple Media object with only one or two items.'''\n\treturn MediaClass(css={'all': ['main.css']}, js=['main.js'])\nstart = datetime.datetime.now()\nmedia = create_media(Media)\nfor i in range(100000):\n\tmedia = media + create_media(Media)\n\t\nprint('100000 additions took: %s' % (datetime.datetime.now() - start))\nOn my machine several runs of this code result in times between 1:35 - 1:44 (eg. 1 minute 35 seconds to 1 minute 44 seconds). However, taking away one zero from the number of media objects runs in under a second. Near as I can tell this has to do with the memory used to store these arrays and when it gets past a certain point the performance is awful. Since I am not sure if it is machine specific, for reference my machine is a i7-8700 with 64 GB RAM.\nHere is a sample that has a modified Media class that does not have theses issues:\nfrom django.forms import Media\nimport datetime\ndef create_media(MediaClass):\n\t'''Creates a simple Media object with only one or two items.'''\n\treturn MediaClass(css={'all': ['main.css']}, js=['main.js'])\nclass CustomMedia(Media):\n\tdef __add__(self, other):\n\t\tcombined = CustomMedia()\n\t\tif len(self._css_lists) + len(other._css_lists) > 1000:\n\t\t\tcombined._css_lists = [self._css, other._css]\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\tcombined._css_lists = self._css_lists + other._css_lists\n\t\t\n\t\tif len(self._js_lists) + len(other._js_lists) > 1000:\n\t\t\tcombined._js_lists = [self._js, other._js]\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\tcombined._js_lists = self._js_lists + other._js_lists\n\t\t\n\t\treturn combined\nstart = datetime.datetime.now()\nmedia = create_media(CustomMedia)\nfor i in range(100000):\n\tmedia = media + create_media(CustomMedia)\n\t\nprint('100000 additions took: %s' % (datetime.datetime.now() - start))\nWith this change it again runs in under a second. If I increase the number of loops the performance seems to change at a much more expected level.\nI set an upper limit on the length allowed before a merge occurs. I'm not sure if the number of additions allowed should be a setting that can be adjusted to meet specific needs or if something that is just \"reasonably\" high is sufficient. It does appear that limiting the total number of items in the list to about 1000 works best on my machine. I'm also not sure that this is the best solution.\nThanks for your consideration.\n"
