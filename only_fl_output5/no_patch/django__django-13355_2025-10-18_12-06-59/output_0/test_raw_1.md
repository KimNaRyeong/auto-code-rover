To address your request accurately, I'll craft a `reproducer.py` that strictly follows the provided criteria, ensuring the script can properly identify and raise an exception if the issue is present, or gracefully exit with code 0 if the issue is resolved. The script will integrate the function to print the stack trace clearly, facilitating precise issue analysis.

```python
import datetime
from django.forms import Media
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    line {line_number}, in {frame.name}", file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_media(MediaClass):
    '''Creates a simple Media object with only one or two items.'''
    return MediaClass(css={'all': ['main.css']}, js=['main.js'])

class FixedMedia(Media):
    def __add__(self, other):
        combined = FixedMedia()
        if len(self._css_lists) + len(other._css_lists) > 1000:
            combined._css_lists = [self._css, other._css]
        else:
            combined._css_lists = self._css_lists + other._css_lists

        if len(self._js_lists) + len(other._js_lists) > 1000:
            combined._js_lists = [self._js, other._js]
        else:
            combined._js_lists = self._js_lists + other._js_lists
        return combined

def test_performance_issue():
    start_time = datetime.datetime.now()
    media = create_media(Media)
    for _ in range(100000):
        media = media + create_media(Media)
    end_time = datetime.datetime.now()

    vanilla_duration = end_time - start_time

    start_time = datetime.datetime.now()
    media = create_media(FixedMedia)
    for _ in range(100000):
        media = media + create_media(FixedMedia)
    end_time = datetime.datetime.now()

    fixed_duration = end_time - start_time

    # Asserting the fix is faster than the original by more than a minute (as an example)
    # This would depend on the actual performance difference observed and can be adjusted.
    assert fixed_duration + datetime.timedelta(minutes=1) < vanilla_duration, "Performance issue is still present"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_performance_issue()
        print("The performance issue is likely fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
```

This Python file is structured to run a performance test that adds a large number of `Media` objects both in the original and patched implementations. It uses the provided stack trace printing function for clear error reporting. By comparing the execution times before and after the hypothetical fix, it will assert whether the issue persists. If the patched version (represented by `FixedMedia`) does not exhibit the same slowdown as the standard `Media` class, it is considered a successful resolution.
