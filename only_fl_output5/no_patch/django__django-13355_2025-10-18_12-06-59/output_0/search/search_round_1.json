        "content": "<issue>Optimize django.forms.widgets.Media.__add__.\nDescription\nWhile working with another project that make extensive use of django.forms.widgets.Media I discovered that the fix for ticket #30153 has unintended consequences on the performance of Media.__add__. If the number of Media objects added grows beyond a certain point (not sure it may be machine specific) then the performance of all subsequent Media.__add__ calls becomes terrible.\nThis was causing page load times of several minutes on my development machine. I agree that you need to delay as long as possible as #30153 intends but it seems that there probably should be an upper bound on this so that performance does not suddenly decrease.\nHere is some sample code that can reproduce the issue:\nfrom django.forms import Media\nimport datetime\ndef create_media(MediaClass):\n'''Creates a simple Media object with only one or two items.'''\nreturn MediaClass(css={'all': ['main.css']}, js=['main.js'])\nstart = datetime.datetime.now()\nmedia = create_media(Media)\nfor i in range(100000):\nmedia = media + create_media(Media)\nprint('100000 additions took: %s' % (datetime.datetime.now() - start))\nOn my machine several runs of this code result in times between 1:35 - 1:44 (eg. 1 minute 35 seconds to 1 minute 44 seconds). However, taking away one zero from the number of media objects runs in under a second. Near as I can tell this has to do with the memory used to store these arrays and when it gets past a certain point the performance is awful. Since I am not sure if it is machine specific, for reference my machine is a i7-8700 with 64 GB RAM.\nHere is a sample that has a modified Media class that does not have theses issues:\nfrom django.forms import Media\nimport datetime\ndef create_media(MediaClass):\n'''Creates a simple Media object with only one or two items.'''\nreturn MediaClass(css={'all': ['main.css']}, js=['main.js'])\nclass CustomMedia(Media):\ndef __add__(self, other):\ncombined = CustomMedia()\nif len(self._css_lists) + len(other._css_lists) > 1000:\ncombined._css_lists = [self._css, other._css]\nelse:\ncombined._css_lists = self._css_lists + other._css_lists\nif len(self._js_lists) + len(other._js_lists) > 1000:\ncombined._js_lists = [self._js, other._js]\nelse:\ncombined._js_lists = self._js_lists + other._js_lists\nreturn combined\nstart = datetime.datetime.now()\nmedia = create_media(CustomMedia)\nfor i in range(100000):\nmedia = media + create_media(CustomMedia)\nprint('100000 additions took: %s' % (datetime.datetime.now() - start))\nWith this change it again runs in under a second. If I increase the number of loops the performance seems to change at a much more expected level.\nI set an upper limit on the length allowed before a merge occurs. I'm not sure if the number of additions allowed should be a setting that can be adjusted to meet specific needs or if something that is just \"reasonably\" high is sufficient. It does appear that limiting the total number of items in the list to about 1000 works best on my machine. I'm also not sure that this is the best solution.\nThanks for your consideration.\n</issue>"

Each concatenation operation has a cost that increases with the number of additions, leading to exponential growth in processing time.\n\n### Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\n- The intended behavior would be to efficiently combine multiple `Media` objects without a significant performance penalty, even when dealing with a large number of objects.\n- To address the issue, an optimized approach might involve accumulating `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` more efficiently, perhaps by using more performant data structures or algorithms, to avoid the cost of repeatedly creating and concatenating large lists.\n- The suggested solution from the issue involves setting an upper limit on the number of items before merging occurs, potentially reducing the performance impact for very large numbers of operations. This implies that a more performant concatenation logic or a conditional logic to limit the operations may be needed.\n\nGiven this analysis, a next step towards crafting a patch could involve exploring alternative approaches to merging `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` within the `__add__` method. This could include:\n- Directly appending to existing lists rather than creating new ones, if possible.\n- Exploring the use of more efficient data structures for managing CSS and JS lists that could be merged more efficiently.\n- Implementing a threshold for merging lists directly and using a different strategy beyond this threshold to manage memory and computation time effectively.\n\nFurther investigation into how `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` are initialized and managed throughout the `Media` class lifecycle could also be necessary to ensure that any optimizations are compatible with the current design and use cases of the `Media` class."

The current implementation, which directly concatenates `_css_lists` and `_js_lists`, leads to significant performance degradation as the number of combinations increases. Implementing a more efficient strategy for merging these lists is essential to address the performance issue.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the method's intended behavior should change as follows:\n\n- Introduce conditional logic that checks the cumulative size of the `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` before performing the concatenation. If the total size exceeds a predefined threshold (for example, 1000 items, as suggested in the issue description), it should switch to an alternative method for combining these lists to prevent performance degradation.\n- Consider maintaining a flat list for each media type or implementing a more efficient data structure for these lists that supports quick merges and avoids the overhead of duplicating lists with each addition.\n- Ensure that the optimized behavior preserves the original functionality of aggregating CSS and JS references for the `Media` objects, so the end result remains correct regardless of the number of `Media` objects combined.\n- The solution should account for the typical use case of the `Media` class in Django forms and widgets, which can often involve dynamically adding or combining forms that include media resources.\n\nThis approach aims to strike a balance between preserving the intended functionality of dynamically combining media resources across form widgets while addressing the specific performance bottleneck identified in the issue."
