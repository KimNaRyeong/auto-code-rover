Given the feedback and to adhere closely to the requirement, let's integrate the correct measures in a revised `reproducer.py` script. This version will properly check the `__repr__` strings of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes from `sklearn`, accounting for the previously encountered import issue in a try-except block. 

However, it's worth mentioning that the error encountered during the test execution seems related to the Sklearn build on your environment, not directly related to the script itself. Make sure Sklearn is installed correctly in your environment before running the script.

Here's a new version of `reproducer.py` that concretely addresses checking the representations of the specified classes and exits accordingly based on the findings:

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedKFold, RepeatedStratifiedKFold
        expected_rkf_repr = "RepeatedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)"
        expected_rskf_repr = "RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)"

        rkf_repr = repr(RepeatedKFold())
        rskf_repr = repr(RepeatedStratifiedKFold())

        assert rkf_repr == expected_rkf_repr, f"RepeatedKFold __repr__ incorrect: {rkf_repr}"
        assert rskf_repr == expected_rskf_repr, f"RepeatedStratifiedKFold __repr__ incorrect: {rskf_repr}"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exits with a non-zero code if there is an assertion error
    except Exception as e:
        print("Unexpected error encountered:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exits upon encountering any unexpected errors
    print("No issues detected.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script takes into account both the need for a detailed error trace and the possibility of an unexpected error, while focusing on testing the `__repr__` strings of the two specified Sklearn classes.
