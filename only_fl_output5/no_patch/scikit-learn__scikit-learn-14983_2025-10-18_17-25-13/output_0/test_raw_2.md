Understood. Let's craft a `reproducer.py` aimed at specifically examining the `__repr__` output for `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` based on the given requirements and utilizing the provided function for error reporting. The script will verify if the actual `__repr__` output matches the expected outcome and otherwise will raise an `AssertionError`.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_repr_sklearn():
    from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedKFold, RepeatedStratifiedKFold
    rkf = RepeatedKFold()
    rskf = RepeatedStratifiedKFold()
    expected_rkf_repr = "RepeatedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)"
    expected_rskf_repr = "RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)"
    
    assert repr(rkf) == expected_rkf_repr, "RepeatedKFold __repr__ did not match expected"
    assert repr(rskf) == expected_rskf_repr, "RepeatedStratifiedKFold __repr__ did not match expected"

try:
    test_repr_sklearn()
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero code indicating failure/error

print("No issues detected.")
exit(0)  # Exit with zero indicating success/no error
```

This script will directly engage with the heart of the issue: whether `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` accurately reflect their expected `__repr__` strings or not. If the actual outcome diverges, an assertion error will be raised, and the detailed stack trace is shown, leveraging the `print_stacktrace` function as requested. The script concludes with an exit code that signifies whether the test was successful (`0`) or if an issue was detected (`1`).
