The information provided does not include the implementation of the `__repr__` method for either class, which suggests a few possibilities:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   The provided code snippets show the initialization methods (`__init__`) of both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes, indicating their default parameters. There's no direct mention of a `__repr__` method, implying that the representation functionality is either inherited from a parent class or not specialized, leading to the default Python object representation being used (which explains the issue reported).\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   The absence of a customized `__repr__` method in these class definitions directly relates to the bug. Python's default `__repr__` function is kicking in, generating the generic `<class_name object at memory_address>` string, instead of a more informative representation that includes relevant class attributes like `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   The intended behavior would be to provide a human-readable string that includes the class name and its key initialization parameters. This requires implementing a `__repr__` method that returns a formatted string containing the class name and parameters such as `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`.\n\nGiven these considerations, our next step should be to investigate whether `_RepeatedSplits` (the superclass) implements a `__repr__` method which `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` could inherit or override as needed. If `_RepeatedSplits` does not provide a `__repr__` method, or if the method does not produce the expected string, we'll need to implement or modify `__repr__` methods within `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` directly.\n\n- search_class(\"_RepeatedSplits\")"

        "content": "The search result for `_RepeatedSplits` provides essential insights into the superclass of both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`. Here's the analysis based on this context:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `_RepeatedSplits` class serves as an abstract base class (due to the `ABCMeta` metaclass) for split generators that need to be repeated with different randomization in each repetition. It defines the fundamental structure and interface (`__init__`, `split`, `get_n_splits`) that its subclasses should inherit or implement. However, from the information provided, it does not include a `__repr__` method, which means subclasses are responsible for providing their own representation if the default Python object representation is not desirable.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Since `_RepeatedSplits` lacks a `__repr__` method, its subclasses (`RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`) inherit this omission. This inheritance is the root cause of the issue where calling `repr()` on instances of these subclasses results in the non-informative default Python representation rather than a custom, informative string that includes the class name and its key parameters.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The expected or intended behavior would be for the subclasses of `_RepeatedSplits`, specifically `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`, to implement a `__repr__` method that reflects their configuration. Ideally, this method should output a string that clearly states the class name and its initialization parameters (i.e., `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, `random_state`). Implementing this in each subclass directly, or adding such a method to `_RepeatedSplits` that the subclasses can inherit or override, would resolve the issue.\n\nGiven that `_RepeatedSplits` does not implement `__repr__`, it's clear that the absence of this method in the subclasses is not an inheritance oversight but rather an implementation detail that was missed or deferred. To address the bug, each subclass should include a `__repr__` method that matches the expected output format: a readable string incorporating the class name and its main parameters. This would require adding or modifying code in the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes, specifically in the file `sklearn/model_selection/_split.py`."
