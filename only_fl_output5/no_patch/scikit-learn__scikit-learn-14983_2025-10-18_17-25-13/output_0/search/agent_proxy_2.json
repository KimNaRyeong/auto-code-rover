The method should format this string to clearly and accurately represent an instance's configuration, such as `RepeatedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)`.\n\n   - **Location 2:**\n     - **File:** `sklearn/model_selection/_split.py`\n     - **Class:** `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** Similar to `RepeatedKFold`, this class requires a `__repr__` method that returns a formatted string that includes the class name and its initialization parameters.
