Given the misunderstanding, we will proceed with the assumption that the environment and dependencies are properly configured to reproduce the original issue related to `xarray.DataArray.quantile` and `keep_attrs`. Here is a revised version of `reproducer.py` designed to specifically test for the reported issue:

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_quantile_keeps_attrs():
    import xarray as xr
    try:
        da = xr.DataArray([0, 0], dims="x", attrs={'units':'K'})
        out = da.quantile(.9, dim='x', keep_attrs=True)
        assert out.attrs == {'units': 'K'}, "Quantile method does not honor `keep_attrs=True`, expected attrs to be retained."
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_quantile_keeps_attrs()
    print("The issue has been fixed.")
    exit(0)
```

This version includes the try-except block within the `test_quantile_keeps_attrs` function for better handling of potential exceptions thrown by xarray or other libraries. It ensures that any exception, including the `AssertionError` upon failing the `assert`, is caught, and a detailed stack trace is printed. This script should be executed in an environment where the reported versions of the dependencies, including xarray, are installed. If the issue has been resolved in a version of xarray later than the one reported, then the script will exit with code 0, confirming the fix.
