Certainly! Given the requirements and understanding the task fully now, below is the revised `reproducer.py` Python script. This script checks whether the `xarray.DataArray.quantile` function keeps the attributes when `keep_attrs=True` is specified. If the attributes are not preserved, it raises an `AssertionError`; otherwise, it completes successfully, indicating the issue has been fixed.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_quantile_keeps_attrs():
    import xarray as xr
    da = xr.DataArray([0, 0], dims="x", attrs={'units':'K'})
    out = da.quantile(.9, dim='x', keep_attrs=True)
    assert out.attrs == {'units': 'K'}, "Quantile method does not honor `keep_attrs=True`. Expected attrs to be retained."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_quantile_keeps_attrs()
        print("The issue has been fixed.")
        exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
```

This script is designed to be executed at the root directory of the project with Python 3:
```bash
python3 reproducer.py
```

If the script encounters an `AssertionError` (meaning the attrs were not kept as expected), it will print a detailed stack trace explaining where and why the error occurred. If no error is thrown, it indicates that the `quantile` method behaves as expected by keeping the attributes, and the script will exit with code 0, signaling the issue has been addressed.
