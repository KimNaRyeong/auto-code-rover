        "intended_behavior": "The code in these locations should be updated or fixed to ensure that test methods decorated with @staticmethod or @classmethod and @pytest.mark.parametrize are correctly identified and collected as test cases. The discovery mechanism should be able to introspect these methods, recognize them as valid test cases, and execute them with each set of parameters provided by @pytest.mark.parametrize. The behavior must ensure that this fix preserves the existing functionality of pytest's test discovery, not affecting other types of test methods or breaking backwards compatibility. Special care might be required to ensure that the fix does not inadvertently interfere with other decorators or pytest plugins. It might be beneficial to add explicit checks or logic to handle the combination of @staticmethod/@classmethod with @pytest.mark.parametrize to avoid relying on more general introspection logic that might miss specific cases or configurations."
