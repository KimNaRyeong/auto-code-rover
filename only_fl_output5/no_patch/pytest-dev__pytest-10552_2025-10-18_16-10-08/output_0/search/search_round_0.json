Here's an example:\n```python\nimport pytest\nclass TestFoo:\n# passes:\n@staticmethod\ndef test_staticmethod() -> None:\nfoo = 0\nassert foo < 3\n# warning: cannot collect 'test_staticmethod_inner' because it is not a function.\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [1, 2])\n@staticmethod\ndef test_staticmethod_inner(foo: int) -> None:\nassert foo < 3\n# passes:\n@staticmethod\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [1, 2])\ndef test_staticmethod_outer(foo: int) -> None:\nassert foo < 3\n# silently fails to run\n@classmethod\ndef test_classmethod(cls) -> None:\nfoo = 0\nassert foo < 3\n# warning: cannot collect 'test_classmethod_inner' because it is not a function.\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [1, 2])\n@classmethod\ndef test_classmethod_inner(cls, foo: int) -> None:\nassert foo < 3\n# silently fails to run\n@classmethod\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [1, 2])\ndef test_classmethod_outer(cls, foo: int) -> None:\nassert foo < 3\n```\nThe most worrysome cases are `test_classmethod` and `test_classmethod_outer`, which are not discovered by pytest.

        "content": "To understand the context of the issue and potentially identify why `staticmethod` and `classmethod` decorated tests with parametrization are not working correctly while discovery and running tests with pytest, we should look into where these methods are defined and used. Here are the API calls we can make based on the given issue:\n\n1. **Search for the Test Class**: Since all the tests methods mentioned in the issue are within a class named `TestFoo`, let's start by locating this class in the codebase to understand its context, dependencies, and any potentially relevant code surrounding it.\n   - `search_class(\"TestFoo\")`\n\n2. **Search for Specific Methods within the Test Class**: Next, we want to look at the problematic methods directly to get more context about their implementation and to verify if there's something about how they're defined that could be leading to the issue.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"test_staticmethod\", \"TestFoo\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"test_staticmethod_inner\", \"TestFoo\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"test_classmethod\", \"TestFoo\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"test_classmethod_inner\", \"TestFoo\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"test_classmethod_outer\", \"TestFoo\")`\n\n3. **Search for Decorators and Parametrize Usage**: We are also interested in the usage of `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, and `@pytest.mark.parametrize` throughout the codebase, particularly in the context of test discovery issues. This can help us understand if there's a pattern or known issue with using these decorators in certain ways.\n   - `search_code(\"@staticmethod\")`\n   - `search_code(\"@classmethod\")`\n   - `search_code(\"@pytest.mark.parametrize\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how `TestFoo` and its methods are structured, including any peculiarities with the decorators that might inform us about the nature of the issue being faced."
