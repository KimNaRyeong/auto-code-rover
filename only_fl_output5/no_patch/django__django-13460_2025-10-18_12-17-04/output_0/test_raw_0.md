To create a standalone Python file `reproducer.py` that can reproduce the discussed issue, you'll need to simulate a scenario where Django's `{% blocktrans %}` tag with a float value encounters the described TypeError. For simplicity, this script will mock parts of the Django translation mechanism to directly test the format operation with float values, resembling the process that fails within Django's blocktrans tag handling. This approach allows us to focus on the specific format error while avoiding the complexity of setting up a full Django project environment.

```python
# reproducer.py
def simulate_gettext_translation(value):
    """
    Simulates the translation process of the gettext module
    with the provided value, mimicking the formatting operation
    that causes the issue.
    """
    try:
        # Try to format the string as gettext would when a float is involved.
        # This line simulates the string formatting mechanism in gettext
        # that leads to the TypeError when formatting with floats.
        formatted_string = "На расстоянии %(counter)s мили" % {'counter': value}
        print("Successfully formatted string:", formatted_string)
        return False  # Issue is not present
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return True  # Issue is present

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    """
    Prints the stack trace of the given exception with clear line numbers.
    """
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Change this value to a float to simulate the issue
    value = 1.5  # Simulating a float value that might cause the format issue

    # Call simulate_gettext_translation with the value to see if the issue is present
    issue_present = simulate_gettext_translation(value)
    
    # Raise an AssertionError if the issue is present, indicating the test failed
    assert not issue_present, "Issue detected: TypeError when formatting float values"

    print("Issue not present. Exiting with code 0.")
```

This script attempts to directly reproduce the formatting issue encountered when Django's `{% blocktrans %}` tag is used with a floating-point value within a template, which ultimately leads to a `TypeError` due to the incompatibility with the expected string formatting behavior. We simulate this behavior by directly performing a string formatting operation that mirrors the failure point.

Note: This script does not include Django or its templating engine due to the focus on remaining standalone and simplifying the reproduction of the string formatting error specifically.
