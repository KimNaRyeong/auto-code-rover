Let's strategize our search:\n\n1. **`blocktrans` Tag Implementation:** This is likely part of a template rendering engine, possibly Django's template engine. Finding the class or method that handles `blocktrans` would be the first step.\n\n2. **String Formatting with `gettext`:** Understanding how the project implements or wraps `gettext` calls when processing `blocktrans` tags, particularly the string formatting part that fails with floats.\n\nHere are the search requests:\n\n- First, we need to locate the handling of `blocktrans` tags which is likely in the template rendering system. `search_method(\"blocktrans\")`\n\n- Next, given the issue mentions `gettext` and string formatting errors, we should search for where `gettext` is used. `search_method(\"gettext\")`\n\n- Additionally, since `floatformat` filter is mentioned to work when not passing floats directly, it would be useful to find where this filter is defined or applied. `search_code(\"floatformat\")`\n\nThese searches should provide us with enough context to understand where the problem lies and how to approach fixing it."
