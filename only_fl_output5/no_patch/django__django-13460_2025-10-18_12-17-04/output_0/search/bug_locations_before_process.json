        "intended_behavior": "The core issue arises because `gettext` cannot process floats directly in the context of string formatting specified by translations. The method should be enhanced to gracefully handle or convert float values to strings in a format compatible with the expected string formatting operations. This could involve checking the type of `message` or the context in which `message` is being translated, and ensuring float values are appropriately formatted as strings (considering the locale) before passing to the actual translation logic. This preserves the existing functionality (i.e., translating string messages based on the active locale) while enhancing it to prevent `TypeError` when translating messages with float values."

        "intended_behavior": "While the `floatformat` filter itself may not be directly buggy, its interplay with the translation system (particularly, `blocktrans` tags that involve numeric values) needs review. The filter should ensure that any float values are converted to a string format that is consistent with the expectations of the Django translation system (and, by extension, Python's string formatting system). This might involve ensuring the output is not only locale-aware but also compatible with how `gettext` processes placeholder values within translated strings. An additional check or enhancement might be needed to explicitly mark the output as 'safe' for string formatting operations within the context of translations, thus avoiding the type error mentioned in the issue."
