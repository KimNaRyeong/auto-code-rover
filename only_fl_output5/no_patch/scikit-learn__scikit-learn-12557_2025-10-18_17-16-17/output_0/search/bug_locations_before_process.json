        "intended_behavior": "Ensure that tie-breaking logic within `decision_function` is consistent with that of `predict`, possibly by adjusting how class scores are evaluated to reflect the same tie-breaking strategy. This means if `decision_function` implements a form of tie-breaking not present in `predict`, aligning these two methods either by adding tie-breaking to `predict` or modifying `decision_function` to reflect `predict`'s existing behavior could resolve the issue. Ensuring compatibility between these methods is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the class's interface and the accuracy of its predictive capabilities."
