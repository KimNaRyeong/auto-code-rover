        "intended_behavior": "The `_contains` method should correctly evaluate an element's membership in the intersection of sets, particularly when complex numbers and `Reals` are involved. For the specific bug, the method needs to accurately differentiate and validate elements against `Reals` when one of the intersecting sets is an `ImageSet` involving complex numbers. Specifically, this method should assert that complex numbers (or operations that result in complex numbers) do not falsely qualify as members of the intersection with `Reals` unless their real parts are explicitly part of the intersecting sets. This enhancement or correction should uphold the method's general functionality while ensuring mathematical accuracy for operations involving complex numbers and `Reals`."
