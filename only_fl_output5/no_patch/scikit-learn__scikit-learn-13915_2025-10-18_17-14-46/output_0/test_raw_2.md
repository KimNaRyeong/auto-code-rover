Based on the specified requirements and taking into consideration the issue described previously, below is an adapted standalone Python file named `reproducer.py`. This script is designed to reproduce the reported issue, utilizing the provided function to print the stack trace for clear error reporting.

```python
# reproduducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import scipy.sparse as sp
    from sklearn.utils.sparsefuncs import min_max_axis

    X = sp.csc_matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    X.indptr = X.indptr.astype('int64')

    Y = sp.csr_matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    Y.indptr = Y.indptr.astype('int64')

    try:
        # For CSR matrix
        result_csr = min_max_axis(Y, 0)
        print(result_csr)
        
        # For CSC matrix, this is expected to raise an error on 32-bit Windows with the issue present
        result_csc = min_max_axis(X, 0)
        print(result_csc)
        
        # If no error is raised till now, issue is considered resolved
        print("Issue resolved.")
        exit(0)

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script creates both CSR and CSC matrices, where `indptr` is specifically cast to `int64`, aligning with the circumstances outlined in the reported issue concerning 32-bit Windows platforms. The script attempts to process these matrices using the `min_max_axis` function from `sklearn.utils.sparsefuncs`.

- **When the issue is present**: The script should raise a `TypeError` during the processing of the CSC matrix, captured by the exception handler which then raises an `AssertionError` after printing a detailed stack trace.
- **When the issue is resolved**: No exception should be raised, and the script will exit with code 0 after printing "Issue resolved.".

Please make sure to execute this script in an environment similar to the one where the issue was initially reported (specifically, a 32-bit Windows Python environment with the mentioned versions of dependencies) to accurately verify the presence or resolution of the issue.
