        "intended_behavior": "The `_minor_reduce` function is where the type casting error occurs due to numpy's `reduceat` method not being able to handle `int64` indices on a 32-bit system. The solution should involve ensuring the `X.indptr` indices passed to `reduceat` are of a type that numpy expects in the system's architecture. This might entail dynamically checking the system's architecture (or numpy's integer size expectation) and converting `X.indptr` to `int32` if running on a 32-bit system, while ensuring that such a conversion does not lose information. A safety check should be added to see if it's possible to safely convert `int64` indices to `int32` without data loss. If data loss is likely, the function should raise an informative error or warning. The adjustment ensures that the intended behavior of computing minimum and maximum values for segments of the sparse matrix data is preserved across all supported system architectures, effectively resolving the issue reported without altering the functionality for existing users on 64-bit systems."
