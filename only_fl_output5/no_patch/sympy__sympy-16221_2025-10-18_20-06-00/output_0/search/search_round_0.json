        "content": "To address the issue regarding the lack of support for printing matrices and arrays in Wolfram Mathematica code within our project, we will need to gather more context about how the current printing system is implemented. By understanding where and how objects are currently being printed, we can then identify the best place to integrate support for matrices and arrays. Let's begin by searching for relevant classes, methods, and any existing code related to printing or Mathematica output handling.\n\nGiven the specifications of the issue, the following API calls would be useful:\n\n1. Search for a class that might be responsible for printer or output handling. Mathematica-related functionality could be encapsulated within a specific class:\n   - `search_class(\"PrintManager\")`\n   - `search_class(\"OutputHandler\")`\n\n2. Assuming that the project might have a specific method for printing objects, it would be necessary to look for these methods throughout the codebase. Given the broad nature of the task, looking for general print methods could also provide clues on where to integrate matrix and array printing support:\n   - `search_method(\"printObject\")`\n   - `search_method(\"displayOutput\")`\n\n3. It's also possible that the project contains specific code snippets for handling or identifying Mathematica data structures. Identifying these can pinpoint where adjustments for matrix and array printing can be made:\n   - `search_code(\"Wolfram Mathematica\")`\n   - `search_code(\"Matrix\")`\n   - `search_code(\"Array\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of the project's current capabilities and limitations regarding object printing, particularly focusing on matrices and arrays in the context of Wolfram Mathematica."
