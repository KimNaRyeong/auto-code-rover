Does it make sense to support this case. It will return the identity matrix which is not the use case for the `StandardScaler`. If we wish a transformer to do so, one should use the `FunctionTransformer` I assume.\n2. If we consider this behaviour normal, we need to:\n* In the dense case, force `self.mean_` to be `None` after each iteration of `partial_fit`.\n* In the sparse case, compute the non-NaNs values and update `self.n_samples_seen_` which is not computed. It leads currently to an error if calling twice `fit` (i.e. `del self.n_samples_seen_` will fail).\nIMO, we should make a checking at `fit` raise an error.\n@jnothman @ogrisel WDYT?\n</issue>"

Once we have the file location for `StandardScaler`, it's important to look into the `fit` and `partial_fit` methods for both sparse and dense cases.

Since the issue mentions issues with `self.mean_` and `self.n_samples_seen_` in different cases, we would also search for where these attributes are handled within the file:\n```\nsearch_code_in_file(\"self.mean_\", \"preprocessing.py\")\nsearch_code_in_file(\"self.n_samples_seen_\", \"preprocessing.py\")\n```\n\n4.

The `StandardScaler` class implementation details provided indicate it supports initialization parameters for mean and standard deviation adjustment, and includes methods relevant to the issue, such as `fit`, `partial_fit`, and others.\n\nBased on the initial issue description and the correct file path, we should adjust our strategy and issue the following corrected API calls:\n\n1. Re-examine the `fit` and `partial_fit` methods in the correct file to understand how they handle sparse and dense inputs and manage the `self.mean_` and `self.n_samples_seen_` attributes:\n```\nsearch_method_in_file(\"fit\", \"sklearn/preprocessing/data.py\")\nsearch_method_in_file(\"partial_fit\", \"sklearn/preprocessing/data.py\")\n```\n\n2.

Bug Locations:\n\n- **Location 1:**\n  - File: sklearn/preprocessing/data.py\n  - Class: StandardScaler\n  - Method: fit\n  - Intended Behavior: The `fit` method should include logic to check if both `with_mean` and `with_std` are set to `False` and handle the sparse and dense input cases consistently. In case of `with_mean=False` and `with_std=False`, the function should either raise a meaningful error directing the user to a more appropriate transformer such as `FunctionTransformer` for achieving an identity transformation or ensure that the handling of attributes like `self.mean_` and `self.n_samples_seen_` is consistent across sparse and dense inputs. Particularly, for sparse inputs, it should not attempt to delete or incorrectly update `self.n_samples_seen_` in a way that would cause an error on subsequent calls to `fit`.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - File: sklearn/preprocessing/data.py\n  - Class: StandardScaler\n  - Method: partial_fit\n  - Intended Behavior: Similar to the `fit` method, `partial_fit` should be designed to handle the case where both `with_mean` and `with_std` are set to `False` consistently for sparse and dense inputs. It should ensure that when it's called iteratively, `self.mean_` remains `None` (or is handled appropriately) and `self.n_samples_seen_` is updated correctly without causing errors upon subsequent fittings. This might involve checking the input type and handling sparse data specifically, ensuring that the correct counting of samples is performed to update `self.n_samples_seen_` accurately.\n\nThese adjustments aim to resolve the inconsistency mentioned while preserving the existing functionality for cases where `with_mean` and/or `with_std` are `True`, or when the input data does not switch types across calls to `fit` or `partial_fit`."
