        "intended_behavior": "The `fit` method should include logic to check if both `with_mean` and `with_std` are set to `False` and handle the sparse and dense input cases consistently. In case of `with_mean=False` and `with_std=False`, the function should either raise a meaningful error directing the user to a more appropriate transformer such as `FunctionTransformer` for achieving an identity transformation or ensure that the handling of attributes like `self.mean_` and `self.n_samples_seen_` is consistent across sparse and dense inputs. Particularly, for sparse inputs, it should not attempt to delete or incorrectly update `self.n_samples_seen_` in a way that would cause an error on subsequent calls to `fit`."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to the `fit` method, `partial_fit` should be designed to handle the case where both `with_mean` and `with_std` are set to `False` consistently for sparse and dense inputs. It should ensure that when it's called iteratively, `self.mean_` remains `None` (or is handled appropriately) and `self.n_samples_seen_` is updated correctly without causing errors upon subsequent fittings. This might involve checking the input type and handling sparse data specifically, ensuring that the correct counting of samples is performed to update `self.n_samples_seen_` accurately."
