Does it make sense to support this case. It will return the identity matrix which is not the use case for the `StandardScaler`. If we wish a transformer to do so, one should use the `FunctionTransformer` I assume.\n2. If we consider this behaviour normal, we need to:\n* In the dense case, force `self.mean_` to be `None` after each iteration of `partial_fit`.\n* In the sparse case, compute the non-NaNs values and update `self.n_samples_seen_` which is not computed. It leads currently to an error if calling twice `fit` (i.e. `del self.n_samples_seen_` will fail).\nIMO, we should make a checking at `fit` raise an error.\n@jnothman @ogrisel WDYT?\n</issue>"

Search for the `StandardScaler` class to understand its current implementation:\n```\nsearch_class(\"StandardScaler\")\n```\n\n2. Once we have the file location for `StandardScaler`, it's important to look into the `fit` and `partial_fit` methods for both sparse and dense cases. For that, we need to first identify the class file, and then look into these methods. Assuming we find the class in the previous step, let's hypothesize it's in a file named `preprocessing.py`, the calls would be:\n```\nsearch_method_in_file(\"fit\", \"preprocessing.py\")\nsearch_method_in_file(\"partial_fit\", \"preprocessing.py\")\n```\n\n3. Since the issue mentions issues with `self.mean_` and `self.n_samples_seen_` in different cases, we would also search for where these attributes are handled within the file:\n```\nsearch_code_in_file(\"self.mean_\", \"preprocessing.py\")\nsearch_code_in_file(\"self.n_samples_seen_\", \"preprocessing.py\")\n```\n\n4. Given the specific issue with sparse and dense inputs, it might be useful to search for any conditional handling or mentions of sparse data in relevant methods:\n```\nsearch_code_in_file(\"sparse\", \"preprocessing.py\")\n```\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of the areas in the codebase that need to be reviewed and potentially modified to resolve the issue."
