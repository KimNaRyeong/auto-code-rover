Apologies for any confusion caused by previous responses. Let's directly address the requirement to reproduce the issue involving the `header_rows` keyword in the RestructuredText (`rst`) format using the `astropy` package, and ensure proper error handling and exit code behavior as per your specifications. The script below is crafted to meet these precise needs:

```python
# reproducer.py
import io
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from astropy.table import QTable
        import astropy.units as u

        # Create a table
        tbl = QTable({'wave': [350, 950] * u.nm, 'response': [0.7, 1.2] * u.count})
        
        # Redirect output to a buffer to prevent actual printing to stdout
        buffer = io.StringIO()
        
        # Attempt to write the table in 'rst' format using header_rows, which is expected to fail
        tbl.write(buffer, format="ascii.rst", header_rows=["name", "unit"])
        
        # If the previous line did not raise an exception, the issue is assumed to be fixed
        print("The issue appears to be fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except TypeError as e:
        if "unexpected keyword argument 'header_rows'" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("The issue with 'header_rows' not being accepted in ascii.rst format is present.")
        else:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        sys.exit(1)
```

This script precisely checks for the described issue by attempting to use the `header_rows` keyword argument with the `ascii.rst` writer format, which according to the issue report, raises a `TypeError` due to `header_rows` being unexpected. The script will:

1. Exit with code 0 if for any reason the operation succeeds, indicating the issue is presumably fixed.
2. Print the stack trace and raise an `AssertionError` if the known error message is encountered, and exit with code 1.
3. Print the stack trace and exit with code 1 for any other `TypeError` or any other exceptions, indicating an unexpected failure, possibly unrelated to the known issue.

The use of `print_stacktrace` ensures detailed error information is available for diagnosis while maintaining clear and specific behavior based on the result of the operation.
