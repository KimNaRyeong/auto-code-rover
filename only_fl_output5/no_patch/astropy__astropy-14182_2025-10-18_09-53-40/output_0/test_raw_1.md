Given your previous attempt and the error shown, it seems there was an issue with the environment lacking the `packaging` module, which is not directly related to the issue you are trying to reproduce. Ensure that your environment has all the necessary dependencies installed, including `astropy` and any other modules it might depend on, such as `packaging`.

Below is an updated version of `reproducer.py`, refined to follow the original requirements closely. It's designed to explicitly catch and assert the specific error related to the `header_rows` keyword which is at the heart of the reported issue. Additionally, the script attempts to use a more robust way of capturing and asserting the exception to prevent misunderstand exit codes due to environment setup issues.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_header_rows_in_restructuredtext_output():
    from astropy.table import QTable
    import astropy.units as u
    import io

    tbl = QTable({'wave': [350, 950] * u.nm, 'response': [0.7, 1.2] * u.count})

    buffer = io.StringIO()
    try:
        tbl.write(buffer, format="ascii.rst", header_rows=["name", "unit"])
        # If the method call succeeds, we assert False since the issue is expected to be present
        assert False, "The method call was expected to fail but succeeded."
    except TypeError as e:
        if "unexpected keyword argument 'header_rows'" in str(e):
            print("The issue is present as expected.")
        else:
            # For any other TypeError, re-raise it
            raise
    except Exception as e:
        # If any other exception occurs, print the stack trace and re-raise it
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_header_rows_in_restructuredtext_output()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception:
        # If there's an exception other than AssertionError, it indicates an unexpected failure
        exit(1)
    else:
        print("The issue is fixed.")
        exit(0)
```

This script is designed with the expectation that the `header_rows` issue is specifically caught and indicated, whereas any other environmental or unexpected exception is directly reported to aid in debugging. If the script exits with code 1 due to the `AssertionError`, it indicates the specific issue with `header_rows` you're testing for is present. Any improvements or bug fixes that prevent the `TypeError` from occurring should result in the script exiting with code 0, denoting the issue is fixed.
