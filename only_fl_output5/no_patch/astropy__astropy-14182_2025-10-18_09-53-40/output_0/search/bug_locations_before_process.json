        "intended_behavior": "The `__init__` method within the `RST` class should be modified to accept `header_rows` as an optional argument. This argument should control the inclusion of additional header rows in the RestructuredText output, similar to how it works in other output formats like `ascii.fixed_width`. Implementing support for `header_rows` involves handling it within the `write` method or appropriately passing this information to `data_class` (`SimpleRSTData`) and `header_class` (`SimpleRSTHeader`). The existing functionality for writing tables in the reStructuredText format must be preserved, with the enhancement that when `header_rows` are provided, they are included according to the RestructuredText specifications above the table data."

        "intended_behavior": "Ensure that when the `RST` class (or any writer class in the `ascii` module) is instantiated via a mechanism (presumably `_get_writer` or similar), any provided `header_rows` are correctly passed through and handled. This may involve modifying how writer classes are instantiated or ensuring that the interface for writer classes consistently supports `header_rows`. While the specified method or location for this mechanism wasn't directly identified, the handling of `header_rows` should be consistent across different formats, necessitating a review of the instantiation process to ensure it supports this functionality."
