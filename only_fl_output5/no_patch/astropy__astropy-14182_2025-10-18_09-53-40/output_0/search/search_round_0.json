        "content": "To address the issue effectively and gather sufficient context for crafting a patch, let's outline the steps based on the information from the issue description:\n\n1. From the traceback, it's clear that the error originates within the `RestructuredText` writer (noted as `RST.__init__()` in the error message), specifically when trying to pass `header_rows` as an argument, which isn't supported currently. Therefore, we must look into the `RST` (RestructuredText) class to understand how it handles inputs.\n\n2. Additionally, we need to understand how `header_rows` is handled in other formats, such as `ascii.fixed_width`, where it's seemingly implemented correctly.\n\n3. Lastly, we should check the mechanism by which writers are chosen and instantiated (`_get_writer` method mentioned in the traceback) to understand how the `header_rows` argument gets passed and why it might not be accepted by the `RST` writer.\n\nBased on these steps, here are our API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"RST\")` to find the `RestructuredText` writer class.\n- `search_method(\"write\")` to look for the `write` method that handles writing tables since this might give us a clue on how `header_rows` could be implemented or handled differently across formats.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_get_writer\", \"ascii.core\")` to examine how writers are instantiated, as it's clear that the process involves selecting specific writer classes based on format options."
