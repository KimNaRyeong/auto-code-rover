        "intended_behavior": "The `get_field` method should avoid throwing a `KeyError` when accessing `order_with_respect_to` for models with an `_order` field but not using `order_with_respect_to`. A safety check is necessary to ensure `order_with_respect_to` is indeed provided in the model's options before attempting to redirect `_order` to it. This preserves the existing functionality where `_order` is automatically resolved to the `order_with_respect_to` field, while also handling cases where a model might have an `_order` field independently of the `order_with_respect_to` option."
