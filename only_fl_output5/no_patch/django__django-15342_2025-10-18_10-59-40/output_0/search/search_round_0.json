The class `MigrationAutodetector` to understand how `generate_altered_fields` method triggers the error through `get_field` method.\n3. The actual implementation of the `get_field` method in `ModelState` class where it fails in the absence of `order_with_respect_to`.\n4. The `generate_altered_fields` method in `MigrationAutodetector` to comprehend its interaction with `ModelState.get_field`.\n\nGiven these targets, the corresponding API calls are:\n\n- `search_class(\"ModelState\")`: To locate the file and detailed context of the `ModelState` class.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"get_field\", \"ModelState\")`: To find the implementation of the `get_field` method within `ModelState`.\n- `search_class(\"MigrationAutodetector\")`: To find the `MigrationAutodetector` class which uses the `generate_altered_fields` method.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"generate_altered_fields\", \"MigrationAutodetector\")`: To understand how `generate_altered_fields` method functions and interacts with `ModelState.get_field`."
