        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we'll need to gather detailed context about the `_mathtext_data.py` file where the `tex2uni` dictionary or function is defined or manipulated, as mentioned in the issue description. We aim to find the location within the file where the mathematical operations are defined, and understand how new items can be added based on the provided hexadecimal values and their corresponding symbols. The right approach involves inspecting the `_mathtext_data.py` file, specifically looking for the `tex2uni` entity and any relevant portions that manage mathematical operators.\n\nHere are the search API calls we will use to collect the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_code_in_file(\"tex2uni\", \"_mathtext_data.py\")`: This call will help us locate the `tex2uni` within the `_mathtext_data.py` file, offering insights into its structure and how it's currently defined or used.\n\n2. `search_code(\"def tex2uni\"):`: Making this search will help to see if the definition of `tex2uni` occurs in more than one place across the codebase or if it's uniquely defined in `_mathtext_data.py`, which could affect how we decide to update it.\n\nThese actions combined should give us sufficient context to proceed with enhancing the `_mathtext_data.py` file by adding the missing mathematical operations as requested in the issue."
