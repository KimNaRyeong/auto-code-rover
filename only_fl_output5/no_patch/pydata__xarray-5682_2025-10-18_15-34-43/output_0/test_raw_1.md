Given the context of the updated requirements and the outcome of the previous attempt, let's adjust the approach to ensure compatibility with the latest standards and practices, especially concerning numpy's changes and xarray's usage. To accurately replicate the issue described while facilitating the desired outcome of raising an `AssertionError` based on the specific concern of LaTeX rendering in xarray and matplotlib, we'll need to focus on a correctly designed test case within the reproducible standalone python file, `reproducer.py`. This revision will take into account the newer numpy version's adjustments alongside ensuring the test aims precisely at the matter of LaTeX rendering.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_latex_rendering():
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import xarray as xr
     
    # Ensure matplotlib backend is set to one that is universally available and supports saving figures.
    plt.switch_backend('Agg')

    # Set up the data and LaTeX expression
    data = xr.DataArray(np.random.rand(10), dims=["x"], coords={"x": np.arange(10)})
    latex_expression = r"$\alpha > \beta$"
    data.x.attrs["long_name"] = latex_expression

    # Generate plot
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    data.plot(ax=ax)
    ax.set_title("Testing LaTeX Rendering")

    # Save plot to file for manual verification
    fig.savefig("latex_test_plot.png")

    # In a real-world scenario, we would manually inspect 'latex_test_plot.png' 
    # to confirm if LaTeX is correctly rendered. For automation purposes of this test, however,
    # we resort to checking whether matplotlib's text handling intercepts LaTeX.
    # Warning: This method does not guarantee LaTeX was rendered correctly in the image.
    
    try:
        assert latex_expression in ax.get_xlabel(), \
            "LaTeX expression not found in xlabel, indicating potential rendering issue."
        print("LaTeX expression appears to be set correctly; manual inspection of 'latex_test_plot.png' is required for confirmation.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise  # Reraising the assertion error for clarity outside of the try-except block

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_latex_rendering()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Ensuring the script exits with a non-zero exit code upon failure
```

This code attempts to more closely align with the expectations set forth while keeping in mind the nuances of testing LaTeX rendering capabilities programmatically. Do bear in mind, the true validation of LaTeX rendering success is somewhat cumbersome to achieve solely through automated testing and often necessitates visual inspection.
