Based on the provided guidelines and the requirement for a standalone Python script (`reproducer.py`) that should raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, let's directly tackle the LaTeX rendering issue within `xarray` and `matplotlib`. This time, I'll ensure the script is adapted to test specifically whether LaTeX expressions in `long_name`s of `xarray` data arrays are rendered correctly when plotted. If they are not rendered as expected, the script will raise an exception and print the stack trace as requested.

Let's create the `reproducer.py` file:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import xarray as xr
import tempfile
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_latex_rendering_in_plot():
    # Set up the data array with a complex LaTeX expression as its `long_name`
    da = xr.DataArray(np.random.rand(5), dims=["x"], coords=dict(x=range(5)))
    complex_latex_expression = r"$\frac{\alpha}{\beta} = \gamma$"
    da.attrs["long_name"] = complex_latex_expression
    
    # Plot using xarray's built-in plotting function, which should use the `long_name`
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    da.plot(ax=ax)
    
    # Save the plot to a temporary file to examine the output
    _, temp_file_path = tempfile.mkstemp(suffix=".png")
    plt.savefig(temp_file_path)
    plt.close(fig)
    
    # In this mock test, we cannot automatically verify the rendering of LaTeX within the plot image.
    # We would need to manually inspect the saved image or use image processing libraries for automation.
    # As a placeholder for actual image analysis, check if the LaTeX string appears in the file.
    with open(temp_file_path, 'rb') as img_file:
        img_data = img_file.read()
        if complex_latex_expression.encode() not in img_data:
            raise AssertionError("Complex LaTeX expression not rendered in plot.")
        else:
            print("LaTeX expression rendered. (Note: This check is not conclusive.)")
    os.remove(temp_file_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        check_latex_rendering_in_plot()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    else:
        exit(0)
```

Please note, this script does a basic check to simulate the detection of whether the LaTeX rendering issue exists. In practice, checking if LaTeX is correctly rendered in a plot programmatically is challenging without employing image processing techniques or manual inspection. The script assumes that if the complex LaTeX expression cannot be found as a byte string within the saved image file, it likely was not rendered correctlyâ€”a highly imprecise method but serves as a placeholder for demonstration purposes.
