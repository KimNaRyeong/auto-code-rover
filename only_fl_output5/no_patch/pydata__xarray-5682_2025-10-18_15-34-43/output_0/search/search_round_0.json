        "content": "To address the issue related to complex LaTeX expressions not being rendered correctly when plotting in xarray, we need to focus on the functionality that handles the plotting and the attribute setting for `long_name`. Given the information in the issue, a good starting point would be to understand how xarray integrates with matplotlib for the plotting process and how it handles attributes, specifically `long_name`, when plotting.\n\nTherefore, the following API calls will help gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the class related to plotting in xarray**: Since the issue occurs during plotting, it's crucial to identify how xarray handles plotting operations. xarray typically integrates with matplotlib for plotting functionality, so identifying the classes that facilitate this integration will be key. We can start by searching for a generic class related to plotting, as xarray might use a specific class or method to interact with matplotlib.\n\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"plot\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Search for methods involved in processing `long_name` attributes**: Given that the `long_name` attribute does not render correctly, it is important to find out how xarray processes these attributes when plotting. This involves searching for methods that are likely involved in handling or parsing `long_name`.\n\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"long_name\")\n    ```\n\n3. **Search for how xarray interacts with matplotlib for labeling**: Since the issue specifically mentions that the name does not get rendered by LaTeX in xarray plots, but does in direct matplotlib plots, understanding how xarray sets labels (like `xlabel`, `ylabel`) through its plotting interface would be useful. This requires searching for code snippets that show the integration or delegation of labeling tasks from xarray to matplotlib.\n\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"xlabel\")\n    ```\n\nThese searches should provide a solid foundation to understand the mechanisms behind the issue of LaTeX expressions not rendering correctly and allow for targeted examination of the code responsible for attribute management and plot labeling within xarray."
