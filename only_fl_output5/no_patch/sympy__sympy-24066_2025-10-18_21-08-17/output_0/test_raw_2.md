Given the requirements and the specific needs for exception handling and stack trace printing, let's create a `reproducer.py` script that faithfully reproduces the reported issue, adhering to the provided structure for capturing and displaying exceptions. This script will execute the necessary steps to trigger the reported bug, aiming to raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present or exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed.

```python
# reproducer.py
def main():
    from sympy import exp
    from sympy.physics import units
    from sympy.physics.units.systems.si import SI

    try:
        expr = units.second / (units.ohm * units.farad)
        dim = SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr)[1]

        # Check if the dimension is mistakenly considered non-dimensionless.
        # This assertion should pass, but due to the bug, the test might fail later instead.
        assert SI.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(dim), "Dimension should be considered dimensionless."

        buggy_expr = 100 + exp(expr)
        # Attempt to collect factor and dimension of an expression that should be dimensionless.
        # This is where the bug is expected to manifest.
        SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(buggy_expr)

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # If the exception is caught, it indicates an issue is present.
        # Exiting with 1 to signal the error condition in an automated test environment.
        exit(1)
    else:
        # If the test passes without exceptions, the issue is presumably fixed.
        print("No issue detected.")
        exit(0)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script includes proper exception handling to indicate whether the issue persists. If the problem as described is reproduced successfully, the script will print the stack trace of the error, providing insight into where things went wrong, and exit with status code 1. Conversely, if the issue has been resolved and no exception is raised, the script will indicate that no issue was detected and exit with status code 0. This approach allows for clear identification of the problem's existence and aids in the debugging process.
