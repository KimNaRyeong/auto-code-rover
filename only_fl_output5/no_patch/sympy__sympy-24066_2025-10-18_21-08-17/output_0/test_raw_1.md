It appears there was a misunderstanding regarding the test's outcome from the previous response. Let's clarify the situation with an adjusted version of the `reproducer.py` script, which is intended to accurately demonstrate the presence of the reported issue and adhere to your instructions for error handling and stack trace printing.

```python
# reproducer.py
def main():
    from sympy import exp
    from sympy.physics import units
    from sympy.physics.units.systems.si import SI

    try:
        # Correct usage, expecting no issue
        correct_expr = units.second / (units.ohm * units.farad)
        factor, dim = SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(correct_expr)
        
        # This assertion should pass if the dimension is correctly identified as dimensionless
        assert SI.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(dim), "Dimension was not recognized as dimensionless."

        # Buggy usage, expecting an issue
        buggy_expr = 100 + exp(correct_expr)
        
        # This line is expected to raise ValueError which we aim to catch
        SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(buggy_expr)

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Exit with a specific code or handle accordingly
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Exiting with 1 to indicate script caught an expected issue
        exit(1)
    else:
        # If no error occurs, the script exits normally indicating the issue is fixed
        print("No issue detected.")
        exit(0)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script should now be correctly set up to run in the root directory of your project with `python3 reproducer.py`. It is designed to:

1. Validate that dimensions are handled correctly in a scenario that should pass.
2. Trigger and demonstrate the reported issue with `exp()` where the dimension is not recognized as dimensionless.
3. Use the provided function to print stack trace clearly for debugging purposes.

It exits with code 1 if the issue is present (either through an AssertionError or the specific ValueError) and code 0 if the issue is fixed.
