Place this script in the root directory of your project and execute it with `python3 reproducer.py`. The script will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is encountered, alongside printing the stack trace of the error, as instructed. If the issue is correctly handled by any updates or fixes in your environment, the script should exit with code 0, indicating that the problem is resolved or does not exist under the tested conditions.
