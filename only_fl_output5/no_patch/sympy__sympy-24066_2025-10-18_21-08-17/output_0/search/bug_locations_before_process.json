        "intended_behavior": "The `is_dimensionless` method should correctly evaluate expressions that involve mathematical functions, explicitly recognizing the result of `exp(expression)` as dimensionless, regardless of the expression's base dimensionality. This behavior requires possibly extending the `is_dimensionless` method or the underlying logic that feeds into it to interpret such expressions differently. The method might need to incorporate additional checks for mathematical functions that inherently result in dimensionless outcomes or work alongside modifications in the system that pre-processes expressions for dimensionality checks."

        "intended_behavior": "Enhancements are likely needed in the logic that preprocesses expressions for dimensionality evaluations, specifically before invoking `is_dimensionless`. This part of the code should account for the nature of specific functions like `exp`, possibly marking the result as dimensionless or converting expressions into a form that `is_dimensionless` can handle straightforwardly. This might involve intercepting expressions involving specific functions and adjusting their dimensional representation or ensuring that the dimensionality check is context-aware regarding the mathematical properties of the functions involved."
