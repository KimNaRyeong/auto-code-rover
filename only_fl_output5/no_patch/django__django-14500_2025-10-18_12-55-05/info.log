</code><intended_behavior>The `unapply_migration` method should be updated to ensure that when all migrations replaced by a squashed migration are unapplied, the squashed migration itself is also marked as unapplied in the migration history. This involves adding logic to check if the current unapplied migration is a squashed migration and then, if all the migrations it replaces are marked as unapplied, also marking the squashed migration as unapplied. This adjustment is crucial for maintaining accurate migration history and ensuring the integrity of the database schema state as understood by Django's migration system. The existing functionality for recording the unapplied status of individual migrations and handling other migration operations should be preserved, with the additional condition to account for squashed migrations' unique requirements.</intended_behavior>, <file>django/db/migrations/executor.py</file>
