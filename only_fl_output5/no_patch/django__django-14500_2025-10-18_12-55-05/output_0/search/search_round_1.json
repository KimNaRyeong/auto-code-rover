Specifically, we are interested in how migrations are tracked and how the state of squashed and replaced migrations is managed.\n\nGiven this focus, useful steps might be to look into the `MigrationExecutor` class, which might contain the logic for marking migrations as applied or unapplied, and any methods specifically related to the application or rollback (unapplying) of migrations.\n\nTherefore, the following API calls could be helpful:\n\n1. Search for the `MigrationExecutor` class to find its definition and any associated methods that might be involved in this process.\n2. Search for methods responsible for applying and unapplying migrations. Given the description of the issue, method names might involve terms like \"apply\", \"unapply\", or \"squash\".\n3. Since the issue specifically mentions the act of unapplying a squashed migration and dealing with replaced migration files, it could be beneficial to search for code snippets or methods that reference squashed migrations or the handling of migration files.\n\nBased on these considerations, the first set of API calls could be:\n\n- `search_class(\"MigrationExecutor\")`\n- `search_method(\"apply_migration\")`\n- `search_method(\"unapply_migration\")`\n- `search_code(\"squashed\")`"

        "content": "Based on the collected context, let's analyze each piece regarding the squashed migrations not being marked as unapplied appropriately.\n\n1. **MigrationExecutor Class:**\n\n   The `MigrationExecutor` class is central to applying and unapplying migrations within Django's migration system. It contains methods for both actions, including `apply_migration` and `unapply_migration`, along with other related functionalities like migration planning, state creation, and detection of applied migrations.\n\n2. **apply_migration Method:**\n\n   The `apply_migration` method forwards a migration, altering the database schema as described by the migration file. It includes provisions for faking a migration or faking the initial application of a migration. If a migration is applied successfully and is not deferred through SQL, it is recorded as applied. This method's role is to ensure that migrations that modify the database schema are applied sequentially and recorded appropriately in Django's migration history.\n\n3. **unapply_migration Method:**\n\n   The `unapply_migration` method rolls back migrations, i.e., it undoes the changes made by applying a migration. If a migration is unapplied successfully, it's recorded as unapplied. Notably, for squashed migrations, it records individual statuses for each migration it replaces. This functionality is directly related to the reported bug\u2014the unapply process must appropriately mark not only the individual migrations as unapplied but also the squashed migration if all its replaced migrations are unapplied. This suggests an issue in how replaced migrations and the squashed migration's status are managed within the system.\n\nGiven these insights:\n\n- **Relationship to the Bug:** Both `apply_migration` and `unapply_migration` methods directly interact with migrations' applied statuses. However, the `unapply_migration` method is of particular interest because it deals with the unapplying (or rollback) process of migrations, including squashed ones. The critical part of the code handling the recording of unapplied migrations, especially for squashed migrations, seems not to mark the squashed migration itself as unapplied when all its replaced migrations are unapplied.\n\n- **Intended Behavior:** When a squashed migration is unapplied, and the replaced migration files are still available, the system should also mark the squashed migration as unapplied after all replaced migrations are marked as such. This would keep the migration history consistent and accurate, reflecting the true state of the database schema and migration application history.\n\nTo address the issue, one would likely need to adjust the logic within the `unapply_migration` method to check if all migrations replaced by a squashed migration are unapplied and, if so, mark the squashed migration itself as unapplied. This might involve adjusting the conditions under which `self.recorder.record_unapplied` is called for squashed migrations or adding additional logic to handle the squashed migration's unapplied status more explicitly."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

This involves adding logic to check if the current unapplied migration is a squashed migration and then, if all the migrations it replaces are marked as unapplied, also marking the squashed migration as unapplied. This adjustment is crucial for maintaining accurate migration history and ensuring the integrity of the database schema state as understood by Django's migration system. The existing functionality for recording the unapplied status of individual migrations and handling other migration operations should be preserved, with the additional condition to account for squashed migrations' unique requirements."
