        "intended_behavior": "The method `bind_template` is where the application attempts to update the context with the return values of context processors. To resolve the issue, the intended behavior here would involve adding error handling around the `updates.update(processor(self.request))` call. Before attempting to update the `updates` dict, we should ensure that the processor's return is not `None`. If it is, the application should raise a descriptive error message pointing out which context processor is returning `None` instead of the expected value (e.g., dictionary). This check aligns with Django's aim to provide actionable error messages and aids in debugging, especially when writing or using custom context processors. A try-except block could be used to catch `TypeError` exceptions when `None` is encountered. Alternatively, a preemptive check can ensure that the return value is a dictionary or at least not `None`, with a custom error message explaining the problem if the check fails. This approach maintains existing functionality while providing clearer feedback to developers, thereby improving the development experience in line with Django's design philosophies."
