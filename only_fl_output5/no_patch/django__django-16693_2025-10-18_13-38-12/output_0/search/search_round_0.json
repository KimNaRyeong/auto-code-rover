It returned None instead.\nI suggest we do the same for context processors. If we use try/except around the updates.update() line, it will not slow down normal processing any noticeable amount, thanks to Python 3.11's \u201czero-cost\u201d exception handling: \u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3.11/whatsnew/3.11.html#misc\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gain the necessary context for the issue, I'll need to conduct a series of searches, focusing on the classes, methods, and code snippets mentioned in the issue. The error trace references Django's template rendering process, specifically files like `django/template/backends/django.py`, `django/template/base.py`, and `django/template/context.py`. Key items include the context processor execution and error handling during template rendering. Here are the API calls I plan to make:\n\n1. Search for the `render` method in the file path `django/template/backends/django.py` to understand how templates are rendered and how context is processed there. This will help us find where the error handling might be improved.\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_file(\"render\", \"django/template/backends/django.py\")\n   ```\n\n2. Search for the `render` method within the `django/template/base.py` file to explore how context binding occurs during the rendering process. This function seems to be near the traceback's failure point.\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_file(\"render\", \"django/template/base.py\")\n   ```\n\n3. Investigate the `bind_template` method within the `django/template/context.py` file since the error mentions issues around context binding and `TypeError` being raised from this area.\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_file(\"bind_template\", \"django/template/context.py\")\n   ```\n   \n4. Look for the usage of `updates.update(processor(self.request))` within `django/template/context.py` to identify where the problematic context processor's output is being handled.\n   ```python\n   search_code_in_file(\"updates.update(processor(self.request))\", \"django/template/context.py\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of the relevant parts of the Django framework related to the issue, making it easier to craft an appropriate fix for improving error handling with context processors."
