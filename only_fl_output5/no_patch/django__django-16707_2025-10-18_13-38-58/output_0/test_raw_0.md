Make sure to have Django installed and appropriately configured in your project before running this script. This script specifically checks for the TypeError that would occur when executing `str(DateField().input_formats)` due to `input_formats` being a list and not a string. If the exception is caught, it prints a detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function and raises an `AssertionError`. This design ensures it will clearly indicate when the issue is present based on the original problem description.
