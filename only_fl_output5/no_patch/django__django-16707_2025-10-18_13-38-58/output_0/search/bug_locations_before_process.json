        "intended_behavior": "Since the issue arises from the inability of Python's default `__str__` method to handle the list type of the `DateField.input_formats` attribute directly, the intended behavior at this location is to properly handle the string representation of `input_formats`. To resolve the issue while preserving the existing functionality, a custom `__str__` method should be implemented within the `DateField` class. This method would intelligently convert the `input_formats` list into a human-readable string format. The implementation should ensure that it does not affect the primary functionality of the `DateField` or its parent class methods. The custom `__str__` method could iterate over the `input_formats` list and join the elements into a single string, perhaps separated by commas or new lines, to ensure it is both readable and correctly handled as a string by Python's print function. This resolution maintains compatibility with existing functionalities of Django forms by only modifying the string representation of the `input_formats` attribute, used primarily for debugging or logging purposes, without affecting how dates are parsed, validated, or displayed in the actual form fields."
