        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue, we should start by examining the `DateField` class from django.forms.fields, as well as the `__str__` method that could be causing the error when trying to print `DateField().input_formats`.\n\nThe following API calls would be ideal to start our investigation:\n\n1. `search_class(\"DateField\")`: This will help us find the file or files where the `DateField` class is defined. Knowing the exact location of this class is crucial for understanding how `input_formats` is implemented and potentially modified or accessed.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__str__\", \"DateField\")`: With this, we aim to find how the `__str__` method is implemented within the `DateField` class. Since the issue mentions that using `__str__` fails, it's essential to see how this method handles the `input_formats` attribute or if it's not properly implemented for this case.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__repr__\", \"DateField\")`: Given that `__repr__` works as expected, examining its implementation could provide clues on how to properly implement or fix the `__str__` method for `DateField`. Comparing both could reveal why one works and the other doesn't, especially in handling the `input_formats` attribute.\n\nWith the results from these API calls, we should have a better understanding of the issue and be equipped to suggest or implement a potential fix."
