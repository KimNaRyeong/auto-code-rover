Knowing the exact location of this class is crucial for understanding how `input_formats` is implemented and potentially modified or accessed.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__str__\", \"DateField\")`: With this, we aim to find how the `__str__` method is implemented within the `DateField` class. Since the issue mentions that using `__str__` fails, it's essential to see how this method handles the `input_formats` attribute or if it's not properly implemented for this case.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__repr__\", \"DateField\")`: Given that `__repr__` works as expected, examining its implementation could provide clues on how to properly implement or fix the `__str__` method for `DateField`. Comparing both could reveal why one works and the other doesn't, especially in handling the `input_formats` attribute.\n\nWith the results from these API calls, we should have a better understanding of the issue and be equipped to suggest or implement a potential fix."

        "content": "Given the results from the API calls and analyzing the context provided:\n\n1. **Analysis of `DateField` in `django/forms/fields.py`:**\n   - This part of the code defines a class `DateField` which inherits from `BaseTemporalField`. It sets a default widget, `DateInput`, and defines `input_formats` as a lazy-loaded format string using `formats.get_format_lazy(\"DATE_INPUT_FORMATS\")`.\n   - The relationship with the bug is crucial since the `input_formats` attribute is directly mentioned in the issue description. The issue occurs when attempting to print this attribute using `__str__`, but not when using `__repr__`. Since there seems to be no custom `__str__` or `__repr__` method for this class, the error likely stems from the default Python object string representation behavior not handling the `input_formats` list attribute as expected.\n   - The intended behavior, according to the issue description, would be to allow for a string representation (`__str__`) of the `input_formats` without raising a TypeError. Since `input_formats` is a list, it seems the default `__str__` method is not converting it to a string appropriately for printing.\n\n2. **No `__str__` or `__repr__` Methods Found in `DateField`:**\n   - The absence of custom `__str__` or `__repr__` methods in the `DateField` class means that the default Python implementations are used. By default, `__str__` calls `__repr__` if it is not defined, but since printing a list directly (the type of `input_formats`) raises a TypeError when `__str__` is expected to return a string, this leads to the encountered issue.\n   - The intended behavior, therefore, would involve implementing a `__str__` method for the `DateField` class that properly handles the `input_formats` attribute, converting it into a string representation that can be printed without errors.\n\nGiven these points, a potential solution would be to implement a custom `__str__` method within the `DateField` class in `django/forms/fields.py` that ensures `input_formats` can be represented as a string. Alternatively, ensuring external code converts `input_formats` to a string before printing could mitigate the issue, but the former solution offers a more encapsulated and reusable fix.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nTo formulate a patch, I would proceed to:\n- Propose implementing a custom `__str__` method in the `DateField` class that handles the `input_formats` list elegantly, potentially joining the formats into a single string or providing a more descriptive output about its contents.\n- Ensure this custom `__str__` method maintains compatibility with any existing uses or expectations within Django's form handling."

This method would intelligently convert the `input_formats` list into a human-readable string format. The implementation should ensure that it does not affect the primary functionality of the `DateField` or its parent class methods.\n   - The custom `__str__` method could iterate over the `input_formats` list and join the elements into a single string, perhaps separated by commas or new lines, to ensure it is both readable and correctly handled as a string by Python's print function.\n   - This resolution maintains compatibility with existing functionalities of Django forms by only modifying the string representation of the `input_formats` attribute, used primarily for debugging or logging purposes, without affecting how dates are parsed, validated, or displayed in the actual form fields."
