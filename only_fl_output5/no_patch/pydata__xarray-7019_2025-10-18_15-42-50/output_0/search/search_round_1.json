        "content": "<issue>Alternative parallel execution frameworks in xarray\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?\nSince early on the project xarray has supported wrapping `dask.array` objects in a first-class manner. However recent work on flexible array wrapping has made it possible to wrap all sorts of array types (and with #6804 we should support wrapping any array that conforms to the [array API standard](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/index.html)).\nCurrently though the only way to parallelize array operations with xarray \"automatically\" is to use dask. (You could use [xarray-beam](https://github.com/google/xarray-beam) or other options too but they don't \"automatically\" generate the computation for you like dask does.)\nWhen dask is the only type of parallel framework exposing an array-like API then there is no need for flexibility, but now we have nascent projects like [cubed](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed) to consider too. @tomwhite\n### Describe the solution you'd like\nRefactor the internals so that dask is one option among many, and that any newer options can plug in in an extensible way.\nIn particular cubed deliberately uses the same API as `dask.array`, exposing:\n1) the methods needed to conform to the array API standard\n2) a `.chunk` and `.compute` method, which we could dispatch to\n3) dask-like functions to create computation graphs including [`blockwise`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/400dc9adcf21c8b468fce9f24e8d4b8cb9ef2f11/cubed/core/ops.py#L43), [`map_blocks`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/400dc9adcf21c8b468fce9f24e8d4b8cb9ef2f11/cubed/core/ops.py#L221), and [`rechunk`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/main/cubed/primitive/rechunk.py)\nI would like to see xarray able to wrap any array-like object which offers this set of methods / functions, and call the corresponding version of that method for the correct library (i.e. dask vs cubed) automatically.\nThat way users could try different parallel execution frameworks simply via a switch like\n```python\nds.chunk(**chunk_pattern, manager=\"dask\")\n```\nand see which one works best for their particular problem.\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\nIf we leave it the way it is now then xarray will not be truly flexible in this respect.\nAny library can wrap (or subclass if they are really brave) xarray objects to provide parallelism but that's not the same level of flexibility.\n### Additional context\n[cubed repo](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed)\n[PR](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/6804) about making xarray able to wrap objects conforming to the new [array API standard](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/index.html)\ncc @shoyer @rabernat @dcherian @keewis\n</issue>"

Specifically, we need to look into how xarray wraps `dask.array` objects, and how chunking and computation are currently handled.

        "content": "Analyzing the results from the search API calls gives us a detailed picture of how `dask.array` is integrated within xarray and where changes might be necessary to support alternative parallel execution frameworks, such as cubed.\n\n### Analyzing `dask.array` Usage\n- The widespread appearance of `dask.array` across various files suggests a deep and pervasive integration of Dask within xarray. This integration is present in core components (`xarray/core`), backend file handling (`xarray/backends`), and even utility functions (`xarray/util`). Understanding the specific roles these references play is crucial for refactoring efforts. \n- Key areas like variable manipulation (`variable.py`), dataset operations (`dataset.py`), and data array processing (`dataarray.py`) are highlighted as significant points of interaction with Dask. This insight aligns with the expectation that any efforts to abstract the parallel computation backend will need to focus on these components.\n\n### Analysis of `chunk` Method\n- The `chunk` method's presence in `variable.py`, `dataarray.py`, and `dataset.py` matches the requirement to enable chunking operations across the main xarray data structures. \n- Given the issue's context, these implementations likely assume dask arrays as their primary target for chunking operations. To support a more flexible backend, these methods would need to be abstracted or extended to identify and delegate to the appropriate parallel execution framework (like dask or cubed). \n\n### Analysis of `compute` Method\n- As with `chunk`, the `compute` method found across `variable.py`, `dataarray.py`, and `dataset.py` suggests a centralized role in finalizing computations and converting them from lazy to eager evaluation. \n- The relationship to the issue is direct: to enable true backend flexibility, xarray must be able to invoke compute operations in a way that is agnostic to the underlying parallel computation library. This means abstracting compute calls to work with any compatible backend.\n\n### Missing `blockwise` and `rechunk`\n- The absence of `blockwise` and `rechunk` methods in the search results indicates that xarray does not currently provide custom implementations for these operations, potentially relying on dask's implementations directly.\n- This discovery prompts a reconsideration of how such methods can be introduced or abstracted within xarray to support other backends like cubed, which claims dask-like functionality. It might involve creating wrapper functions or interface definitions in xarray that can route to the corresponding methods of the active backend.\n\n### Analysis of `map_blocks` Method\n- Finding `map_blocks` in `dataarray.py`, `parallel.py`, and `dataset.py` suggests that xarray already has some level of abstraction for applying block-wise operations on data structures. This could serve as a model for integrating other methods like `blockwise` or `chunk`.\n- Given the issue's context, the current usage of `map_blocks` may be tailored to dask but indicates a pattern that could be expanded to more dynamically target the functions of other parallel computing frameworks.\n\n### Next Steps for Analysis\nGiven the absence of direct hits for `blockwise` and `rechunk`, further investigation is needed. A logical next step could be to review how `map_blocks` is implemented and used in xarray to glean insights on potential abstraction strategies. This might involve:\n- `search_code_in_file(\"map_blocks\", \"xarray/core/parallel.py\")` to examine how xarray abstracts or interacts with parallel backend libraries for block-wise operations.\n- Revisiting the list of files with `dask.array` references to identify any patterns or utility functions that facilitate the current dask integration, such as the functions in `xarray/core/dask_array_ops.py` or `xarray/core/computation.py`, could offer a blueprint for extending support to cubed or similar frameworks.\n\nBy examining these integration points and abstractions, we can outline a strategy for encapsulating parallel execution logic in a manner that supports easy extension or replacement with alternative frameworks, addressing the core request of the issue."

Bug Locations:\n   \n   - **Location 1:**\n     - File: `xarray/core/variable.py`\n     - Intended Behavior: Refactor the `chunk` and `compute` methods within this file to abstract the logic that currently assumes Dask arrays as the target for these operations. Implement an interface or dispatch mechanism that can dynamically identify and use the appropriate methods from the backend specified by the user (e.g., Dask, Cubed, etc.), while preserving the current functionality when the Dask backend is used.\n   \n   - **Location 2:**\n     - File: `xarray/core/dataarray.py`\n     - Intended Behavior: Similar to `variable.py`, refactor `chunk`, `compute`, and `map_blocks` methods in `DataArray` to use an abstracted backend interface. This should allow these methods to operate not just with Dask but with other compatible backends, enabling parallel computation without direct dependency on Dask.\n   \n   - **Location 3:**\n     - File: `xarray/core/dataset.py`\n     - Intended Behavior: Update the `chunk`, `compute`, and `map_blocks` methods for the `Dataset` class, ensuring they conform to an abstracted approach that facilitates backend flexibility. Ensure that the dataset operations can be delegated to the corresponding backend library's methods dynamically, based on a user-specified or configured option.\n   \n   - **Location 4:**\n     - File: `xarray/core/parallel.py`\n     - Class: (New utility class/methods to be added)\n     - Intended Behavior: Develop a new utility class or set of functions within this file to serve as the backend abstraction layer. This layer would perform the dynamic resolution of backend-specific operations such as `chunk`, `compute`, `blockwise`, and potentially `rechunk`. It would identify the current backend based on the configuration and delegate operations to the appropriate library methods, serving as a single point of backend management within xarray.\n\nThese locations and intended behaviors target the core of the issue: enabling xarray to use alternative parallel execution frameworks in addition to Dask. By refactoring these parts of the code to abstract the computation backend, xarray could support a wider range of parallel computation libraries, enhancing its flexibility and utility for users with different computational requirements or preferences."
