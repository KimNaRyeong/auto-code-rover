        "content": "<issue>Alternative parallel execution frameworks in xarray\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?\nSince early on the project xarray has supported wrapping `dask.array` objects in a first-class manner. However recent work on flexible array wrapping has made it possible to wrap all sorts of array types (and with #6804 we should support wrapping any array that conforms to the [array API standard](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/index.html)).\nCurrently though the only way to parallelize array operations with xarray \"automatically\" is to use dask. (You could use [xarray-beam](https://github.com/google/xarray-beam) or other options too but they don't \"automatically\" generate the computation for you like dask does.)\nWhen dask is the only type of parallel framework exposing an array-like API then there is no need for flexibility, but now we have nascent projects like [cubed](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed) to consider too. @tomwhite\n### Describe the solution you'd like\nRefactor the internals so that dask is one option among many, and that any newer options can plug in in an extensible way.\nIn particular cubed deliberately uses the same API as `dask.array`, exposing:\n1) the methods needed to conform to the array API standard\n2) a `.chunk` and `.compute` method, which we could dispatch to\n3) dask-like functions to create computation graphs including [`blockwise`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/400dc9adcf21c8b468fce9f24e8d4b8cb9ef2f11/cubed/core/ops.py#L43), [`map_blocks`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/400dc9adcf21c8b468fce9f24e8d4b8cb9ef2f11/cubed/core/ops.py#L221), and [`rechunk`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/main/cubed/primitive/rechunk.py)\nI would like to see xarray able to wrap any array-like object which offers this set of methods / functions, and call the corresponding version of that method for the correct library (i.e. dask vs cubed) automatically.\nThat way users could try different parallel execution frameworks simply via a switch like\n```python\nds.chunk(**chunk_pattern, manager=\"dask\")\n```\nand see which one works best for their particular problem.\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\nIf we leave it the way it is now then xarray will not be truly flexible in this respect.\nAny library can wrap (or subclass if they are really brave) xarray objects to provide parallelism but that's not the same level of flexibility.\n### Additional context\n[cubed repo](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed)\n[PR](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/6804) about making xarray able to wrap objects conforming to the new [array API standard](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/index.html)\ncc @shoyer @rabernat @dcherian @keewis\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how xarray currently integrates with dask and identifies areas that require refactoring to support alternative parallel execution frameworks like cubed. Specifically, we need to look into how xarray wraps `dask.array` objects, and how chunking and computation are currently handled. This would involve examining how `chunk`, `compute`, and potentially other methods related to parallel execution are managed. \n\nGiven the requirements from the issue, the following API calls could provide relevant context:\n\n1. Look into where and how `dask.array` objects are being wrapped or utilized within xarray. Since xarray is designed to work closely with dask, there might be multiple points of integration. We can start by searching for key phrases or method calls that are likely involved in this process.\n   - `search_code(\"dask.array\")` to find references to dask arrays across the codebase, which could help us identify where the integration happens.\n\n2. Given that `chunk`, `compute`, `blockwise`, `map_blocks`, and `rechunk` are mentioned as key operations that need to be generic to support frameworks like cubed, we could search for these to understand their current implementation or usage.\n   - `search_method(\"chunk\")` to find how chunking is currently implemented or called.\n   - `search_method(\"compute\")` to understand how computations are triggered and handled.\n   - `search_method(\"blockwise\")` to see if it's directly used or referred to within xarray, which might be more relevant if xarray defines or overrides these operations for integration with dask.\n   - `search_method(\"map_blocks\")` to identify usages that might be specific to dask, or designed in a way that assumes dask's API.\n   - `search_method(\"rechunk\")` to explore how rechunking is approached, which is crucial for parallel computation optimizations.\n\nThese calls should provide a good starting point to understand the current integration with dask and identify where the code can be refactored to support an abstract, plug-and-play architecture for different parallel execution frameworks, thereby addressing the feature request described in the issue."
