See the attached log: [sphinx-err-325ndteh.log](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/files/4842672/sphinx-err-325ndteh.log)\n**To Reproduce**\n```\n$ git https://github.com/perrygoy/screenpy.git\n$ cd screenpy/docs\n$ python -m venv env\n$ source env/bin/activate\n$ pip install sphinx pyhamcrest selenium typing_extensions\n$ make html\n```\nObserve the docs command fails with a TypeError.\n**Expected behavior**\nDocs can still be built when generics are involved.\n**Your project**\nhttps://github.com/perrygoy/screenpy.git\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Mac 10.15.5 (19F101)\n- Python version: 3.7.7\n- Sphinx version: 3.1.1\n- Sphinx extensions:  sphinx.ext.autodoc, sphinx.ext.intersphinx, sphinx.ext.coverage, sphinx.ext.ifconfig, sphinx.ext.napoleon\n**Additional context**\nThis might just be me not knowing how to make Sphinx-friendly generic typing, if that's the case please let me know!\n</issue>"

        "content": "To properly address the issue described, given that it involves a `TypeError` thrown by an operation within the Autodoc extension related to handling generically-typed classes, I'd propose the following API calls to gather enough context to understand and resolve the problem:\n\n1. **search_class_in_file**: We need to inspect how generically-typed classes are implemented within the relevant project files, especially those that are causing issues with Sphinx's Autodoc. However, the issue does not specify a particular class or file, just that the problem occurs with generically-typed classes in general.\n\n2. **search_method_in_class**: Understanding how `_make_subclass` is implemented or utilized might require inspecting this method within the class causing issues or within the Autodoc extension itself. But again, specific class or method names are not provided in the issue description.\n\n3. **search_code**: Since the issue mentions a specific operation (`mock._make_subclass` attempting to concatenate a `str` to a `TypeVar`), we should search for occurrences of `mock._make_subclass` or similar code patterns that involve handling of `TypeVar` within generically-typed classes.\n\nGiven the information provided in the issue, the following are concrete API calls I would invoke:\n\n- `search_code(\"mock._make_subclass\")`\n- `search_code(\"TypeVar\")`\n\nThese searches aim to find where `mock._make_subclass` is used in the context of generic types, which could potentially lead to the `TypeError` discussed in the issue. Without more specific class, file, or method names, we start with these broad searches to narrow down the problem areas."
