This script aims to directly replicate the issue involving Sphinx's `autodoc` extension and generic-typed classes within a Python-based environment, without necessitating the explicit Sphinx build command. By invoking this script at the root directory of the specified project (`screenpy` as per the issue description), it attempts to reconstruct the documentation generation process, including the step where the error due to handling of generically-typed classes is anticipated to occur. It catches and reports the exception if it arises during the documentation building process. Conversely, upon successful completion, it confirms that the issue has been resolved, operating under a zero-exit-code protocol for normal execution and employing a non-zero exit code to signal an error state, where an `AssertionError` would signify the continued presence of the originally reported bug.
