Creating a standalone script that replicates the exact issue involving Sphinx, specifically its autodoc extension failing due to a `TypeError` with generic-typed classes, is quite nuanced. This is because the underlying issue is deeply tied to Sphinx's internal processing, which involves reading, rendering, and interpreting Python code based on its AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and typing information.

However, I will provide a script that attempts to mimic the conditions under which Sphinx's autodoc extension might fail when encountering generic-typed classes. This script will force a similar `TypeError` by directly creating a subclass from a generic type in a way that might parallel the error scenario with autodoc's handling.

Please note, this script does not invoke Sphinx or its autodoc extension directly because reproducing the exact Sphinx environment and interaction programmatically without running its full process is overly complex. Instead, it focuses on simulating the type issue.

```python
from typing import TypeVar, Generic

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

T = TypeVar('T')

class GenericClass(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, value: T):
        self.value = value

def main():
    # Attempting to mimic the failure scenario with generics
    try:
        # This operation is somewhat analogous to what might raise an error during Sphinx's documentation build process,
        # especially when Sphinx tries to mock or subclass a generic-typed class.
        
        # Directly causing TypeError by dynamically creating subclass from a generic without proper handling
        MockedClass = type('MockedClass', (GenericClass,), {})
        mock_instance = MockedClass('test')
        
        assert False, "The line should not be reached if TypeError is to be correctly triggered"
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating the simulation of the issue is successful
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An unexpected exception occurred, which does not match the simulated scenario.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this script, the direct creation of a subclass from `GenericClass` does not directly parallel the actions Sphinx's autodoc would take but aims to induce a similar type system misuse. This forced error stems from incorrectly handling Python's generic typing in a dynamic type creation scenario—a simplified parallel to what might happen internally when Sphinx attempts to document such classes without appropriate type handling.

This approach is theoretical and crafted for demonstration purposes, signaling that if the actual Sphinx issue is to be replicated exactingly, reviewing Sphinx’s source relevant to `mock._make_subclass` alongside a detailed examination of the documentation build process for the problematic generically-typed class would be essential.
