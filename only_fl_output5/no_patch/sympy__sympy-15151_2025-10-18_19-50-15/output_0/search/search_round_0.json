Given that the information about the exact class or method names isn't provided in the issue, we'll start with a generic search for methods that might be involved in rendering or pretty printing.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"pretty_print\")\n   search_method(\"render_latex\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the code handling the `indexed` term or function**: Since the issue specifically mentions \"indexed(x1, i)\" and the expected output \"x_{1,i}\", it's crucial to find where in the codebase this `indexed` function or method is handled. \n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"indexed\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls are designed to locate the relevant parts of the codebase where the issue may be originating from, by identifying how indexed expressions are handled and where the pretty printing functionality might be improved to achieve the expected behavior."
