This may involve introducing a specific case or modification within the `pretty` function for handling `Indexed` objects distinctly from other expression types, ensuring that indices are formatted in subscript notation when converted into strings. The change should preserve the function's ability to handle all other expressions as currently designed."

        "intended_behavior": "While the `IndexedBase` class itself may not require changes for this specific issue of pretty printing, ensuring that `IndexedBase` (and by extension, `Indexed` objects derived from it) includes comprehensive metadata about its indices could facilitate the pretty printing process. It is crucial, however, that any modifications or enhancements made to convey such information do not interfere with existing functionality or the primary role of `IndexedBase` in symbolically representing structures equivalent to arrays. Any change here would be to enrich the interface between `IndexedBase` objects and the pretty printing subsystem, possibly by making index information more readily accessible or interpretable by the printing logic."
