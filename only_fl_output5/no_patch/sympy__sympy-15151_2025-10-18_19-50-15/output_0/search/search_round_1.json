The method considers several parameters to influence the representation, such as line wrapping, the number of columns, and whether to use Unicode.\n\n   - **Relationship to the bug:**\n     Since the issue involves the expectation of a specific graphical representation of an indexed expression (specifically `x_{1,i}`), this method could be directly related. The issue likely arises from how the `pretty_print` function handles or fails to handle indexed expressions as expected by the user.\n\n   - **Intended behavior:**\n     Given the issue description, the intended behavior would involve modifying or ensuring that the `pretty_print` function can accurately interpret and display indexed expressions in the LaTeX-like syntax or equivalent pretty format that the user expects.\n\n2. **Occurrences of `indexed` in the Codebase**:\n\n   - **What does this part of the code do?**\n     These snippets indicate where the concept or feature of indexed expressions is used or supported across the SymPy library. The `indexed` occurrences span multiple modules, suggesting a foundational or widely utilized functionality likely involved in symbolic mathematics, matrix operations, and other mathematical constructs.\n\n   - **Relationship to the bug:**\n     The descriptions of where `indexed` is found, particularly in `sympy/tensor/indexed.py` and potentially in printing or code generation modules, highlight areas of the code that might be responsible for how indexed expressions are represented internally and how they are converted into a string or pretty-printed output. This connection suggests that the fix might involve adjusting how indexed expressions are rendered into their symbolic or pretty-printed form.\n\n   - **Intended behavior:**\n     The parts of the code dealing with `indexed` expressions should ensure that when such expressions are encountered, they are processed or transformed in a way that respects the expected mathematical notation or pretty-printed format. This might include special handling rules for indexed expressions during the pretty print process to match the `x_{1,i}` expectation.\n\nGiven this analysis, moving forward would involve focusing on how `pretty_print` handles `indexed` expressions specifically. A potential next step could be to explore the implementation within `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` to see how expressions are processed and to look into `sympy/tensor/indexed.py` to understand how indexed expressions are defined and represented internally. This would involve inspecting the implementation details and the logic that leads to the formatting mentioned in the issue."

Additionally, examining the implementation in `sympy/tensor/indexed.py` might provide insights into how indexed expressions are represented and any special consideration they require during pretty printing. Thus, further exploration into these areas is recommended.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_file(\"pretty\", \"sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py\")\n   search_class(\"IndexedBase\", \"sympy/tensor/indexed.py\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Where are bug locations**:\n\n   Since the requested additional context has not yet been provided, based on the current understanding, the following can be considered potential bug locations along with a description of the intended behavior modifications to resolve the issue:\n   \n   - **Location 1**: \n     - **File**: `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`\n     - **Class/Method**: `pretty_print` function\n     - **Intended Behavior**: Modify or extend the `pretty_print` function to correctly interpret and display indexed expressions in a mathematically accurate notation (`x_{1,i}`). This includes detecting expressions that are indexed and applying the correct formatting rules to represent these as expected in the issue description while preserving existing functionality for all other types of expressions.\n   \n   - **Location 2**: \n     - **File**: `sympy/tensor/indexed.py`\n     - **Class/Method**: Potentially within the `IndexedBase` class or related classes/methods handling indexed expressions\n     - **Intended Behavior**: Ensure the internal representation of indexed expressions includes metadata or structure that clearly identifies the indexed parts (base and indices) in a way that can be easily consumed by the pretty printing logic to generate the desired output. This might not require change if the representation is already sufficient but informing the `pretty_print` function on handling this structure correctly is essential.\n\nThese locations and intended behaviors suggest a two-pronged approach: ensuring the data structure for indexed expressions is conducive to pretty printing and modifying the pretty print logic to leverage this structure effectively."
