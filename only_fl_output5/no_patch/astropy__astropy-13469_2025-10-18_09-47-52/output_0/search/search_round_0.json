For a single Table, this may be odd, but not necessarily incorrect. And for a list of Tables, to be converted to an array, this may be helpful.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving this issue, I will need to find where the `__array__` method of the `Table` class is implemented in the Astropy codebase. This is crucial for understanding how Astropy Tables are converted to NumPy arrays and to identify where the check that raises the `ValueError` for non-`None` `dtype` is occurring. Therefore, the following API calls will provide the required context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Table\")` - This will help in locating the file or files where the `Table` class is defined.\n2. `search_method(\"__array__\")` - This call will help to find where the `__array__` methods are defined in the codebase, which is relevant since the issue occurs during an array conversion that likely involves this method."
