        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather sufficient context about how `wspace` and `hspace` are supposed to work within `Figure.subfigures`. Based on the given issue, the following API calls will provide the requisite information:\n\n1. **Search for the `Figure` Class**: To understand how the `Figure` class is implemented, especially the `subfigures` method where the issue is reportedly occurring.\n    - `search_class(\"Figure\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `subfigures` Method in the `Figure` Class**: Since the issue specifically mentions the `subfigures` method, finding this method will help understand its current implementation and how `wspace` and `hspace` are handled.\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"subfigures\", \"Figure\")`\n\n3. **Search for Code Implementing `wspace` and `hspace` Handling**: This will give insight into how these parameters are used within the class/method, revealing if there's an obvious omission or error in their usage.\n    - `search_code(\"wspace\")`\n    - `search_code(\"hspace\")`\n\n4. **Get Code Around the Expected Outcome URL**: The issue mentions a link to a specific part of the code in the `figure.py` file which seems relevant to the expected behavior. We should examine the code around this part to understand the intended use of `wspace` and `hspace`.\n    - `get_code_around_line(\"lib/matplotlib/figure.py\", 1552, 5)`\n\nThese actions will collectively help in forming a comprehensive context around how `subfigures` should handle `wspace` and `hspace`, any existing implementation details, and how it's currently behaving versus the expected outcome."
