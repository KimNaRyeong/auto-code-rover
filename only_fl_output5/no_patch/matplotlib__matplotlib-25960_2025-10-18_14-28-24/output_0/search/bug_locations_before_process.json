        "intended_behavior": "The `subfigures` method needs to correctly interpret and apply the `wspace` and `hspace` parameters to adjust the whitespace between generated subfigures. This involves modifying the layout configuration so that the spacing inputs (`wspace` and `hspace`) are factored into the arrangement of the subfigures within a parent figure. The existing mechanics of subfigure creation should be preserved, with the additional functionality of spacing adjustments based on these parameters. This requires ensuring that the `subfigures` method processes the `wspace` and `hspace` arguments correctly and that these parameters influence the layout engine's space allocation between subfigures. The absence of this behavior might be causing the reported bug, where changes to `wspace` and `hspace` have no effect. To resolve the issue, it may involve invoking or adjusting layout engine configurations specifically for `subfigures` that account for these spacing parameters, ensuring that user-specified values are respected and visibly affect the display of subfigures."
