It turns out it's possible with just a few changes.\nBecause it's not really possible to configure the cached template loader I did have to base this patch on the fix for #25788. Enabling autoreloading for the cached template loader would work like this:\nTEMPLATES = [{\n'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',\n'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],\n'APP_DIRS': True\n'OPTIONS': {\n'cache_templates': True,\n'autoreload': DEBUG\n}\n}]\n</issue>"

        "content": "To effectively resolve the issue related to implementing autoreload behavior for the cached template loader, we need to gather specific code contexts encompassing classes or methods managing templates, caching mechanisms, and the configuration of template engines in Django. Here are the API calls that could help:\n\n1. **Search for Classes Managing Templates**:\n   Given that the issue is about templates in Django, classes such as `DjangoTemplates` might be relevant. The configuration snippet provided in the issue suggests involvement of a backend capable of handling templates, caching, and potentially autoreload features.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"DjangoTemplates\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for Template Loading Mechanisms**:\n   The issue description suggests that the implementation might rely on a loader or a mechanism to manage cached templates. Identifying such a loader or its methods could be crucial. Django typically uses loaders for template handling, so identifying relevant classes or methods will provide insight into where modifications for autoreload might be applied.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"BaseLoader\")\n   search_method(\"get_template\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for Configuration Related Code**:\n   The issue outlines a specific configuration setup for enabling cache and autoreload. It would be important to find where such configurations are parsed or utilized within the Django backend. This might not correspond directly to a singular method or class and may involve multiple components for the TEMPLATES setting processing.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_code(\"'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates'\")\n   search_code(\"'cache_templates'\")\n   search_code(\"autoreload\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Investigate Caching Mechanisms**:\n   Since caching is a fundamental part of the issue, understanding how Django handles template caching would be essential. This includes identifying any extant mechanisms for cache invalidation, which autoreload functionality could tie into or extend.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"CacheLoader\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"load_template\", \"CacheLoader\")\n   ```\n\n5. **Explore Development Server Reload Mechanisms**:\n   Autoreloading generally involves detecting file changes and restarting the server or reloading the files in question. Identifying the part of Django that handles autoreloading for other aspects, like code changes, could provide a starting point for implementing similar behavior for template changes.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"autoreload\")\n   ```\n\nEach of these calls aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how Django manages templates, caches, and the autoreload mechanism, which is crucial for developing the required patch to add autoreload behavior to the cached template loader without needing a server restart after every template change."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides us with a foundation to better understand the structure and functionality relevant to implementing autoreload behavior for the cached template loader in Django. Let's dissect the findings:\n\n### Analysis of `DjangoTemplates` Class\n**Found in:** `django/template/backends/django.py` and `django/forms/renderers.py`\n\n1. **What it does:** The `DjangoTemplates` class in `django/template/backends/django.py` appears to be the primary backend for handling template rendering within Django. It inherits from `BaseEngine`, providing methods for various template operations like loading (`get_template`), rendering from strings (`from_string`), and obtaining template tag libraries. The class found in `django/forms/renderers.py` seems to leverage the backend for form rendering specifically, indicating that `DjangoTemplates` serves as a versatile component in template management.\n\n2. **Relation to the bug:** Since the issue targets enhancing the `DjangoTemplates` backend with autoreload capabilities when using a cached template loader, understanding this class is crucial. It's where the integration of caching and possibly autoreload triggers should be considered or modified.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:** In the context of the issue, the intended behavior would be to adapt `DjangoTemplates` (especially its method for retrieving templates, `get_template`) to recognize changes in template files and reload them as needed when caching is active, without restarting the development server.\n\n### Absence of `BaseLoader` and `CacheLoader`\nThe API call to find these classes yielded no results, suggesting either these classes do not exist by the given names or the caching/loading mechanism is implemented differently. This outcome indicates the need to explore alternative approaches or mechanisms within Django that facilitate template loading and caching.\n\n### `get_template` Method(s)\n**Found across several files:** Indicating that different backends and loaders have their implementations of template loading.\n\n1. **What it does:** These methods are responsible for retrieving and possibly compiling templates for rendering. Each backend or loader can implement this differently, affecting how templates are cached and reused.\n\n2. **Relation to the bug:** Given the issue aims at modifying how caching interacts with `get_template` functionality, identifying all variations of this method across different backends or loaders is critical for implementing a cohesive autoreload feature.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:** Modifications to `get_template` implementations, particularly in the context of caching (e.g., `loaders/cached.py`), should include checks for template changes that trigger a reload of the cached template if autoreload is enabled.\n\n### Absence of Direct References to Caching Configuration\nThe failure to retrieve direct references to `'cache_templates'` in the codebase implies that this aspect might be implicitly handled or configured differently. It might be necessary to look into how Django's settings and options are processed and applied, especially for template backends.\n\n### Autoreload References\n**Found in:** Multiple files, including `django/utils/autoreload.py` and `runserver.py`\n\n1. **What it does:** These snippets are likely part of the development server's mechanism that watches for file changes to trigger reloads. `django/utils/autoreload.py` suggests it contains the core functionality for monitoring file changes.\n\n2. **Relation to the bug:** The existing autoreload mechanisms might offer a basis or hook for extending autoreload functionality to template files when cached.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:** Integrating with or extending these autoreload mechanisms to detect changes in template files and invalidate the cache as necessary when `autoreload` is enabled could be a potential approach to addressing the issue.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps could involve:\n\n- Investigating how Django processes template settings and options. (`TEMPLATES`)\n- Further exploration of how Django's current autoreload mechanism works to identify potential integration points or methods that could be adapted for template autoreload.\n  \n  Therefore, more specific code searches focusing on settings processing and a deeper look into `django/utils/autoreload.py` and `django/template/loaders/cached.py` might shed additional light on potential implementation strategies."

Constructing additional search API calls can provide critical insights into these areas:\n\n- Explore how Django processes template settings:\n  ```python\n  search_code(\"TEMPLATES = [\")\n  search_method(\"get_template\")\n  ```\n\n- Deep dive into the autoreload mechanism to understand potential integration points for templates:\n  ```python\n  search_code_in_file(\"autoreload\", \"django/utils/autoreload.py\")\n  ```\n\n- Since the `cached.py` file seems relevant due to its potential role in caching templates, let's gather more context around it, especially analyzing how caching is performed and investigating possibilities for invalidating cache entries upon template modification:\n  ```python\n  search_method_in_file(\"get_template\", \"django/template/loaders/cached.py\")\n  ```\n\n2. **Where are bug locations:**\n\nGiven the information we have so far, the following location(s) appear to be particularly relevant for addressing the issue, even though we've identified a need for more context above:\n\n### Location 1: \n- **File:** django/template/backends/django.py\n- **Class:** DjangoTemplates\n- **Method:** get_template\n- **Intended Behavior:** This method should be adapted to include an autoreload check if the `autoreload` option is set to `True` in the `TEMPLATES` configuration. This could involve verifying the last modification timestamp of the requested template file against the cached version. If a discrepancy is noticed (the file has been modified since being cached), the cached entry should be invalidated, and the template reloaded from the file system. This approach should preserve dynamic reloading of templates during development without requiring a restart of the server.\n\n### Location 2: \n- **File:** django/template/loaders/cached.py\n- **Intended Behavior:** Introduce a method or modify existing caching mechanisms to check for file changes before returning a cached template. This could involve integrating with Django's existing `autoreload` mechanisms to ensure that template changes are detected in real-time, thus invalidating the cache entry and prompting a reload. The objective is to enable a seamless development experience by allowing instantaneous reflection of template changes without impacting the performance benefit offered by caching in a development context.\n\nThese intended modifications aim to extend the current functionality by incorporating a development-friendly feature of template autoreload, all while ensuring that the original purpose and efficiency of the cached template loading are preserved intact."
