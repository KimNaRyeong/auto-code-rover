If so, invalidate the cached template and reload it from its source. This ensures that any changes made to the template are reflected immediately without needing to restart the server, enhancing the development experience. To efficiently implement this, a mechanism for tracking the modification times and comparing them upon each template load request is needed. This behavior should be controlled by the `autoreload` option such that it is only active in development environments or when explicitly enabled to avoid any performance impact in production."

        "intended_behavior": "Ensure the backend's processing of the `TEMPLATES` configuration includes logic to interpret and apply the `autoreload` option. This might involve passing the `autoreload` flag down to the loader level where the template caching and loading logic can access it. Essentially, this adjustment would bridge the gap between the configuration and its practical application in template loading and caching behavior."
