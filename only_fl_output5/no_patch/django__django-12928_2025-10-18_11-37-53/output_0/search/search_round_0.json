It turns out it's possible with just a few changes.\nBecause it's not really possible to configure the cached template loader I did have to base this patch on the fix for #25788. Enabling autoreloading for the cached template loader would work like this:\nTEMPLATES = [{\n'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',\n'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],\n'APP_DIRS': True\n'OPTIONS': {\n'cache_templates': True,\n'autoreload': DEBUG\n}\n}]\n</issue>"

        "content": "To effectively resolve the issue related to implementing autoreload behavior for the cached template loader, we need to gather specific code contexts encompassing classes or methods managing templates, caching mechanisms, and the configuration of template engines in Django. Here are the API calls that could help:\n\n1. **Search for Classes Managing Templates**:\n   Given that the issue is about templates in Django, classes such as `DjangoTemplates` might be relevant. The configuration snippet provided in the issue suggests involvement of a backend capable of handling templates, caching, and potentially autoreload features.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"DjangoTemplates\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for Template Loading Mechanisms**:\n   The issue description suggests that the implementation might rely on a loader or a mechanism to manage cached templates. Identifying such a loader or its methods could be crucial. Django typically uses loaders for template handling, so identifying relevant classes or methods will provide insight into where modifications for autoreload might be applied.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"BaseLoader\")\n   search_method(\"get_template\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for Configuration Related Code**:\n   The issue outlines a specific configuration setup for enabling cache and autoreload. It would be important to find where such configurations are parsed or utilized within the Django backend. This might not correspond directly to a singular method or class and may involve multiple components for the TEMPLATES setting processing.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_code(\"'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates'\")\n   search_code(\"'cache_templates'\")\n   search_code(\"autoreload\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Investigate Caching Mechanisms**:\n   Since caching is a fundamental part of the issue, understanding how Django handles template caching would be essential. This includes identifying any extant mechanisms for cache invalidation, which autoreload functionality could tie into or extend.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"CacheLoader\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"load_template\", \"CacheLoader\")\n   ```\n\n5. **Explore Development Server Reload Mechanisms**:\n   Autoreloading generally involves detecting file changes and restarting the server or reloading the files in question. Identifying the part of Django that handles autoreloading for other aspects, like code changes, could provide a starting point for implementing similar behavior for template changes.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"autoreload\")\n   ```\n\nEach of these calls aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how Django manages templates, caches, and the autoreload mechanism, which is crucial for developing the required patch to add autoreload behavior to the cached template loader without needing a server restart after every template change."
