Certainly! Given the specific requirements for handling exceptions and the expectation for the script's behavior based on the presence or rectification of an issue, here's a `reproducer.py` tailored to this scenario:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', line=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    try:
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        from cartopy.crs import PlateCarree
        from cartopy.mpl.geoaxes import GeoAxes
        from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import AxesGrid

        fig = plt.figure()
        axes_class = (GeoAxes, dict(map_projection=PlateCarree()))
        gr = AxesGrid(fig, 111, nrows_ncols=(1, 1),
                      axes_class=axes_class)
                      
        assert False, "Expected to throw TypeError but didn't"
    except TypeError as e:
        expected_error_message = "'method' object is not subscriptable"
        if expected_error_message in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)  # Exiting with 1 because this is the scenario where the issue is reproduced
        else:
            raise  # This error is unexpected within the current issue context
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print("The issue seems to be fixed.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

This script correctly handles the specified behavior:
- It attempts to reproduce the issue and expects a `TypeError` to confirm the issue's presence.
- For all scenarios:
  - When the issue is present, it prints the stack trace and exits with code 1.
  - If the issue does not manifest (indicating the bug might be fixed or absent), it asserts false to jump to the assertion exception, printing a message indicating potential resolution, and exits with code 0.
  - Any unexpected exceptions will also print a stack trace and exit with code 1, signaling something went wrong that was not anticipated by the script.

Please note, as the initial execution scenario you provided indicated the absence of `cartopy`, it's essential to ensure all dependencies are installed in your environment before executing this script. The absence of `cartopy` or any other required library will lead to a `ModuleNotFoundError`.
