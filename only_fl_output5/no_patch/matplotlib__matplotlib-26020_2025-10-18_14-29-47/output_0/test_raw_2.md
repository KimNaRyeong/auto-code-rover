Certainly! Below is a corrected version of the `reproducer.py` file following your instructions:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    try:
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        from cartopy.crs import PlateCarree
        from cartopy.mpl.geoaxes import GeoAxes
        from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import AxesGrid

        fig = plt.figure()
        axes_class = (GeoAxes, dict(map_projection=PlateCarree()))
        gr = AxesGrid(fig, 111, nrows_ncols=(1, 1),
                      axes_class=axes_class)
                      
        # If the code reaches this point without an exception, the expected error did not occur.
        assert False, "Expected TypeError did not occur."
    except TypeError as e:
        expected_error_message = "'method' object is not subscriptable"
        if expected_error_message in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)  # Exiting with 1 because the issue was reproduced
        else:
            raise  # Re-raises unexpected TypeErrors that don't match the known issue
    except AssertionError as ae:
        # The assertion indicates the TypeError did not occur, suggesting the issue may be fixed.
        print("The issue seems to be fixed.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch all for any other unexpected exceptions
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

This script adheres to your instructions:
- It attempts to execute the buggy code snippet.
- If the specific `TypeError` described in the bug report is raised, it prints the stack trace and exits with code 1, indicating the issue was successfully reproduced.
- If there is no exception or if the assertion fails (indicating that the issue might be fixed because the expected error didn't occur), it prints a message suggesting the issue is fixed and exits with code 0.
- It properly handles any other unexpected exceptions by printing their stack trace and exiting with an error code to signal an unforeseen problem. 

Please make sure that Cartopy and Matplotlib are correctly installed in your Python environment before running this script.
