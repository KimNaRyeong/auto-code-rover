        "intended_behavior": "The method `_tick_only` is intended to toggle the visibility of tick labels and the axis label for the bottom and left axes. To resolve the issue, this method should be updated to handle both cases where `ax.axis` is a method (likely providing an interface to manipulate axes properties) and where it's a subscriptable object (dictionary-like behavior). A conditional check should be implemented to call `ax.axis` as a method if it's not subscriptable, possibly using a strategy to handle arguments in a manner consistent with the expected outcomes (e.g., manipulating visibility of tick labels and axis labels). This ensures compatibility with `GeoAxes` or any other axes class that implements `axis` as a method rather than an attribute."

        "intended_behavior": "While `GeoAxes` may not be directly \"buggy,\" an adjustment or addition could be made to ensure it behaves consistently with expectations from utilities like `_tick_only`. This could involve adding a wrapper or adapter method within `GeoAxes` that allows its `axis` method to be accessed in a manner consistent with subscriptable `axis` attributes found in other axes classes. Alternatively, ensuring that `GeoAxes` and similar classes provide a compatible interface for manipulating axis properties could also resolve the issue. This might include implementing dictionary-like access patterns or providing clear documentation and utilities for converting between the different `axis` interfaces."
