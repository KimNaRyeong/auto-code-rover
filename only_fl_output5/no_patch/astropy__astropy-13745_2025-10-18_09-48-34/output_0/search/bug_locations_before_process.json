        "intended_behavior": "This method should include a tolerance margin in the validation of latitude angles to accommodate the precision limitation of `float32` values. The tolerance could be implemented based on the precision of the input values. For instance, when dealing with `float32` values, a small tolerance could be applied to the angle limits (-90 and +90 degrees) to ensure that values very close to these limits are accepted. This change must be crafted carefully to not overly relax the validation for higher precision values like `float64`. One way to implement this could be by dynamically adjusting the tolerance based on the data type of the input angle, such as using `np.finfo(angle.dtype).resolution` to determine an appropriate tolerance level."
