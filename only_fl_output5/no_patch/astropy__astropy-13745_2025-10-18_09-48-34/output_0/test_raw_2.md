Below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` as requested. This script is designed to be placed in the root directory of the project and executed with Python 3. It endeavors to replicate the issue outlined with the `astropy.coordinates.Latitude` class not accepting a `float32` representation of pi/2. Upon encountering the specific issue, it will print a stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. It is expected to exit with a code of 0 if the issue is present (i.e., if the `AssertionError` is raised), demonstrating that the script successfully reproduces the issue as described.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from astropy.coordinates import Latitude
        import numpy as np
        
        lat = np.float32(np.pi / 2)
        Latitude(lat, 'rad')  # This line is expected to raise an exception
        
    except ValueError as e:
        # If the specific ValueError is caught, it means the issue is reproduced
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Asserting the presence of the error message in the exception to validate it's the expected issue
        assert "Latitude angle(s) must be within -90 deg <= angle <= 90 deg" in str(e), "Unexpected ValueError."
        # Exiting with 0 to signal that the reproduction of the issue was successful
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        # Catching and printing any unexpected exceptions
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Exiting with 1 to signal an incorrect reproduction attempt, hence not as expected
        exit(1)
    else:
        # If no exception is encountered, indicating a potential fix or different behavior than expected
        print("No issue detected - the script did not raise an expected ValueError.")
        # Exiting with a non-zero code to signal that the issue was not reproduced as expected
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script operates under the assumptions that:
- The environment is correctly set up with all necessary dependencies for `astropy` and `numpy`.
- Its purpose is to replicate the specific issue related to angle validation within the `astropy.coordinates.Latitude` class, particularly when using `np.float32` as the data type for the angle representation.
- It will print a detailed stack trace if the expected `ValueError` is caught, thereby aiding in the identification of the issue's source within the Astropy library's codebase.
