I understand you're looking for a corrected version of your request. Given the error output you provided earlier, which indicates a problem with the environment setup (missing `packaging` module), it's not directly related to the test script provided. However, making sure the environment is correctly set up falls outside the scope of the script itself.

For the purpose of ensuring a standalone script operates as expected (and assuming the environment issue is resolved), let's provide a corrected script version. This script assumes that your Python environment has the necessary dependencies (`astropy` and `numpy`) installed and correctly configured.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from astropy.coordinates import Latitude
        import numpy as np
        lat = np.float32(np.pi / 2)
        Latitude(lat, 'rad')
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert "Latitude angle(s) must be within -90 deg <= angle <= 90 deg" in str(e), "The issue is not reproduced."
        raise SystemExit(0)  # Exit with 0 to indicate the issue is present as expected.
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise SystemExit(1)  # Exit with 1 to indicate an unexpected error.
    else:
        print("No issue detected - the script did not raise an expected ValueError.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script is designed to directly address the issue you've encountered with `astropy.coordinates.Latitude` and the representation of `np.float32(np.pi / 2)`.

Before running the script, ensure that you've resolved any environment setup issues, such as installing the `packaging` module or any other dependencies that may be missing or misconfigured. You can typically resolve such issues by ensuring your environment is correctly set up (e.g., use of a virtual environment, correct installation of dependencies via `pip` or another package manager).
