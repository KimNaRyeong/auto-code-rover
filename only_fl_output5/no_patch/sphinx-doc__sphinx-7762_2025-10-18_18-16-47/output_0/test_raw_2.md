Given your request for a Python script that explicitly reproduces the issue described, let's write `reproducer.py`. This script will use the `requests` library to make HTTP `HEAD` requests to the specified URL with two different sets of headers: one that mimics the current Sphinx `linkcheck` behavior (which should reproduce the `406 Not Acceptable` error) and one without the `Accept` header, expected to succeed. 

Additionally, we'll include the error handling and stack trace printing as you requested. If an `AssertionError` is caught, indicating the test has reproduced the problem (i.e., a `406` response), it will print the stack trace. Otherwise, if the test catches no errors, meaning the issue may have been fixed, it will exit with code `0`.

```python
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_url_with_headers(url, headers):
    response = requests.head(url, headers=headers)
    return response.status_code

def main():
    url = "https://github.com/cherrypy/cheroot/workflows/Test%20suite/badge.svg"
    headers_with_accept = {"Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8"}
    headers_without_accept = {}  # Let's simulate a request without the Accept header
    
    status_with_accept = check_url_with_headers(url, headers_with_accept)
    status_without_accept = check_url_with_headers(url, headers_without_accept)
    
    try:
        # Expect a 406 response due to the Accept header issue
        assert status_with_accept == 406, "Expected 406 Not Acceptable status with Accept header"
        
        # Expecting a successful response when the Accept header is not set
        assert status_without_accept == 200, "Expected 200 OK status without Accept header"
        
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code if the issue is reproduced

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    # If the script hasn't exited by this point, the issue could not be reproduced under the current conditions
    print("Issue could not be reproduced.")
    exit(0)
```

This script will properly raise a flag if the `Accept` header causes a `406 Not Acceptable` response from GitHub's server, which directly emulates the described issue. On the other hand, if the conditions no longer replicate the problem (for example, if GitHub changes their response or if Sphinx alters their `linkcheck` functionality), the script will indicate that the issue could not be reproduced, fulfilling the dual-purpose validation logic you outlined.
