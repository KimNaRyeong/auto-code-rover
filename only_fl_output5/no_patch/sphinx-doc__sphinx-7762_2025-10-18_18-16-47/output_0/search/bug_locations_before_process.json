        "intended_behavior": "The `check_uri` method should be extended to support configurable HTTP headers. Currently, it uses a hardcoded `Accept` header within the HTTP requests. The modification should allow the method to incorporate custom headers specified in the Sphinx configuration, replacing or supplementing the existing hardcoded `Accept` header. This change ensures that users can specify custom headers required by certain servers or links, thus avoiding issues like the 406 Not Acceptable error highlighted in the issue description. The modification must preserve the method's existing functionality, such as handling non-ASCII URIs, authorization, making HEAD and GET requests, handling responses, and managing redirects. The custom headers should be applied to both the HEAD and GET requests made within this method.\n\nTo implement this feature while preserving existing functionality, the code must first check for any user-defined headers in the Sphinx configuration. These headers would then either supplement or replace the default headers as specified by the user's needs. The solution must ensure that if no custom headers are defined, the method's behavior remains unchanged, thus ensuring backward compatibility for existing Sphinx projects that do not require this new feature."
