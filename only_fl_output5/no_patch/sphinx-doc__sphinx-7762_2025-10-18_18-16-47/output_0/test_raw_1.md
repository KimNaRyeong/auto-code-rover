Given the updated request, let's adjust the purpose and functionality of `reproducer.py`. This version will attempt to simulate the issue where a server responds with `406 Not Acceptable` due to the injected `Accept` header by Sphinx's `linkcheck.py`, and will use your provided `print_stacktrace` function to clearly report assertion failures.

```python
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def send_request_with_header(url: str, headers: dict):
    response = requests.head(url, headers=headers)
    return response

def main():
    url = "https://github.com/cherrypy/cheroot/workflows/Test%20suite/badge.svg"
    
    # Hardcoded Accept header value that causes an issue
    bad_headers = {"Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8"}
    
    # A header that simulates a successful request (mimicking a browser's typical headers)
    good_headers = {"Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9"}

    try:
        # Simulating the requests with problematic and successful headers
        bad_response = send_request_with_header(url, bad_headers)
        assert bad_response.status_code != 406, f"URL '{url}' should not respond with 406 Not Acceptable to Sphinx's default headers"

        good_response = send_request_with_header(url, good_headers)
        assert good_response.status_code == 200, f"URL '{url}' should respond with 200 OK to browser-like headers"
    
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise  # Re-raises the current exception and exits the script with an error

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError:
        exit(1)  # Exit with an error code to indicate failure
    else:
        print("No issue detected. The response was as expected.")
        exit(0)  # Exit code 0 to indicate success/no issue
```

This script will check if the hardcoded `Accept` header causes a `406 Not Acceptable` response from the server. If the response code is 406, indicating the issue is present, it will print a stack trace explaining where the assertion failed. Conversely, if the response code is not 406 (indicating the server handled the request as intended), it concludes that the issue would not occur with customizable HTTP headers and exits gracefully, indicating no issue detected.
