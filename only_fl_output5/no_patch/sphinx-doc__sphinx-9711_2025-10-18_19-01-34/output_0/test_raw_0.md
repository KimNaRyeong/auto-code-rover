Sure, considering the issue description you provided, weâ€™re attempting to replicate a situation where comparing versions as strings leads to incorrect results. Specifically, we need to replicate the behavior of a simplified "needs_extensions" check similar to what may occur in Sphinx or a Sphinx-like environment. Here's a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` to demonstrate the issue:

```python
def check_version(min_required: str, installed: str) -> bool:
    """Compares version strings to determine if the installed version meets the minimum requirement."""
    return installed >= min_required

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    min_version_required = '0.6'
    installed_version = '0.10'
    try:
        assert check_version(min_version_required, installed_version), (
            f"Version {installed_version} should be considered newer than {min_version_required}"
        )
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise SystemExit(1)

    print("Version check passed. The issue is fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Behavior:
- **When the issue is present**: The script will fail asserting that '0.10' is considered older than '0.6' due to string comparison (`'0.10' < '0.6'` when compared lexicographically) and print the stack trace accordingly.
- **When the issue is fixed**: The assertion will pass, indicating that the version comparison logic handles versions correctly (recognizing '0.10' is newer than '0.6'), and it will print "Version check passed. The issue is fixed."

Note: The simplified `check_version` function in this script demonstrates the incorrect string-based comparison that leads to the described issue. A real fix would involve parsing the version strings and comparing their numerical parts, which is not implemented here since the purpose is to reproduce the described error scenario.
