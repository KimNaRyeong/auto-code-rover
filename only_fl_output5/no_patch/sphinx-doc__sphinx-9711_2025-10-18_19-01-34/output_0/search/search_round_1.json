This means any version >9 is not allowed for any check of something >1. That is, treated as string '0.6' > '0.10', but treated as versions '0.6' < '0.10'. Since Sphinx does the former, some extension versions may not be allowed when they should be.\n### How to Reproduce\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors\n$ cd mplcursors\n$ pip install -r .doc-requirements.txt\n$ pip install -e .\n$ make -C doc html\n```\nThis passes just fine, because the requirements pin sphinx-gallery to 0.9. But if you then update to the current 0.10 release:\n```\n$ pip install sphinx-gallery==0.10\n$ make -C doc html\n```\nresults in a failure due to a \"not new enough\" version:\n```\nRunning Sphinx v4.1.2\nloading translations [en]... done\nmaking output directory... done\nSphinx version error:\nThis project needs the extension sphinx_gallery.gen_gallery at least in version 0.6.0 and therefore cannot be built with the loaded version (0.10.0).\n```\n### Expected behavior\nsphinx-gallery 0.10.0 should be accepted if 0.6 is the minimum specified.\n### Your project\nhttps://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nFedora\n### Python version\n3.9.6\n### Sphinx version\n4.1.2\n### Sphinx extensions\n_No response_\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

Given the context of the issue, these findings are particularly relevant:\n\n   - **sphinx/config.py**: This file possibly contains configuration-related aspects of Sphinx, including the setup or definition of `needs_extensions` configurations. The mention of `needs_extensions` here could relate to how configurations are parsed or validated, potentially including how extension versions are read and compared.\n   \n   - **sphinx/extension.py**: With five matches in this file, it's clear this is a key area for extension handling in Sphinx. This could involve loading extensions, checking their compatibility or versions, and possibly where the logic flaw exists that leads to the version check being performed in a 'string-like' manner.\n\n2. **The relationship with the bug:**\n\nThe bug describes an incorrect mechanism of comparing versions as strings rather than in a numerical or semantic versioning manner. This leads to erroneous conclusions about extension compatibility, specifically, thinking '0.10.0' is less than '0.6.0' due to lexicographical comparison ('1' being less than '6' in the first character comparison). The locations of `needs_extensions` usages hint at where in the codebase this flawed logic might reside.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n\nThe intended behavior is for version comparisons to respect the semantic value of version numbers, meaning that an extension version '0.10.0' should be recognized as newer than '0.6.0', allowing `sphinx-gallery 0.10.0` to satisfy a requirement for a minimum version of '0.6.0'.\n\n**Next Steps for Further Context:**\n\nGiven this analysis, it would be prudent to inspect the specific implementation details within `sphinx/config.py` and `sphinx/extension.py` where `needs_extensions` is mentioned. We can examine how versions are parsed and compared to identify the misapplication of string comparison logic.\n\nTo proceed, the following API calls seem appropriate:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"needs_extensions\", \"sphinx/config.py\")` to understand how `needs_extensions` versions are configured.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"needs_extensions\", \"sphinx/extension.py\")` to delve into the logic of extension handling and version checking."
