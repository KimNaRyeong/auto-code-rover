This means any version >9 is not allowed for any check of something >1. That is, treated as string '0.6' > '0.10', but treated as versions '0.6' < '0.10'. Since Sphinx does the former, some extension versions may not be allowed when they should be.\n### How to Reproduce\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors\n$ cd mplcursors\n$ pip install -r .doc-requirements.txt\n$ pip install -e .\n$ make -C doc html\n```\nThis passes just fine, because the requirements pin sphinx-gallery to 0.9. But if you then update to the current 0.10 release:\n```\n$ pip install sphinx-gallery==0.10\n$ make -C doc html\n```\nresults in a failure due to a \"not new enough\" version:\n```\nRunning Sphinx v4.1.2\nloading translations [en]... done\nmaking output directory... done\nSphinx version error:\nThis project needs the extension sphinx_gallery.gen_gallery at least in version 0.6.0 and therefore cannot be built with the loaded version (0.10.0).\n```\n### Expected behavior\nsphinx-gallery 0.10.0 should be accepted if 0.6 is the minimum specified.\n### Your project\nhttps://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nFedora\n### Python version\n3.9.6\n### Sphinx version\n4.1.2\n### Sphinx extensions\n_No response_\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

Given the context of the issue, these findings are particularly relevant:\n\n   - **sphinx/config.py**: This file possibly contains configuration-related aspects of Sphinx, including the setup or definition of `needs_extensions` configurations. The mention of `needs_extensions` here could relate to how configurations are parsed or validated, potentially including how extension versions are read and compared.\n   \n   - **sphinx/extension.py**: With five matches in this file, it's clear this is a key area for extension handling in Sphinx. This could involve loading extensions, checking their compatibility or versions, and possibly where the logic flaw exists that leads to the version check being performed in a 'string-like' manner.\n\n2. **The relationship with the bug:**\n\nThe bug describes an incorrect mechanism of comparing versions as strings rather than in a numerical or semantic versioning manner. This leads to erroneous conclusions about extension compatibility, specifically, thinking '0.10.0' is less than '0.6.0' due to lexicographical comparison ('1' being less than '6' in the first character comparison). The locations of `needs_extensions` usages hint at where in the codebase this flawed logic might reside.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n\nThe intended behavior is for version comparisons to respect the semantic value of version numbers, meaning that an extension version '0.10.0' should be recognized as newer than '0.6.0', allowing `sphinx-gallery 0.10.0` to satisfy a requirement for a minimum version of '0.6.0'.\n\n**Next Steps for Further Context:**\n\nGiven this analysis, it would be prudent to inspect the specific implementation details within `sphinx/config.py` and `sphinx/extension.py` where `needs_extensions` is mentioned. We can examine how versions are parsed and compared to identify the misapplication of string comparison logic.\n\nTo proceed, the following API calls seem appropriate:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"needs_extensions\", \"sphinx/config.py\")` to understand how `needs_extensions` versions are configured.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"needs_extensions\", \"sphinx/extension.py\")` to delve into the logic of extension handling and version checking."

This configuration parameter is likely used for specifying which extensions are required and, presumably, their minimum versions for the Sphinx project. However, this does not directly reveal how versions are compared, but it is crucial for establishing the context in which extensions are declared necessary.\n\n2. **sphinx/extension.py Analysis:**\n\nIn `sphinx/extension.py`, the function `verify_needs_extensions` is highlighted multiple times (3 matches), suggesting it's directly involved in checking the versions of required extensions against those loaded or available. The method name itself implies it is where the validation of extension requirements versus actual versions occurs. The non-function match might relate to the initial setup or definition part where `needs_extensions` is considered.\n\nThe `setup` function mention (1 match) indicates it has a role in preparing or registering extensions, which may include invoking the version check logic as part of ensuring a correct setup environment.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior and Relationship with the Bug:**\n\n- The intended behavior of the code, specifically within `verify_needs_extensions`, should correctly compare version numbers in a way that acknowledges semantic versioning. This means understanding '0.10.0' as a higher version than '0.6.0', contrary to a simple string comparison which would falsely evaluate '0.6.0' as greater due to lexicographical ordering.\n  \n- The relationship between this part of the code and the bug is direct; the issue arises during the comparison of required and actual extension versions. The bug fix should involve modifying this version comparison logic to properly interpret and compare version strings as versions, not plain strings.\n\nGiven those insights, the `verify_needs_extensions` method within `sphinx/extension.py` is a key locus for the bug. It is here the logic needs modification to align with the issue's resolution goals while preserving existing functionality (e.g., not breaking version checks that correctly recognize other version requirements).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe next steps involve focusing on the `verify_needs_extensions` function within `sphinx/extension.py` to correct the version comparison logic. This adjustment will enable '0.10.0' and similar versions to be recognized as valid when they meet or exceed the specified minimum requirement."

This means incorporating logic or utilizing a library capable of parsing version strings and comparing them based on their numeric and precendence values rather than lexicographical (string) comparison.\n\nThe method must:\n\n- Correctly interpret version strings, splitting them into their constituent parts (major, minor, patch) and compare these numerically.\n- For versions that follow a simple major.minor.patch scheme, it should compare major versions first, then minor, and finally patch levels, recognizing, for example, that '0.10.0' is indeed greater than '0.6.0'.\n- Maintain functionality for other forms of version comparison it currently supports, ensuring backward compatibility with projects that have correctly specified their `needs_extensions` versions under the existing system.\n\nThis approach will resolve the issue by allowing extensions with versions 'greater than 9' in the minor or patch places to be recognized as satisfying or exceeding version requirements specified in the `needs_extensions` configuration."
