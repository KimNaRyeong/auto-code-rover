        "intended_behavior": "The `verify_needs_extensions` method should compare extension versions using a mechanism that accurately reflects semantic versioning. This means incorporating logic or utilizing a library capable of parsing version strings and comparing them based on their numeric and precedence values rather than lexicographical (string) comparison.\n\nThe method must:\n\n- Correctly interpret version strings, splitting them into their constituent parts (major, minor, patch) and compare these numerically.\n- For versions that follow a simple major.minor.patch scheme, it should compare major versions first, then minor, and finally patch levels, recognizing, for example, that '0.10.0' is indeed greater than '0.6.0'.\n- Maintain functionality for other forms of version comparison it currently supports, ensuring backward compatibility with projects that have correctly specified their `needs_extensions` versions under the existing system.\n\nThis approach will resolve the issue by allowing extensions with versions 'greater than 9' in the minor or patch places to be recognized as satisfying or exceeding version requirements specified in the `needs_extensions` configuration."
