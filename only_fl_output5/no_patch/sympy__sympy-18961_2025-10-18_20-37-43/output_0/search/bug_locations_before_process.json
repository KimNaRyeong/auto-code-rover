        "intended_behavior": "The `digits` function is to be modified to accept an additional `bits` parameter, which is optional. This parameter will control the padding of the resulting digits list with leading zeros (after the base indicator) to ensure the list's length matches the specified `bits` length if the original digit count is less than `bits`. This enhancement should not alter the function's behavior when the `bits` parameter is not provided, thus preserving backward compatibility. Specifically, after reversing the list to place the base indicator at the beginning, and before returning the final list, the function should check if the `bits` parameter is provided and if the length of the list (excluding the base indicator) is less than `bits`. If so, zeros should be inserted immediately after the base indicator to make up the difference. This feature enhancement will require careful implementation to handle edge cases such as when `bits` is less than the number of digits already present or when `n` is negative, ensuring that the sign of the base reflects the sign of `n` accurately."
