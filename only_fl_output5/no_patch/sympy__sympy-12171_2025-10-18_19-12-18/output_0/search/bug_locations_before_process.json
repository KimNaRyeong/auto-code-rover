The expected output for a derivative, such as `Derivative(f(t), t)`, is to be `D[f[t], t]`, reflecting Mathematica's `D` function for derivatives. This method will take a derivative expression as its input and should return a string formatted according to Mathematica's expectations for derivative expressions."

        "method": "_print_Float",
        "intended_behavior": "A new method `_print_Float` needs to be added to handle the conversion of float expressions, especially those with exponents, into a format compatible with Mathematica syntax. Specifically, a float in the form of \"1.0e-4\" should be converted to \"1.0*^-4\" to match the Mathematica input syntax. This method will convert float numbers from Python's scientific notation to Mathematica's notation, ensuring accuracy and compatibility with Mathematica's numerical input requirements."
