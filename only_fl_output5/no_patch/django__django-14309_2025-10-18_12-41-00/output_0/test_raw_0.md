Here's a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` to reproduce the described issue. Before running this script, ensure that you have Django installed and set up correctly, including a model named `Book` for this script to function properly.

```python
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Exists, Q

# Minimal Django configuration for running this script without a complete project
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=[
        '__main__',  # Include this script as a Django app
    ],
    TIME_ZONE='UTC',
    USE_TZ=True,
)

# Define a simple model to work with
class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)

    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'  # Allow Django to recognize this as a valid app model

# Function to print stack trace
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Setup Django
    django.setup()
    # Create in-memory database tables
    with django.db.connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:
        schema_editor.create_model(Book)

    # Now let's check the issue
    try:
        q = Q() & Exists(Book.objects.all())
        assert not q.negated  # This should pass as per description
        q = Q() & ~Exists(Book.objects.all())
        assert q.negated  # This is expected to fail
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

    finally:
        # Cleanup - delete in-memory database tables
        with django.db.connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:
            schema_editor.delete_model(Book)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

To execute this file:
1. Ensure you have Django installed in your Python environment (`pip install django`).
2. Place this script in the root directory of your project or an appropriate working directory.
3. Run it using the command `python3 reproducer.py`.

This script will raise an `AssertionError` when the described issue is present, showing a stack trace of where the problem occurred. If the issue is fixed, the script will complete without error. Note that this script creates a basic in-memory SQLite database and does not require a separate Django project setup, making it a complete, self-contained reproducer.
