        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue regarding the combination of an empty Q object with a negated Exists lookup in Django, the following API calls will be essential:\n\n1. **Search for the `Q` class**: Since the issue involves the `Q` object, we need to understand how Q objects handle combinations and negations internally.\n   - `search_class(\"Q\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `Exists` class**: Understanding the `Exists` class will help us see how it's structured and potentially why its negation behavior is being altered when combined with an empty `Q` object.\n   - `search_class(\"Exists\")`\n\n3. **Search for the `combine` method in the `Q` class**: The issue specifically mentions combining a `Q` object with an `Exists` object, so we need to look at how the `combine` method is implemented within `Q`.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"combine\", \"Q\")`\n\n4. **Search for any code related to negating Exists objects**: Looking for the negation process might give insights into how the negation state is stored or altered, especially in combination with `Q` objects.\n   - `search_code(\"~Exists\")`\n\nThese API calls will likely provide us with a comprehensive understanding of the components involved in the issue, offering a solid foundation for drafting a patch."
