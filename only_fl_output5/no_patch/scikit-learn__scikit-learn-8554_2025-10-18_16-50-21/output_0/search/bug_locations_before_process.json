        "intended_behavior": "Inside the `_fit_transform` method, the call to `check_array` should be updated to include `accept_sparse=True` along with keeping `dtype=float`. This change will allow the method to accept sparse matrices as input, aligning with the documented capability. The rest of the method (and any methods that it calls) should be reviewed to ensure that they can handle sparse matrices without issues. This includes ensuring that any operations that follow can work efficiently with sparse data or converting the sparse matrix to a dense format when absolutely necessary and efficient to do so."

        "intended_behavior": "For consistency and to address the same issue as with LocallyLinearEmbedding, the `Isomap` class's handling of input data in the `_fit_transform` method should also be adjusted to accept sparse matrices by using `accept_sparse=True` in calls to `check_array`. As with LocallyLinearEmbedding, subsequent data processing steps need to be compatible with sparse matrix operations, ensuring the algorithm's proper functionality without degrading performance unnecessarily."
