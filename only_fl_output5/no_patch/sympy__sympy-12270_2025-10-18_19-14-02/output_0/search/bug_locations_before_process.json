The adjustment must ensure that the process respects mathematical equivalence between evaluated and non-evaluated forms of expressions. This means if an expression can mathematically be divided by a number (positive or negative), extract_multiplicatively should be able to factor out that number and return the appropriate quotient expression, even when initially constructed with evaluate=False."

        "intended_behavior": "While the behavior of finding a positive rational that can be extracted from every term of an expression is correct, there should be additional consideration or clarification in the documentation and implementation about how this interacts with extract_multiplicatively, especially in scenarios involving negative numbers. If primitive plays a part in the preparation of expressions for extract_multiplicatively, it should be ensured that this preparation does not prevent correct mathematical operations. This might not require changing the primitive function itself but ensuring that its output is correctly handled in contexts where negative coefficients or non-evaluation (evaluate=False) could impact the result of operations like extract_multiplicatively."
