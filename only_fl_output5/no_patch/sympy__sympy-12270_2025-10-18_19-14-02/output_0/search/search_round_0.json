Search for the `expr.py` file to find the implementation of `.extract_multiplicatively()` method, and also to understand how the `Mul` class behaves with its `evaluate` parameter.\n   \n2. Since the issue mentions a problem with extracting multiplicatively in a specific scenario, and refers to `primitive()` and `Mul` creation with `evaluate=False`, it's crucial to look into how these methods and behaviors are implemented for the relevant classes.\n\nHence, I will perform the following API calls:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"extract_multiplicatively\", \"core/expr.py\")`\n- `search_method_in_file(\"primitive\", \"core/expr.py\")`\n- `search_code(\"Mul(\", \"core/expr.py\")`\n\nThese calls are aimed to provide a detailed view of the mentioned methods and constructors, and to understand if there's a specific handling or scenario that the issue description points to."
