The fix would likely involve either wrapping trivial results in a `FormalPowerSeries`-like interface or ensuring that any return type supports the full range of operations expected by users of `fps`. The preservation of existing functionality implies that any direct polynomial representation like `x**2` should still return an object that conveys this is a complete series representation of the input function. This might mean enhancing the `FormalPowerSeries` object or similar to accommodate trivial series without altering their mathematical representation but enriching their interface."
