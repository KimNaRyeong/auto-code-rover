When executed, it attempts to use the `fps` function from SymPy to obtain a formal power series of `x**2`. It verifies whether the returned object supports indexing by trying to access its first element. If this operation does not raise a `TypeError`, it means the object supports indexing like a formal power series, and hence the script won't raise an `AssertionError`. Conversely, if accessing the first element causes a `TypeError`, indicating that the object does not behave as expected for a formal power series, the script will print the stack trace of the exception and terminate with exit code 1, signaling the presence of the issue (#12310)."
