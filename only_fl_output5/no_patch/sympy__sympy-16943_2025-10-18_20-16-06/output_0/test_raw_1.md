This script specifically targets the problem reported in the issue related to the function `fps` from SymPy. It tries to reproduce the situation where `fps` does not behave as expected when given a power expression. The expected correct behavior for the given input should technically raise an `AssertionError` only if `fps` unexpectedly allows indexing on a non-formal power series object. However, if a `TypeError` is raised when attempting to index, which is incorrect behavior according to the issue description, the script exits gracefully, indicating that the peculiar behavior described might have been addressed or is manifesting as expected due to the nature of `fps`' output.
