        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `fps` function should be adjusted to ensure that it returns an object that supports the formal power series interface, even for inputs that result in simple expressions such as power functions. Specifically, when `fps` computes the series and determines the result to be something that would typically return as a `Pow` object (or any other object that wouldn\u2019t support the series interface, such as direct constants or other simple sympy expressions), it should instead return a formal power series object that represents the original expression within the series framework. This ensures that even trivial expressions that don't require expansion are still returned in a manner consistent with the expected behavior of `fps`, supporting operations like indexing. The implementation might involve a check after the computation to decide whether to wrap the result in a `FormalPowerSeries` object or a similar wrapper that provides the necessary interface, without altering the mathematical intent of the returned expression."
