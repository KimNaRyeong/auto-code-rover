        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. Symbol Class from `sympy/core/symbol.py`\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\nThe `Symbol` class represents a mathematical symbol, which is a basic building block for defining variables in symbolic algebra within SymPy. It is a type of atomic expression that does not directly contain other expressions. Symbols can have assumptions (like real, integer, etc.) defined on creation.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug:** The issue starts by creating a `Symbol` named `x`, which is then used as the input for the `fps` function. Understanding the `Symbol` class is crucial because it is the datatype being manipulated and passed to the `fps` function, but it does not hint at the discrepancies in the returned types from `fps`.\n\n- **Intended behavior:** When used in expressions and passed to functions like `fps`, the `Symbol` class should seamlessly interact with other parts of SymPy, enabling symbolic computations. The class itself likely isn't directly related to the cause of the issue but understanding its role and behavior is foundational.\n\n#### 2. The `fps` Function\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\nThe `fps` function, found in `sympy/series/formal.py`, is designed to generate a formal power series of a given function around a specific point. It returns a `FormalPowerSeries` object, which represents the series expansion. The function handles different inputs and settings, determining how the series is computed, including direction, order, and whether to use hypergeometric or rational algorithms.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug:** The bug arises when using the `fps` function with `x ** 2` as the input. Instead of returning a `FormalPowerSeries` object, it returns a `Pow` object (power function), which does not support the same interface, particularly indexing. The behavior of `fps` directly impacts the issue, especially how it handles cases where the input might already be a polynomial or does not require expansion.\n\n- **Intended behavior:** Based on the issue description and intended functionality of `fps`, the function should always return a `FormalPowerSeries` object or a type with a consistent interface, regardless of the input being already a polynomial or requiring no expansion. The documentation and the user's expectation suggest that a series object should support certain operations, such as indexing, which `Pow` does not.\n\n#### Failed Searches and Next Steps\n- The search for usage examples or implementations directly involving `fps(x ** 2)` or the `Pow` class did not yield results. This suggests a potential gap in handling specific types of inputs within the `fps` function or a lack of documentation or examples covering these cases.\n\n- **Next Steps:**\nGiven the missing links and the core of the issue being how `fps` handles certain inputs:\n1. **Search for the `FormalPowerSeries` class:** Understanding the structure and intended use of the `FormalPowerSeries` object might offer insights into how `fps` is supposed to work and why it might default to returning `Pow` objects under certain conditions. \n   \n   `search_class(\"FormalPowerSeries\")`\n\n2. **Explore the `Pow` class or how power expressions are handled within SymPy:** Since the issue specifically encounters a problem with a `Pow` object being returned, understanding how these are created and used within the library could be crucial. Since the direct search for the `Pow` class failed, an alternative approach might be needed.\n\n   `search_code(\"Pow\")`\n\n3. **Look for documentation or comments within `formal.py` related to handling polynomial or trivial cases:** Since the direct behavior causing the issue wasn't clear from the initial search results, looking into the source file might reveal conditions or comments explaining why a non-series object is returned.\n\n   `search_code_in_file(\"return f\", \"sympy/series/formal.py\")`\n\nThese steps aim to close the gap in understanding how `fps` decides on the type of object to return and how this process might be improved or documented to address the reported issue."

This would involve adjusting the logic within `fps` to handle cases where the input is already a polynomial or so trivial that it doesn't necessitate an actual series expansion, yet should still support the expected operations. The fix would likely involve either wrapping trivial results in a `FormalPowerSeries`-like interface or ensuring that any return type supports the full range of operations expected by users of `fps`. The preservation of existing functionality implies that any direct polynomial representation like `x**2` should still return an object that conveys this is a complete series representation of the input function. This might mean enhancing the `FormalPowerSeries` object or similar to accommodate trivial series without altering their mathematical representation but enriching their interface."
