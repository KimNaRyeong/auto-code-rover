        "content": "To effectively resolve the issue related to RFC 6265 compliance in Django's contrib.messages regarding cookie handling, we need to understand how the contrib.messages framework constructs and manipulates cookies. The bug specifically mentions the use of an unsupported escape character in cookie values, which likely involves the serialization and deserialization of messages stored in cookies. To get the necessary context, we should first locate the relevant part of the Django codebase that handles these operations. We will gather information about the classes or methods that are responsible for setting, escaping, and storing messages in cookies within the contrib.messages framework.\n\nGiven the specifics of the issue, here are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. **Search for the contrib.messages framework classes and methods**: Since the issue is within the contrib.messages framework, we need to look for classes related to message storage or cookie handling in this module. Without the exact class or method names, we start with a broad search.\n\n   - `search_code(\"contrib.messages\")` to identify relevant files and classes.\n\n2. **Locate cookie handling code**: Based on the issue description, the problem arises when messages are stored in cookies, possibly during escaping special characters. We should locate the methods that are responsible for this.\n\n   - `search_method(\"set_cookie\")` might give us insights into how cookies are set and if there's customization for messages.\n   - `search_code(\"messages=\")` to find where message cookies are specifically handled.\n\n3. **Find cookie value escaping logic**: Since the problem involves an escape character in cookie values, finding the logic that serializes or escapes message content could be crucial.\n\n   - `search_code(\"escape\")` within the context of messages or cookies to see if there's a custom implementation or utilization of an escape function.\n\nThese API calls are designed to locate the parts of the Django codebase where the modification might be needed to ensure RFC 6265 compliance for cookies in the contrib.messages framework."
