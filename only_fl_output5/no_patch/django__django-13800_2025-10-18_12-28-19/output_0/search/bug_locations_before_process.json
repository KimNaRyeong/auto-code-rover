        "intended_behavior": "The class should implement a serialization method that complies with RFC 6265 by accurately encoding or escaping special characters in message contents before storing them in a cookie. This could involve using base64 encoding or a similar approach to ensure that all characters within the message content are compliant with the cookie value constraints specified by the RFC. The encoding method should be designed to avoid altering the original message content's meaning or readability when it is decoded. This behavior ensures that messages stored in cookies remain intact and meaningful for end-users, while also adhering to web standards and compatibility with web application firewalls (WAFs)."
