Find out if the `DataArrayGroupBy` class indeed has a `quantile` method.\n2. Check whether there is a `DatasetGroupBy` class and if it lacks the `quantile` method.\n3. Look into how methods are typically implemented or delegated in these groupby classes to understand how to properly introduce the `quantile` method.\n\nBased on these points, here are the API calls that need to be made:\n\n- search_class(\"DataArrayGroupBy\")\n- search_class(\"DatasetGroupBy\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"quantile\", \"DataArrayGroupBy\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"quantile\", \"DatasetGroupBy\")"
