This method should provide the ability to compute quantiles over each dataset in the groups, with parameters for quantile values `q`, optional dimensions `dim` over which to compute the quantiles, interpolation method `interpolation`, and whether to keep attributes `keep_attrs`. The method should iterate over each grouped dataset, applying the quantile computation accordingly and then concatenate the results into a new dataset. This implementation would resolve the issue by providing the expected functionality that is currently missing, as described by the error encountered in the user-submitted issue."
