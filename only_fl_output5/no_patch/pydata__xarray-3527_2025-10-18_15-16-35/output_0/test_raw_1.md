It seems there was a misunderstanding earlier in the execution context. I will write a standalone Python script `reproducer.py` that more accurately reflects how the issue can be reproduced given the current task requirements. This script will attempt to use the `quantile` attribute on an `xarray.DatasetGroupBy` object, expecting to catch an `AttributeError` if the issue described is present. If the attribute is accessible (indicating the issue has been resolved), it will exit with code 0.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import xarray as xr
    try:
        ds = xr.Dataset(data_vars={"a": ("x", list("abcd"))}, coords={"x": range(4)})
        # Attempt to call `quantile` on a grouped dataset object
        quantile_func = ds.groupby(ds.x % 2 == 0).quantile
    except AttributeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("DatasetGroupBy does not implement quantile. Issue is present.") from e
    else:
        print("Success: `quantile` works on grouped dataset. Issue seems to be fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This script should work as intended:

- It imports `xarray` and tries to call the `quantile` method on a `DatasetGroupBy` object.
- If the method does not exist, an `AttributeError` is caught, and the stack trace of the issue is printed using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. An `AssertionError` is then raised to indicate that the issue is present.
- If no error occurs, it prints a success message, indicating that the `quantile` method is available on `DatasetGroupBy` objects and thus the issue appears to be fixed.
