Here's the revised `reproducer.py` Python script incorporating your specific requirements and the function to print the stack trace. This script will check if the `quantile` method is available for `xarray.DatasetGroupBy` objects and will handle the situation accordingly:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import sys
    import xarray as xr
    
    try:
        ds = xr.Dataset(data_vars={"a": ("x", list("abcd"))}, coords={"x": range(4)})
        # Attempt to access `quantile` on a grouped dataset object to reproduce the issue.
        _ = ds.groupby(ds.x % 2 == 0).quantile
    except AttributeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating the script caught the AttributeError as expected.
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An unexpected error occurred.") from e
    else:
        raise AssertionError("`quantile` is unexpectedly present on DatasetGroupBy. Issue might be fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script works as follows:

- It attempts to use the `quantile` method on an `xarray.DatasetGroupBy` object. 
- If `AttributeError` is caught (because `quantile` does not exist on the object), it prints the stack trace and exits with code 0, indicating the issue is present as expected.
- If any other exception occurs, it is caught, and its stack trace is printed, then the script raises an `AssertionError` indicating an unexpected error occurred.
- If no exception is caught, the script raises an `AssertionError` suggesting that the `quantile` method is unexpectedly present, and thus the issue might have been fixed.

This script checks for the specific issue described and handles exceptions appropriately, providing clear feedback on the presence of the issue.
