Given the specifications and aiming to accurately reproduce the issue outlined — where renaming a coordinate to a dimension name using `rename_vars` in xarray does not correctly create an index for further operations such as `sel` — the following `reproducer.py` script is provided. This script checks whether the bug as described occurs. It uses `assert` statements to ensure that the expected conditions are met, and in case of failure, it prints a detailed stack trace of the issue.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import xarray as xr

    data = xr.DataArray([5, 6, 7], coords={"c": ("x", [1, 2, 3])}, dims="x")
    data_renamed = data.rename({"c": "x"})

    # Check if the dimension 'x' is labeled as a coordinate
    assert "x" in data_renamed.dims, "Dimension 'x' not found."

    # Check if renaming 'c' to 'x' created an index
    indexes = data_renamed.indexes
    if "x" not in indexes:
        raise AssertionError("Index for 'x' was not created by rename_vars.")

    # Test 'sel' operation
    try:
        _ = data_renamed.sel(x=2)
    except KeyError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Selection by 'x' failed. The index seems missing even though 'x' is set as a dimension coordinate.") from e
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

    print("Test passed: Renaming a coordinate to a dimension coordinate creates an index, and operations like 'sel' succeed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
```

This script validates the renaming functionality within the xarray package. It specifically verifies:
- if renaming a coordinate to a dimension correctly updates the dimension information (`dims`),
- if this renaming operation properly initializes an index which is critical for further data selections,
- and performs a selection operation (`sel`) to ensure the index is functional.

If the issue is present, the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed traceback of where and why the failure occurred. If the renaming operation behaves as expected after potential fixes, the script will conclude successfully, outputting a confirmation message and exiting with code 0.
