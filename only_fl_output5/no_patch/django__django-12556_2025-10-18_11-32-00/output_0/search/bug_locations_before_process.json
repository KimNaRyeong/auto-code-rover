        "intended_behavior": "The method signature of `get_random_string` needs to be changed to remove the default value for the `length` parameter, making it mandatory for callers to specify the length explicitly. This change ensures that the developers have to make an intentional choice about the length of the random string they need, which could enhance security and usability by making the use of this function more deliberate. The existing functionality of generating a random string given a length and an allowed character set will be preserved. All occurrences of the `get_random_string` method being called within the Django project must also be updated to explicitly specify the length parameter to comply with the new method signature."
