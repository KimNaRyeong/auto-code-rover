        "intended_behavior": "The `construct` method needs to be modified to ensure that non-dimensional coordinates are preserved as coordinates after the coarsen operation. This involves enhancing the way `construct` reassigns dimensions and coordinates so that the original classification of data as either a coordinate or a variable is maintained through the process. Specifically, any logic that aggregates or modifies the dimensions of the dataset during the coarsening process should also include steps to accurately track and preserve non-dimensional coordinates instead of demoting them to variables. This preservation should not interfere with the primary functionality of reducing the dataset's resolution but should ensure that the metadata distinguishing coordinates from variables is kept intact."
