Based on the mentioned issue, we need to examine the `Coarsen` class, specifically the `construct` method, and how non-dimensional coordinates are handled during its execution. This approach will help us gather relevant code context for devising a patch. \n\nHere are the appropriate API calls to execute:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Coarsen\")`: To locate the `Coarsen` class within the codebase and identify the file or files it is defined in.\n2. `search_method(\"construct\")`: Since the issue specifically concerns the `construct` method, this call will help us find all occurrences or definitions of `construct` methods across the project, particularly those related to the `Coarsen` class. This is important for cross-verification and ensuring that any solution proposed does not negatively impact other components.\n\nThese calls are aimed at pinpointing the exact location and usage of the involved components to ensure any proposed solution is both relevant and comprehensive."
