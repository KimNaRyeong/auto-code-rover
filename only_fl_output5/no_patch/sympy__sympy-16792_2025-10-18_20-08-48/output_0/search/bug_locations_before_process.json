It should ensure that array arguments are declared as pointers or appropriate Cython types that can handle arrays (like `np.ndarray[double, ndim=1]` for a one-dimensional double array in Cython) instead of being treated as scalars. This preserves the functionality for scalar arguments while adding proper support for array arguments."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to `_declare_arg`, this method should ensure that the prototype signature for any function involving array arguments correctly reflects that they are arrays (e.g., `double* ` for C or the corresponding Cython array type) rather than mistakenly identifying them as scalar types. This corrects the function prototype to match the expected input types, especially for external libraries or cases where the function signature is predetermined but not all arguments may contribute to the output."
