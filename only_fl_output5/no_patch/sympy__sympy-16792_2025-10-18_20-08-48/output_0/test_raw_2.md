This Python script aims to serve as a reproducer for the issue described. Before executing the script, ensure that you have both `sympy` and `numpy` installed in your environment. These dependencies are crucial for the script to run correctly.

This script is structured to:

1. Import necessary modules (`sympy`, `numpy`), handling imports with an error message prompting for manual installation if any dependency is missing.
2. Define a `print_stacktrace` function that prints the stack trace of an exception, which would help in understanding the context of any exceptions thrown during execution.
3. Implement a `main` function to encapsulate the steps that reproduce the issue:
   - Defining a matrix symbol `x` and an expression `expr` that does not depend on `x`.
   - Attempting to autowrap `expr` with `x` as an argument using the Cython backend.
   - Executing the wrapped function with a numpy array to see if it raises the expected type error.
4. Handle exceptions by printing a stack trace for deeper analysis.
5. Conditionally exit the script with a status code to indicate the occurrence or resolution of the issue.
