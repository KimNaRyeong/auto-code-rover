It raises an `AssertionError` if the failure does not occur as expected, suggesting a deviation from the issue described.\n- It should exit with code 0 without errors observed during the execution if the issue has been resolved or the described scenario does not replicate the issue.\n\nPlease ensure you have the environment set up to run this script with Python 3 and the necessary SymPy library installed."
