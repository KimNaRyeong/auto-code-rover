        "content": "To get enough context for resolving the issue with `lambdify` and `MatrixSymbol` names containing curly braces even with `dummify=True` setting, we should consider gathering information about the relevant classes and methods mentioned in the issue. Specifically, we're interested in how `lambdify`, `MatrixSymbol`, and possibly the `symbols` function handle symbol names, especially those with curly braces, and how `lambdify` processes its arguments differently when `dummify` is set to `True`.\n\nLet's break down the required API calls based on the information needed:\n\n1. **The `lambdify` Function:** We need to understand how `lambdify` processes the input arguments, particularly `MatrixSymbol` instances and how the `dummify` parameter influences its behavior.\n\n2. **The `MatrixSymbol` Class:** Since the issue occurs when using `MatrixSymbol` with names that contain curly braces, we need to know how these symbols are managed within this class.\n\n3. **Handling of Symbol Names:** It's also important to understand how symbol names, especially those with special characters like curly braces, are handled internally. This might not be directly linked to one particular function or class, so searching for code snippets that deal with symbol names might be useful.\n\nBased on these points, here are the API calls that could provide the necessary context:\n\n- `search_method(\"lambdify\")`: To get general information about the `lambdify` function, including how it handles its parameters and the `dummify` logic.\n- `search_class(\"MatrixSymbol\")`: To understand the implementation of `MatrixSymbol` and how it handles its symbol names.\n\nThese calls should provide a good starting point for resolving the issue."
