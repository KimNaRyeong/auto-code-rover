This may involve enhancing the dummification process to more robustly sanitize symbol names, including those of `MatrixSymbol` instances, ensuring they are converted into valid Python variable names when `dummify=True`."

This might not necessarily involve a direct change in `MatrixSymbol` but ensuring its compatibility with `lambdify`'s expectations, especially regarding name handling."
