Sure, here's the `reproducer.py` script.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import sympy as sy

    curlyx = sy.symbols("{x}")
    v = sy.MatrixSymbol("v", 2, 1)
    curlyv = sy.MatrixSymbol("{v}", 2, 1)

    try:
        curlyScalarId = sy.lambdify(curlyx, curlyx)  # Should work
        vectorId = sy.lambdify(v, v)  # Should work
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("lambdify fails with either curly-brace scalar or regular vector")

    try:
        curlyVectorId = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv)  # This and next line should raise SyntaxError
        raise AssertionError("lambdify should fail with curly-brace vector, but it didn't")
    except SyntaxError as e:
        print("Expected failure with non-dummified curly-brace vector")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Unexpected exception type for non-dummified curly-brace vector")

    try:
        curlyVectorIdDummified = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv, dummify=True)
        raise AssertionError("lambdify should fail with dummified curly-brace vector, but it didn't")
    except SyntaxError as e:
        print("Expected failure with dummified curly-brace vector")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Unexpected exception type for dummified curly-brace vector")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script will reproduce the issue described by executing it with python3. It checks the lambdify function with and without `dummify` parameter for `MatrixSymbol`s with names containing curly braces. It raises an `AssertionError` when the issue is present (if the `lambdify` fails in an unexpected way or doesn't fail when it's supposed to) and prints a stack trace of the issue.

Since this script is designed for you to run as `python3 reproducer.py`, it directly reproduces the described issue and handles both expected and unexpected failures accordingly.
