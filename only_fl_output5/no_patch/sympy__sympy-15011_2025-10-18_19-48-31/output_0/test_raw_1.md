Apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's adjust the approach to correctly address the issue and expectations based on the feedback. This revised script includes detailed validation to explicitly check for the presence of the issue and will raise an `AssertionError` only if the error occurs as described, indicating the issue is still present. If there are no errors where expected, it quietly completes, noting that the issue might have been fixed or not reproducibly highlighted. Try the following version:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_lambdify_with_curly_brace_vectors():
    import sympy as sy

    curlyx = sy.symbols("{x}")
    v = sy.MatrixSymbol("v", 2, 1)
    curlyv = sy.MatrixSymbol("{v}", 2, 1)

    # These calls are expected to work
    try:
        curlyScalarId = sy.lambdify(curlyx, curlyx)
        vectorId = sy.lambdify(v, v)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "Failure in lambdify with non-curly symbols."

    # Testing lambdify with curly-brace vector without dummify
    try:
        curlyVectorId = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv)
        assert False, "Expected failure with curly-brace vector without dummify didn't occur."
    except SyntaxError:
        # Expected: passes quietly in case of SyntaxError, indicating the known issue
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "Unexpected exception type for curly-brace vector without dummify."

    # Testing lambdify with curly-brace vector with dummify
    try:
        curlyVectorIdDummified = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv, dummify=True)
        assert False, "Expected failure with curly-brace vector with dummify didnâ€™t occur."
    except SyntaxError:
        # Expected: passes quietly in case of SyntaxError, indicating the known issue
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "Unexpected exception type for curly-brace vector with dummify."

def main():
    test_lambdify_with_curly_brace_vectors()
    print("Test completed. If no AssertionError was raised, the issue as described was not reproduced.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note:
- This script assumes the behavior described regarding `lambdify` handling of `MatrixSymbol` with curly braces in names as an issue.
- Upon running this script, it will explicitly check for the specific failure mode (`SyntaxError`), which aligns with the described problem. It raises an `AssertionError` if the failure does not occur as expected, suggesting a deviation from the issue described.
- It should exit with code 0 without errors observed during the execution if the issue has been resolved or the described scenario does not replicate the issue.

Please ensure you have the environment set up to run this script with Python 3 and the necessary SymPy library installed.
