Please note, this script assumes you have a Python file named `mytest.py` in the same directory. If you don't, the script may exit with an error code indicating that `pylint` cannot find the file to lint, rather than reproducing the specific error in question.

To properly test this issue, make sure you have the specific version of `pylint` (`2.14.0-dev0`) and Python (as noted in your report) installed and available in your environment. The `subprocess.run` call in the `run_pylint` function attempts to use `pylint` to lint a file named `mytest.py` with the verbose flag `-v`, expecting it to either pass (indicating the issue is resolved) or fail with a specific error message, in which case the script captures and prints the stack trace of the error.
