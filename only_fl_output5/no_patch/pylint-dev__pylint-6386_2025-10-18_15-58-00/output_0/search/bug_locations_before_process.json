The exact change would depend on finding the specific part of code that deals with this option's setup but ensuring uniformity in requiring no arguments is key."

If this method is responsible for aggregating and applying argument configurations, it's crucial it applies a uniform rule to both forms of the verbose option that aligns with the expected behavior: not requiring an argument. The patch should ensure that any setup or addition of these options to the argparse parser includes flags or parameters that indicate these options are standalone and do not require additional input."
