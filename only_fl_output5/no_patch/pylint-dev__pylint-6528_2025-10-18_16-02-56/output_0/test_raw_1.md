Given the error message you've encountered, it appears that the `pylint` command is not found in the environment where the script is run. This could happen for a few reasons, such as `pylint` not being installed in the active environment or the environment not being activated correctly before running the script.

Before proceeding with a revised version of the reproducer script, please ensure that `pylint` is installed in your Python environment. You can install `pylint` by running:

```shell
pip install pylint
```

or if you are using conda:

```shell
conda install pylint
```

After ensuring `pylint` is installed, here is a revised `reproducer.py` script that includes a check for the presence of `pylint` before attempting to use it, to provide a more clear error message in case it is not found:

This script includes a check at the beginning of the `main` function to ensure `pylint` is installed, providing a clear message if it is not. Please ensure `pylint` is available in your environment before running this script.
