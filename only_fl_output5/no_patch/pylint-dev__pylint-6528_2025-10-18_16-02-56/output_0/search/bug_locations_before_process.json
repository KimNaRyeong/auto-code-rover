        "intended_behavior": "The code within this file should properly heed the `--ignore`, `--ignore-paths`, and `--ignore-patterns` flags when performing similarity checks, particularly in recursive mode. This would involve filtering out files and directories that match the patterns specified by these flags before any analysis or similarity checks are conducted. The intended behavior ensures that any file or directory meant to be ignored as per the user's configuration is indeed skipped during linting, preserving the existing functionality of Pylint while fixing the issue of ignored entities still being analyzed."
