They should be\nbase names, not paths. [current: CVS]\n--ignore-patterns=<pattern>[,<pattern>...]\nFiles or directories matching the regex patterns are\nskipped.

Specifically, we need to observe how Pylint processes directory and file ignore rules when the recursive option is activated. Given the nature of the issue, it's likely that the bug resides in the parts of the code that parse command-line arguments and apply these settings to determine which files and directories to lint.\n\nHere are the API calls we can make to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. Search for the function or class method that handles command-line argument parsing related to recursion and ignore settings. This is likely where these flags are processed or initially set up.\n   - `search_code(\"parse command-line arguments\")`\n   - `search_code(\"--recursive\")`\n   - `search_code(\"--ignore\")`\n   - `search_code(\"--ignore-paths\")`\n   - `search_code(\"--ignore-patterns\")`\n\n2.

What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThe file `pylint/checkers/similar.py` likely hosts code related to checking for similarities between different modules or files. The numerous matches for `--ignore` within suggest it may handle or respect some form of ignore logic, possibly to exclude files or directories from similarity checks based on the user's specifications.\n\n**2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\nSince `--ignore` options are not working as expected in recursive mode, and given this is where our search found matches, it could indicate that the logic to correctly handle these ignore options might be insufficiently applied or entirely missing within this context or its usage. The ignore logic, whether it's designed to filter out files from analysis or from similarity checks, is directly related to the reported bug. If the ignore options are not correctly applied, files and directories that should be skipped would still be analyzed or considered, going against user expectations and the documentation.\n\n**3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\nThe intended behavior would involve correctly parsing and applying `--ignore`, `--ignore-patterns`, and `--ignore-paths` flags to exclude specified files and directories from any checks, including similarity checks when operating in recursive mode. This entails not only recognizing these options at the command line but also incorporating them into the linting process in a manner that the specified entities are effectively ignored during the analysis.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the insights and missing information, further investigations should target understanding:\n\n- How is `--ignore` (and related options) intended to work in the context of `pylint/checkers/similar.py`? \n- Are these ignore options being parsed at a higher level, and their effects not propagated down to all the relevant checkers or parts of the analysis process when in recursive mode?\n- How is the recursive analysis implemented, and where does it interface with the logic for applying ignore rules?\n\nTo clarify these questions, additional API calls could focus on:\n\n- How and where command-line options (`--ignore`, `--ignore-paths`, `--ignore-patterns`) are parsed and stored. Since the direct search did not yield results, we might need to look into files or classes related to configuration handling.\n  - `search_code(\"Configuration\")`\n  - `search_code(\"command-line\")`\n- Investigating how pylint's recursive mode is implemented to understand where the breakdown in respect for ignore settings might occur.\n  - `search_code(\"recursive mode\")`\n- Direct examination of `pylint/checkers/similar.py` to understand how ignore logic is currently implemented or referenced.\n  - `get_code_around_line(\"pylint/checkers/similar.py\", 1, 10)`\n\nThese steps should provide a deeper understanding and point towards the mechanism that fails to respect ignore settings in recursive mode, guiding towards a potential resolution to the reported issue."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This would involve filtering out files and directories that match the patterns specified by these flags before any analysis or similarity checks are conducted. The intended behavior ensures that any file or directory meant to be ignored as per the user's configuration is indeed skipped during linting, preserving the existing functionality of Pylint while fixing the issue of ignored entities still being analyzed. This corrects the central issue reported.\n   \nGiven the available details, it seems more context might not be necessary at this juncture to hypothesize the general area and intended corrective action. The focus should be on accurately implementing ignore logic in the context of `pylint/checkers/similar.py` or wherever the recursive analysis is orchestrated. It should be ensured that ignore rules are universally applicable, effectively filtering out specified entities in all modes of operation, including and especially in the recursive mode."
