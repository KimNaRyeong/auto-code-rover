Based on the feedback provided and addressing the issue reported during the execution of the previous script, it seems `sphinx-build` was not found in your environment. Ensure that Sphinx is correctly installed and the environment is properly set up for it. You can install Sphinx using `pip install sphinx`. If `sphinx-build` isn't found, it's likely that the environment's bin directory isn't in your PATH, or the Sphinx installation didn't complete successfully.

Here's a revised version of the script that attempts to directly call Sphinx as a module, which may bypass the issue if `sphinx-build` isn't directly accessible from your PATH. This version also includes the same error-handling and stack trace printing functionality:

```python
import os
import shutil
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_minimal_sphinx_project():
    os.mkdir('test_project')
    with open('test_project/conf.py', 'w') as conf:
        conf.write("project = 'Test Project'\n")
        conf.write("extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']\n")
    with open('test_project/index.rst', 'w') as index:
        index.write("""
.. role:: python(code)
   :language: python
   :class: highlight

Inline :python:`def foo(1 + 2 + None + "abc"): pass` code block

.. code-block:: python

   def foo(1 + 2 + None + "abc"): pass
""")

def generate_latex():
    # Use sphinx-build via Python module interface
    subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-m", "sphinx", "-b", "latex", "test_project", "test_project/_build/latex"], check=True)

def check_latex_output():
    with open("test_project/_build/latex/TestProject.tex", "r") as f:  # Adjust the generated .tex file name if necessary
        content = f.read()
        if "\\sphinxcode{\\sphinxupquote{ def foo(1 + 2 + None + \"abc\"): pass }}" in content:
            raise AssertionError("Inline code highlighting includes unwanted whitespace.")

def cleanup():
    shutil.rmtree('test_project', ignore_errors=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        create_minimal_sphinx_project()
        generate_latex()
        check_latex_output()
        print("Issue not found: inline code highlighting does not include unwanted whitespace.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    finally:
        cleanup()
```

This script attempts to build the Sphinx project by invoking Sphinx through Python's module interface, which should work regardless of whether `sphinx-build` is directly accessible in your PATH. Please make sure Sphinx is installed in your current Python environment (`pip install sphinx`). If you encounter issues with file paths or names (for example, the `TestProject.tex` filename), adjust them as necessary based on your Sphinx version and configuration.
