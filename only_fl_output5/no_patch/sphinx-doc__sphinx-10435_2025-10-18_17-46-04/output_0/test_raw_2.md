Given the requirements and the previous errors encountered in the execution environment (such as the missing `docutils` module), it's crucial to ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and the Python script is well-structured to accurately reproduce the issue reported regarding Sphinx's LaTeX output formatting. Hereâ€™s an improved approach to `reproducer.py`:

```python
"""
This standalone script is designed to reproduce a specific issue 
where LaTeX: new Inline code highlighting from #10251 adds whitespace at start and end in pdf output.
"""

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_environment():
    import sys
    import subprocess
    
    # Ensure required Sphinx and docutils packages are installed
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "sphinx", "docutils"])

def create_sphinx_project():
    import os
    os.makedirs('test_project', exist_ok=True)
    with open('test_project/conf.py', 'w') as conf_file:
        conf_file.write("project = 'Test Project'\n")
        conf_file.write("extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']\n")
    with open('test_project/index.rst', 'w') as index_file:
        index_file.write("""

   :language: python
   :class: highlight

def build_latex():
    import subprocess
    import sys
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "sphinx", "-b", "latex", "test_project", "test_project/_build/latex"])

def verify_issue():
    try:
        with open("test_project/_build/latex/testproject.tex", "r") as f:
            content = f.read()
            if "}" in content.split("}{")[-1]:  # simplistic check to infer the format issue
                raise AssertionError("Whitespace issue is present in LaTeX output.")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        raise FileNotFoundError("The expected LaTeX file was not found. Build process might have failed.")

def cleanup():
    import shutil
    shutil.rmtree("test_project", ignore_errors=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        setup_environment()
        create_sphinx_project()
        build_latex()
        verify_issue()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    else:
        print("The issue was not reproduced. No unexpected whitespace found in LaTeX output.")
    finally:
        cleanup()
```

This script aims to:
- Ensure the Python environment has the necessary Sphinx and docutils packages installed.
- Set up a minimal Sphinx project that demonstrates the issue.
- Build the LaTeX output via the Sphinx tool.
- Verify whether the problematic whitespace issue is present in the generated `.tex` file.
- Provide descriptive error handling and cleanup after its execution.

Remember, the script attempts to install the necessary packages (`sphinx` and `docutils`). Ensure you have appropriate permissions or are in a virtual environment where these actions are allowed. Also, the verification step is simplified and assumes the presence of the issue based on specific characters in the `.tex` file content; it might need adjustments based on the actual output formatting and how the issue manifests in the `.tex` content.
