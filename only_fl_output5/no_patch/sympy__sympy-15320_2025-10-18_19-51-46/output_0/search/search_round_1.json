The initial search confirmed the existence of the `RootOf` class within `sympy/polys/rootoftools.py` but didn't retrieve the `__init__` method or `poly` method directly, possibly due to `RootOf` leveraging default or dynamically defined behaviors.\n\nGiven the issue describes a potential problem with how `RootOf` instances handle polynomials with different generators but similar forms, we need more insight into how these instances are created and managed. The `__new__` method mention in the search result suggests `RootOf` might be using a custom instantiation process, which is crucial for understanding the issue.\n\nSince the direct search for `__init__` and `poly` methods did not yield results, and considering the `__new__` method's significance in Python class instantiation, especially in classes dealing with complex initialization logic like `RootOf`, let's:\n\n1. Examine the `__new__` method of `RootOf` in greater detail to understand its instantiation logic.\n2. Investigate how the polynomial (`poly`) attribute of the `RootOf` instances is managed or accessed since the direct search for a method named `poly` was unfruitful. This could involve looking at properties or dynamic attribute access mechanisms.\n3. Check for any methods or properties that relate to the handling or definition of the generator for the polynomial within `RootOf`, this might provide insight into how the issue arises.\n\nHence, we'll make the following API calls:\n- Get more detailed code surrounding the `RootOf` class definition in `sympy/polys/rootoftools.py` to analyze its structure further.\n- Search for the code snippets where the `poly` attribute of `RootOf` is accessed or modified, which might not be directly exposed via a method named `poly`.\n\n```python\nget_code_around_line(\"sympy/polys/rootoftools.py\", 0, 50)\nsearch_code(\"poly\")\n```"

Therefore, I will leave the first part regarding the need for more context EMPTY, as the action to acquire more context was not yet executed.\n\nHowever, based on the understanding of the issue and the general structure of such problems:\n\n### Bug Locations:\n\nThe bug seems to centralized around the handling of generators within the `RootOf` class in the `sympy` library. The issue is that `RootOf` might not correctly account for different expressions' generators, leading to incorrect behavior when the same polynomial form is used with a different generator (e.g., using `tan(x)` instead of `x`).\n\n1. **File**: `sympy/polys/rootoftools.py`\n   **Class**: `RootOf`\n   \n   The lack of results for `__init__` and `poly` methods points towards the need to investigate the `__new__` method or other class methods that might be responsible for initializing `RootOf` instances or managing their polynomial attributes. The specific part of the class that handles the instantiation and maintains the polynomial's generator needs adjustments.\n\n### Intended Behavior:\n\n1. **In `RootOf` Instantiation Process** (`__new__` or equivalent initial setup method within `RootOf` class):\n   - The instantiation logic should correctly identify and preserve the generator of the polynomial expression provided to it. This includes recognizing when a polynomial is expressed in terms of a different variable or function (like `tan(x)` vs. `x`) and maintaining that distinction in the created `RootOf` instance. This is vital for ensuring the `RootOf` instance reflects the actual mathematical entity it is supposed to represent.\n   - Ensure that the generator's unique representation is preserved within the instance. This may involve enhancing how the `poly` attribute understands and stores the generator or possibly introducing new mechanisms to ensure that different expressions (even if they have the same polynomial form) are treated as distinct based on their generators.\n\nCorrect identification and handling of the generator during the initialization of `RootOf` instances are crucial. The intended behavior is that when a `RootOf` instance is created, it should accurately preserve and reflect the generator specified in the expression given to it, ensuring that subsequent computations and representations are correct and expected by the user."
