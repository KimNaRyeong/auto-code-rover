This is to see how `RootOf` is instantiated in various parts of the codebase.\n3. Search within the `RootOf` class for any methods that might be responsible for handling the generator, since the issue points to a potential discrepancy in generator handling.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"RootOf\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"RootOf\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"poly\", \"RootOf\")\n```"
