        "intended_behavior": "Modify this method to explicitly distinguish between decimal precision (`dps`) and binary precision (`prec`). This involves changing the method signature to allow both `dps` and `prec` as keyword arguments and implementing logic to handle cases where either, both, or none are provided by the user. The existing behavior of using `prec` as an approximation of decimal precision (which is actually interpreted as binary precision internally) needs to be preserved for backward compatibility. Add a deprecation warning when `prec` is used in the old sense (as decimal precision), advising users of the changed behavior and guiding them towards the new usage. Ensure that if both `dps` and `prec` are provided, the method raises an error to avoid ambiguity, unless a clear precedence rule is established. Implement logic to convert `dps` to `prec` internally if only `dps` is provided, maintaining the current mechanism of precision handling within the class while aligning with the user\u2019s expectations from the interface."
