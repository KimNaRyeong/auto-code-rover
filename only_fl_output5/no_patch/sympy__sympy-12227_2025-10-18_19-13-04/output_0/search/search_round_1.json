        "content": "<issue>Float constructor should allow to set binary precision\nI discussed this in some other issues, but I don't think I've opened an issue for it.\nThe Float constructor only allows you to set the decimal precision. It then converts this to binary precision and saves that in `Float._prec`.\nThe problem here is that there are fewer decimal precisions than binary precisions. For example:\n```\nIn [9]: Float(1.0, 15)._prec\nOut[9]: 53\nIn [10]: Float(1.0, 16)._prec\nOut[10]: 56\n```\nSo for instance, if you had a float that used 54 binary digits, it would be difficult to create a Float from it. I'm not even sure if it's possible, since in the current constructor, the `prec` argument overrides the fourth argument of a tuple input.\nOne issue here is that everywhere else in the\u00a0Sympy and mpmath code, `prec` refers to binary precision and `dps` refers to decimal precision. But currently, the second argument to `Float` is called `prec`, but refers to the decimal precision. So ideally, it should be\n```\nFloat(s, dps=15, prec=53)\n```\nwhere `Float(s, prec=54)` would override the default value of `dps=15`, and calling both (even consistently), like `Float(s, dps=15, prec=54)` would be an error.\nSince the keyword argument name has to change, it would be a backwards compatibility break for anyone who calls Float like `Float(s, prec=20)`.  Ideally this would require a deprecation cycle, but it's not possible to detect if someone is calling `Float(s, prec=20)` meaning the old way (20 decimal digits) or the new way (20 binary digits). The good news is that `N` and `evalf` call this argument `n`, so there's no need to change things there.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context regarding the `Float` class and its usage across the codebase provides several insights crucial for addressing the issue:\n\n### Analysis of the `Float` Class Definition\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `Float` class in `sympy/core/numbers.py` represents floating-point numbers within the SymPy library. It includes methods for mathematical operations and properties that return various states or characteristics of the float object, such as its precision (`_prec`), whether it is finite, infinite, positive, negative, etc.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:**\n   - The constructor of the `Float` class (`__new__(cls, num, prec=None)`) accepts a `num` argument for the number itself and an optional `prec` argument. The issue arises with the interpretation of `prec`, which currently represents decimal precision, while elsewhere in SymPy and mpmath, `prec` stands for binary precision. The necessity for a clear distinction between binary precision (`prec`) and decimal precision (`dps`) is at the heart of the submitted issue.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n   - Ideally, the `Float` constructor should differentiate explicitly between binary precision (`prec`) and decimal precision (`dps`) when initializing new `Float` instances, aligning with the conventions used throughout the library and its dependencies. This suggests modifications are required for the `Float` class constructor to either accept a new parameter for binary precision or rename the current `prec` parameter to `dps` to correctly reflect its meaning and add a new `prec` parameter for binary precision.\n\n### Analysis of `Float` Constructor Usage:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The snippets that involve `Float(` across the codebase demonstrate various uses of the `Float` class, from creating new `Float` objects with specified precision to being involved in mathematical operations, simplifications, and assumptions. These snippets are found in various contexts from core functionality, simplification routines, assumption handling, to pretty-printing and plotting.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:**\n   - These usage contexts illustrate how the `Float` constructor's current behavior and parameter naming affect a wide range of functionalities within the SymPy library. Incorrectly assuming the meaning of `prec` can lead to misunderstandings or errors in numerical calculations, especially in scientific computations where precision is critical.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n   - The broad usage underscores the importance of implementing the fix carefully to avoid breaking changes or at least minimize their impact. The intended behavior would ensure that when developers use the `Float` constructor throughout the codebase, they can explicitly and clearly specify the desired precision type (binary or decimal) without ambiguity, improving the library's reliability and ease of use.\n\nGiven the analysis, the next steps would involve drafting a proposed solution that includes modifying the `Float` constructor to clearly differentiate between `dps` and `prec`, identifying areas of the codebase that will be affected by this change to assess the potential impact, and considering a strategy for introducing these changes that could include a deprecation warning or a transitional period to accommodate the backward-incompatible change."

This involves changing the method signature to allow both `dps` and `prec` as keyword arguments and implementing logic to handle cases where either, both, or none are provided by the user.\n    - The existing behavior of using `prec` as an approximation of decimal precision (which is actually interpreted as binary precision internally) needs to be preserved for backward compatibility.\n    - Add a deprecation warning when `prec` is used in the old sense (as decimal precision), advising users of the changed behavior and guiding them towards the new usage.\n    - Ensure that if both `dps` and `prec` are provided, the method raises an error to avoid ambiguity, unless a clear precedence rule is established.\n    - Implement logic to convert `dps` to `prec` internally if only `dps` is provided, maintaining the current mechanism of precision handling within the class while aligning with the user's expectations from the interface.\n\n- **Intended Global Behavior:**\n  - While the constructor change is central, this adjustment implies a need for a comprehensive review of the codebase to identify any direct uses of the `Float` constructor with the `prec` argument, ensuring they are updated or flagged for future update to align with the new usage methodology.\n  - Documentation and examples within the codebase must be updated to reflect these changes, highlighting the distinction between `dps` and `prec` and how to use them correctly.\n  - Additional unit tests might be required to cover cases with the new constructor signature, specifically testing the behavior when none, either, or both precision arguments are provided.\n"
