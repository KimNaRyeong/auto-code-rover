Given the description of the issue, it will be useful to look into the `Pipeline` class, its initialization, and any existing methods that relate to length or size determination.\n\nThus, I would suggest making the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Pipeline\")` - This will help us locate the `Pipeline` class within the codebase to understand its current implementation and structure.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__len__\", \"Pipeline\")` - To check if the `__len__` method is already implemented in the `Pipeline` class and how it's currently being handled if it exists.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__getitem__\", \"Pipeline\")` - Since the issue mentions indexing support (`pipe[:len(pipe)]`), it's also valuable to examine how the `__getitem__` method is implemented within the `Pipeline` class. This could provide insights into how the class handles indexing and whether there are implications for the `__len__` implementation."
