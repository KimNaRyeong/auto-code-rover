        "intended_behavior": "Implement the `__len__` method within the `Pipeline` class. This new method should return the number of steps in the pipeline. The implementation will be straightforward, leveraging the length of the `self.steps` list, which contains all the steps added to the pipeline. This allows users to use `len(pipe)` to get the total number of steps, facilitating operations like slicing the pipeline up to its total length without errors."
