Given the error and the constraints, I'll revise the approach without relying on external libraries like BeautifulSoup. To address concerns directly tied to Sphinx and potentially affecting links in documentation built through Sphinx, a more suitable method can be employed. This involves checking the output HTML files directly for the expected anchor format. Here's a standalone script designed to be executed in an environment where Sphinx is already configured, without assuming additional dependencies.

```python
import os
import subprocess

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_sphinx_project():
    os.makedirs("test_docs", exist_ok=True)
    with open("test_docs/conf.py", "w") as f:
        f.write("project = 'TestDocs'\n")

    with open("test_docs/index.rst", "w") as f:
        f.writelines([
            ".. py:function:: example_python_function(arg1, arg2)\n",
            "   :module: my_module\n\n",
            "   This function does something.\n"
        ])

def build_sphinx_project():
    try:
        subprocess.run(["sphinx-build", "-b", "html", "test_docs", "test_docs/_build"], check=True)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("\nFailed to build Sphinx project.")
        exit(1)

def verify_anchor_use():
    expected_anchor = "example-python-function"
    try:
        with open("test_docs/_build/index.html", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            if expected_anchor not in f.read():
                raise AssertionError(f"Expected anchor #{expected_anchor} not found in HTML.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    create_sphinx_project()
    build_sphinx_project()
    verify_anchor_use()
    print("The issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0.")
```

This script performs the following operations:
1. Creates a minimal Sphinx project with a single function documented in the `index.rst` file.
2. Builds the Sphinx project to generate HTML documentation.
3. Looks for the expected anchor format in the generated HTML documentation.

**Dependencies**: Ensure Sphinx is installed in your Python environment (`pip install sphinx`) to run the script successfully. This script operates under the assumption that Sphinx and its command line tools are properly set up in your environment. It directly inspects the generated HTML files for the existence of expected content, thus avoiding external dependencies for HTML parsing.

**Note**: Modify the path and filenames as required to fit the structure of the existing project or documentation needs.
