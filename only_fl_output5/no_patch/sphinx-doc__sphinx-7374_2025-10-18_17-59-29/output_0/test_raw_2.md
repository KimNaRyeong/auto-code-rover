Given the feedback and error from the previous attempt, let's re-evaluate the requirement for a standalone Python file `reproducer.py` to reproduce the specific issue related to Sphinx and Python IDs.

The primary challenge with the previous attempt was executing Sphinx and resolving dependency issues within the script. Notably, based on your description, the primary concern is to ensure we detect the change in the behavior of Python domain ID generation by Sphinx â€“ specifically, that underscores (`_`) in Python function names documented using Sphinx are now being converted to dashes (`-`) in the fragment identifiers within the generated HTML.

This revised approach focuses on directly capturing and inspecting the output of the Sphinx build process to check if the generated anchor tags match the expected format (underscores vs. dashes). Note that for this script to work, Sphinx must be correctly installed and configured in the environment where the script is executed.

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_test_documentation():
    test_dir = "test_docs"
    os.makedirs(test_dir, exist_ok=True)
    with open(os.path.join(test_dir, "conf.py"), "w") as f:
        f.write("project = 'TestProject'\n")
    with open(os.path.join(test_dir, "index.rst"), "w") as f:
        f.write(".. py:function:: example_python_function(foo)\n\n   This is a test function.\n")
    return test_dir

def build_sphinx(test_dir):
    cmd = ["sphinx-build", "-b", "html", test_dir, os.path.join(test_dir, "_build")]
    subprocess.run(cmd, check=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

def check_for_issue(test_dir):
    build_output_dir = os.path.join(test_dir, "_build")
    with open(os.path.join(build_output_dir, "index.html"), "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        contents = f.read()
        # Checking for both possible anchor formats
        if "#example_python_function" not in contents and "#example-python-function" in contents:
            print("Issue present: Function ID contains dashes instead of underscores.")
            sys.exit(1)
        elif "#example_python_function" in contents:
            print("No issue found: Function ID contains underscores.")
        else:
            raise AssertionError("Unexpected state: Anchor tag for function not found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_dir = create_test_documentation()
        build_sphinx(test_dir)
        check_for_issue(test_dir)
        print("The issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
```

**Instructions:**
- Place this script in the root directory of your Sphinx project or ensure it is executed in a location where it's safe to generate and delete a `test_docs` directory.
- Your environment must have Sphinx installed (`pip install sphinx`). The version of Sphinx should be the one where you want to test the presence of the issue.
- Run the script using Python 3.

This script creates a minimal Sphinx project with a single documented Python function, then builds the project and checks the generated HTML file for the presence of the relevant anchors. If the underscore-to-dash behavior is detected, it exits with code 1, indicating the issue is present.
