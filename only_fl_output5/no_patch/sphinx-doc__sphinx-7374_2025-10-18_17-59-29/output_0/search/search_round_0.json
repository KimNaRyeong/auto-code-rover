        "content": "To effectively address the described issue, it's necessary to understand several aspects of the codebase where the change from underscores to dashes in Python function anchor IDs occurred. Given the nature of the problem, it appears to involve the Sphinx documentation tool, particularly its handling of Python domain objects in the documentation.\n\nFirst, we need to identify where in the Sphinx codebase this change might have been introduced. It's logical to start by looking into how Sphinx generates anchor IDs for Python functions. Here are the API calls I would make to gather the required information:\n\n1. Search the entire codebase for any method or function responsible for generating these anchor IDs for Python functions. This operation looks for any relevant method name that suggests manipulation of anchor IDs for Python functions.\n   - `search_method(\"generate_anchor_id\")` \n\n2. Given that Sphinx plugins or extensions could also affect how these IDs are generated, specifically `nbsphinx`, which integrates notebooks with Sphinx, it's also important to search for instances where these IDs are specifically handled or modified by such extensions.\n   - `search_code(\"anchor ID\")`\n\n3. Since the issue mentions a specific PR or change (#7236), finding references to this within the code might directly lead us to the related code changes. This can be crucial for understanding the scope and rationale behind the change.\n   - `search_code(\"#7236\")`\n\nThese calls are aimed at piecing together a comprehensive understanding of where and how the modification from underscores to dashes in fragment identifiers happens within the Sphinx project or its associated plugins/extensions. The gathered information will then serve as a basis for devising a targeted patch."
