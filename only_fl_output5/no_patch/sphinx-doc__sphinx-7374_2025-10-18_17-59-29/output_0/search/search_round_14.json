Let\u2019s analyze this in the context of the issue described:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - This function, `get_id_from_cfg`, appears to take a string input (`text`) that begins with a specific pattern (`$cfg['`) and processes it to format an anchor ID. The specific processing or formatting rules are not entirely clear from the given snippet, as it only shows the removal of a portion of the text prefix.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - While this piece of code deals with formatting anchor IDs, it seems specific to `phpmyadmin`'s documentation extension rather than the Sphinx documentation tool, suggesting that there might not be a direct relationship. However, it does underscore a general theme within documentation tools and extensions: the need to dynamically generate anchor IDs from configuration or code symbols. This might hint at the broader technical context within which the reported Sphinx issue operates, indicating that changes to anchor ID formatting rules could have widespread effects.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior here is to format an anchor ID based on some textual configuration provided. For the described issue, an analogous function within Sphinx or its ecosystem might be expected to generate anchor IDs for Python functions, converting character patterns like underscores to dashes\u2014or previously doing so, leading to the reported regression. \n\n### Next Steps for Further Understanding\n\nSince the direct mention of PR #7236 and a method named something like `generate_anchor_id` failed to yield results, and the snippet found is not directly related to Sphinx or the issue at hand but rather to another project's documentation customization, we might need to refine our search strategy to get more context relevant to Sphinx and the issue described. \n\nConsidering Sphinx documentation closely interacts with Python objects, including functions, and the issue refers to ID generation migrating from underscores to dashes, a closer look at how Sphinx handles the documentation of Python domain objects and their identifiers would be valuable. Also, understanding how `nbsphinx` integrates with this mechanism could provide insights.\n\nFurther API Calls to Consider:\n1. **Search within Sphinx Documentation Components**: Since the issue likely lies within how Sphinx generates documentation for Python objects, searching for functions involved in this process might help.\n   - `search_method(\"add_target_and_index\")`\n   - `search_method(\"domain_for_python_objects\")`\n\n2. **Explore `nbsphinx` Integration**: Given the issue's impact on `nbsphinx`, investigating how this tool interacts with Sphinx to generate links to domain objects might reveal the cause.\n   - `search_code(\"nbsphinx\")`\n   - `search_code(\"python domain objects\")`\n\nThese searches aim to get closer to the mechanisms that could have been affected by the change in anchor ID formatting, leading to the issues with Sphinx documentation links."

It aims to distinguish between external links (which contain a colon before the `#`) and local fragment identifiers (which do not), ensuring only the latter are subject to certain processing.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  - While this code snippet is related to fragment identifiers, it specifically deals with the handling of URIs in the context of ePub building within Sphinx. This particular logic for distinguishing between types of URIs based on colons and fragment identifiers indicates that Sphinx has a mechanism in place for processing and potentially altering fragment identifiers, yet this snippet appears unrelated to the direct issue of changing anchor ID formats from underscores to dashes in Python documentation.\n\n- **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n  - The intended behavior of Sphinx, related to this issue, would be to correctly generate and handle internal fragment identifiers in a way that preserves consistency across documentation versions. This specific code snippet aims to ensure URIs are handled appropriately within ePub documents, which is slightly adjacent to the reported issue concerning link consistency due to anchor ID format changes. It shows the complexity of handling fragment identifiers but doesn't directly address the underscore-to-dash conversion.\n\n### Search result 2\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  - Here, the `write_doc` method in an `EpubBuilder` class is being overridden to, among other things, \"fix fragment identifiers\" within the document object model (doctree) of a Sphinx project. The method `fix_ids` is called with `doctree` as its argument, suggesting that this function manipulates IDs in the document tree.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  - This snippet is directly involved with adjusting fragment identifiers, which aligns more closely with the nature of the reported issue. Although the context is within ePub documentation building, the concept of \"fixing fragment identifiers\" could similarly apply to how Sphinx currently handles anchor ID generation for Python functions in HTML or other formats. The methodology or logic used here could mirror or provide insight into how Sphinx could handle or should handle the underscore-to-dash conversion issue across different documentation representations.\n\n- **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n  - Ideally, within the broader context of Sphinx document generation and not just ePub formatting, Sphinx would apply a consistent, clear approach when generating anchor IDs for Python functions. If changing formats from underscores to dashes, Sphinx should either:\n    - Provide backward compatibility by either generating both formats of IDs or allowing a configuration option to select the preferred ID format.\n    - Implement a redirection or aliasing mechanism that automatically maps older underscore-based IDs to the new dash-based format, preventing broken links both within the documentation and from external sources.\n\n### Further Context Needed\n\nGiven this understanding, it's evident that while we've found relevant discussion around fragment identifiers, the specific implementation details of how Sphinx transformed Python function anchor IDs from underscores to dashes remain unclear. It would be beneficial to further investigate either the Sphinx documentation generation process for HTML formats or to find specific logic related to transforming identifiers within Python domain documentation."

Specifically, looking into Python domain handling (potentially within files related to the Python domain or HTML generation modules) would be crucial.\n\n2. **Consult Project Documentation and Community**: Without specific search results to guide us, consulting the Sphinx project's official documentation for any mention of this change, checking the project's issue tracker for related discussions, and perhaps even reaching out on forums or community channels could provide insights or official stances on the change.\n\n3. **Local Testing**: Experiment with Sphinx on a local setup to observe the behavior of anchor ID generation for Python functions firsthand. Creating minimal test cases (e.g., documenting a Python function with underscores in its name) and examining the generated HTML could confirm the issue and provide clues to its origin in the code.\n\n4. **Check for Configuration Options**: There might be existing configuration options within Sphinx that influence how anchor IDs are generated and whether dashes or underscores are used.

Considering the nature of the issue, areas related to HTML generation, domain object processing, and specifically the handling of Python function names would be pertinent.\n\n2. **Community and Documentation Consultation**: Leverage the Sphinx community resources such as their GitHub repository, mailing lists, or forums. Someone might have already faced and solved this issue, or there might be documentation on the rationale behind the change from underscores to dashes in anchor IDs.\n\n3. **Configuration and Customization Review**: Sphinx offers extensive configuration options and the ability for customization through extensions. Review the Sphinx documentation for any settings that might influence how anchor IDs are generated or if there's a way to extend Sphinx to maintain or restore the previous behavior regarding underscores in anchor IDs.\n\n4. **Test Environment**: Set up a Sphinx project test environment to experiment with and observe the behavior of anchor ID generation for Python functions. This can also help you validate any potential fixes or workarounds you develop.\n\n5. **Contribute or Report**: If you identify a solution or if the issue remains unresolved but clearly understood, consider contributing to Sphinx by suggesting a feature or modification through a pull request or opening an issue if one does not already exist to highlight this behavior.\n\nUnfortunately, without the ability to further direct search API calls, the exploration must continue with these recommended steps outside of this dialog. Your initiative in manually exploring the codebase and engaging with the Sphinx documentation and community will be essential in addressing the reported issue."
