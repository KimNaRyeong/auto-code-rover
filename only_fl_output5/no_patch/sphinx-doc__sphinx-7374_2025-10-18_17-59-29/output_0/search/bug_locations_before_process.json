This could be achieved through an optional setting in the Sphinx configuration file (`conf.py`), allowing project maintainers to select their preferred ID format. For projects migrating to the new format, a mechanism to automatically redirect from the old underscored URLs to the new dashed URLs could prevent broken links, preserving the integrity of external references to the Sphinx-generated documentation."
