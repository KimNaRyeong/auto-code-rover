Given the nature of the problem, it appears to involve the Sphinx documentation tool, particularly its handling of Python domain objects in the documentation.\n\nFirst, we need to identify where in the Sphinx codebase this change might have been introduced. It's logical to start by looking into how Sphinx generates anchor IDs for Python functions. Here are the API calls I would make to gather the required information:\n\n1. Search the entire codebase for any method or function responsible for generating these anchor IDs for Python functions. This operation looks for any relevant method name that suggests manipulation of anchor IDs for Python functions.\n   - `search_method(\"generate_anchor_id\")` \n\n2. Given that Sphinx plugins or extensions could also affect how these IDs are generated, specifically `nbsphinx`, which integrates notebooks with Sphinx, it's also important to search for instances where these IDs are specifically handled or modified by such extensions.\n   - `search_code(\"anchor ID\")`\n\n3. Since the issue mentions a specific PR or change (#7236), finding references to this within the code might directly lead us to the related code changes. This can be crucial for understanding the scope and rationale behind the change.\n   - `search_code(\"#7236\")`\n\nThese calls are aimed at piecing together a comprehensive understanding of where and how the modification from underscores to dashes in fragment identifiers happens within the Sphinx project or its associated plugins/extensions. The gathered information will then serve as a basis for devising a targeted patch."

        "content": "Analyzing the information retrieved from the search operations:\n\n### Analysis of Found Code Snippet\n\nIn the given snippet from `phpmyadmin/docs/_ext/configext.py`, there is a function named `get_id_from_cfg` which formats an anchor ID from a config option. Let\u2019s analyze this in the context of the issue described:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - This function, `get_id_from_cfg`, appears to take a string input (`text`) that begins with a specific pattern (`$cfg['`) and processes it to format an anchor ID. The specific processing or formatting rules are not entirely clear from the given snippet, as it only shows the removal of a portion of the text prefix.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - While this piece of code deals with formatting anchor IDs, it seems specific to `phpmyadmin`'s documentation extension rather than the Sphinx documentation tool, suggesting that there might not be a direct relationship. However, it does underscore a general theme within documentation tools and extensions: the need to dynamically generate anchor IDs from configuration or code symbols. This might hint at the broader technical context within which the reported Sphinx issue operates, indicating that changes to anchor ID formatting rules could have widespread effects.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior here is to format an anchor ID based on some textual configuration provided. For the described issue, an analogous function within Sphinx or its ecosystem might be expected to generate anchor IDs for Python functions, converting character patterns like underscores to dashes\u2014or previously doing so, leading to the reported regression. \n\n### Next Steps for Further Understanding\n\nSince the direct mention of PR #7236 and a method named something like `generate_anchor_id` failed to yield results, and the snippet found is not directly related to Sphinx or the issue at hand but rather to another project's documentation customization, we might need to refine our search strategy to get more context relevant to Sphinx and the issue described. \n\nConsidering Sphinx documentation closely interacts with Python objects, including functions, and the issue refers to ID generation migrating from underscores to dashes, a closer look at how Sphinx handles the documentation of Python domain objects and their identifiers would be valuable. Also, understanding how `nbsphinx` integrates with this mechanism could provide insights.\n\nFurther API Calls to Consider:\n1. **Search within Sphinx Documentation Components**: Since the issue likely lies within how Sphinx generates documentation for Python objects, searching for functions involved in this process might help.\n   - `search_method(\"add_target_and_index\")`\n   - `search_method(\"domain_for_python_objects\")`\n\n2. **Explore `nbsphinx` Integration**: Given the issue's impact on `nbsphinx`, investigating how this tool interacts with Sphinx to generate links to domain objects might reveal the cause.\n   - `search_code(\"nbsphinx\")`\n   - `search_code(\"python domain objects\")`\n\nThese searches aim to get closer to the mechanisms that could have been affected by the change in anchor ID formatting, leading to the issues with Sphinx documentation links."

Given the information we have, without direct evidence of specific buggy files, classes, and methods within Sphinx's codebase that might be causing the reported issue, providing precise bug locations and their intended behaviors is speculative. However, we can theorize a relevant focus for the necessary fix based on the nature of the problem:\n\n- **Theoretical Bug Location**: The problem seems deeply related to the Sphinx codebase, possibly in the mechanisms it uses to generate anchor IDs for Python domain objects. Given that the issue involves a change in how these IDs are generated (moving from underscores to dashes), the bug (or change causing the issue) is likely in the file(s) and method(s) responsible for generating, formatting, or processing these identifiers during the documentation build process.\n\n- **Intended Behavior**: The ideal fix would ensure that anchor IDs generated for Python functions (and possibly other domain objects) either:\n  - Respect a configuration setting that allows users to choose between underscores and dashes for generated IDs, thereby supporting backward compatibility and linking integrity across different versions of the documentation. This could involve modifying the method responsible for ID generation to check for this setting and adjust its behavior accordingly.\n  - Or, introduce a systematic way to redirect or alias IDs generated with underscores to their new versions with dashes, preventing broken links without necessitating changes to external references pointing to the documentation.\n\nWithout the ability to execute more specific search API calls to pinpoint the exact location of the change or the current handling of anchor ID generation, these theoretical solutions aim to address the core issue described: preserving link integrity across documentation versions and external references post-change in ID formatting conventions."
