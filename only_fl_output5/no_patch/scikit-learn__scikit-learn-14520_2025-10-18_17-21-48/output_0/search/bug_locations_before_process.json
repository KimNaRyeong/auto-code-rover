        "intended_behavior": "The `fit_transform` method should incorporate the `copy` parameter effectively. This means replacing the hardcoded `copy=False` argument in the `_tfidf.transform(X, copy=False)` call with the method's `copy` parameter, which should be determined based on the user's input or a default value if none provided. This change would allow users to control whether the transformation operates on a copy of the input data or directly modifies it in place, aligning with the user's expectations and preserving the flexibility of method usage."
