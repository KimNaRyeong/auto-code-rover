        "intended_behavior": "This method should be corrected to ensure that the expansion of `polylog(1, z)` simplifies to `-log(1 - z)` directly, without introducing `exp_polar(-I*pi)`. The fix should verify that such a simplification accurately reflects the mathematical properties of `polylog` functions, especially around their branch points and cuts. The correction must maintain all existing functionality outside of this specific case (e.g., handling of other arguments and `polylog` orders), ensuring that only the incorrect introduction of `exp_polar(-I*pi)` is addressed. This will likely involve examining and possibly modifying conditional logic within `_eval_expand_func` that determines when and how `exp_polar(-I*pi)` is introduced into expressions."
