Here is an updated version of the `reproducer.py` script that addresses the previous mistake related to the missing import for the `log` function and corrects the expected outcomes to more precisely match the scenarios described in your instructions. Note that to properly handle complex numbers as expected outputs, this version thoroughly checks the structure of the expressions and their evaluations.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_polylog_2_issue():
    from sympy import polylog, Rational, log, pi, nsimplify, expand_func, Symbol

    # First issue reproduction attempt
    try:
        result = polylog(2, Rational(1, 2)).expand(func=True)
        expected_result = -log(2)**2/2 + pi**2/12
        # Calculating numerical approximation to compare with expected numerical result
        approx_result = result.evalf()
        expected_approx_result = expected_result.evalf()
        assert approx_result == expected_approx_result, f"Expected approx {expected_approx_result}, got {approx_result}"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

def test_polylog_1_issue():
    from sympy import polylog, symbols, expand_func, log, diff, exp_polar, I, simplify

    z = symbols('z')
    # Second issue reproduction attempt
    try:
        expanded = expand_func(polylog(1, z))
        expected = -log(1 - z)
        # Verifying if the expression unnecessarily includes exp_polar
        if expanded.has(exp_polar):
            raise AssertionError("Expanded polylog(1, z) includes unexpected exp_polar.")

        # Ensuring the derivative does not change unexpectedly
        derivative_original = diff(polylog(1, z), z)
        derivative_expanded = diff(expanded, z)
        if not simplify(derivative_original - derivative_expanded) == 0:
            raise AssertionError("Derivative mismatch after expansion.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

try:
    test_polylog_2_issue()
    test_polylog_1_issue()
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)

print("All checks passed successfully.")
exit(0)
```

This script tests for two distinct issues related to the `polylog` function in SymPy. It employs a precise assertion strategy to verify that the expansions and evaluations behave as expected according to the issues described. It carefully tests for the unnecessary inclusion of `exp_polar` in the expanded `polylog` function and checks that derivatives remain correct post-expansion. If any of the tests fail, it prints a detailed stack trace to help diagnose the problem.
