        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results, we can understand how the `__repr__` methods are implemented across the different constraint and index classes (`Index`, `UniqueConstraint`, `ExclusionConstraint`, and `CheckConstraint`) in Django's models. This analysis will help in identifying how to make their representations consistent as per the issue request.\n\n### 1. Index Class\n- **What it does:** The `__repr__` method for the `Index` class combines the class name with various attributes like fields, expressions, conditions, includes, and opclasses into a formatted string.\n- **Relation to the bug:** The formatting includes labeled attributes only if they are present, preventing cluttered outputs. This approach to formatting differs from the other classes, affecting consistency.\n- **Intended Behavior:** Should present a compact and informative representation, showing relevant attributes when they are not default values.\n\n### 2. UniqueConstraint Class\n- **What it does:** Similar to the `Index` class, `UniqueConstraint`'s `__repr__` method returns a string representation combining the class name with attributes like fields, name, condition, deferrable, include, and opclasses.\n- **Relation to the bug:** The method uses `%r` for some attributes and conditional inclusion of parts of the string based on the presence of attributes. It's formatted similarly to `Index` but with slight variations in style (e.g., `%r` and conditional prefix text like ' condition=%s').\n- **Intended Behavior:** Consistent labeling and format for attributes, ensuring the output is easily readable and informative.\n\n### 3. ExclusionConstraint Class\n- **What it does:** The `__repr__` method for `ExclusionConstraint` builds a string with the class name and attributes like index_type, expressions, condition, deferrable, include, and opclasses.\n- **Relation to the bug:** It uses a qualname for the class and includes more specific formatting, particularly focusing on comma separators and prefix text for clarity. This makes its representation structurally different from `Index` and `UniqueConstraint`.\n- **Intended Behavior:** Clearly displays the constraint's details with a focus on readability and inclusivity of all relevant properties.\n\n### 4. CheckConstraint Class\n- **What it does:** Offers a simpler `__repr__` that includes the class name, the check condition, and the name.\n- **Relation to the bug:** This class's representation is much simpler compared to the others, lacking the depth of conditionals and attributes shown in `Index`, `UniqueConstraint`, and `ExclusionConstraint`.\n- **Intended Behavior:** Provide minimum necessary details while being consistent with the formatting and detail level of other classes.\n\n### Summary\n\nGiven the issue's description and analyzing each related `__repr__` implementation, the intended behavior across all classes should ensure:\n1. Consistency in how attributes are labeled and formatted.\n2. Inclusion of conditionals for attributes to avoid representing defaults or None values unnecessarily.\n3. A standardized approach to represent complex and simple constraints and indexes alike, balancing between informativeness and readability.\n\nTo resolve the issue, we need to propose a format that aligns with these principles, ensuring all classes use a similar style for their `__repr__` methods. This would likely involve standardizing the use of `%r` for representations, deciding on conditional inclusion formatting (e.g., spacing, comma usage, prefixes like ' condition='), and ensuring each class's unique attributes are represented efficiently."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

Ensure this method's structure aligns with others in aesthetics and information delivery.\n\n- **Location 3:** \n  - **File:** django/contrib/postgres/constraints.py\n  - **Class:** ExclusionConstraint\n  - **Method:** `__repr__`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Adapt the `__repr__` method to follow the established patterns from `Index` and `UniqueConstraint` for a unified approach in attribute presentation. This includes standardizing how conditional attributes are displayed and ensuring the format remains clear and concise.\n\n- **Location 4:** \n  - **File:** django/db/models/constraints.py\n  - **Class:** CheckConstraint\n  - **Method:** `__repr__`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** While maintaining the simplicity fitting CheckConstraint's needs, ensure that the presentation of its attributes aligns with the other classes in terms of formatting and conditionality. This could mean adopting the same style of conditionally including attributes and using consistent representation formats.\n\nThe resolution involves standardizing the formatting, conditional attribute inclusion, and representation styles used in the `__repr__` methods across the different classes to achieve a uniform and predictable representation of these objects, preserving their individual functionalities while offering a consistent developer experience."
