Given your task to correctly reproduce the issue and your provided template for printing a stack trace, I'll create a corrected version of `reproducer.py`. This script should now correctly represent the scenario necessary to raise an `AssertionError` when the issue described is encountered and will exit accordingly. The error from the previous attempt seems to be related to the environment rather than the reproducer script itself. Please ensure your environment is correctly set up with a functional `scikit-learn` installation. 

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import label_ranking_average_precision_score

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_issue():
    truth = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=bool)
    scores = np.array([[0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]])
    sample_weight = [1.0, 1.0, 0.0]
    try:
        result = label_ranking_average_precision_score(truth, scores, sample_weight=sample_weight)
        expected_result = 0.625
        # Adopt a tolerance for floating-point arithmetic
        assert abs(result - expected_result) <= 1e-9, "Result does not match expected value."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        test_issue()
    except AssertionError:
        # If an AssertionError is caught, exit with a status code indicating failure
        exit(1)
    # If no error occurs, exit with a code indicating success
    exit(0)
```

This script aims to replicate the issue by:

1. Importing necessary dependencies from `numpy` and `scikit-learn`.
2. Defining `print_stacktrace()` as provided, to output detailed information about where an exception occurs.
3. Implementing `test_issue()` to test the specific behavior detailed in the issue description related to `label_ranking_average_precision_score`, particularly focusing on the handling of sample weights.
4. Using `try-except` to catch and print any `AssertionError`, utilizing `print_stacktrace()` for detailed debugging information.
5. Exiting with a status code indicating whether the issue was successfully reproduced (`1` for an error, `0` for success/no error).

Ensure your Python environment has the correct version of `scikit-learn` installed and configured properly to prevent the previous module not found errors.
