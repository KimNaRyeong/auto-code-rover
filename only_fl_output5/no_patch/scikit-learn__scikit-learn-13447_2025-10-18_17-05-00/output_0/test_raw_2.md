Given the detailed requirements and the function for printing a stack trace clearly, here is a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that should accurately reproduce the specified issue. This script will attempt to execute the scenario described, and it will raise an `AssertionError` if the actual results deviate from the expected behavior, indicating the presence of the issue. The script will print a detailed stack trace of the issue using the provided function and will exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed, showcasing the correct behavior.

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import label_ranking_average_precision_score

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Sample data from the issue description
    truth = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=bool)
    scores = np.array([[0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]])
    sample_weight = [1.0, 1.0, 0.0]

    try:
        # Calculate the label ranking average precision score with provided sample weights
        result = label_ranking_average_precision_score(truth, scores, sample_weight=sample_weight)
        # Expected result calculation needs to consider only the weighted samples
        expected_result = (0.5 + 0.75) / (1.0 + 1.0)  # Only two samples are considered due to their weights
        
        # Assert if the actual result deviates from the expected result
        assert np.isclose(result, expected_result), f"Expected result {expected_result}, but got {result}"
    
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e  # Re-raise the exception to indicate failure outside the try-except block

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except Exception as e:
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code 1 if an exception occurred, indicating the issue is present
    exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 if no exception occurred, indicating the issue is fixed
```

This script executes in a standalone manner; it imports the necessary dependencies, prepares the data as specified, calculates the metric with consideration for sample weights, and compares the result against the expected outcome. If the actual result deviates from the expected, an `AssertionError` is raised with a detailed stack trace for easier debugging. The script exits with code `0` if everything runs as expected (indicating the issue has been resolved), or code `1` if an exception is raised (indicating the issue is present).
