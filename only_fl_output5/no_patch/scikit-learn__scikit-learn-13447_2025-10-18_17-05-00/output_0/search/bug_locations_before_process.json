        "intended_behavior": "For the segment of the code handling samples with all labels either relevant or irrelevant (lines 728-732), the adjustment for `sample_weight` needs to be incorporated. This means, instead of just incrementing the output score (`out`) by 1 for each of these special cases, it should be incremented by `1 * sample_weight[i]` if `sample_weight` is not `None`. This change ensures that all samples are weighted appropriately, including those with no relevant labels or all relevant labels, thereby correcting the calculation of the metric and aligning it with the expected behavior where the sample weights impact the final score uniformly across all scenarios. To preserve the existing functionality (for scenarios without sample_weight), this adjustment should only apply when `sample_weight` is provided. This ensures that in cases without sample weighting, the logic and outcomes remain unaffected, maintaining backward compatibility and expected functionality."
