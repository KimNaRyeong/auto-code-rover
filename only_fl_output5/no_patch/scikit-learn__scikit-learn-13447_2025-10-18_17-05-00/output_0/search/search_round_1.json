Separately, individual samples whose labels are the same for all classes (all true or all false) are treated as a special case (precision == 1, [line 732](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7b136e9/sklearn/metrics/ranking.py#L732)). However, this special case bypasses the application of sample_weight ([line 740](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7b136e9/sklearn/metrics/ranking.py#L740)).  So, in the case where there is both non-default sample_weighting and samples with, for instance, zero labels, the reported metric is wrong.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\nSee example in [this colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19P-6UgIMZSUgBcLyR7jm9oELacrYNJE7)\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport sklearn.metrics\n# Per sample APs are 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 (default for zero labels).\ntruth = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=np.bool)\nscores = np.array([[0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]])\nprint(sklearn.metrics.label_ranking_average_precision_score(\ntruth, scores, sample_weight=[1.0, 1.0, 0.0]))\n```\n#### Expected Results\nAverage of AP of first and second samples = 0.625\n#### Actual Results\nSum of AP of all three samples, divided by sum of weighting vector = 2.25/2 = 1.125\n#### Versions\nSystem:\npython: 3.6.7 (default, Oct 22 2018, 11:32:17)  [GCC 8.2.0]\nexecutable: /usr/bin/python3\nmachine: Linux-4.14.79+-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-18.04-bionic\nBLAS:\nmacros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\nlib_dirs: /usr/local/lib\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\nPython deps:\npip: 19.0.3\nsetuptools: 40.8.0\nsklearn: 0.20.3\nnumpy: 1.14.6\nscipy: 1.1.0\nCython: 0.29.6\npandas: 0.22.0\n</issue>"

This method computes the label ranking average precision score (LRAP), a metric used in multi-label ranking problems. The steps in the code perform the following:\n\n1. **Initialization:** It initializes the output score to 0 and iterates through each sample in the input arrays (lines 722-724).\n\n2. **Special Case Handling:** For samples where all labels are either relevant (all true) or irrelevant (all false), it simply adds 1 to the output score, thereby assuming perfect ranking precision for these cases (lines 728-732).\n\n3. **Score Calculation for Normal Cases:** For samples with mixed relevance labels, it calculates a ranking score based on the relative ranks of true labels and adjusts this with the sample weight if provided (lines 733-740).\n\n4. **Normalization:** Finally, it normalizes the total output score by either the number of samples or the sum of sample weights, depending on whether sample weights were provided (lines 742-745).\n\n### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue lies in step 2, where the function handles samples with all labels being relevant or irrelevant. In the case described in the issue, when there are samples with zero (all false) labels, the code increments the output score by 1 for these samples without considering the sample weight. This oversight occurs because the sample weighting adjustment only applies in the regular score calculation block (lines 738-739), not in the special case handling block.\n\n### Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior should be that the sample weighting is considered consistently across all samples, regardless of their label configurations. This means altering the special case handling to account for sample weights in a manner similar to how it's done for the mixed relevance label samples. Specifically, when adding 1 to the output score for samples with all labels relevant or irrelevant, this value should be multiplied by the sample's weight, similar to the auxiliary score calculated for other samples (line 739). The oversight results in incorrect calculations for scenarios where sample weighting is intended to influence the overall metric, especially when there are samples with all labels irrelevant (all false), which should potentially contribute less or more differently based on their assigned weight.\n\nThis discrepancy leads to the reported bug where the metric's calculation does not correctly represent the intended influence of the sample weights, particularly noticeable in the given example with zero labels and non-uniform sample weights."

This means, instead of just incrementing the output score (`out`) by 1 for each of these special cases, it should be incremented by `1 * sample_weight[i]` if `sample_weight` is not `None`. This change ensures that all samples are weighted appropriately, including those with no relevant labels or all relevant labels, thereby correcting the calculation of the metric and aligning it with the expected behavior where the sample weights impact the final score uniformly across all scenarios.\n    \n    - To preserve the existing functionality (for scenarios without sample_weight), this adjustment should only apply when `sample_weight` is provided. This ensures that in cases without sample weighting, the logic and outcomes remain unaffected, maintaining backward compatibility and expected functionality.\n    \n    Thus, the code modification should resemble:\n    \n    ```python\n    if (relevant.size == 0 or relevant.size == n_labels):\n        # If all labels are relevant or unrelevant, the score is also\n        # equal to 1. The label ranking has no meaning.\n        if sample_weight is not None:\n            out += 1. * sample_weight[i]\n        else:\n            out += 1.\n        continue\n    ```\n    \n    This modification correctly integrates the sample weights into the calculation for all samples, handling the oversight and resolving the issue described."
