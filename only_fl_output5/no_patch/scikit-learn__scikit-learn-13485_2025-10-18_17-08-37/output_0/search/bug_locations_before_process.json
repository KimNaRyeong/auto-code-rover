        "intended_behavior": "This method should be modified to handle 3D input arrays for cases where such inputs are relevant (e.g., in pairs or sequences that need calibrating). Currently, the method might be invoking `check_array` with its default parameters (`ensure_2d=True, allow_nd=False`), which restricts inputs to 2D. The intended behavior here would be to adjust the invocation of `check_array` within the `fit` method, allowing 3D arrays when necessary. This could mean setting `allow_nd=True` selectively based on the nature of the base estimator or adding a parameter to `CalibratedClassifierCV`'s initialization, letting users specify when 3D inputs are expected, then using this parameter to conditionally adjust `check_array`'s behavior.\nThe adjustment should preserve existing functionality for all current use cases of `CalibratedClassifierCV`, ensuring compatibility with 2D inputs while extending support to 3D inputs where applicable. This means careful consideration must be given to not disrupt the expected structure and validation of inputs for the vast majority of use cases currently relying on 2D inputs."
