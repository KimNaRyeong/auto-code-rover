If we could, I'd be happy to provide a PR to do so\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the API calls regarding the `CalibratedClassifierCV` class, its use of `check_array`, and its occurrences in the codebase provides essential insights into the issue and potential steps towards a resolution.\n\n### Analysis of `CalibratedClassifierCV` class \n\nFrom the search result for `CalibratedClassifierCV` within `sklearn/calibration.py`, we know that this class is designed to calibrate probabilities of a classifier, which could be vital for producing reliable probability estimates from the predictions. It doesn't show direct usage of `check_array` from this outline, but knowing its file location is crucial for a deeper dive.\n\n### Analysis of `check_array` method\n\nThe `check_array` function from `sklearn/utils/validation.py` is designed to ensure inputs conform to specific requirements, like being of a certain dtype, having a minimum number of samples and features, and notably, being 2D unless `allow_nd` is true. It raises a ValueError if the input array is not 2D (`ensure_2d=True` by default) and `allow_nd=False` also by default, which prevents acceptance of ND arrays (3D in the case of the user's issue).\n\nGiven the issue description, the user encounters problems because their input to `CalibratedClassifierCV` involves 3D arrays, which `check_array` does not permit due to its configuration in this context.\n\n### Relationship with the Bug\n\nThe relationship between `check_array` and the bug is clear: the default validation behavior enforces 2D arrays and does not accept 3D arrays, which is problematic for the user's case with Weakly Supervised Learners where inputs can be 3D.\n\n### Intended Behavior\n\nGiven the issue, the intended behavior would be to allow `CalibratedClassifierCV` to process 3D arrays as inputs for calibration purposes. This change could involve adjusting how `check_array` is called within `CalibratedClassifierCV`'s `fit`, `predict_proba`, or any other method that processes input data, to set `allow_nd=True` or to circumvent the `check_array` constraints where it makes sense without compromising input validation integrity.\n\n### Next Steps for Code Analysis\n\nTo address the user's query efficiently, further analysis is needed in specific areas:\n\n1. **Investigate `CalibratedClassifierCV.fit` and related methods for `check_array` usage:** Since the methods `fit`, `predict_proba`, etc., are where inputs are processed, understanding how `check_array` is invoked here can pinpoint where adjustments are needed.\n\n2. **Understand how examples and related files use `CalibratedClassifierCV`:** This can show if there\u2019s precedent or related comments on handling non-standard inputs, providing insights or potential workarounds already in place or needed.\n\nBased on this analysis, it appears we need to dive deeper into the specific uses of `check_array` within the `CalibratedClassifierCV` methods to formulate a solution. We should start with examining how `fit` method of `CalibratedClassifierCV` interfaces with `check_array`."

Location 1: File: sklearn/calibration.py, Class: CalibratedClassifierCV, Method: fit. \n\n   **Intended Behavior:** This method should be modified to handle 3D input arrays for cases where such inputs are relevant (e.g., in pairs or sequences that need calibrating). Currently, the method might be invoking `check_array` with its default parameters (`ensure_2d=True, allow_nd=False`), which restricts inputs to 2D. The intended behavior here would be to adjust the invocation of `check_array` within the `fit` method, allowing 3D arrays when necessary. This could mean setting `allow_nd=True` selectively based on the nature of the base estimator or adding a parameter to `CalibratedClassifierCV`'s initialization, letting users specify when 3D inputs are expected, then using this parameter to conditionally adjust `check_array`'s behavior.\n   \n   The adjustment should preserve existing functionality for all current use cases of `CalibratedClassifierCV`, ensuring compatibility with 2D inputs while extending support to 3D inputs where applicable. This means careful consideration must be given to not disrupt the expected structure and validation of inputs for the vast majority of use cases currently relying on 2D inputs."
