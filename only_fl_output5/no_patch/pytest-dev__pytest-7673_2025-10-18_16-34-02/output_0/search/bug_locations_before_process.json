        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior is that the `_initial_handler_level` should be initialized to capture the logging level before any test begins and should be restored to this initial level after the test concludes, regardless of how many times `caplog.set_level()` is called within the test. When `caplog.set_level()` is called multiple times within a test, it should always reset the logging level to the intended level for the test's context but ensure that after the test concludes, the logging level is restored to what it was before the test started. Currently, because the implementation likely uses \"set\" instead of \"setdefault\" for `_initial_handler_level`, this restoration is incorrect if `caplog.set_level()` is called more than once. The fix should ensure that `_initial_handler_level` is only set the first time `caplog.set_level()` is called and not modified on subsequent calls, allowing for accurate restoration post-test. This may involve checking if `_initial_handler_level` has already been set and, if so, skipping its modification in further `set_level()` calls within the same test scope."
