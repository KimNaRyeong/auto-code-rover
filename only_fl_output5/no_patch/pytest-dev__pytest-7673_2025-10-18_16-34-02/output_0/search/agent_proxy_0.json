Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. **Search for the `caplog` class**: Since the issue involves a method called `set_level` that belongs to `caplog`, finding the class would be our priority. This will give us an overview of the class structure and its methods.\n   - `search_class(\"caplog\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `set_level` method within the `caplog` class**: To understand how `set_level` currently operates, especially in relation to modifying the `_initial_handler_level`.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"set_level\", \"caplog\")`\n\n3. **Search for usage of `_initial_handler_level`**: Understanding how `_initial_handler_level` is used and manipulated across the project will give insights into the issue, especially how it's being changed instead of being set as a default value initially.\n   - `search_code(\"_initial_handler_level\")`\n\nThese selected API calls aim to gather sufficient context around the `caplog` class, the `set_level` method, and the usage of `_initial_handler_level` to provide a solid foundation for crafting a fix for the reported bug."
