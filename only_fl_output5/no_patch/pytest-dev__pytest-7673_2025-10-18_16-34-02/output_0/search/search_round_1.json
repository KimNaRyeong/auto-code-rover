So if there are multiple calls to `caplog.set_level`, the level will be restored to that of the one-before-last call, instead of the value before the test.\nWill submit a fix for this shortly.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given the results from the initial set of API calls, it's clear we need to adjust our strategy. The inability to find the `caplog` class and method `set_level` within it suggests that `caplog` might not be a class or is part of a larger system or plugin mechanism, hence not directly searchable with the provided context. Given that `_pytest` is a testing framework, `caplog` could very well be a fixture or part of their logging system.\n\nHowever, finding occurrences of `_initial_handler_level` within `src/_pytest/logging.py` provides a valuable lead. The presence of this variable in the logging module is directly related to the issue. The problem described in the issue pertains to how `_initial_handler_level` is managed: it should be remembered before the first call to `caplog.set_level` and restored correctly after the test, even if `caplog.set_level` is called multiple times. The existing behavior, as per the bug report, suggests a flaw in how this restoration process is coded, likely replacing this value on subsequent `set_level` calls rather than maintaining the initial state.\n\n### What to Analyze Next\nTo understand and address the issue, we should focus on the following points:\n- **The implementation of `_initial_handler_level`**: How and where it's being initialized and modified. This would clarify why the level is restored incorrectly after multiple `set_level` calls.\n- **The flow of `set_level` calls**: Understanding the control flow that leads to `_initial_handler_level` being set incorrectly would highlight why the bug occurs and provide hints on how to fix it.\n- **The intended behavior vs. the current logic of handling `_initial_handler_level`**: Knowing what the code is meant to accomplish will guide the patch to ensure `_initial_handler_level` is handled as intended.\n\n### Next Steps in Code Analysis\nGiven the above understanding, the most logical next step is to dive deeper into the `logging.py` file to pinpoint the exact implementation details surrounding `_initial_handler_level` and `set_level`. This would involve:\n1. **Looking at the code around `_initial_handler_level`**: This can provide clues on its current use and mismanagement.\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"src/_pytest/logging.py\", line_number, window_size)` for each occurrence found, adjusting `line_number` and `window_size` accordingly.\n2. **Detailed examination of the `set_level` method in `logging.py`**: Since our initial search for `set_level` in `caplog` didn't yield results, but we know the action is associated with `_pytest/logging.py`, examining its implementation in the logging module will be crucial.\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"set_level\", \"src/_pytest/logging.py\")`\n\nThese steps will provide the necessary context to understand how `_initial_handler_level` is supposed to work versus how it currently works and offer insights into addressing the bug as reported."

Currently, because the implementation likely uses \"set\" instead of \"setdefault\" for `_initial_handler_level`, this restoration is incorrect if `caplog.set_level()` is called more than once. \n- The fix should ensure that `_initial_handler_level` is only set the first time `caplog.set_level()` is called and not modified on subsequent calls, allowing for accurate restoration post-test. This may involve checking if `_initial_handler_level` has already been set and, if so, skipping its modification in further `set_level()` calls within the same test scope."
