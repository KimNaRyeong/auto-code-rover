Certainly! Based on the instructions and guidelines you've provided, below is an updated standalone Python file named `reproducer.py`. This script is designed to reproduce the mentioned issue with `sympy`, and it uses the provided function to print a stack trace clearly. If the issue is present, the script will print the stack trace and exit with code 0. If the issue is fixed, an `AssertionError` should be raised since the expected exception wouldn't occur.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    from sympy import I, Symbol, cos, simplify
    x = Symbol('x')
    try:
        # This operation should raise a specific exception if the issue exists.
        simplify(cos(x)**I)
        # If no exception is raised, the issue might be fixed; assert to flag that.
        assert False, "No exception raised, issue might be fixed."
    except Exception as e:
        # Checking if the raised exception matches the expected issue.
        if "Invalid comparison of complex" in str(e):
            # Correct issue found; print stack trace and exit with code 0.
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(0)
        else:
            # An unexpected exception suggests a different issue; re-raise it.
            raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

This script works by attempting to execute the operation `simplify(cos(x)**I)` that is known to trigger the issue based on your description. If the specific error regarding the invalid comparison of complex numbers occurs, it captures the exception, prints a detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function, and exits with code 0 indicating the issue was successfully reproduced. If another type of error occurs or no error occurs (indicating a potential resolution of the issue), it behaves differently, either re-raising the unexpected error or asserting failure, to signal that the issue might have been fixed.
