Certainly! Based on the previous feedback and incorporating the necessary correction for the undefined name 'I', which should be imported from `sympy`, here's the revised `reproducer.py` script:

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import I, Symbol, cos, simplify

    x = Symbol('x')
    try:
        # Operation that is expected to raise an exception if the issue is present.
        result = simplify(cos(x)**I)
        # If the operation does not raise an exception, assert to ensure the script signals failure.
        assert False, "Expected an exception to be raised due to the issue."
    except Exception as e:
        # Check if the exception raised is because of the reported issue.
        if "Invalid comparison of complex" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            # Exit with code 0 to indicate that the issue is reproduced successfully.
            exit(0)
        else:
            # If the issue encountered is not as expected, raise the exception to avoid hiding other problems.
            raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This updated script now correctly imports the `I` symbol from `sympy`, which represents the imaginary unit necessary for the test. Upon running this script in an environment where the issue is present, it should raise an `AssertionError` as intended if the issue is not triggered, or exit with code 0 if the issue regarding "Invalid comparison of complex I" is successfully reproduced.
