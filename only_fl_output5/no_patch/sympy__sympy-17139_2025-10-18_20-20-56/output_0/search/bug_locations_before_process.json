        "intended_behavior": "The `TR6` method should include a conditional check to handle cases where the exponent of the `cos` function is a complex number, specifically the case of raising to the power of `I`. Before attempting transformations like `cos(x)**2` to `1 - sin(x)**2`, the method should verify the type of the exponent. If the exponent is complex, the method should either leave the expression unchanged or apply a more suitable transformation that correctly handles complex numbers. This change would prevent the method from proceeding to comparisons or transformations that are invalid for complex numbers, thereby avoiding the TypeError."

        "method": "__lt__",
        "intended_behavior": "The comparison method `__lt__` should include improved logic for handling comparisons involving complex numbers more gracefully. Given the symbolic nature of SymPy expressions, the method might not always be able to concretely determine the comparison result between complex terms. In such cases, rather than raising a TypeError, it should return a symbolic representation of the comparison or a representation that acknowledges the indeterminate nature of the comparison. This would allow SymPy to continue its symbolic manipulations without unhandled exceptions. This solution implies a deeper change in how SymPy's core deals with complex comparisons, possibly requiring enhancements in the symbolic comparison infrastructure to more elegantly handle or defer complex number comparisons."
