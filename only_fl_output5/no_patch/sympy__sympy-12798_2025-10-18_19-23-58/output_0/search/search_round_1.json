Given this information, the most relevant API calls to make in this situation are:\n\n1. Search for where the `ff` and `rf` functions are defined or used. As these could be method names or part of code snippets depending on their implementation (like if they are standalone functions or part of a class), relevant API calls include:\n   - `search_method(\"ff\")`\n   - `search_method(\"rf\")`\n\n2. After identifying the files or classes they reside in from the above calls, if it turns out they are part of a specific class, additional specific calls might be needed such as:\n   - `search_class_in_file(class_name, file_name)` -- The `class_name` and `file_name` will be decided based on the output from the initial searches.\n   \nGiven we are aiming to revert a change, pinpointing the exact location and doing a direct comparison with the mentioned pull request would allow us to identify what needs to be reverted efficiently."

Alternatively, `ff` and `rf` could be snippets of code, variables, or part of a larger method or function. This necessitates a different approach to locate the context of the issue:\n\n1. Because the direct search for these methods yielded no results, it is possible that `ff` and `rf` could be implemented within a larger context or even as part of specific utility functions or classes that do not directly expose these names as method names. Since `ff` and `rf` are often used in mathematical contexts, they could be part of a specialized module within SymPy that deals with combinatorial functions or number theory.\n\n2. **What other API calls can be made to get more context?**\n   - `search_code(\"ff\")`: Since `ff` might not be a standalone method, searching for it within code snippets might reveal where and how it is used or defined.\n   - `search_code(\"rf\")`: Similarly, searching for `rf` within code snippets can provide clues to its usage or definition.\n\nGiven the need to revert changes indicated in the issue, it's constructive to identify where the `ff` and `rf` functionalities are employed in the codebase first and then map these findings back to the changes introduced in the specified pull request. The intent here is to understand the implementation context as well as how these identifiers are used, which will guide the reverting process."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).
