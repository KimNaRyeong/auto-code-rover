Given this information, the most relevant API calls to make in this situation are:\n\n1. Search for where the `ff` and `rf` functions are defined or used. As these could be method names or part of code snippets depending on their implementation (like if they are standalone functions or part of a class), relevant API calls include:\n   - `search_method(\"ff\")`\n   - `search_method(\"rf\")`\n\n2. After identifying the files or classes they reside in from the above calls, if it turns out they are part of a specific class, additional specific calls might be needed such as:\n   - `search_class_in_file(class_name, file_name)` -- The `class_name` and `file_name` will be decided based on the output from the initial searches.\n   \nGiven we are aiming to revert a change, pinpointing the exact location and doing a direct comparison with the mentioned pull request would allow us to identify what needs to be reverted efficiently."
