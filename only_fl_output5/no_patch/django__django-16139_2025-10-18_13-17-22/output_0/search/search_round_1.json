        "content": "<issue>Accessing UserAdmin via to_field leads to link to PasswordResetForm being broken (404)\nDescription\n(last modified by Simon Kern)\nAccessing the UserAdmin via another model's Admin that has a reference to User (with to_field set, e.g., to_field=\"uuid\") leads to the UserAdmin being accessed via an url that looks similar to this one:\n.../user/22222222-3333-4444-5555-666677778888/change/?_to_field=uuid\nHowever the underlying form looks like this:\nCode highlighting:\nclass UserChangeForm(forms.ModelForm):\npassword = ReadOnlyPasswordHashField(\nlabel=_(\"Password\"),\nhelp_text=_(\n\"Raw passwords are not stored, so there is no way to see this \"\n\"user\u2019s password, but you can change the password using \"\n'<a href=\"{}\">this form</a>.'\n),\n)\n...\n...\ndef __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\nsuper().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\npassword = self.fields.get(\"password\")\nif password:\npassword.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")\n...\n...\nThis results in the link to the PasswordResetForm being wrong and thus ending up in a 404. If we drop the assumption that UserAdmin is always accessed via its pk, then we're good to go. It's as simple as replacing password.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\") with password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")\nI've opened a pull request on GitHub for this Ticket, please see:\n\u200bPR\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context sheds light on how the issue at hand relates to the code within the `UserChangeForm` class defined in `django/contrib/auth/forms.py`.\n\n### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `UserChangeForm` class includes a `password` field defined as a `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField`. The help text for this field is designed to inform the user that raw passwords are not stored and provides a link to a form where the password can be changed. The `__init__` method for this class dynamically sets the help text for the password field, formatting it with a relative path meant to lead to the password change form.\n\n### Relationship between this part of the code and the bug\n\nThe bug emerges from the way the help text's link is formatted within the `__init__` method. The formulation `password.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")` assumes that the `UserChangeForm` is always accessed in a certain way\u2014that is, directly from a detail view of a user where the user ID (or primary key) is the distinguishing URL component. However, when accessed through another admin interface using a field other than the primary key (e.g., `to_field=\"uuid\"`) to access the `UserChangeForm`, this relative path calculation leads to an incorrect URL for the password change form, hence resulting in a 404 error when the link is followed.\n\n### Intended behavior of this part of the code\n\nThe intended behavior would be for the help text's link to correctly lead to the password change form, regardless of how the `UserChangeForm` is accessed. Since the issue description suggests modifying the link to accommodate access via a non-primary key field, an appropriate fix would involve adjusting the relative path in such a way that it remains valid regardless of the path used to reach the form.\n\nGiven this analysis, the fix proposed in the issue description appears to direct towards a more flexible and accurate handling of the help text's link, ensuring it resolves correctly by dynamically constructing the URL based on the instance's primary key. This would necessitate replacing the static path construction with a dynamic one that reflects the current user's ID in the URL, thus ensuring the link to the password change form is always correct.\n\nTo proceed towards a solution, it might be prudent to consider examining how URLs are typically constructed within Django admin to handle instances with non-default `to_field` attributes, ensuring our proposed fix aligns with best practices and existing patterns within Django."

Bug Location:\n   - File: django/contrib/auth/forms.py\n   - Class: UserChangeForm\n   - Method: __init__\n\nIntended Behavior:\nThe intended behavior at this bug location is to ensure that the help text's link to the password change form dynamically adjusts according to the user's unique identifier, ensuring it remains valid and leads to the correct destination, regardless of how `UserChangeForm` is accessed. This involves altering the static relative path calculation to dynamically generate the URL based on the instance's primary key (or another unique field specified by `to_field`) if accessed through another admin interface with `to_field` set.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the method should be updated from:\n\n```python\npassword.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")\n```\n\nto something that dynamically incorporates the user's unique identifier (e.g., primary key or a UUID if `to_field=\"uuid\"`) into the path, such as:\n\n```python\n# Assuming self.instance.pk is the way to access the primary key\n# and self.instance can reliably access the current user instance\nif self.instance and self.instance.pk:\n    password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")\nelse:\n    password.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")  # Fallback for safety\n```\n\nThis modification takes into account instances where `self.instance` might be `None` or `self.instance.pk` might not be set, providing a fallback to preserve existing functionality. The code dynamically constructs the path based on the user's primary key, ensuring the link is always correct, thereby preventing the 404 error from occurring when accessing the password reset form through different paths."
