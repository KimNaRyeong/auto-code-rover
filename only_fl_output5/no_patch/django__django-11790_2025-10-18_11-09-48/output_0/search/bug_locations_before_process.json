        "intended_behavior": "The `username` field within the `AuthenticationForm` should include a `maxlength` HTML attribute. The precise length should either reflect a sensible default that aligns with the underlying database field's maximum length (typically, a `username` might have a maximum length of 150 characters in many Django projects, but this should be confirmed against the project's specific user model) or be configurable via an attribute or setting to maintain flexibility.\n\nTo resolve the issue while preserving existing functionality, the definition of the `username` field in the `AuthenticationForm` class needs to be adjusted to include the `maxlength` attribute within the `attrs` dictionary of the `TextInput` widget. Considering the snippet from the search result, a line setting the `maxlength` could be added as follows:\n\nclass AuthenticationForm(forms.Form):\n    username = UsernameField(widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={'autofocus': True, 'maxlength': '150'}))  # assuming 150 is the intended maximum length\n\nThis change ensures the front-end HTML form will not allow more characters than specified to be entered into the `username` field, aligning with the intended behavior to prevent excessively long inputs, thereby improving usability and security. It directly addresses the regression by reintroducing an attribute that was once present but has been removed or omitted following recent changes."
