        "intended_behavior": "This method currently determines whether to use `*` or `.*` for multiplication and does so based on the type of the operands, specifically using `.*` for element-wise multiplication when the operands are not purely numerical. To resolve the issue, the method should be modified to ensure that spaces are inserted around these operators. Besides maintaining the existing decision logic for choosing between `*` and `.*`, it should format the output string such that binary operators are always surrounded by spaces, especially around `.*`. This change aims to eliminate syntax ambiguity in Julia without altering the core functionality of expression conversion from SymPy to Julia. For instance, generating `(x .^ 2 .* y) * A ^ 3` instead of `(x.^2.*y)*A^3`, which adheres to Julia's syntax requirements and preserves readability. The modification should carefully handle edge cases to ensure that added spaces do not disrupt the correct interpretation of Julia code, particularly in expressions involving a mix of numeric literals and variables/functions."
