Therefore, understanding how these verbose names are normally accessed and displayed will be crucial.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are the specific API calls I would make:\n\n- `search_code(\"LogEntry\")`\n- `search_code(\"history\")`\n- `search_code(\"verbose_name\")`\n\nThese calls should help find where and how model changes are logged, how the logging mechanism retrieves field names, and potentially where verbose names should be integrated but are currently overlooked.\n"

Let's address each of the search results to better understand the possible locations for the bug and determine a plan of action.\n\n### LogEntry\n\nThe `LogEntry` mentions across different Django admin files (`models.py`, `utils.py`, `options.py`, etc.) imply that this model or object is closely tied to the logging of administrative actions, including the change history of models. Given the issue at hand:\n- **What does this part of the code do?** It's likely responsible for recording each log entry associated with CRUD operations in the admin panel.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The issue mentions that the history display does not use verbose names. The `LogEntry` handling code is a potential area where the actual field names are being logged instead of their verbose names.\n- **Intended behavior:** The code should ideally check for the existence of a verbose name for each field being changed and use it in the log entry instead of the field's code identifier.\n\n### History\n\nThe term \"history\" appearing mostly in `options.py` among other files suggests it's related to operations or configurations that manage or interact with historical records of model instances. \n- **What does this part of the code do?** This could be code that handles the viewing, tracking, or managing of change histories for model instances in the admin.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** Direct, since the issue is explicitly about the representation of changes in the administrative history of a model.\n- **Intended behavior:** The handling of history should incorporate checking for verbose names when recording field changes.\n\n### Verbose Name\n\nVerbose names are mentioned throughout many files, indicating widespread use of this feature across Django's model system.\n- **What does this part of the code do?** It's spread across model definitions and possibly the admin to ensure that human-readable names are used in place of technical field names in the UI.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The extensive presence of `verbose_name` in the model system yet its absence in the history logging suggests a disconnect or oversight. The code is likely not leveraging these verbose names in the context of history logging.\n- **Intended behavior:** Any part of Django that displays or logs field names for administrator consumption should utilize the verbose name where available.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Analysis\n\nBased on this analysis, the next steps would involve directly inspecting specific methods and classes where these mentions are densest, especially within the admin and model files related to history and verbose name handling. More precise API calls should aim to uncover:\n- How `LogEntry` objects are created and what data they include, especially with regard to field names.\n- The part of the `options.py` dealing with history to see how changes are recorded and retrieved.\n- How `verbose_name` properties are accessed and used across the system, focusing on admin views and model change logging.\n\nSpecific follow-up API calls that could yield valuable insights include:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"log_addition\", \"django/contrib/admin/options.py\")`\n- `search_method_in_file(\"log_change\", \"django/contrib/admin/options.py\")`\n- `search_method_in_file(\"__str__\", \"django/contrib/admin/models.py\")`\n- `search_code_in_file(\"verbose_name\", \"django/contrib/admin/options.py\")`\n\nThese targeted searches are intended to directly find the interactions of logging model changes, how field names are incorporated into those logs, and the potential for incorporating verbose names into that process.\n"

However, given the nature of the issue, we can hypothesize likely locations and what the intended behavior should be.\n\n### Hypothetical Bug Locations and Intended Behavior:\n\n#### Location 1:\n- **File:** `django/contrib/admin/models.py`\n- **Class:** `LogEntry`\n- **Method/Function:** Potentially in the method(s) responsible for constructing the log message for changes.\n- **Intended Behavior:** Ensure that when log entries are constructed, the verbose name of the field is used in place of the field's code identifier if a verbose name is defined. This logic might involve checking if the model field has a verbose_name attribute and using it in the change message, reverting to the default field name only if no verbose name is provided.\n\n#### Location 2:\n- **File:** `django/contrib/admin/options.py`\n- **Class:** The admin class managing the model (could vary based on the model).\n- **Method/Function:** Methods responsible for logging changes, such as `log_addition`, `log_change`, and/or any other custom method that constructs the description/message for history log entries.\n- **Intended Behavior:** Modify these methods to consult the model's field definitions for verbose names to use in log descriptions/messages. This involves ensuring that every time a field change is logged, the system checks for a verbose name to include in the log entry, making the history entries more readable and human-friendly.\n\nWithout further specific context or code inspection, detailing more precise bug locations might risk inaccuracies. The outlined intended behaviors aim to maintain existing functionality while enhancing the clarity and usefulness of admin history logs by utilizing verbose names."
