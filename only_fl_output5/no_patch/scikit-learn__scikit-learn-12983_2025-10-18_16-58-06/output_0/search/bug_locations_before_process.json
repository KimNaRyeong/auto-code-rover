        "intended_behavior": "If the issue involves the handling of sample weights with initial estimators that do not support them, the implementation needs to ensure that these weights are only applied where applicable or provide a fallback mechanism. This could mean introducing a check or compatibility layer within the gradient boosting initialization process to verify if the `init` estimator supports sample weights and handle cases where it doesn't, possibly by ignoring the weights or applying a default weighting mechanism that ensures the initial model fitting process proceeds without errors."
