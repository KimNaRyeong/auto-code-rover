        "intended_behavior": "The method `_preprocess_colors` should ensure that NA values within the `colors` data can be filled with a default color ('white') without raising an error, regardless of whether 'white' is initially a category in the data. To resolve the issue, the method must be adjusted to handle pandas categoricals gracefully. Before applying `fillna('white')`, the method should check if 'white' is a valid category within `colors`. If not, 'white' should be added to the categories of the colors data. This change must preserve the original functionality of replacing NA values with a background color, ensuring compatibility with both categorical and non-categorical data types in pandas."
