It's tripped me up on more than one occasion, and it seems a trivial feature to support, from my limited testing.\n>>> from django.template import Template, Context\n>>> tmpl = Template('{% include var %}')\n>>> ctx = Context({'var':'admin/base.html'})\n>>> ctx\n[{'var': 'admin/base.html'}]\n>>> tmpl.render(ctx)\n... some HTML output ...\n>>> ctx.update({'var':['admin/base.html', 'admin/fail.html']})\n{'var': ['admin/base.html', 'admin/fail.html']}\n>>> tmpl.render(ctx)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<console>\", line 1, in <module>\nFile \"/path/django/template/base.py\", line 140, in render\nreturn self._render(context)\nFile \"/path/django/template/base.py\", line 134, in _render\nreturn self.nodelist.render(context)\nFile \"/path/django/template/base.py\", line 823, in render\nbit = self.render_node(node, context)\nFile \"/path/django/template/debug.py\", line 74, in render_node\nreturn node.render(context)\nFile \"/path/django/template/loader_tags.py\", line 165, in render\ntemplate = get_template(template_name)\nFile \"/path/django/template/loader.py\", line 145, in get_template\ntemplate, origin = find_template(template_name)\nFile \"/path/django/template/loader.py\", line 138, in find_template\nraise TemplateDoesNotExist(name)\nTemplateDoesNotExist: ['admin/base.html', 'admin/fail.html']\nThe 'fix' is to change \u200bthis line from get_template to select_template, though this might now be slightly complicated by the recent changes in 5cdacbda034af928f5033c9afc7b50ee0b13f75c to allow for rendering of Template instances.\nChanging to select_template on 1.4 yields the results I'd expect:\n>>> from django.template import Template, Context\n>>> tmpl = Template('{% include var %}')\n>>> ctx = Context({'var':['admin/base.html', 'admin/fail.html']})\n>>> tmpl.render(ctx)\n... some HTML output ...\nBoth the above shell sessions assume django.contrib.admin is in INSTALLED_APPS.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, we need to focus on the specific classes, methods, and code statements mentioned in the issue. Based on the description, it's clear that the bug involves the way Django selects templates within the include tag functionality, specifically regarding the transition from `get_template` to `select_template` to allow for template fallbacks. The relevant files and methods include those related to template rendering like `get_template`, `find_template`, `select_template`, and the implementation of the `{% include %}` tag.\n\nGiven this, we will make the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `get_template` method to understand its current usage: `search_method(\"get_template\")`\n2. Search for the `select_template` method to understand its functionality and parameters: `search_method(\"select_template\")`\n3. Search for the code where the `{% include %}` tag is implemented, since the issue specifically points out changing a line related to this tag. It seems related to the rendering process within the include tag's functionality: `search_code(\"{% include var %}\")`\n4. Given the hint about a change in a commit (`5cdacbda034af928f5033c9afc7b50ee0b13f75c`), although we can't access the commit directly through an API call here, searching for any reference or changes might be relevant in nearby context or in comments within the code: `search_code(\"5cdacbda034af928f5033c9afc7b50ee0b13f75c\")` - however, given the format, it seems this specific call might not be directly supported, so let's focus on the accessible methods and implementations:\n5. Lastly, to get a precise location for the change, we need to identify where in the Django codebase the include tag calls `get_template`: `search_code(\"get_template(template_name)\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive context of how templates are loaded and rendered, specifically regarding the include tag's functionality and how it could be modified to support fallback templates through `select_template`."
