Based on the description, it's clear that the bug involves the way Django selects templates within the include tag functionality, specifically regarding the transition from `get_template` to `select_template` to allow for template fallbacks. The relevant files and methods include those related to template rendering like `get_template`, `find_template`, `select_template`, and the implementation of the `{% include %}` tag.\n\nGiven this, we will make the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `get_template` method to understand its current usage: `search_method(\"get_template\")`\n2. Search for the `select_template` method to understand its functionality and parameters: `search_method(\"select_template\")`\n3. Search for the code where the `{% include %}` tag is implemented, since the issue specifically points out changing a line related to this tag. It seems related to the rendering process within the include tag's functionality: `search_code(\"{% include var %}\")`\n4. Given the hint about a change in a commit (`5cdacbda034af928f5033c9afc7b50ee0b13f75c`), although we can't access the commit directly through an API call here, searching for any reference or changes might be relevant in nearby context or in comments within the code: `search_code(\"5cdacbda034af928f5033c9afc7b50ee0b13f75c\")` - however, given the format, it seems this specific call might not be directly supported, so let's focus on the accessible methods and implementations:\n5. Lastly, to get a precise location for the change, we need to identify where in the Django codebase the include tag calls `get_template`: `search_code(\"get_template(template_name)\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive context of how templates are loaded and rendered, specifically regarding the include tag's functionality and how it could be modified to support fallback templates through `select_template`."

This method is utilized for loading a single template by name.\n    - **Relation to Bug**: The issue at hand involves the `{% include %}` template tag, which currently uses `get_template` to load a specified template. The problem arises when multiple template options are given for fallback purposes, as `get_template` does not support an iterable of template names and hence, cannot select from multiple template options.\n    - **Intended Behavior**: Ideally, the part of the code using `get_template` within the `{% include %}` tag functionality should be modified to use `select_template` instead, which supports an iterable of template names, allowing fallback options if the primary template is not found.\n\n2. **`select_template` Method Context**:\n    - `select_template` is specifically designed to take an iterable of template names and return the first template found that can be successfully loaded. It's found in **`django/template/loader.py`** and **`django/template/engine.py`**.\n    - **Relation to Bug**: This method is directly relevant to the issue as switching from `get_template` to `select_template` within the `{% include %}` implementation would allow for the intended fallback mechanism.\n    - **Intended Behavior**: Upon modification, when the `{% include %}` tag is used with an iterable of template names, `select_template` would attempt to load each template in order until one is found, thereby avoiding the `TemplateDoesNotExist` exception for lists of template names.\n\n3. **Search for `{% include var %}`**:\n    - This search did not return results, indicating a need for more specific or alternative search terms, perhaps looking directly into the implementation files for the include tag (e.g., searching within the **`django/template/loader_tags.py`** file directly).\n\n4. **Occurrences of `get_template(template_name)`**:\n    - Found within **`django/template/loader_tags.py`** among other files, this specific code snippet is likely where the adjustment needs to be made for the `{% include %}` tag.\n    - **Relation to Bug**: This directly correlates with the described issue as this snippet represents the current method by which templates are loaded within certain functionalities, including the include tag. The issue stems from this method not supporting multiple fallback templates.\n    - **Intended Behavior**: By adjusting the use of `get_template` to `select_template`, the system should be capable of intelligently selecting from multiple provided templates, enhancing flexibility and error handling.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps involve diving deeper into the specific implementation of the `{% include %}` tag, especially within **`django/template/loader_tags.py`**. This would involve examining how `get_template` is currently used and planning its replacement with `select_template` for supporting template fallbacks as intended by the issue's description. This means we should specifically look into the `django/template/loader_tags.py` to understand and eventually modify the include tag's implementation. \n\nBased on this evaluation, the appropriate next step would be to inspect the usage of `get_template` within **`django/template/loader_tags.py`** more closely:\n\n- **API Call**: `search_code_in_file(\"get_template\", \"django/template/loader_tags.py\")` - This will provide the specific usage within the context of the `{% include %}` tag implementation."

The intended behavior is to modify this implementation to use `select_template` instead. This change would allow the `{% include %}` tag to accept an iterable of template names (`var` becoming a list of template names) and use the first template that exists, rather than failing when the first option does not exist. This maintains the existing functionality for single template names while extending versatility to support fallback templates. This adjustment would thus enable template fallback mechanism, reinforcing Django's robust template rendering capabilities and addressing the issue of template loading inflexibility highlighted in the submitted issue.\n  \nThe targeted modification should preserve all existing functionality when a single template name is provided, ensuring backward compatibility and enhancing the feature set to include fallback capabilities for template selection. This approach adapts the `select_template` method's ability to iterate over multiple template options, providing a seamless fallback mechanism that aligns with Django's design principles of ease and flexibility in web development practices."
