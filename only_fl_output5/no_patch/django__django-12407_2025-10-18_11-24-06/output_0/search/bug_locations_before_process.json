        "intended_behavior": "This method or section of code currently uses `get_template` to load a single template specified by the `var` variable in the `{% include var %}` syntax. The intended behavior is to modify this implementation to use `select_template` instead. This change would allow the `{% include %}` tag to accept an iterable of template names (`var` becoming a list of template names) and use the first template that exists, rather than failing when the first option does not exist. This maintains the existing functionality for single template names while extending versatility to support fallback templates. This adjustment would thus enable template fallback mechanism, reinforcing Django's robust template rendering capabilities and addressing the issue of template loading inflexibility highlighted in the submitted issue."
