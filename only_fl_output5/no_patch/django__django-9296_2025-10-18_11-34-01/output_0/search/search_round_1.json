        "content": "The collected context provides important insights into the `Paginator` class located in `django/core/paginator.py`. Let's analyze the results:\n\n### 1. Paginator Class Definition and Methods\n\nThe `Paginator` class as it stands has several methods crucial for paginating a dataset, such as `validate_number`, `page`, `_get_page`, along with properties like `count`, `num_pages`, and notably, `page_range`.\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n\n- **Paginator class**: Provides functionality to paginate lists or querysets into Page objects that contain items for individual pages.\n- **validate_number method**: Validates that a given page number is within the valid range of pages.\n- **page method**: Given a page number, it returns a Page object that represents the items on that page. It does range checking and calculates the indices for slicing the object list.\n- **page_range property**: Generates a range of numbers representing valid page numbers that can be iterated over, usually within template for loops.\n\n#### Relationship With the Bug\n\nThe issue isn't describing a bug per se but suggests an enhancement for the `Paginator` class to make it more Pythonic and easier to use by implementing the `__iter__` method. This enhancement would allow users to directly iterate over Paginator instances, implicitly iterating over pages, without explicitly relying on `page_range` for iteration.\n\n#### Intended Behavior With the Issue Description\n\n- **After the enhancement**: Rather than using `paginator.page_range` to get an iterable of page numbers and then manually fetching each page with `paginator.page(number)`, we should be able to directly iterate over the paginator object using a for loop, which under the hood would iterate through all available pages, likely using the `page` and `page_range` methods to achieve this.\n\nIn essence, the enhancement would simplify iterating over pages in a Paginator instance, making code that works with paginated lists or querysets cleaner and more intuitive.\n\nThe next steps towards implementing this enhancement would involve adding an `__iter__` method to the `Paginator` class in `django/core/paginator.py`, utilizing the `page_range` to loop through pages and yielding each page through the already defined `page` method. This aligns well with the suggested implementation presented in the issue."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

The new method should allow users to iterate over the `Paginator` instance directly, which in turn iterates over all its pages seamlessly. This method should leverage the existing `page` and `page_range` methods to yield each page in sequence. Specifically, the `__iter__` method should:\n\n    1. Iterate through the `page_range` of the paginator to access each page number.\n    2. For each page number, it should call the `page` method to retrieve the `Page` object.\n    3. Yield this `Page` object, allowing the entire paginator to be iterated over in a loop.\n\n  This enhancement will make the Paginator more Pythonic and intuitive to use, preserving all existing functionality while adding a new, convenient way to iterate over paginated results."
