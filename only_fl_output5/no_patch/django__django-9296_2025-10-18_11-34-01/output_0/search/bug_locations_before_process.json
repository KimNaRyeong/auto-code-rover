        "intended_behavior": "The task at this location is not to fix a bug but to enhance the existing functionality by adding an `__iter__` method. The new method should allow users to iterate over the `Paginator` instance directly, which in turn iterates over all its pages seamlessly. This method should leverage the existing `page` and `page_range` methods to yield each page in sequence. Specifically, the `__iter__` method should:\n\n1. Iterate through the `page_range` of the paginator to access each page number.\n2. For each page number, it should call the `page` method to retrieve the `Page` object.\n3. Yield this `Page` object, allowing the entire paginator to be iterated over in a loop.\n\nThis enhancement will make the Paginator more Pythonic and intuitive to use, preserving all existing functionality while adding a new, convenient way to iterate over paginated results."
