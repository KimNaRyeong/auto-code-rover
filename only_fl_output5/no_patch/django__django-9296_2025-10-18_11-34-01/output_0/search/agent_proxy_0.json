Specifically, I'll need information about the `__iter__`, `page_range`, and `page` methods referenced in the issue description. The goal is to enable iteration over Paginator objects more naturally by implementing an `__iter__` method as suggested. Given this, I will perform the following API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the Paginator class**: This will help me locate the file(s) where the Paginator class is defined.\n   - `search_class(\"Paginator\")`\n\n2. **Search for the page method in Paginator class**: Since the issue describes adding an `__iter__` method that relies on the `page` method, understanding its current implementation will be crucial.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"page\", \"Paginator\")`\n\n3. **Search for the page_range method in Paginator class**: Identifying the `page_range` method's implementation will provide insight into its current use and how it can be leveraged inside the `__iter__` method.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"page_range\", \"Paginator\")`"
