        "intended_behavior": "The line causing the issue attempts to use the unary negation '-' operator on a boolean array, which is incorrect in this context and leads to a 'TypeError'. To resolve the issue, this operator should be replaced with a correct array manipulation method that respects the boolean nature of the data. The replacement could involve using logical negation such as '~' or a function like 'numpy.logical_not' for inverting the boolean mask correctly. This change would ensure that when boolean arrays (like 'X_bool') are processed, the code does not throw a 'TypeError'. The existing functionality for non-boolean data should remain unaffected by this change."
