A search for this operation in the context of `HuberRegressor` may reveal where the adaptation needs to be made.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"-axis0_safe_slice\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls are aimed at pinpointing the exact location and implementation details of the error, thereby enabling a focused approach to crafting a patch."
