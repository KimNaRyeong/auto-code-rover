        "intended_behavior": "The `fit` method should allow `X` to be more than just numeric arrays or sparse matrices. It should perform validation in a way that if the base estimator can handle more diverse data formats (e.g., text blobs), the method should not block such data types. This means possibly delegating more of the type and format validation of `X` to the base estimator itself or relaxing the type checks while preserving checks that ensure `X` meets basic requirements for the fitting process to proceed without errors."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to the AdaBoostClassifier, the `fit` method here should also relax the input validation for `X` to accommodate a wider variety of data types, assuming the base estimator can handle them. Validation logic should be adapted to ensure necessary conditions for `X` are met without enforcing it to be strictly numeric or sparse matrices."
