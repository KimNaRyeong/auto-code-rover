420 
421     Parameters
422     ==========
423 
424     expr : Expr
425         A sympy expression to be converted.
426     assign_to : optional
427         When given, the argument is used as the name of the variable to which
428         the expression is assigned. Can be a string, ``Symbol``,
429         ``MatrixSymbol``, or ``Indexed`` type. This is helpful in case of
430         line-wrapping, or for expressions that generate multi-line statements.
431     precision : integer, optional
432         The precision for numbers such as pi [default=15].
433     user_functions : dict, optional
434         A dictionary where keys are ``FunctionClass`` instances and values are
435         their string representations. Alternatively, the dictionary value can
436         be a list of tuples i.e. [(argument_test, cfunction_string)]. See below
437         for examples.
438     human : bool, optional
439         If True, the result is a single string that may contain some constant
440         declarations for the number symbols. If False, the same information is
441         returned in a tuple of (symbols_to_declare, not_supported_functions,
442         code_text). [default=True].
443     contract: bool, optional
444         If True, ``Indexed`` instances are assumed to obey tensor contraction
445         rules and the corresponding nested loops over indices are generated.
446         Setting contract=False will not generate loops, instead the user is
447         responsible to provide values for the indices in the code.
448         [default=True].
449     source_format : optional
450         The source format can be either 'fixed' or 'free'. [default='fixed']
451     standard : integer, optional
452         The Fortran standard to be followed. This is specified as an integer.
453         Acceptable standards are 66, 77, 90, 95, 2003, and 2008. Default is 77.
454         Note that currently the only distinction internally is between
455         standards before 95, and those 95 and after. This may change later as
456         more features are added.
457 
458     Examples
459     ========
460 
461     >>> from sympy import fcode, symbols, Rational, sin, ceiling, floor
462     >>> x, tau = symbols("x, tau")
463     >>> fcode((2*tau)**Rational(7, 2))
464     '      8*sqrt(2.0d0)*tau**(7.0d0/2.0d0)'
465     >>> fcode(sin(x), assign_to="s")
466     '      s = sin(x)'
467 
468     Custom printing can be defined for certain types by passing a dictionary of
469     "type" : "function" to the ``user_functions`` kwarg. Alternatively, the
470     dictionary value can be a list of tuples i.e. [(argument_test,
471     cfunction_string)].
472 
473     >>> custom_functions = {
474     ...   "ceiling": "CEIL",
475     ...   "floor": [(lambda x: not x.is_integer, "FLOOR1"),
476     ...             (lambda x: x.is_integer, "FLOOR2")]
477     ... }
478     >>> fcode(floor(x) + ceiling(x), user_functions=custom_functions)
479     '      CEIL(x) + FLOOR1(x)'
480 
481     ``Piecewise`` expressions are converted into conditionals. If an
482     ``assign_to`` variable is provided an if statement is created, otherwise
483     the ternary operator is used. Note that if the ``Piecewise`` lacks a
484     default term, represented by ``(expr, True)`` then an error will be thrown.
485     This is to prevent generating an expression that may not evaluate to
486     anything.
487 
488     >>> from sympy import Piecewise
489     >>> expr = Piecewise((x + 1, x > 0), (x, True))
490     >>> print(fcode(expr, tau))
491           if (x > 0) then
492              tau = x + 1
493           else
494              tau = x
495           end if
496 
497     Support for loops is provided through ``Indexed`` types. With
498     ``contract=True`` these expressions will be turned into loops, whereas
499     ``contract=False`` will just print the assignment expression that should be
500     looped over:
501 
502     >>> from sympy import Eq, IndexedBase, Idx
503     >>> len_y = 5
504     >>> y = IndexedBase('y', shape=(len_y,))
505     >>> t = IndexedBase('t', shape=(len_y,))
506     >>> Dy = IndexedBase('Dy', shape=(len_y-1,))
507     >>> i = Idx('i', len_y-1)
508     >>> e=Eq(Dy[i], (y[i+1]-y[i])/(t[i+1]-t[i]))
509     >>> fcode(e.rhs, assign_to=e.lhs, contract=False)
510     '      Dy(i) = (y(i + 1) - y(i))/(t(i + 1) - t(i))'
511 
512     Matrices are also supported, but a ``MatrixSymbol`` of the same dimensions
513     must be provided to ``assign_to``. Note that any expression that can be
514     generated normally can also exist inside a Matrix:
515 
516     >>> from sympy import Matrix, MatrixSymbol
517     >>> mat = Matrix([x**2, Piecewise((x + 1, x > 0), (x, True)), sin(x)])
518     >>> A = MatrixSymbol('A', 3, 1)
519     >>> print(fcode(mat, A))
520           A(1, 1) = x**2
521              if (x > 0) then
522           A(2, 1) = x + 1
523              else
524           A(2, 1) = x
525              end if
526           A(3, 1) = sin(x)
527     """
