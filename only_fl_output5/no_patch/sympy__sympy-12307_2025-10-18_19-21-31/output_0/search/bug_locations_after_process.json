Can be a string, ``Symbol``,\n429         ``MatrixSymbol``, or ``Indexed`` type. This is helpful in case of\n430         line-wrapping, or for expressions that generate multi-line statements.\n431     precision : integer, optional\n432         The precision for numbers such as pi [default=15].\n433     user_functions : dict, optional\n434         A dictionary where keys are ``FunctionClass`` instances and values are\n435         their string representations. Alternatively, the dictionary value can\n436         be a list of tuples i.e. [(argument_test, cfunction_string)]. See below\n437         for examples.\n438     human : bool, optional\n439         If True, the result is a single string that may contain some constant\n440         declarations for the number symbols. If False, the same information is\n441         returned in a tuple of (symbols_to_declare, not_supported_functions,\n442         code_text). [default=True].\n443     contract: bool, optional\n444         If True, ``Indexed`` instances are assumed to obey tensor contraction\n445         rules and the corresponding nested loops over indices are generated.\n446         Setting contract=False will not generate loops, instead the user is\n447         responsible to provide values for the indices in the code.\n448         [default=True].\n449     source_format : optional\n450         The source format can be either 'fixed' or 'free'. [default='fixed']\n451     standard : integer, optional\n452         The Fortran standard to be followed. This is specified as an integer.\n453         Acceptable standards are 66, 77, 90, 95, 2003, and 2008. Default is 77.\n454         Note that currently the only distinction internally is between\n455         standards before 95, and those 95 and after. This may change later as\n456         more features are added.\n457 \n458     Examples\n459     ========\n460 \n461     >>> from sympy import fcode, symbols, Rational, sin, ceiling, floor\n462     >>> x, tau = symbols(\"x, tau\")\n463     >>> fcode((2*tau)**Rational(7, 2))\n464     '      8*sqrt(2.0d0)*tau**(7.0d0/2.0d0)'\n465     >>> fcode(sin(x), assign_to=\"s\")\n466     '      s = sin(x)'\n467 \n468     Custom printing can be defined for certain types by passing a dictionary of\n469     \"type\" : \"function\" to the ``user_functions`` kwarg. Alternatively, the\n470     dictionary value can be a list of tuples i.e. [(argument_test,\n471     cfunction_string)].\n472 \n473     >>> custom_functions = {\n474     ...   \"ceiling\": \"CEIL\",\n475     ...   \"floor\": [(lambda x: not x.is_integer, \"FLOOR1\"),\n476     ...             (lambda x: x.is_integer, \"FLOOR2\")]\n477     ... }\n478     >>> fcode(floor(x) + ceiling(x), user_functions=custom_functions)\n479     '      CEIL(x) + FLOOR1(x)'\n480 \n481     ``Piecewise`` expressions are converted into conditionals. If an\n482     ``assign_to`` variable is provided an if statement is created, otherwise\n483     the ternary operator is used. Note that if the ``Piecewise`` lacks a\n484     default term, represented by ``(expr, True)`` then an error will be thrown.\n485     This is to prevent generating an expression that may not evaluate to\n486     anything.\n487 \n488     >>> from sympy import Piecewise\n489     >>> expr = Piecewise((x + 1, x > 0), (x, True))\n490     >>> print(fcode(expr, tau))\n491           if (x > 0) then\n492              tau = x + 1\n493           else\n494              tau = x\n495           end if\n496 \n497     Support for loops is provided through ``Indexed`` types. With\n498     ``contract=True`` these expressions will be turned into loops, whereas\n499     ``contract=False`` will just print the assignment expression that should be\n500     looped over:\n501 \n502     >>> from sympy import Eq, IndexedBase, Idx\n503     >>> len_y = 5\n504     >>> y = IndexedBase('y', shape=(len_y,))\n505     >>> t = IndexedBase('t', shape=(len_y,))\n506     >>> Dy = IndexedBase('Dy', shape=(len_y-1,))\n507     >>> i = Idx('i', len_y-1)\n508     >>> e=Eq(Dy[i], (y[i+1]-y[i])/(t[i+1]-t[i]))\n509     >>> fcode(e.rhs, assign_to=e.lhs, contract=False)\n510     '      Dy(i) = (y(i + 1) - y(i))/(t(i + 1) - t(i))'\n511 \n512     Matrices are also supported, but a ``MatrixSymbol`` of the same dimensions\n513     must be provided to ``assign_to``. Note that any expression that can be\n514     generated normally can also exist inside a Matrix:\n515 \n516     >>> from sympy import Matrix, MatrixSymbol\n517     >>> mat = Matrix([x**2, Piecewise((x + 1, x > 0), (x, True)), sin(x)])\n518     >>> A = MatrixSymbol('A', 3, 1)\n519     >>> print(fcode(mat, A))\n520           A(1, 1) = x**2\n521              if (x > 0) then\n522           A(2, 1) = x + 1\n523              else\n524           A(2, 1) = x\n525              end if\n526           A(3, 1) = sin(x)\n527     \"\"\"\n528 \n529     return FCodePrinter(settings).doprint(expr, assign_to)\n",
        "intended_behavior": "The `fcode` function should correctly generate Fortran code for the `sign` function according to Fortran syntax. Currently, it produces `sign(x)`, which is incorrect. The correct Fortran function call for the mathematical sign function depends on the context but is generally `sign(1, x)` for most cases or `sign(1d0, x)` for double precision contexts. The intended behavior is to modify this method to detect usage of the `sign` function within expressions and generate code that correctly reflects Fortran's expectations.\n\nThe method needs to be enhanced to interpret the `sign` function based on its arguments and the desired output precision (taking into account the context in which it is used\u2014whether it involves integers, real numbers, or double precision). This might involve adding conditional checks within the `fcode` method to identify `sign` function calls and translate them appropriately into Fortran code. It should also preserve the existing functionality for all other types of expressions and functions, ensuring that this change does not introduce regressions for code generation that currently works correctly.\n\nTo specifically handle the issue with `x=0` where the behavior of `sign` might differ between SymPy and Fortran (since Fortran's `sign(A, B)` function returns the magnitude of `A` with the sign of `B`, and for `B=0`, it returns `A` with its original sign), additional logic might need to be incorporated to correctly reflect the intended mathematical output while maintaining valid Fortran syntax."
