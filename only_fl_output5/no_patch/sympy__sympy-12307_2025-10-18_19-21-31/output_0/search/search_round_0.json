        "content": "To address the issue related to the Fortran code generation for the `sign` function in Sympy, we need to learn how the `sign` function is implemented and handled in the codebase, specifically within code generation for Fortran. The problem description gives us some key entities to start our search: the use of `sp.fcode` (indicating Fortran code generation) and the involvement of the `sign` function. Let's outline the necessary API calls for getting the required context:\n\n1. Search for the code generation utility that handles Fortran, likely related to `fcode`. This will help us find where the generation of Fortran code for mathematical functions is implemented:\n   - `search_method(\"fcode\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that the same behavior is obtained with `sympy.utilities.codegen`, we should also look into this module for references to Fortran code generation, particularly for any customization or handling of the `sign` function:\n   - `search_code(\"sympy.utilities.codegen\")`\n\n3. It would be helpful to find the implementation of the `sign` function within the codebase, as it might be referenced or special-cased during Fortran code generation:\n   - `search_method(\"sign\")`\n\n4. If there's any direct reference to handling the sign function specifically for Fortran code generation within Sympy, it's essential to find it. Since the exact method or class where this handling would occur isn't known, let's look for any code snippet that references both `sign` and possibly `Fortran` as keywords:\n   - `search_code(\"sign\")`\n   - `search_code(\"Fortran\")`\n\nThese searches aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of where and how the `sign` function is generated for Fortran within the Sympy project. After finding the relevant classes, methods, or code snippets, we will have a clearer idea of how to approach a patch to address the issue."
