        "intended_behavior": "The `fcode` function should correctly generate Fortran code for the `sign` function according to Fortran syntax. Currently, it produces `sign(x)`, which is incorrect. The correct Fortran function call for the mathematical sign function depends on the context but is generally `sign(1, x)` for most cases or `sign(1d0, x)` for double precision contexts. The intended behavior is to modify this method to detect usage of the `sign` function within expressions and generate code that correctly reflects Fortran's expectations.\n\nThe method needs to be enhanced to interpret the `sign` function based on its arguments and the desired output precision (taking into account the context in which it is used\u2014whether it involves integers, real numbers, or double precision). This might involve adding conditional checks within the `fcode` method to identify `sign` function calls and translate them appropriately into Fortran code. It should also preserve the existing functionality for all other types of expressions and functions, ensuring that this change does not introduce regressions for code generation that currently works correctly.\n\nTo specifically handle the issue with `x=0` where the behavior of `sign` might differ between SymPy and Fortran (since Fortran's `sign(A, B)` function returns the magnitude of `A` with the sign of `B`, and for `B=0`, it returns `A` with its original sign), additional logic might need to be incorporated to correctly reflect the intended mathematical output while maintaining valid Fortran syntax."
