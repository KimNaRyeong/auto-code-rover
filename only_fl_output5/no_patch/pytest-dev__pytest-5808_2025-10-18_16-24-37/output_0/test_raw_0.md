This `reproducer.py` script is designed to replicate the issue described with the `--pastebin` functionality of `pytest` when using the `lexer=python3` parameter, which results in a `HTTP Error 400: Bad Request`. 

The script attempts to send a test payload to `https://bpaste.net` mimicking what would happen in `pytest`'s `--pastebin` usage with the `lexer` set as `python3`. 

- If the payload is accepted and a `HTTP 200 OK` response is received, it implies the issue has been resolved, and the script will note that the issue is fixed.
- If a `HTTP 400 Bad Request` response is triggered, the script raises an `AssertionError` and prints the stack trace, confirming the issue's presence.

To use this reproducer, save it to the root directory of the project and execute it with Python 3. If the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace of the issue. If the issue is fixed, the script will exit with code 0, printing "Issue is fixed."
