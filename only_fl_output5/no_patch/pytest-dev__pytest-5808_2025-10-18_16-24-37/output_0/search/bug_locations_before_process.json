        "intended_behavior": "The `create_new_paste` method is intended to submit the output of `pytest` runs to `bpaste.net`. To resolve the issue, the method should change `params` from specifying `\"lexer\": \"python3\"` to `\"lexer\": \"text\"`. This adjustment is necessary because the content being uploaded is console output from `pytest` sessions, not strictly Python code. This change aims to prevent the `HTTP Error 400: Bad Request` which occurs with some contents when incorrectly labeled as Python code. The rest of the functionality, particularly around error handling and the construction/request process, should remain unchanged to preserve existing behavior such as error reporting and URL extraction from the response."
