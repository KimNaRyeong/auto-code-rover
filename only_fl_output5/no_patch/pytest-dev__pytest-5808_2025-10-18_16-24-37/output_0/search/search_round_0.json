This would seem like the right thing to do in any case: the console output of a `pytest` run that is being uploaded is not Python code, but arbitrary text.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather enough context for crafting a patch based on the issue details provided, we need to examine the code where the `--pastebin` feature is implemented, understand how `lexer=python3` is set, and potentially look for places where the console output of a `pytest` run is handled or formatted before being sent to `bpaste.net`. The provided URL in the issue points to the logic involved in pastebin submission in the `pytest` source code.\n\nGiven these requirements, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n1. **Get the code around the mentioned URL**: To understand how `lexer=python3` is integrated and to confirm if changing it to `text` is feasible without causing other issues.\n\n2. **Search for the class or method handling the `--pastebin` feature**: This is crucial to understand any relevant logic or dependencies that might be affected by the change.\n\n3. **Look for error handling related to HTTP requests to `bpaste.net`**: Since the issue mentions `HTTP Error 400: Bad Request`, understanding how errors are handled could provide insight into better error management or more friendly user feedback.\n\nGiven these considerations, the specific API calls are:\n\n- `get_code_around_line(\"src/_pytest/pastebin.py\", 68, 5)`: This will provide the context around the line setting `lexer=python3`, showing us how the data is formatted and sent.\n- `search_method(\"create_new_paste\")`: Assuming this or a similarly named method would handle the logic of sending data to `bpaste.net`, this call would help us understand where in the codebase the `--pastebin` functionality's core logic resides.\n- `search_code(\"urlopen\")`: Since the issue example uses `urlopen`, finding other instances of its use might show us how network requests are made throughout `pytest`, offering insights into standard practices for error handling or request formatting in the project."
