The provided URL in the issue points to the logic involved in pastebin submission in the `pytest` source code.\n\nGiven these requirements, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n1. **Get the code around the mentioned URL**: To understand how `lexer=python3` is integrated and to confirm if changing it to `text` is feasible without causing other issues.\n\n2. **Search for the class or method handling the `--pastebin` feature**: This is crucial to understand any relevant logic or dependencies that might be affected by the change.\n\n3. **Look for error handling related to HTTP requests to `bpaste.net`**: Since the issue mentions `HTTP Error 400: Bad Request`, understanding how errors are handled could provide insight into better error management or more friendly user feedback.\n\nGiven these considerations, the specific API calls are:\n\n- `get_code_around_line(\"src/_pytest/pastebin.py\", 68, 5)`: This will provide the context around the line setting `lexer=python3`, showing us how the data is formatted and sent.\n- `search_method(\"create_new_paste\")`: Assuming this or a similarly named method would handle the logic of sending data to `bpaste.net`, this call would help us understand where in the codebase the `--pastebin` functionality's core logic resides.\n- `search_code(\"urlopen\")`: Since the issue example uses `urlopen`, finding other instances of its use might show us how network requests are made throughout `pytest`, offering insights into standard practices for error handling or request formatting in the project."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n### 1. Analysis of `create_new_paste` Function in `src/_pytest/pastebin.py`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `create_new_paste` function takes `contents` as input, which are utf-8 encoded bytes intended for pasting. It constructs `params` with this `contents`, specifying a `lexer` as `python3` and an `expiry` setting for the paste. It then makes a POST request to `https://bpaste.net` using these parameters, encoded in ASCII. Upon receiving a response, it attempts to extract a URL from the response using regular expression searching, returning either the URL to the pasted content or an error message.\n\n#### Relationship with the Bug\n\nThe issue description mentions that using `lexer=python3` with certain contents results in an `HTTP Error 400: Bad Request` when making a POST request to `bpaste.net`. The highlighted code section directly relates to this problem, specifically the setting of `lexer` to `python3`. According to the issue, changing `lexer` from `python3` to `text` could potentially resolve this HTTP error because the contents being uploaded are not Python code but console output.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\n\nGiven the issue details, the intended behavior would be to successfully submit the `pytest` run output to `bpaste.net` without encountering an HTTP 400 error. This would likely involve changing the `lexer` parameter to `text` to accurately reflect the nature of the content being pasted, which is arbitrary text rather than Python code.\n\n### 2. General Usage of `urlopen` in the Project\n\nThe search for the `urlopen` usage in the project, including the `create_new_paste` function and tests related to the pastebin functionality, indicates how HTTP requests are conventionally made within pytest's codebase. The fact that `urlopen` is widely used for network requests, including error handling through catching `OSError`, provides context on standard practices within the project for making and handling responses from web requests.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe specific mention of `lexer=python3` in `create_new_paste` and the problem described in the issue suggest that changing this parameter is the direct way to address the bug. The usage of `urlopen` and the structure of the `create_new_paste` function also imply that any modification made to the HTTP request parameters should ensure proper encoding of the request data and should consider error handling for responses that don't include the expected URL format. Given this, the next steps would include preparing a patch to modify the `lexer` parameter value from `python3` to `text` in the `params` dictionary within `create_new_paste`, alongside ensuring that this change does not adversely affect how responses are processed and errors are handled."

To resolve the issue, the method should change `params` from specifying `\"lexer\": \"python3\"` to `\"lexer\": \"text\"`. This adjustment is necessary because the content being uploaded is console output from `pytest` sessions, not strictly Python code. This change aims to prevent the `HTTP Error 400: Bad Request` which occurs with some contents when incorrectly labeled as Python code. The rest of the functionality, particularly around error handling and the construction/request process, should remain unchanged to preserve existing behavior such as error reporting and URL extraction from the response."
