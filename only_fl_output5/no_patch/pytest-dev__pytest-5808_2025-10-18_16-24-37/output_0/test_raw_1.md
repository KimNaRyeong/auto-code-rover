To create `reproducer.py` with the context you've shared, it looks like we need a script capable of simulating the issue described originally: sending data to `bpaste.net` with the `lexer=python3` option causes an HTTP 400 error. Let's create a more precise test case that explicitly checks for this condition and behaves accordingly:

```python
# reproducer.py
import urllib.request
import urllib.parse
import sys
import json

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Encode the data to be sent to bpaste.net, setting lexer to python3
    data = {
        'lexer': 'python3',
        'code': 'print("Hello World")',
        'expiry': '1week',
        'description': 'pytest output'
    }
    data_encoded = urllib.parse.urlencode(data).encode()

    # Construct the request
    req = urllib.request.Request(
        "https://bpaste.net",
        data=data_encoded,
        method='POST'
    )

    # Perform the HTTP request
    try:
        with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as response:
            # If the response is successful, it implies the issue might be fixed
            # But let's check the content to be sure
            content = response.read().decode('utf-8')
            # Success condition (potentially checking for expected landing URL or content snippet)
            if "Successfully" in content:
                print("Issue is fixed.")
                sys.exit(0)
            else:
                raise AssertionError("Unexpected content received, the issue may still be present.")
    except urllib.error.HTTPError as e:
        # Specifically catch the HTTPError to print a custom stack trace
        if e.code == 400:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("The issue is present: HTTP Error 400: Bad Request") from e
        else:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError(f"Unexpected HTTP error: {e.code}") from e
    except Exception as e:
        # Catch other exceptions to print their traceback and re-raise them
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version of `reproducer.py` tries sending a predefined code snippet to `bpaste.net` with the `lexer=python3` setting, as described in the issue. It assumes that successful submission without a `400 Bad Request` response indicates a potential fix to the issue, warranting a successful exit. Otherwise, it catches the `HTTPError`, checks if it's a `400` error specifically related to the issue, prints the stack trace, and asserts the problem's presence. Other HTTP errors or exceptions trigger their respective handling logic to ensure any problem is clearly identified and reported.
