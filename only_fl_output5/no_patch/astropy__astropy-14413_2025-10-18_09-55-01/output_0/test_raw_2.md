Given your requirements, here's an updated version of `reproducer.py` that focuses on detecting the specific issue related to space inconsistencies in unit representations within the Astropy library. This script incorporates the provided stack trace function to ensure error details are clearly communicated.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import astropy.units as u
    error_detected = False
    
    # Case: Testing representation without scale factor
    result = f'{(u.m**-1):unicode}'
    if result.startswith(' '):
        error_detected = True
        print(f"Unexpected space at start for unit without scale factor: '{result}'")

    # Case: Testing representation with scale factor, decompose without specifying format
    result = f"{(u.eV*u.s**2).decompose()}"
    if " kg m2" not in result:
        error_detected = True
        print(f"Incorrect decomposition format for unit with scale factor: '{result}'")

    # Case: Testing unicode format with scale factor
    result = f"{(u.eV*u.s**2).decompose():unicode}"
    if " m² kg" not in result.replace(' ', ''):
        error_detected = True
        print(f"Unexpected absence or misplacement of space in unicode format: '{result}'")
    
    # Case: Testing decomposed value with specified format
    result = f"{(1*u.eV*u.s**2).decompose():unicode}"
    if " m² kg" not in result.replace(' ', ''):
        error_detected = True
        print(f"Space issue in decomposed value representation in unicode format: '{result}'")
    
    return error_detected

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        if main():
            raise AssertionError("Space inconsistency issue detected.")
        else:
            print("No issue detected.")
            exit(0)  # Exit code 0 when issue is fixed.
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit code 1 when issue is present.
```

This script performs several checks around the formatting and representation of units in both default and unicode formats, specifically looking for unwarranted spaces at the start of these representations and/or between values and units in decomposed forms. When an inconsistency or error is detected, a respective message is printed, and an `AssertionError` is raised with a custom message detailing the nature of the problem. The `print_stacktrace` function is utilized to offer detailed error information if an exception is encountered.
