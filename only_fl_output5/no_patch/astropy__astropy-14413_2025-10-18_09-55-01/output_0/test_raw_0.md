This script aims to capture the behavior described in the issue by running a series of assertions. If the format for the units and scales does not behave as expected (either by starting with an unwanted space or not matching the anticipated format), the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print the stack trace for the failed assertion, as requested. It will exit with code 0 only when all tests pass, indicating the issue has been resolved.
