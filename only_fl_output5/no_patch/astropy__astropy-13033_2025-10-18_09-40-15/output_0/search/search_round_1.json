Since the issue revolves around misleading exceptions when required columns are missing, we should initially look for the implementation of the `TimeSeries` class, the `remove_column` method, and possibly any method that validates the required columns in a `TimeSeries` object.\n\nThus, the API calls we need to make are:\n\n1. To locate the `TimeSeries` class definition: `search_class(\"TimeSeries\")`.\n2. To find the implementation of the `remove_column` method within the `TimeSeries` class: `search_method_in_class(\"remove_column\", \"TimeSeries\")`.\n3.

Assuming \"validate\" is a term that may be used for such functionality, if this does not yield results, we may need to refine our search based on findings.\n\nThese calls should provide enough context to start addressing the problem described."

Given that `TimeSeries` is a subclass of `BaseTimeSeries`, it's logical to infer that the `remove_column` method might exist in the `BaseTimeSeries` class or in another superclass from which `TimeSeries` inherits functionality.\n\n2. **The absence of a `validate` method directly within the `TimeSeries` class implies that the validation of required columns might either be implemented under a different name or handled as part of another method's workflow.** The misleading exception message about required columns suggests a disconnection or oversight in the process where the `TimeSeries` object's integrity is checked, especially after column removal or modification operations.\n\nGiven this analysis, the subsequent steps could include:\n- Searching for the `remove_column` method in the parent class (`BaseTimeSeries`) to understand how columns are removed and what checks are performed during this process.\n- Identifying any method that implicitly acts as a validator or ensures the integrity of `TimeSeries` objects, which could either be within `TimeSeries`, `BaseTimeSeries`, or any related utility functions/classes.\n- Exploring if there's any dedicated error handling or exception messaging functionality that might be responsible for generating the observed misleading exception.\n\nTo get more context based on these insights, the next set of API calls should include:\n1. Searching the parent class where `remove_column` might be defined: `search_class(\"BaseTimeSeries\")`.\n2. Exploring the `BaseTimeSeries` class (assuming `remove_column` is there) or any other superclass for a method that is responsible for the integrity check or validation, which might not be explicitly named \"validate\": Since the explicit search for `validate` in `TimeSeries` was fruitless, inspecting parent class methods for anything related to integrity checks or required column validation directly might necessitate examining the code of `BaseTimeSeries` or related documentation.\n3. After finding `BaseTimeSeries`, performing a broader search for the `remove_column` method if it's not directly in `BaseTimeSeries`: `search_method(\"remove_column\")`. \n\nThese steps are speculative and will need adjustment based on the findings from the suggested searches."
