If the column is flagged as required, the method should raise a specific `ValueError` that clearly indicates the attempt to remove a required column, naming the column explicitly and suggesting that required columns cannot be removed. This change requires adding a mechanism to interact with or be aware of subclass-specific attributes like `_required_columns` in a generic class such as `Table`, possibly through a method override in `TimeSeries` or by introducing a check within `Table` that subclasses can configure or hook into."

        "intended_behavior": "While the direct implementation details are not shown in the snippet, it is evident that `BaseTimeSeries` should include or override methods related to column removal (such as `remove_column`) to enforce the integrity of required columns. If the `BaseTimeSeries` or `TimeSeries` classes do not currently override `remove_column` to include such checks, an override method should be introduced in `TimeSeries` (or `BaseTimeSeries` if applicable) that first checks if the column being removed is in `_required_columns`, raising a clear and helpful error if so. Additionally, it should leverage the context manager `_delay_required_column_checks` appropriately if temporary removal of columns is needed for internal operations, ensuring integrity checks are only bypassed when explicitly intended and safe to do so."
