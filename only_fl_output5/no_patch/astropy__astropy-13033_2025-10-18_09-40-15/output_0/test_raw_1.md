Given that the previous submission did not address the task as expected and considering the feedback, I'll reformulate the `reproducer.py` script as per your instructions ensuring it aligns correctly with the requirements. Notably, the script will attempt to reproduce the issue as specified, expecting an AssertionError when the issue is present due to the incorrect exception message.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from astropy.time import Time
        from astropy.timeseries import TimeSeries
        import numpy as np

        time = Time(np.arange(100000, 100003), format='jd')
        ts = TimeSeries(time=time, data = {"flux": [99.9, 99.8, 99.7]})
        ts._required_columns = ["time", "flux"]                                   
        ts.remove_column("flux")
        raise AssertionError("The script is supposed to raise an exception for missing required columns but did not.")

    except ValueError as e:
        expected_message = "TimeSeries object is invalid - expected 'time', 'flux' as the required columns but found 'time'"
        if str(e) == expected_message:
            print("The issue is reproduced successfully.")
            sys.exit(0)  # Exits with code 0 indicating the issue is correctly reproduced.
        else:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(1)  # Exits with code 1 indicating the test failed to reproduce the issue as expected.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised `reproducer.py` script captures the necessary conditions to reproduce the outlined issue regarding the misleading exception message when a required column check fails in an `astropy.timeseries.TimeSeries` object. It makes use of `numpy` for creating time series data, and `astropy.time` and `astropy.timeseries` for manipulating time series data according to the description provided.

The script attempts to remove a required column from a `TimeSeries` object and checks the exception message against the expected one. If the exception message matches the expected wrong message (as stated in the original issue description), the script exits with code 0, indicating the presence of the issue. Otherwise, it prints the stack trace using `print_stacktrace` and exits with code 1, indicating a failure to reproduce the issue as described or that the issue might have been resolved.
