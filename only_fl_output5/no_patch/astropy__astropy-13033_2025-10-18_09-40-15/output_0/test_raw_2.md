Based on your instructions and the details provided previously, I have prepared a revised version of `reproducer.py` configured to execute in the manner you have described. The goal is to ensure that when the specific issue regarding misleading exceptions in `TimeSeries` objects is present, the script will correctly identify it through an `AssertionError`. Conversely, if the issue has been addressed, the script should complete without error and exit with code 0. 

Please find the updated script below:

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        import numpy as np
        from astropy.time import Time
        from astropy.timeseries import TimeSeries

        time = Time(np.arange(100000, 100003), format='jd')
        ts = TimeSeries(time=time, data={"flux": [99.9, 99.8, 99.7]})
        ts._required_columns = ["time", "flux"]
        ts.remove_column("flux")

        # If the exception is not raised as expected, then it implies the issue is not present
        # However, since we are expecting an issue, reaching this point without an exception
        # should be considered as a failure to reproduce the issue
        print("No exception was raised. This may indicate that the issue has been fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        expected_message_part = "expected 'time' as the first columns but found 'time'"
        if expected_message_part in str(e):
            # Issue reproduced successfully
            print("Incorrect exception message indicates the issue is present.")
            raise AssertionError("Expected exception with a more informative message regarding missing required columns.")  # This will not be caught and triggers the correct stacktrace
        else:
            # If an exception is raised but not the one we're looking for, print its stacktrace
            print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as err:
        print_stacktrace(err)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exiting with 1 to indicate the script did raise the AssertionError as planned for the issue presence
```

This script is structured to perform specifically according to your directives. When executed in the root directory of the targeted project, it should serve the purpose of detecting the described issue within the `TimeSeries` object effectively.
