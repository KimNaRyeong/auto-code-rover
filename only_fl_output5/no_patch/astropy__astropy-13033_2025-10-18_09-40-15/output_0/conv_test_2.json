It makes use of `numpy` for creating time series data, and `astropy.time` and `astropy.timeseries` for manipulating time series data according to the description provided.\n\nThe script attempts to remove a required column from a `TimeSeries` object and checks the exception message against the expected one. If the exception message matches the expected wrong message (as stated in the original issue description), the script exits with code 0, indicating the presence of the issue. Otherwise, it prints the stack trace using `print_stacktrace` and exits with code 1, indicating a failure to reproduce the issue as described or that the issue might have been resolved."
