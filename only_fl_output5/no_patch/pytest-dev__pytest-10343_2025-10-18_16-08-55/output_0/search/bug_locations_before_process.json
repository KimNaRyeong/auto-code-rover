To resolve the issue, when raising a `PytestDeprecationWarning` for old-style `hookimpl`, the code at this location should be extended to include the source (file path and possibly line number) of the deprecated usage. This enhancement should preserve the functionality of emitting warnings but augment them with additional context to help users locate and address the deprecated configurations within their plugins or test suites."

        "intended_behavior": "In files where the `@hookimpl` decorator is used for registering hooks, particularly those related to the `pytest_configure` hook implementation, an update or wrapper around the registration process may be needed to capture and store the source location (e.g., using introspection or modifying the `@hookimpl` decorator functionality). When a deprecated hook implementation is identified, the system should then be able to use this stored location information to provide a detailed warning. This solution requires careful consideration to ensure that performance implications are minimal and that the additional context does not interfere with the normal operation and flexibility of the plugin system."
