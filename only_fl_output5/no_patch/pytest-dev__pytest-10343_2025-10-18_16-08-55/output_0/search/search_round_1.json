However, we didn't find direct references to a `hookimpl` method, suggesting that our search might need to explore the decorators and mechanisms by which plugins are handled in `pytest`.\n\n### Analysis of `pytest_configure` Hook Implementations\n- **What it does**: These results indicate various places in the `pytest` codebase and plugins where the `pytest_configure` hook is implemented. Each instance suggests a different plugin or core functionality handling configuration initialization.\n- **Relation to the bug**: The error message concerns these `pytest_configure` implementations but lacks the necessary context about which one is using an outdated approach.\n- **Intended behavior**: Ideally, when a deprecation warning is raised for a `pytest_configure` hook, the source of the call (e.g., plugin or file location) should be included, helping users easily locate and update their code.\n\n### Analysis of `PytestDeprecationWarning`\n- **What it does**: The snippets where `PytestDeprecationWarning` is raised are crucial to understanding how deprecation warnings are formulated and thrown within the `pytest` framework.\n- **Relation to the bug**: Since the issue is specifically about `PytestDeprecationWarning` not providing enough context (i.e., source location), looking into these parts of the code could reveal how to append additional information to the warning messages.\n- **Intended behavior**: Modifications here should ensure that whenever a `PytestDeprecationWarning` is raised, particularly for deprecated hook implementations, it includes precise location details.\n\n### Analysis of `@hookimpl`\n- **What it does**: The usage of `@hookimpl` across different files shows where and how plugin hooks are defined. It's a decorator indicating a plugin's implementation of a hook.\n- **Relation to the bug**: Understanding how `@hookimpl` is parsed and executed can lead to insights into where the system might introspect to add location information about deprecated usage.\n- **Intended behavior**: The process that handles these `@hookimpl` annotations should be capable of detecting outdated configurations and properly flagging them, ideally with context about where they are defined.\n\nGiven these insights, the next steps should involve:\n1. **Exploring how deprecation warnings are raised**: Specifically, we need to understand how `PytestDeprecationWarning` in `src/_pytest/deprecated.py` and related files can be extended to include file and possibly plugin names.\n   \n2. **Understanding hook registration and detection**: The files containing `@hookimpl` decorations could give clues on how hooks are registered and whether it's possible to capture their source location at registration or execution time.\n\n### Next API Calls\nTo move forward, we should take a closer look at how `PytestDeprecationWarning` is defined and utilized. More specifically, examining `src/_pytest/deprecated.py` might reveal mechanisms for enhancing warning messages with more context. Additionally, investigating how `pytest` initializes and registers hooks (`@hookimpl`) could uncover places where enhancements could allow for the location to be captured. However, without any mention of a specific `hookimpl` method, we must focus on the broader mechanisms around hook registration and deprecation handling.\n\nGiven this, I would proceed with:\n- Examining the implementation details in `src/_pytest/deprecated.py` to see how warnings are constructed.\n- Investigating a specific file where `@hookimpl` is heavily used, such as `src/_pytest/logging.py`, to understand hook registration and execution flow.\n\nHowever, these exact API calls were not requested initially, so we would need to adjust our strategy based on available search capabilities or further inspect the code manually based on the paths identified."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

To resolve the issue, when raising a `PytestDeprecationWarning` for old-style `hookimpl`, the code at this location should be extended to include the source (file path and possibly line number) of the deprecated usage. This enhancement should preserve the functionality of emitting warnings but augment them with additional context to help users locate and address the deprecated configurations within their plugins or test suites.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: \n  - **File**: Various files where `@hookimpl` is used, for example, `src/_pytest/logging.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: In files where the `@hookimpl` decorator is used for registering hooks, particularly those related to the `pytest_configure` hook implementation, an update or wrapper around the registration process may be needed to capture and store the source location (e.g., using introspection or modifying the `@hookimpl` decorator functionality). When a deprecated hook implementation is identified, the system should then be able to use this stored location information to provide a detailed warning. This solution requires careful consideration to ensure that performance implications are minimal and that the additional context does not interfere with the normal operation and flexibility of the plugin system.\n\nThese enhancements aim to make deprecation warnings more informative, directly addressing the issue without altering existing functionalities beyond the scope of improving the warning messages."
