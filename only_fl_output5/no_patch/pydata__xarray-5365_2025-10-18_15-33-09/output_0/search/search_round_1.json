        "content": "<issue>Feature request: vector cross product\nxarray currently has the `xarray.dot()` function for calculating arbitrary dot products which is indeed very handy.\nSometimes, especially for physical applications I also need a vector cross product. I' wondering whether you would be interested in having ` xarray.cross` as a wrapper of [`numpy.cross`.](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.cross.html) I currently use the following implementation:\n```python\ndef cross(a, b, spatial_dim, output_dtype=None):\n\"\"\"xarray-compatible cross product\nCompatible with dask, parallelization uses a.dtype as output_dtype\n\"\"\"\n# TODO find spatial dim default by looking for unique 3(or 2)-valued dim?\nfor d in (a, b):\nif spatial_dim not in d.dims:\nraise ValueError('dimension {} not in {}'.format(spatial_dim, d))\nif d.sizes[spatial_dim] != 3:  #TODO handle 2-valued cases\nraise ValueError('dimension {} has not length 3 in {}'.format(d))\nif output_dtype is None:\noutput_dtype = a.dtype  # TODO some better way to determine default?\nc = xr.apply_ufunc(np.cross, a, b,\ninput_core_dims=[[spatial_dim], [spatial_dim]],\noutput_core_dims=[[spatial_dim]],\ndask='parallelized', output_dtypes=[output_dtype]\n)\nreturn c\n```\n#### Example usage\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport xarray as xr\na = xr.DataArray(np.empty((10, 3)), dims=['line', 'cartesian'])\nb = xr.full_like(a, 1)\nc = cross(a, b, 'cartesian')\n```\n#### Main question\nDo you want such a function (and possibly associated `DataArray.cross` methods) in the `xarray` namespace, or should it be in some other package?  I didn't find a package which would be a good fit as this is close to core numpy functionality and isn't as domain specific as some geo packages. I'm not aware of some \"xrphysics\" package.\nI could make a PR if you'd want to have it in `xarray` directly.\n#### Output of ``xr.show_versions()``\n<details>\n# Paste the output here xr.show_versions() here\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\n------------------\ncommit: None\npython: 3.7.3 (default, Mar 27 2019, 22:11:17)\n[GCC 7.3.0]\npython-bits: 64\nOS: Linux\nOS-release: 4.9.0-9-amd64\nmachine: x86_64\nprocessor:\nbyteorder: little\nLC_ALL: None\nLANG: en_US.UTF-8\nLOCALE: en_US.UTF-8\nlibhdf5: 1.10.4\nlibnetcdf: 4.6.1\nxarray: 0.12.3\npandas: 0.24.2\nnumpy: 1.16.4\nscipy: 1.3.0\nnetCDF4: 1.4.2\npydap: None\nh5netcdf: 0.7.4\nh5py: 2.9.0\nNio: None\nzarr: None\ncftime: 1.0.3.4\nnc_time_axis: None\nPseudoNetCDF: None\nrasterio: None\ncfgrib: None\niris: None\nbottleneck: 1.2.1\ndask: 2.1.0\ndistributed: 2.1.0\nmatplotlib: 3.1.0\ncartopy: None\nseaborn: 0.9.0\nnumbagg: None\nsetuptools: 41.0.1\npip: 19.1.1\nconda: 4.7.11\npytest: 5.0.1\nIPython: 7.6.1\nsphinx: 2.1.2\n</details>\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the feature request related to adding a vector cross product function in `xarray`, we should look into several aspects of the current `xarray` implementation:\n\n1.

Look for any existing wrapper or utility functions interacting with `numpy` operations since `numpy.cross` is directly mentioned.\n3. Check if there's an existing class where such a mathematical operation could logically be added.\n4.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context around the feature request for implementing a vector cross product function similar to `numpy.cross` in xarray, we can deduce the following:\n\n### Analysis of the `dot` Method Implementation:\nThe search for `dot` method results illustrates how dot products are currently implemented in xarray:\n\n1. **xarray/core/dataarray.py**: This file contains the high-level interface for the dot product, which is directly available on the `DataArray` objects. The method checks the type of the other object involved in the dot product and delegates the computation to `xarray.core.computation.dot`.\n\n2. **xarray/core/computation.py**: This file offers a more generalized dot product function, which is designed to work with both `DataArray` and `Variable` objects. It uses `apply_ufunc` to delegate the actual computation, likely to numpy's dot product function, while also managing dimensionality and other xarray-specific operation requirements.\n\nThis part of the code is essential for understanding how xarray wraps numpy functions and manages operations that involve dimensions. The structure and approach here can serve as a blueprint for implementing a cross product operation.\n\n### Relationship With the Feature Request:\nThe dot method's implementation outlines a design pattern in xarray for mathematical operations involving numpy functions while managing dimensions, metadata, and other array properties specific to xarray. Given the issue request, the intended behavior of `xarray.cross` would mirror this pattern: wrapping a numpy operation (`numpy.cross` in this case) within an xarray operation that can handle `DataArray` objects directly, including the compatibility with Dask for parallelized computation.\n\n### Analysis of `apply_ufunc` Usage:\nThe `apply_ufunc` function seems to be a critical part of xarray's approach to handling arbitrary numpy functions while keeping the metadata and dimension logic specific to xarray. The widespread use of `apply_ufunc` in various mathematical and data manipulation operations indicates it is well-suited to serve as a foundation for the new cross product functionality.\n\nGiven the proposal to implement `xarray.cross` as a wrapper around `numpy.cross`, the repeated pattern of using `apply_ufunc` across different functionalities in xarray supports its use for this new feature. It suggests a method for ensuring compatibility with both numpy's calculations and xarray's data structures.\n\n### Non-findings and Next Steps:\nThe search did not return any direct implementations or references to `numpy.cross` within the xarray codebase, indicating this function would indeed be a new addition rather than an extension or modification of existing functionality.\n\nGiven that `dask='parallelized'` appears specifically within `xarray.core/computation.py`, it reinforces the idea that for the cross product functionality to support parallelized computation with Dask, similar handling or annotations will likely be necessary in its implementation.\n\n### Conclusion and Intended Implementation Strategy:\nBased on the shared architecture of `dot` and the use of `apply_ufunc`, the implementation of `xarray.cross` should:\n\n- Utilize `apply_ufunc` to wrap `numpy.cross`, ensuring that the operation can seamlessly work with `DataArray` and potentially `Dataset` objects.\n- Ensure compatibility with Dask for parallelized computations, similar to the existing patterns found in `dot` and other operations using `apply_ufunc`.\n- Respect and manage the dimensionality of the input arrays, including error handling for mismatched or inappropriate dimensions, following the pattern seen in `dot`.\n\nConsidering no xarray wrapper for `numpy.cross` exists in the codebase, and given the structure for mathematical operations seen in xarray, the proposed feature should carefully integrate into the existing framework with attention to xarray's conventions for handling dimensions, metadata, and backed computations."

The implementation would be new, hence does not correspond to an existing file/class/method directly. The best locations for adding such feature based either on existing structures mentioned would likely be:\n    - **For a standalone function:** `xarray/core/computation.py` This file already contains generalized computation functions like `dot`.\n    - **For an object method:** `xarray/core/dataarray.py`, as part of the `DataArray` class, to offer a high-level API similar to `DataArray.dot`.\n    \n- **Intended Behavior:**\n  - **For a standalone function (in `xarray/core/computation.py`):** Implement a function named `cross` that mirrors the structure and logic of the `dot` function in the same file. This function should utilize `numpy.cross` to calculate the cross product of two arrays. It should accept `DataArray` or `Variable` objects as input, manage dimensionality accordingly (especially ensuring the dimensionality conforms to the requirements of a cross product), preserve metadata, and be compatible with parallel computation using Dask, mimicking the `apply_ufunc` usage pattern.\n    \n  - **For an object method (in `xarray/core/dataarray.py`, `DataArray` class):** Add a method named `cross` that provides a convenient high-level API for users to calculate cross products directly from `DataArray` instances. This method should internally call the `cross` function defined in `xarray/core/computation.py`, providing a user-friendly interface. Like the `dot` method, it should handle input validation, ensuring the other operand is also a `DataArray`, and that the dimensions conform to cross product requirements (e.g., three-dimensional vectors or extending to handle two-dimensional with implicit z=0).\n  \nImplementing these changes will add the requested functionality without disrupting existing `xarray` functionalities, preserving the library's design and usage patterns while extending its capability to perform vector cross products."
