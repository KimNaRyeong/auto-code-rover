Based on the information provided, where the error thrown is due to `np.unicode_` being removed in the NumPy 2.0 release and the need to use `np.str_` instead, we'll write a `reproducer.py` script that specifically tests for this issue. This script will attempt to reference `np.unicode_` in a manner consistent with the error context you've described, then use the provided function `print_stacktrace` to output a detailed stack trace if the error is encountered.

```python
import numpy as np
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_np_unicode():
    try:
        # Attempt to access np.unicode_ which should fail for NumPy 2.0 and above
        dummy = np.unicode_
        print("Access to np.unicode_ succeeded, which is unexpected for NumPy 2.0 and above.")
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit code 1 indicates the issue is present

    except AttributeError as e:
        print("Correctly triggered AttributeError, indicating np.unicode_ is not accessible.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit code 0 indicates the issue is fixed or the correct behavior is observed

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_np_unicode()
```

This script intends to:
- Directly target the issue related to the removal of `np.unicode_` in NumPy 2.0 by attempting to access it.
- Utilize `print_stacktrace` to provide clear error details if the access attempt fails as expected.
- Exit with code 1 when the issue is present (i.e., if somehow accessing `np.unicode_` doesn't throw an error, indicating a problem with our environment or a regression in NumPy).
- Exit with code 0 if the AttributeError is correctly raised, indicating that `np.unicode_` has been properly removed and our handling for the deprecation is appropriate.

This reproducer script serves a dual purpose: It acts as a check for the specific deprecation issue in NumPy and demonstrates a method for handling such deprecations in dependent projects or scripts.
