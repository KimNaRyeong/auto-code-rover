If the ellipsis is indeed causing the issue, an alternative documentation approach might need to be considered, such as explicitly specifying the type hint without ellipsis or providing additional context/explanation in the docstring to bypass the Sphinx parsing limitation. The solution should ensure that Sphinx documentation can be successfully generated without warnings related to the `trio_main` method while preserving the method's functionality and accurate representation of its documentation. This might involve custom Sphinx handlers if the issue is with Sphinx's handling of ellipsis in type hints, ensuring that the method's functionality regarding its asynchronous callable and arguments remains unchanged."

Reviewing and updating the Sphinx configuration to ignore specific warnings if they cannot be resolved due to limitations in Sphinx's understanding of certain Python syntaxes used within the docstrings.
