        "intended_behavior": "In the `partial_fit` method, before performing operations prone to overflow like sum and square-sum for mean and variance computations, the method should temporarily upcast `X` to `float32` or `float64` if the input `X` is of `float16` type. This upcasting aims to mitigate the risk of numerical overflow during these operations. After the computation, downcast can be applied where applicable, ensuring the output conforms to the expected dtype. This modification should be transparent to the end-users, maintaining the method's current interface and expected outputs while preventing overflow errors when dealing with `float16` datasets. This adjustment would be specifically tied to the lines of code calculating mean and variance to ensure that the entire spectrum of data precision, especially `float16`, is accommodated without leading to overflow and subsequent loss of data integrity in the normalization process."
