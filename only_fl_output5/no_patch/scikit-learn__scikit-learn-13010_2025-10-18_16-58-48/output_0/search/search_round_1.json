I can convert the array to a larger precision but when working with a larger dataset the memory saved by using float16 on smaller numbers kind of matter. The error is mostly on numpy. Adding the dtype on the mean/std calculation does it but I'm not sure if that how people here would like to do it.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nsample = np.full([10_000_000, 1], 10.0, dtype=np.float16)\nStandardScaler().fit_transform(sample)\n```\n#### Expected Results\nThe normalized array\n#### Actual Results\n```\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/_methods.py:36: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in reduce\nreturn umr_sum(a, axis, dtype, out, keepdims, initial)\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/fromnumeric.py:86: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in reduce\nreturn ufunc.reduce(obj, axis, dtype, out, **passkwargs)\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/_methods.py:36: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in reduce\nreturn umr_sum(a, axis, dtype, out, keepdims, initial)\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/preprocessing/data.py:765: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in true_divide\nX /= self.scale_\narray([[nan],\n[nan],\n[nan],\n...,\n[nan],\n[nan],\n[nan]], dtype=float16)\n```\n#### Versions\n```\nSystem:\npython: 3.6.6 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Oct  9 2018, 12:34:16)  [GCC 7.3.0]\nexecutable: /opt/conda/bin/python\nmachine: Linux-4.9.0-5-amd64-x86_64-with-debian-9.4\nBLAS:\nmacros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\nlib_dirs: /opt/conda/lib\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\nPython deps:\npip: 18.1\nsetuptools: 39.1.0\nsklearn: 0.20.2\nnumpy: 1.16.0\nscipy: 1.1.0\nCython: 0.29.2\npandas: 0.23.4\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "Upon analyzing the gathered context from the `StandardScaler` class within `sklearn.preprocessing.data.py`, we can make several observations:\n\n### What does this part of the code do?\n- The `StandardScaler` class is designed to standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. This is a crucial preprocessing step for many machine learning algorithms.\n- The `fit` method specifically computes the mean and standard deviation for later scaling. It takes an input matrix `X` (and an ignored parameter `y`), computes the mean and std, which are used in subsequent transformations of the data.\n- Inside the `fit` method, it calls `_reset` which seems to reset internal state, and importantly, it calls `partial_fit`. This indicates that the actual computation of mean and standard deviation might happen in the `partial_fit` method.\n\n### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n- The issue mentions an overflow occurring when calculating the mean and standard deviation of a large `float16` array. The likely cause of this problem is that these operations on large datasets, especially with smaller numerical types like `float16`, can lead to numerical overflow due to the limited precision and range of `float16`.\n- The bug is tied to the operation within `fit` or more precisely the operations invoked by `fit` which includes computations done in `partial_fit`. The detailed computational routines which actually cause the overflow are not directly detailed in the `fit` method's description but it highlights where in the codebase the problem originates.\n\n### What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n- Ideally, `fit` should calculate the mean and standard deviation correctly, regardless of the `dtype` of the data it is given, including data types with small precision like `float16`. It should handle large datasets without triggering overflows and hence not degrade to producing NaNs due to overflow.\n- To handle the overflow issue, one might consider ensuring that internal calculations, especially those prone to overflow like sum for mean or squared-sum for standard deviation, are performed in a `dtype` that can handle the range of the data, before possibly downcasting the result to the original `dtype`.\n\nGiven this context and the bug description, we should further examine the `partial_fit` method where the actual computation of mean and std likely occurs. Also, it would be necessary to take a closer look at the data pipeline inside `StandardScaler` to pinpoint where to enforce a safer `dtype` for these calculations. \n\nNext steps in the investigation would involve:\n1. Analyzing the `partial_fit` method in the `StandardScaler` to see how calculations are performed and where a `dtype` adjustment can be applied to prevent overflow.\n2. Understanding the internal data flow within `StandardScaler` when calculating mean and std to pinpoint exactly where and how `dtype` conversions or adjustments need to be made.\n\nTherefore, the next API calls should focus on the `partial_fit` method within the `StandardScaler` class.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"partial_fit\", \"StandardScaler\")\n```"

Location 1: File: sklearn/preprocessing/data.py, Class: StandardScaler, Method: partial_fit.\n   - Intended Behavior: The `partial_fit` method, which is responsible for computing the mean and standard deviation used for scaling, should handle computations in a way that avoids overflow when working with `float16` arrays or similar low-precision data types. This can be achieved by temporarily upcasting the data to a higher precision (`float32` or `float64`) for the mean and standard deviation computations before scaling. The computation should be careful to cast back to the original dtype if necessary, to ensure that this internal adjustment is transparent to users and does not affect the final output dtype beyond what is necessary to avoid overflow. This adjustment should preserve the functionality of `StandardScaler` across all supported dtypes, maintaining its utility for preprocessing steps in machine learning pipelines while accommodating the memory efficiency advantages of using `float16` for large datasets."
