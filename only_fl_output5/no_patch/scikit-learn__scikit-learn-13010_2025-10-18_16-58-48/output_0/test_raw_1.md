Based on your request and given the misunderstanding from the earlier response, let's provide a corrected version of a `reproducer.py` script taking into account the previous issues. This script is designed to deliberately reproduce the overflow error with `StandardScaler` and float16 data type as described, and handle the issue gracefully:

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_normalization():
    try:
        sample = np.full([10_000_000, 1], 10.0, dtype=np.float16)
        result = StandardScaler().fit_transform(sample)
        if np.any(np.isnan(result)):
            raise AssertionError("Result contains NaN values after scaling.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Indicates an error occurred (non-zero exit code)
    else:
        assert not np.any(np.isnan(result)), "Output should not contain NaN"
        print("No issue detected.")
        exit(0)  # No exception and assertion passed (zero exit code)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_normalization()
```

This script attempts to trigger the overflow issue with `StandardScaler` on float16 data and handles the output accordingly:

- If the overflowing or any other exception occurs, it captures the exception, prints the stack trace, and exits with code 1.
  
- If the `StandardScaler` successfully processes the data without generating NaN values, it asserts to make sure the output is as expected. If the assertion passes, it prints "No issue detected." and exits with code 0.

- It uses the given function `print_stacktrace` to print the exception stack trace clearly if needed. 

Please adjust the script if your Python or library versions differ, or if additional handling is necessary for your specific environment.
