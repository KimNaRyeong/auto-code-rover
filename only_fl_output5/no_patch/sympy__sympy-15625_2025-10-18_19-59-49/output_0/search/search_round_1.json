The classes and methods responsible for formatting the LaTeX output would be crucial.

The issue described points to a misconfiguration or misuse of LaTeX math mode delimiters. Let\u2019s analyze the potential relevance of the returned files to the issue at hand:\n\n### sympy/interactive/printing.py\n- **What it might do**: This file likely deals with setting up interactive printing options in sympy, which might include how expressions are formatted for display, potentially in LaTeX form.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: If this file handles defaults or options for LaTeX printing, it might be where the incorrect `$$...$$` wrapping is applied or could be adjusted to implement the correct `$\\displaystyle ...$` behavior.\n- **Intended behavior**: It should ideally check if LaTeX snippets are being wrapped for math mode correctly and adjust to prevent the described issue. Using `$\\displaystyle` for consistency with LaTeX standards on how expressions should be aligned.\n\n### sympy/printing/latex.py\n- **What it might do**: This file is very likely central to the issue, as it's explicitly related to LaTeX printing in sympy. It's responsible for converting sympy expressions into LaTeX format.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: Given the high number of matches for `$$` in this file, it could contain the exact code snippet that wrongly wraps `equation*` blocks within `$$`, which is causing the LaTeX error upon notebook conversion to PDF.\n- **Intended behavior**: The intended behavior should be to wrap expressions in a way that is compatible with LaTeX's math mode without causing errors\u2014specifically, switching the wrapping to `$\\displaystyle ...$` for single-line expressions to fix the issue.\n\n### Steps Forward:\nGiven this analysis, a deeper examination of the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file appears most promising, as this file is most likely where the LaTeX formatting rules are defined. We should specifically look into how mathematical expressions are handled and ensure they are formatted according to LaTeX best practices, aligning with the suggested fix in the issue description.\n\n- **Next API Call**: To understand the context and code structure that leads to the issue, we should look at the sections of code in `sympy/printing/latex.py` that contain the `$$` to understand how they are used and if they are indeed the cause of the problem. This involves inspecting the relevant code snippets and their logic to determine the precise changes required.\n\nBased on this analysis, before making specific changes or further inquiries, reviewing `sympy/printing/latex.py` to understand its handling of LaTeX formatting is essential.\n"

Instead, the code should implement single expressions using `$\\displaystyle ...$` for correct display in LaTeX documents without error. This change must preserve the functionality of rendering expressions in LaTeX, ensuring that they are still displayed correctly inline and in block forms while adhering to LaTeX best practices for math mode. The implementation should carefully consider different contexts in which expressions are printed to avoid introducing similar issues in other areas.\n  \nThe resolution involves modifying how LaTeX representation of expressions is generated, particularly focusing on mathematical expressions. The modification should be carefully tested with various types of expressions to ensure that the new method of wrapping does not introduce new issues, particularly in complex documents that may include a mix of text, mathematical notation, and other LaTeX features."
