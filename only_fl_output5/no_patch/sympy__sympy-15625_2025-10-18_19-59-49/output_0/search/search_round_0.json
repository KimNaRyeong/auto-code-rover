LaTeX Error: Bad math environment delimiter.\nSee the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.\nType  H <return>  for immediate help.\n...\nl.300     $$\\begin{equation*}\n1\\end{equation*}$$\n?\n!

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, let's structure our approach based on the details provided in the issue description:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Classes and Methods**: The issue is related to how Jupyter notebooks are converted to PDF via LaTeX, particularly how mathematical expressions are handled (`$$...$$` to `$\\displaystyle ...$`). The classes and methods responsible for formatting the LaTeX output would be crucial. Unfortunately, without the specifics of the project's structure, we can't directly identify the relevant classes, but we can infer from the issue description that we should look for methods related to \"printing\", \"LaTeX conversion\", or \"notebook to PDF conversion\".\n\n2. **Search for Code Snippets Mentioned**: The issue specifically mentions the transformation of LaTeX wrapping from `$$`...`$$` to `$\\displaystyle `...`$. Searching for these code snippets directly could lead us to the relevant code sections.\n\nGiven this analysis, our API search strategy will focus on the following:\n\n- Search for code snippets related to the LaTeX error, e.g., the existing LaTeX wrapping code (`$$...$$`).\n- Since the issue mentions specific LaTeX environments (`equation*`), search for related LaTeX commands or environment handling in the codebase.\n- References to \"printing\" or \"LaTeX conversion\" in methods or comments might be crucial.\n\nBased on this strategy, here are the API calls:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_code(\"$$\\\\begin{equation*}\")\nsearch_code(\"$$\")\n```\n\nThese searches aim to directly locate the problematic code snippet handling and identify if there are specific methods or parts of the code dedicated to formatting LaTeX output from a Jupyter notebook that could be causing the issue at hand."
