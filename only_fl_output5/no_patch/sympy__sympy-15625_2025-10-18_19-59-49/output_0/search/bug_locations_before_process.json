        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior at this location is to ensure that when expressions are converted into LaTeX format, the wrapping for single-line expressions does not erroneously use `$$...$$` which is causing the LaTeX error. Instead, the code should implement single expressions using `$\\displaystyle ...$` for correct display in LaTeX documents without error. This change must preserve the functionality of rendering expressions in LaTeX, ensuring that they are still displayed correctly inline and in block forms while adhering to LaTeX best practices for math mode. The implementation should carefully consider different contexts in which expressions are printed to avoid introducing similar issues in other areas."
