        "intended_behavior": "The migration function `update_proxy_model_permissions` should be adapted to correctly handle the case where the default database is not set or when operating in a multi-database configuration. To achieve this, the migration operation involving `Permission.objects.filter().update()` within the `transaction.atomic()` block should explicitly specify which database it intends to operate on, if the default database is not appropriate or defined. This can be done by determining the correct database for `ContentType` and `Permission` models based on Django's database routing rules or the application's specific logic. If necessary, the operation could iterate over all configured databases or target a specific database, as defined by the multi-database setup. This intended behavior ensures that the migration can be applied without assuming the presence of a default database, thereby preventing the `ImproperlyConfigured` error and preserving the existing functionality of correctly migrating permissions associated with proxy models. This adjustment would ensure compatibility with diverse database configurations and adhere to Django's guidelines for multi-database support."
