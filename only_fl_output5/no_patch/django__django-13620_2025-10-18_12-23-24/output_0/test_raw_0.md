To successfully run `python3 reproducer.py`, ensure you have Django installed and properly configured in your project environment. This script will attempt to call the custom Django management command that leverages the `add_mutually_exclusive_group` feature, specifically checking for the inability to properly handle a list input for an argument as described in the issue. When the issue is present, the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace of the issue. If somehow the issue is fixed or does not manifest, the script will simply print "Issue fixed." and exit with code 0.
