I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's address the issue accurately this time. The main objective here is to reproduce an issue related to Django's `call_command` function, especially when dealing with list arguments inside exclusive required groups. This script will attempt to replicate the scenario mentioned, and it should properly capture and print the exception if the issue persists or exit with code 0 if the issue has been fixed.

```python
import django
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand, CommandError
from django.core.management import call_command
from django.conf import settings

# Set up Django environment
settings.configure(
    INSTALLED_APPS=[
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
    ],
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        }
    },
    SECRET_KEY='a_very_secret_key',
)

django.setup()

class Command(BaseCommand):
    def add_arguments(self, parser):
        group = parser.add_mutually_exclusive_group(required=True)
        group.add_argument('--foo', nargs='+', type=int)

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        self.stdout.write(self.style.SUCCESS('Successfully called command with options: %s' % options))

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        # Attempting to call the command with a list argument as described in the issue
        call_command('reproducer', foo=[1, 2, 3])
        print("No exception was raised. It seems the issue has been fixed.")
        # Exiting with code 0 to indicate the potential fix of the issue
        exit(0)
    except CommandError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Raising an AssertionError since the issue is expected to be present
        raise AssertionError("The issue is still present.") from e
```

This script encapsulates the essence of the issue described: it defines a Django command that contains an exclusive required argument group with a list argument. It then tries to call this command using `call_command` with a list argument. If the issue is present, an `AssertionError` is raised, alongside the stack trace of the issue for clarity. Conversely, if the issue has been fixed, the script will exit with code 0, indicating no errors encountered.
