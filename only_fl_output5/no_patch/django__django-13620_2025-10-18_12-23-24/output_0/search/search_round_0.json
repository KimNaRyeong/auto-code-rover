        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we should gather more details about the specific classes and methods mentioned in the issue. The primary areas of interest are the `BaseCommand` class, the `add_arguments` method, and how `call_command` handles arguments, particularly with `nargs='+'` and how types are coerced. Here are the API calls that will help us gather the required context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"BaseCommand\")`: This will help us understand the structure of the `BaseCommand` class, which seems central to the issue.\n2. `search_method(\"add_arguments\")`: Since `add_arguments` is used for adding arguments, finding its usage or definition could give us insight into how arguments are registered and possibly why `nargs='+'` isn't working as expected.\n3. `search_method(\"call_command\")`: Understanding how `call_command` is implemented will be key to understanding why passing a list directly raises an error and why specifying the same option multiple times does not aggregate values as one might expect.\n4. `search_code(\"add_mutually_exclusive_group\")`: This could help us find other usages or modifications of mutually exclusive groups, potentially uncovering custom logic or patches.\n5. `search_code(\"parser.add_argument\")`: By looking for this code snippet, we aim to understand how arguments are typically added, which may reveal why setting `type=str` behaves differently."
