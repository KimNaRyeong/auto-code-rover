        "intended_behavior": "The `call_command` function needs to correctly interpret and pass list arguments to commands, specifically within mutually exclusive groups. The fix should ensure that when `nargs='+'` is specified for an argument, calling the command programmatically with a list should not raise an error about invalid int values. Furthermore, the behavior should be consistent whether the command is invoked via `call_command` or the command line, meaning that if multiple values are provided for a list argument, they should all be passed as a list to the command's `handle` method. This might involve adjusting how arguments are parsed and validated in the `call_command` method to recognize and properly handle list arguments or improving how mutually exclusive groups are processed."

        "intended_behavior": "While the `add_arguments` method itself may not be directly defective, the framework it operates within might require adjustment to support the intended functionality. To resolve the issue, there may need to be an enhancement in how the `add_mutually_exclusive_group` is implemented or how arguments added to such a group are handled internally, especially those with `nargs='+'`. The intended behavior is to allow developers to define commands with mutually exclusive arguments where one of the arguments can accept multiple values (a list) without causing errors in parsing or execution. This could involve changes in the underlying argparse configuration or the custom logic that Django applies on top of argparse to integrate with Django's command infrastructure."
