        "intended_behavior": "The `Command` class in this file should be enhanced to include a new command-line option `--skip-checks`. This involves:\n     - Adding a new option to the command-line arguments parser to recognize `--skip-checks`.\n     - Modifying the `handle` method (or wherever the system checks are invoked) to conditionally execute system checks. If the `--skip-checks` option is provided, the command should bypass the normal system checks' execution flow while preserving all other functionalities of the `runserver` command. This option would ideally be designed to be consistent with the way other management command options are implemented in Django, using the framework's capabilities for defining and handling command-line options.\n     - The preservation of existing functionality is crucial. That means system checks should still run by default unless the `--skip-checks` option is explicitly provided by the user. This ensures that the default behavior of the `runserver` command remains unchanged, maintaining backward compatibility and following Django's design principles."
