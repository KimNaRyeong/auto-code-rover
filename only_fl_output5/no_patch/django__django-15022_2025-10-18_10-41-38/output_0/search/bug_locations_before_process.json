        "intended_behavior": "The method `get_search_results` should be optimized to reduce the number of unnecessary JOIN operations generated when executing searches with multiple terms across related objects. Implementing a way to aggregate search conditions for related fields into a fewer number of more complex ORM queries that achieve the same search results but with less database overhead. Possibly introducing conditional logic that limits the depth or number of JOINs based on the `search_fields` configuration or the number of search terms. Ensuring that the solution preserves the flexibility of the Django admin search_fields, including the ability to specify different types of searches (e.g., starts with, exact match, contains) while enhancing performance. Retaining the functionality to return a tuple containing the modified queryset and a boolean indicating if the results may contain duplicates, without altering the expected outcomes of searches performed through the admin interface."
