        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n1. Search for the `Client` class in the codebase to understand its structure and relationships which might affect the admin query performance.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"Client\")\n   ```\n\n2. Search for the `ClientOffice` class as it's directly related to the performance issue given its ForeignKey relationship to `Client` and its fields being part of the search in the admin.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"ClientOffice\")\n   ```\n\n3. Since the issue mentions the admin options and seems to be specifically related to how the admin handles search fields that span relationships, particularly `search_fields` in `ClientAdmin`, it would be helpful to find the `ClientAdmin` class.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"ClientAdmin\")\n   ```\n\n4. To address the performance issue with the `search_fields` causing multiple JOINs in the query, it is essential to find how Django admin constructs the query for search fields. This requires looking at the method, possibly within `admin.ModelAdmin`, that handles the construction of search queries.\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"get_search_results\", \"ModelAdmin\")\n   ```\n\n5. The specific issue mentions a pattern `qs = qs.filter(...)` which implies there might be a specific method or place where this filtering happens for the admin search functionality. Searching for this code pattern might help identify where the search query is being constructed.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"qs = qs.filter(\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive context around the components involved in the issue, including how `Client` and `ClientOffice` are related, how `ClientAdmin` configures search fields, and specifically how Django admin's search functionality operates in relation to generating SQL queries that result in performance issues."
