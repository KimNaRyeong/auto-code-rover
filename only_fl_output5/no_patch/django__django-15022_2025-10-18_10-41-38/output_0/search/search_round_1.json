It constructs search queries based on the fields specified in `search_fields` of a `ModelAdmin` class. The method supports different types of search operations (e.g., `istartswith`, `iexact`, `icontains`, etc.) based on prefixes in the field names. It then filters the queryset using the constructed search queries and a given search term, possibly creating or queries (`models.Q.OR`).\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\nThe issue described is related to an excessive number of JOIN operations in the SQL queries generated by Django admin when performing searches across related fields (e.g., `clientoffice__name`). This method directly influences how search queries are constructed, including how JOINs are created for related fields in the admin search functionality. The way Django admin constructs these queries, especially with multiple search words leading to multiple `filter` calls (as seen through the use of `queryset.filter` in a loop), may lead to performance issues by spawning unnecessary JOIN operations on the database level.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\nThe intended behavior would be to efficiently handle searches across related models without causing an explosion of JOIN operations that could degrade performance, as observed in the reported issue. It might involve optimizing how search queries are constructed for related fields or limiting the number of JOINs based on the search terms.\n\n### Relationship To the Bug and Further Actions\n\n- The `get_search_results` method is central to how Django admin performs model searches and thus is a key focus for patching the performance issue outlined. Since the current approach of filtering leads to a large number of JOINs, a possible solution might involve modifying how Django constructs search queries for related fields to be more performant or to restrict the number of JOINs created during the process.\n- Considering the search in `search_fields` leads to performance issues when multiple terms are involved, it might be beneficial to look into:\n    - How the `orm_lookups` list is constructed and used. \n    - The loop that processes each `bit` from `smart_split(search_term)` and applies `filter` with `or_queries`.\n\nGiven the absence of direct hits for `Client`, `ClientOffice`, and `ClientAdmin` classes from the search results, the next step could have involved searching for where and how `ModelAdmin` classes are typically used within the Django codebase to understand the broader context of `ModelAdmin` customization, such as specifying `search_fields`. However, with the results at hand, the focus should be on understanding and potentially refactoring the `get_search_results` method to address the performance issue."

Rather than applying a new filter for each search term, which can exponentially increase the number of joins, the method should intelligently consolidate search queries to minimize performance impact. This could involve:\n        - Implementing a way to aggregate search conditions for related fields into a fewer number of more complex ORM queries that achieve the same search results but with less database overhead.\n        - Possibly introducing conditional logic that limits the depth or number of JOINs based on the `search_fields` configuration or the number of search terms.\n        - Ensuring that the solution preserves the flexibility of the Django admin search_fields, including the ability to specify different types of searches (e.g., starts with, exact match, contains) while enhancing performance.\n        - Retaining the functionality to return a tuple containing the modified queryset and a boolean indicating if the results may contain duplicates, without altering the expected outcomes of searches performed through the admin interface.\n      \n     This adjustment aims to balance the feature-rich search capabilities of Django admin with the need for efficient database querying, especially in scenarios with a high volume of data and complex relational models."
