        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `where` function needs to correctly handle the case when the second or third arguments are scalars, especially in relation to the `keep_attrs` parameter. When `keep_attrs=True`, the function attempts to preserve the attributes of the second argument, assuming it is an xarray object with attributes. However, when a scalar is provided, this assumption fails, causing an `IndexError`. The intended behavior should include a check to determine if the second argument is indeed an xarray object that has attributes to preserve. If not (as in the case of scalars or possibly other types without attributes), the function should either skip attribute preservation gracefully or handle it in a manner that logically extends to such cases, potentially defaulting to not attempting to preserve attributes that don't exist. This adjustment ensures that the function's existing functionality to preserve attributes from xarray objects is retained while also gracefully handling cases involving scalars or other non-xarray argument types."
