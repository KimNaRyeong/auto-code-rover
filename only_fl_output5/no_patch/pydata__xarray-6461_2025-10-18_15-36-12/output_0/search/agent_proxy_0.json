This involves locating the code snippet that's triggering the `IndexError` and understanding how attribute preservation is intended to function in scenarios where a scalar is used as the second argument in `xr.where`.\n\nLet's start by looking for the specific code causing the issue and gather more context around its logic:\n\n1. Search for the code snippet that directly triggers the error: `keep_attrs = lambda attrs, context: attrs[1]`\n2. Additionally, since `apply_ufunc` is mentioned in the stack trace, we should gather context about its implementation to understand how it handles the `keep_attrs` parameter: search for the `apply_ufunc` method in the entire codebase as it's not clear in which file or class it resides.\n\nThese searches will help us identify the problematic section of the code and provide a foundation to understand how attributes are managed in the scenario described in the issue."
