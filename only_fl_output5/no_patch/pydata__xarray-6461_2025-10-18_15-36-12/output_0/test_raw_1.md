Given the feedback and the corrected context of the situation, I'll provide a revised version of the `reproducer.py` script to address the specific issue noted in the original problem statement. The new script will ensure it's correctly set up to reproduce the reported error with `xr.where` and `keep_attrs=True`, and manage exceptions properly to check whether the issue persists.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import xarray as xr

    try:
        # Correcting the function call to match xarray's API. Assume `keep_attrs=True` should be part of the call.
        result = xr.where(xr.DataArray([1, 2, 3]) > 0, 1, 0, keep_attrs=True)  # Modified to explicitly include keep_attrs
        print("Operation successful, no error raised.")
    except IndexError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # AssertionError to indicate failure if an IndexError is caught.
        raise AssertionError("The issue is still present.") from e
    except Exception as e:
        # Catching any other unexpected error to provide feedback.
        print("An unexpected error occurred:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Unexpected error encountered.") from e
    else:
        # If no errors are encountered, it suggests the issue with keep_attrs may have been resolved.
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script intentionally aligns with the provided context, intending to replicate the issue described. It should correctly attempt to reproduce the error connected with using `keep_attrs=True` in an `xr.where` call. The `print_stacktrace` function ensures that if the script encounters an exception, the traceback is displayed in a clear, readable manner, helping to identify if the specific issue, an `IndexError` due to how attributes are handled, still exists.
