Given the request and clarifications provided, here is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the reported issue related to `xr.where` with `keep_attrs=True`. Based on the nature of the issue, the script will attempt to execute a problematic code snippet that leads to an error, and it will utilize the provided function to print the stack trace clearly.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import xarray as xr

    try:
        # Attempting the operation that is reported to fail
        xr.where(xr.DataArray([1, 2, 3]) > 0, 1, 0, keep_attrs=True)  # This line is supposed to reproduce the issue
        # If the above line does not raise an exception, the issue might have been fixed
        # Hence, exiting with code 0 to indicate the issue has been addressed
        print("Issue not reproduced; the operation succeeded.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        # Printing stack trace if there is an exception
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Raising AssertionError to indicate the presence of the issue
        raise AssertionError("The issue is still present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This `reproducer.py` script encapsulates the intention to execute the potentially faulty code within a try-except block. On catching an exception, it prints the stack trace of the error encountered using the `print_stacktrace` function for detailed error analysis. The script raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is still present, based on the occurrence of an exception within the try block. Conversely, it exits with code 0 if the issue cannot be reproduced, which would suggest that the problem has been resolved.
