This script tries to replicate the reported issue by invoking the `xr.where` function with a condition, two scalar values for the true and false branches, and `keep_attrs=True`, which was reported to cause an `IndexError`. The script catches any exception to print a detailed stack trace using the `print_stacktrace` function defined at the beginning. If the operation fails with an exception, it raises an `AssertionError` indicating the issue is still present. If no exception is caught, it checks the result to make sure it's as expected (all elements should be `1` in this case), indicating the issue may have been fixed.
