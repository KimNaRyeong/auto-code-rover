This method should accurately reflect if the interval is left-open, right-open, or closed, possibly leading to a string format like \"Interval(0, 1, True, False)\" which indicates the openness or closedness of each side."

For example, `str(FiniteSet(1,2,3))` should ideally result in a string like \"FiniteSet(1, 2, 3)\", maintaining the functional approach of the library and facilitating the use of the string output in code reproduction or serialization."
