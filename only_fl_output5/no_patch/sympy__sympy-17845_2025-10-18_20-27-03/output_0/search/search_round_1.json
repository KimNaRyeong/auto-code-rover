This is useful as any changes to the string representation (`__str__`) method of these classes, or the addition of such methods, need to consider the overall structure and conventions of the module they reside in.\n\n2. **Absence of `__str__` Method**:\n   - The search did not find explicit definitions of the `__str__` method in both `Interval` and `FiniteSet` classes. This absence implies that these classes either inherit the `__str__` method from a parent class (`Set`, `EvalfMixin`, or another ancestor within Sympy's hierarchy) or they rely on Python's default string representation mechanism for objects. Understanding this is crucial for addressing the issue because it means that modifying the string representation to align with the \"str(object) is valid code to create object\" principle may require defining a new `__str__` method or overriding an inherited one.\n\nConsidering the issue:\n- The current string representations for `Interval` and `FiniteSet` are simplistic and human-readable (`[0, 1]` for `Interval(0, 1)` and `{1, 2, 3}` for `FiniteSet(1,2,3)`), but they don't align with the principle that `str(object)` should yield a string that can be evaluated as valid Python code to recreate the object.\n- The intended behavior, therefore, would be to adjust or add a `__str__` method to both classes that returns a string that, when evaluated, would recreate the same object. For `Interval`, this means including arguments related to openness/closedness of the interval, despite concerns about this leading to \"ugly\" or cumbersome representations (e.g., \"Interval(0, 1, True, False)\"). For `FiniteSet`, this means ensuring its string representation reflects the constructor call actually used to create an instance of the class.\n\nNext steps for gathering more context could involve:\n- Exploring the parent classes (`Set`, `EvalfMixin`) for existing `__str__` implementations that these classes inherit.\n- Considering the architecture of `sympy/sets/sets.py` to see if there's a general mechanism or pattern for how string representations are defined across different set types in Sympy, which might provide insight into an elegant solution for both `Interval` and `FiniteSet`. \n\nThus, further API calls may include:\n- `search_method(\"__str__\")` to find how `__str__` is globally implemented across the codebase and identify potential inheritance patterns that affect `Interval` and `FiniteSet`.\n- `search_class(\"Set\")` and/or `search_class(\"EvalfMixin\")` to look into the parent classes and understand their roles in the string representation of objects."

Intended Behavior: Add or modify the `__str__` method to return a string representation that can be evaluated as valid Python code to recreate the `Interval` object, while considering readability and simplicity. This method should accurately reflect if the interval is left-open, right-open, or closed, possibly leading to a string format like \"Interval(0, 1, True, False)\" which indicates the openness or closedness of each side.\n\nLocation 2: File: sympy/sets/sets.py, Class: FiniteSet. Intended Behavior: Add or modify the `__str__` method to ensure that the string representation of a `FiniteSet` object is a valid Python expression that can recreate the same object. For example, `str(FiniteSet(1,2,3))` should ideally result in a string like \"FiniteSet(1, 2, 3)\", maintaining the functional approach of the library and facilitating the use of the string output in code reproduction or serialization."
