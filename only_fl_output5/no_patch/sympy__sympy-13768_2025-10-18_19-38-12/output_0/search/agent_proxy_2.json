This update aims to:\n\n- Perform an early check in the method to identify dimension mismatches that would result in undefined or unexpected results for the dot product operation. For instance, before allowing any transformations (transposing of matrices) or calculations, the method should assert that if `self` is a two-dimensional matrix, then `b` must be a vector or a matrix where one dimension matches exactly and the other is 1 (adhering strictly to matrix multiplication rules).\n  \n- Update the error message for the `ShapeError` to provide specific guidance on compatible dimensions based on the dimensions of `self`, guiding the user on how to rectify their input without having to guess what might have gone wrong.\n\nThis refined behavior will make the method's functionality more robust against misusage while ensuring that the flexibility in handling various shapes (vectors versus matrices) for the dot product does not compromise the mathematical correctness or user expectations."
