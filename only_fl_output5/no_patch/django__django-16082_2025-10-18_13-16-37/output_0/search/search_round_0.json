Since the issue is with the MOD operator in Django expressions, it's likely related to the classes and methods handling expressions, specifically numeric ones. So, I will search for classes related to expressions.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Expression\")\nsearch_class(\"Func\")\nsearch_class(\"F\")\n```\n\n2. The issue description mentions a problem with combining numeric expressions and the MOD operator, where types (Decimal and Integer) do not resolve as expected. This suggests that we should look into how the MOD operation is implemented for expressions. Therefore, I will search for the MOD operator within the codebase, which might be defined as a method or a part of a specific class related to expressions.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"Mod\")\n```\n\n3. Since the issue seems to involve type resolution (Decimal vs. Integer), finding how types are resolved in expressions or specifically with the MOD operator could be key. Thus, looking for code snippets that might deal with type resolution in expressions would be useful.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"output_field\")\n```\n\nThese searches aim to locate the relevant portions of the codebase that could be involved with the issue, providing a solid starting point for further investigation and patching."
