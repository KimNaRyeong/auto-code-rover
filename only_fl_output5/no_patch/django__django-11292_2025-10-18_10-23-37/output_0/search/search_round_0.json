I propose exposing this option on the command line. This would allow users to skip checks when running a command from the command line. Sometimes in a development environment, it is nice to move ahead with a task at hand rather than getting side tracked fixing a system check.\n</issue>"

To understand how management commands are structured and potentially locate where to add the new option, I will search for a base class or commonly used class for management commands, often named something like `BaseCommand` or `Command`.\n   - `search_class(\"BaseCommand\")`\n\n2. I need to find an example command or a file where management commands are defined or implemented to understand how command line options are currently added.\n   - `search_code(\"add_arguments(parser)\")`\n\n3. Given that the issue mentions that there is already a `skip_checks` stealth option, I will search for this in the codebase to understand how it's currently used, which could highlight where and how to properly expose it as a command-line option.\n   - `search_code(\"skip_checks\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a starting point by identifying relevant classes, methods, and usage patterns for implementing the new feature."
