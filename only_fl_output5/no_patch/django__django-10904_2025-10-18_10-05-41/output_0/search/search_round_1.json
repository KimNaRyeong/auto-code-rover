With this in mind, the Django code base can be cleaned up.\nFor additional details, see the Python 3.3 release notes:\n\u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#pep-3151-reworking-the-os-and-io-exception-hierarchy\nYou don\u2019t have to worry anymore about choosing the appropriate exception type between OSError, IOError, EnvironmentError, WindowsError, mmap.error, socket.error or select.error. All these exception types are now only one: OSError. The other names are kept as aliases for compatibility reasons.\nAdditionally, since Python 3.4, SMTPException is subclass of OSError . So exception handles catching both can be simplified to just OSError.\n\u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html#smtplib.SMTPException\nSubclass of OSError that is the base exception class for all the other exceptions provided by this module.\nChanged in version 3.4: SMTPException became subclass of OSError\n</issue>"

Given the information provided and the type of issue at hand, let's plan the use of the search API calls to gather the required context. \n\nWe should look for uses of each alias (exception type) that need to be replaced with `OSError`. Here's how we could approach it using the search APIs:\n\n1. **Search for code snippets that use the specific exceptions.** This will help in understanding how widespread these aliases are used across the codebase.\n\n- `search_code(\"IOError\")`\n- `search_code(\"EnvironmentError\")`\n- `search_code(\"WindowsError\")`\n- `search_code(\"mmap.error\")`\n- `search_code(\"socket.error\")`\n- `search_code(\"select.error\")`\n- `search_code(\"SMTPException\")` \n\nEach of these calls will return instances where these aliases are referenced, providing insight into where changes are required. This comprehensive approach ensures that all instances are caught, especially given the diverse use cases across network, file, and OS operations.\n\nRemember, once we get the results, for any file or method that seems heavily involved or specifically focused on exception handling, additional context from those files or methods may be required to properly adjust the handling of exceptions. This could involve further calls like `get_code_around_line` or `search_method_in_file` depending on the information returned by the initial searches."

        "content": "Based on the API call results, let's analyze the context and understand the current use of exception aliases and how it relates to the issue at hand.\n\n### IOError Usage\n- Appearances of `IOError` are scattered across several files concerning file handling (`storage.py`, `temp.py`, `move.py`), server responses (`response.py`), and more. These instances most likely pertain to operations that could fail due to IO issues, such as file access or network problems.\n- The relationship to the issue is direct, as these `IOError` usages should now be replaced with `OSError` to simplify the codebase and standardize exception handling.\n- The intended behavior, post-replacement, would not change the functional outcome but would align the codebase with Python 3.3+'s unified exception model.\n\n### EnvironmentError Usage\n- The `EnvironmentError` is used in `libgeos.py` and `libgdal.py` within configuration loading parts, likely to catch issues accessing environment or configuration-related specifics. Given that `EnvironmentError` is a broader exception that `IOError` was subclassed from, its usage here indicates attempts to handle various environmental setup issues gracefully.\n- This usage is also directly related to the issue, and replacing `EnvironmentError` with `OSError` will have the same benefits as replacing `IOError`.\n- The intended behavior remains to gracefully handle and react to potential misconfigurations or issues in accessing necessary libraries.\n\n### WindowsError Usage\n- No instances found. This likely means there were no platform-specific exception handling blocks for Windows that misused `WindowsError`. This simplifies the cleanup task somewhat.\n\n### mmap.error and select.error Usage\n- No instances found for `mmap.error` and `select.error`. This absence suggests that the application does not directly handle exceptions specific to memory-mapped file objects and the select module in a way that would now be considered incorrect.\n\n### socket.error Usage\n- Found in server and email backend files. This indicates handling network-related errors specifically incurred from socket operations.\n- These usages are critical to the issue since `socket.error` is another instance where the exception should be replaced with `OSError`.\n- The intended behavior here would be to handle socket errors in operations such as running the server or sending emails through SMTP in a unified manner with `OSError`.\n\n### SMTPException Usage\n- The instances of `SMTPException` are found within the email backend functionality, specifically dealing with SMTP operations. This subclassing change since Python 3.4 means that catching `SMTPException` alone without considering `OSError` might overlook some network/socket-related errors that are now encompassed by `OSError`.\n- This usage is significant to the issue since it underlines the necessity to consolidate exception handling around SMTP operations to just `OSError`.\n- The intended behavior should ensure that SMTP communication errors, regardless of their nature (whether they are network issues or SMTP protocol-specific issues), are handled appropriately and uniformly with `OSError`.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on this analysis, it's clear that replacing these specific exceptions with `OSError` across the Django codebase is a straightforward refactor intended to streamline and modernize error handling. This task does not aim to alter the functional aspect of exception handling but rather to make the code cleaner and more maintainable by adhering to Python's unified exception hierarchy introduced in version 3.3."

Replace these with `OSError`, maintaining the response handling integrity.\n\n3. **File:** django/http/request.py\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Uses of `IOError` here are probably for handling request body reading or parsing issues. Substituting `IOError` with `OSError` without changing the error handling logic for request processing is required.\n\n4. **File:** django/utils/translation/trans_real.py\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Replace `IOError` with `OSError` in this translation mechanism, ensuring that translation file access errors continue to be handled effectively.\n\n5. **File:** django/views/debug.py, django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py, etc.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** In these and all other files where `IOError` appears, replace with `OSError`. The aim is to maintain current error management strategies, whether for debugging, static file management, or session handling, while updating exception types to `OSError`.\n\n6. **File:** django/contrib/gis/geos/libgeos.py and django/contrib/gis/gdal/libgdal.py, in methods `load_geos` and similar contexts \n   - **Intended Behavior:** `EnvironmentError` should be replaced with `OSError`. The handling of configuration and library loading errors for GIS features should remain as is, ensuring graceful degradation or informative error messages without altering the existing flow.\n\n7. **File:** django/core/management/commands/runserver.py, django/core/servers/basehttp.py, and django/core/mail/backends/smtp.py for `socket.error`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Here, `socket.error` replacements with `OSError` should keep the server's ability to handle network-related errors (like address in use or connection issues) intact, ensuring robust server and email backends operation.\n\n8. **File:** django/core/mail/backends/smtp.py for `SMTPException`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Given `SMTPException`'s subclassing from `OSError`, use just `OSError` for simplicity while ensuring SMTP operation errors (login, connection closure, mail sending) are handled as before, just with a unified exception type.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis comprehensive approach to replacing outdated or redundant exception aliases with the more general `OSError` across various parts of Django is intended to streamline exception handling without altering the functional behavior of the application. Preserving the original logic behind each try-except block ensures the application's resilience and operational logic remain unaffected while conforming to Python's current best practices for exception handling."
