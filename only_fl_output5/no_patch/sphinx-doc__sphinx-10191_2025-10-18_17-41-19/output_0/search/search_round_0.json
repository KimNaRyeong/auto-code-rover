        "content": "To address the issue of alternating multiply referred footnotes producing a \"?\" in PDF output when using Sphinx, we need to gather more context about how Sphinx processes footnotes for LaTeX (PDF) generation. Given the bug's description, the process involves parsing the `.rst` files, identifying footnote references, and correctly linking them in the output PDF. Therefore, the relevant pieces might involve classes and methods responsible for parsing `.rst` files, handling footnote references, and generating LaTeX output.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls to get more context:\n\n1. Search for code or methods related to parsing or processing footnotes within `.rst` files. Since the issue description doesn't specify class or method names, we'll start with a broad search relevant to processing or handling footnotes:\n    - `search_code(\"footnote\")`\n    - `search_code(\"rst\")`\n\n2. Since the output is LaTeX (PDF), and the bug is specifically in the PDF output, it would be relevant to search for classes or methods that handle the LaTeX generation part:\n    - `search_code(\"latex\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a starting point for understanding how Sphinx processes footnotes for LaTeX documents and may illuminate where the bug could be situated."
