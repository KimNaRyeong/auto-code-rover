Based on the analysis, potential bug locations and their intended behavior to resolve the issue might be:\n\n**Bug Location 1:**\n- **File:** `sphinx/writers/latex.py`\n- **Intended Behavior:** This file is responsible for generating the LaTeX output from the Sphinx documentation sources. The code here should ensure that footnotes are correctly processed, such that when a footnote is referenced more than once, each reference correctly links to the single footnote definition in the LaTeX output, avoiding the occurrence of \"?\" in place of subsequent references. The intended behavior would incorporate checking and properly handling multiple references to the same footnote, ensuring that LaTeX commands generated for footnotes allow for this kind of reuse without error.\n\n**Bug Location 2:**\n- **File:** `sphinx/builders/latex/transforms.py`\n- **Intended Behavior:** Given that this file likely deals with transformations specific to generating LaTeX output, including potentially how footnotes are transformed from their representation in `.rst` files to LaTeX commands, the intended behavior here would involve correctly identifying and transforming multiple references to the same footnote. This would mean ensuring that the transform process accounts for repeated references to footnotes, translating them into LaTeX in a way that preserves the links without leading to unresolved references, signified by \"?\" in the PDF output.\n\nBoth locations share the common goal of ensuring the proper handling and transformation of footnote references in LaTeX output, specifically addressing the issue where multiple references to the same footnote do not correctly link back to the footnote's content in the rendered PDF. The changes should allow for the expected functionality of footnotes to be preserved across multiple references within the same document in the LaTeX and ultimately PDF outputs."
