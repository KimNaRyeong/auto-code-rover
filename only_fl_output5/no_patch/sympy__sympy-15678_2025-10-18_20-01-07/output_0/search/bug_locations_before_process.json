        "intended_behavior": "For handling Eq objects: The method should first check if the argument eq passed to idiff is an instance of Eq. If it is, it should extract the equation in a form that the rest of the idiff function can process, likely by converting Eq to an expression that equals zero. This preserves the assumption the idiff makes about the equation being equal to zero. For example, if an Eq object is given, convert it into the form lhs - rhs to maintain compatibility with the method's logic.\n\nFor supporting functions of x (f(x)) as dependent variables: The method needs to be revised to properly recognize and handle cases where y is not simply a Symbol but a more complex expression involving a function of x. This may involve adjusting how dep (the set of dependent variables) and f (the dictionary mapping symbols to their function forms) are generated, to accommodate not just Symbol but also Function objects or expressions involving x. The code needs to be robust enough to differentiate with respect to x for any expression involving x, encapsulated through functions or otherwise.\n\nThis involves enhancing the logic that determines if y is dependent on x and treating functions of x as valid entities for differentiation, possibly by improving how dep and f are defined to recognize and handle these cases. This adjustment would not only fix the current issues but also enhance idiff's ability to work with a broader range of mathematical expressions, thereby preserving the existing functionality while extending its applicability."
