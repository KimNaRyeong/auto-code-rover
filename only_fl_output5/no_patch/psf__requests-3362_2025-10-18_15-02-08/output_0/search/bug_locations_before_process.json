        "intended_behavior": "The `iter_content` method should ensure that when `decode_unicode=True` is specified, the chunks yielded are properly decoded unicode strings (using the response's apparent encoding if necessary), not bytes. This implies fixing or enhancing the handling around the `decode_unicode` logic, specifically where it determines whether to decode the chunks and which encoding to use for this. The correction should ensure that when `decode_unicode` is set to `True`, the method reliably yields decoded unicode strings rather than raw bytes, aligning its behavior more closely with the user's expectations and making it consistent with the documentation and the behavior of `r.text`. The existing functionality - allowing users to iterate over the content as bytes when `decode_unicode=False` and the functionality around streaming large responses without loading them into memory at once - should be preserved."
