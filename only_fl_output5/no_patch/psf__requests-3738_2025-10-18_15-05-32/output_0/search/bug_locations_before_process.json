        "intended_behavior": "This method should be modified to allow URL preparation for non-HTTP schemes if they are explicitly allowed or registered by the user. This means extending the functionality to not just bypass URLs with schemes other than `http://` or `https://`. A registry or configuration setting could be introduced at the `Session` level, allowing users to specify which schemes should be treated like HTTP schemes for the purpose of URL preparation. This would involve adding a check against this new registry/configuration within the `if` condition that currently skips URL preparation for non-HTTP schemes. The condition at lines 349-352 needs to be adjusted to account for the new mechanism, allowing specified non-HTTP schemes to undergo the same preparation process as HTTP URLs, including parameter encoding and normalization. The solution should preserve the existing functionality for all standard HTTP and HTTPS URLs and add new functionality for user-defined schemes without altering the behavior for truly unsupported or unknown schemes not explicitly marked by the user for HTTP-like processing. This approach ensures backward compatibility while providing flexibility for cases like `http+unix`."
