This may break some more benign uses such as `http+unix`, which wanted to add parameters to their URLs.\nWhile this is inline with our intended policies (we do not understand URLs that have schemes we don't know anything about), this, along with the IDNA behaviour in v2.12.{0,1} will probably have broken a whole bunch of people using these non-standard URL schemes.\nWe should consider whether Session objects should have a registry of places to look for URL preparation based on scheme. This will allow people to opt-in to the HTTP-like processing of URLs, as well as to register their own.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to find relevant parts of the codebase where URL parameters are added to URLs and understand how the scheme of a URL is currently being checked or processed. The relevant parts likely involve a Session object since the issue suggests considering whether Session objects should have a registry of places to look for URL preparation based on scheme. Therefore, we should look into the Session object's implementation, particularly methods related to preparing or processing URLs.\n\nGiven the details, I'll perform the following API calls to gather sufficient code context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Session\")`: To find where the Session class is defined in the codebase.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"prepare_request\", \"Session\")`: To find how requests are being prepared, which may include adding parameters to URLs.\n3. `search_method(\"prepare_url\")`: Since URL preparation, including parameter addition, would logically involve a method potentially named something like `prepare_url`, this search could reveal if there's a dedicated method for URL preparation.\n4. `search_code(\"scheme not in\")`: Based on the issue's description, there might be a conditional check that excludes URLs with non-standard schemes from certain processing. Searching for this pattern can help locate where the problematic behavior is implemented.\n5. `search_code(\"http+unix\")`: To look for any specific handling or examples of non-standard schemes like `http+unix`, which might give clues on where the issue could be fixed or provide context for how these schemes were expected to be handled."

        "content": "The analysis of the collected context from the API calls provides insight into the structure and functionality of the `requests` library, especially regarding how URLs are processed and prepared for HTTP requests. Here\u2019s a breakdown based on the provided results:\n\n### 1. `Session` Class (`requests/sessions.py`)\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n    - The `Session` class manages and persists settings across requests (e.g., cookies, headers). The method `prepare_request` constructs a `PreparedRequest` object, merging settings from the `Request` instance and the `Session`.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug:**\n    - The `prepare_request` method is likely where parameters should be correctly handled and attached to URLs, regardless of the URL scheme. This is relevant because the issue specifically mentions problems with adding parameters for URLs with unrecognized schemes.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n    - It should allow parameters to be added to URLs with non-standard schemes (like `http+unix`) if explicitly desired by the user or through some registry mechanism as suggested.\n\n### 2. `prepare_url` Method in `PreparedRequest` Class (`requests/models.py`)\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n    - This method prepares the URL for the request, including decoding bytes to UTF-8, stripping leading whitespaces, and encoding parameters. It specifically avoids altering URLs that don\u2019t start with `http://` or `https://`, directly assigning such URLs to the request without modification.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug:**\n    - This piece of code directly relates to the bug as it explicitly avoids preparing URLs with non-HTTP schemes (`http+unix`), which is the core issue reported.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n    - While it currently skips processing for non-HTTP schemes, the intended behavior might involve providing a way to prepare these URLs similarly to HTTP URLs when necessary or allowing custom handling via a user-defined mechanism.\n\n### 3. Non-HTTP Schemes Handling (`requests/models.py` and `requests/packages/urllib3/poolmanager.py`)\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n    - It checks the scheme of URLs and decides whether to process them. The PoolManager in `urllib3` raises an exception for proxy schemes not recognized as \"http\" or \"https\".\n\n- **Relationship with the bug:**\n    - The handling of schemes not starting with `http://` or `https://` by avoiding URL preparation and the specific check in the proxy manager for supported schemes are indicative of how the requests library processes schemes, which is central to the issue at hand.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n    - For the `prepare_url` method, the library could provide a mechanism (e.g., a registry as suggested in the issue) to treat certain non-HTTP schemes as HTTP-like for URL preparation purposes. This could involve a more flexible scheme check or a user configuration that allows for the inclusion of additional schemes.\n\nGiven the collected context, the solution might involve altering the `prepare_url` method to allow non-HTTP schemes to be prepared under certain conditions or through a registration mechanism that allows for custom or additional scheme handling. This would support use cases like `http+unix` without compromising the general handling of truly unsupported or unknown schemes."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

This means extending the functionality to not just bypass URLs with schemes other than `http://` or `https://`. A registry or configuration setting could be introduced at the `Session` level, allowing users to specify which schemes should be treated like HTTP schemes for the purpose of URL preparation. This would involve adding a check against this new registry/configuration within the `if` condition that currently skips URL preparation for non-HTTP schemes. The condition at lines 349-352 needs to be adjusted to account for the new mechanism, allowing specified non-HTTP schemes to undergo the same preparation process as HTTP URLs, including parameter encoding and normalization. \n\nThe solution should preserve the existing functionality for all standard HTTP and HTTPS URLs and add new functionality for user-defined schemes without altering the behavior for truly unsupported or unknown schemes not explicitly marked by the user for HTTP-like processing. This approach ensures backward compatibility while providing flexibility for cases like `http+unix`."
