This may break some more benign uses such as `http+unix`, which wanted to add parameters to their URLs.\nWhile this is inline with our intended policies (we do not understand URLs that have schemes we don't know anything about), this, along with the IDNA behaviour in v2.12.{0,1} will probably have broken a whole bunch of people using these non-standard URL schemes.\nWe should consider whether Session objects should have a registry of places to look for URL preparation based on scheme. This will allow people to opt-in to the HTTP-like processing of URLs, as well as to register their own.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to find relevant parts of the codebase where URL parameters are added to URLs and understand how the scheme of a URL is currently being checked or processed. The relevant parts likely involve a Session object since the issue suggests considering whether Session objects should have a registry of places to look for URL preparation based on scheme. Therefore, we should look into the Session object's implementation, particularly methods related to preparing or processing URLs.\n\nGiven the details, I'll perform the following API calls to gather sufficient code context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Session\")`: To find where the Session class is defined in the codebase.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"prepare_request\", \"Session\")`: To find how requests are being prepared, which may include adding parameters to URLs.\n3. `search_method(\"prepare_url\")`: Since URL preparation, including parameter addition, would logically involve a method potentially named something like `prepare_url`, this search could reveal if there's a dedicated method for URL preparation.\n4. `search_code(\"scheme not in\")`: Based on the issue's description, there might be a conditional check that excludes URLs with non-standard schemes from certain processing. Searching for this pattern can help locate where the problematic behavior is implemented.\n5. `search_code(\"http+unix\")`: To look for any specific handling or examples of non-standard schemes like `http+unix`, which might give clues on where the issue could be fixed or provide context for how these schemes were expected to be handled."
