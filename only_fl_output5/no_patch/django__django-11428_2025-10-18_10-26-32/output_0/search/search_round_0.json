The consequence is that you just get a TypeError exception about __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'other_thing' and it completely masks the original exception.\nNote that this behavior was changed in c8720e7696ca41f3262d5369365cc1bd72a216ca, it used to just re-raise the exception value. I don't know why it was changed.\nI noticed this issue as a result of \u200bhttps://gitlab.com/alantrick/django-vox/issues/9\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue related to the autoreloader crashing on re-raising exceptions with custom signatures, I will invoke the following search API calls:\n\n1. Search for the function that is directly involved in the issue, as described in the issue - `django.utils.autoreload.raise_last_exception`. I'll first find the method to see its implementation details and understand how it currently tries to re-raise exceptions.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_method(\"raise_last_exception\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the change that introduced the issue is mentioned to have occurred in a specific commit (`c8720e7696ca41f3262d5369365cc1bd72a216ca`), it's essential to examine the function `raise_last_exception` around the time of this commit to understand the change's impact. However, since I can't directly query by commit, examining the current state of the method should provide cues or comments regarding its evolution.\n\n3. Additionally, understanding how exceptions are being raised within the context of a Django app configuration could provide insight. The `AppConfig.ready` method, where the specific exception raising happens, is mentioned. Getting the context of an `AppConfig` class and its `ready` method is required to fully understand the use case and where it fails.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"AppConfig\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"ready\", \"AppConfig\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls will allow me to gather detailed context about how `raise_last_exception` currently functions, the design and implementation of the `AppConfig` class and its `ready` method, and how exceptions should be properly handled within this context. This information will be crucial for developing a patch that addresses the reported issue."
