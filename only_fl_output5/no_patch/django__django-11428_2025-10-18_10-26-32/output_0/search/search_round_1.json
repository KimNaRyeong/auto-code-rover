The consequence is that you just get a TypeError exception about __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'other_thing' and it completely masks the original exception.\nNote that this behavior was changed in c8720e7696ca41f3262d5369365cc1bd72a216ca, it used to just re-raise the exception value. I don't know why it was changed.\nI noticed this issue as a result of \u200bhttps://gitlab.com/alantrick/django-vox/issues/9\n</issue>"

Since the change that introduced the issue is mentioned to have occurred in a specific commit (`c8720e7696ca41f3262d5369365cc1bd72a216ca`), it's essential to examine the function `raise_last_exception` around the time of this commit to understand the change's impact. However, since I can't directly query by commit, examining the current state of the method should provide cues or comments regarding its evolution.\n\n3. Additionally, understanding how exceptions are being raised within the context of a Django app configuration could provide insight. The `AppConfig.ready` method, where the specific exception raising happens, is mentioned. Getting the context of an `AppConfig` class and its `ready` method is required to fully understand the use case and where it fails.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"AppConfig\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"ready\", \"AppConfig\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls will allow me to gather detailed context about how `raise_last_exception` currently functions, the design and implementation of the `AppConfig` class and its `ready` method, and how exceptions should be properly handled within this context.

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### `raise_last_exception` in `django/utils/autoreload.py`\n\n##### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `raise_last_exception` function checks if there is a globally stored exception (`_exception`) and, if present, re-raises it. This is done by creating a new instance of the exception class with its original argument (`_exception[1]`) and attaching the original traceback (`_exception[2]`) to it.\n\n##### Relationship with the bug\nThe issue description points to a problem where `raise_last_exception` cannot properly handle exceptions with custom constructors that expect more than one argument. This is because the function, as shown in the analysis, attempts to reconstruct the exception with a single argument (`_exception[1]`), disregarding any additional parameters required by the exception's `__init__` method. This leads to a `TypeError` when an exception with a custom signature is re-raised.\n\n##### Intended Behavior\nThe intended behavior would allow for exceptions, irrespective of their signature, to be re-raised without causing a `TypeError`. This implies that `raise_last_exception` needs to adapt to different exception signatures or avoid instantiation that disregards the original parameters beyond the first one.\n\n#### `AppConfig` in `django/apps/config.py` and its `ready` method\n\n##### What does this part of the code do?\n`AppConfig` is a class representing a Django application and its configuration. The `ready` method is meant to be overridden by subclasses to perform initialization tasks at Django startup, such as registering signals or creating models dynamically.\n\n##### Relationship with the bug\nThe issue occurs when an overridden `ready` method in a subclass of `AppConfig` raises a custom exception. Since `raise_last_exception` does not handle custom exceptions well, it causes a `TypeError`, masking the original exception raised in the `ready` method. This makes debugging startup errors difficult, especially for Django applications that depend on complex startup sequences.\n\n##### Intended Behavior\nIn the context of this bug, the `ready` method should be able to raise any exception, and the exception handling mechanism (such as `raise_last_exception`) should faithfully re-raise these exceptions without alteration or loss of information. This ensures that errors raised during the application startup are accurately reported back to the developer.\n\n### Next Steps for Patch Development\n\nGiven this analysis, a patch should aim to modify `raise_last_exception` to handle exceptions with custom signatures more gracefully. This could involve several strategies, such as:\n\n- Directly re-raising the stored exception object without attempting to reconstruct it, thus preserving its original state, including its arguments and traceback.\n- Inspecting the exception's constructor (`__init__`) to dynamically adapt to different numbers of arguments.\n- Implementing a more complex exception handling mechanism that can serialize and deserialize exceptions with custom signatures accurately.\n\nThis analysis sets the stage for developing a solution that addresses the bug while maintaining the current system's design and intentions."

This method should check if the `_exception` global variable is not `None` and, if so, directly re-raise the exception using the Python `raise` keyword with the original exception object. This approach will ensure that any exception, regardless of its signature, is re-raised correctly, preserving its original state (including arguments and traceback). This change should be made while ensuring that any functionalities relying on the current behavior of `raise_last_exception` are not adversely affected. The direct re-raising could be achieved by modifying the existing implementation to simply `raise _exception[0], None, _exception[2]` if maintaining compatibility with the current structure of `_exception` or by adjusting the structure to store and re-raise the exception object more directly."
