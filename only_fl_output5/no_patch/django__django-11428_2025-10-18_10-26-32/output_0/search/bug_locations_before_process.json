        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the intended behavior of `raise_last_exception` should be to re-raise the original exception without altering its state or attempting to reconstruct it in a way that might lead to errors such as `TypeError` due to mismatched constructor arguments. This method should check if the `_exception` global variable is not `None` and, if so, directly re-raise the exception using the Python `raise` keyword with the original exception object. This approach will ensure that any exception, regardless of its signature, is re-raised correctly, preserving its original state (including arguments and traceback). This change should be made while ensuring that any functionalities relying on the current behavior of `raise_last_exception` are not adversely affected. The direct re-raising could be achieved by modifying the existing implementation to simply `raise _exception[0], None, _exception[2]` if maintaining compatibility with the current structure of `_exception` or by adjusting the structure to store and re-raise the exception object more directly."
