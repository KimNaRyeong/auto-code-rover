This script tries to simulate the behavior seen in Django's autoreloader that leads to the problem described. The `simulate_autoreloader_behavior` function attempts to recreate the issue where re-raising an exception with a custom `__init__` signature causes a `TypeError`, which would be indicative of the original issue being present. If the issue is fixed (meaning, a custom exception with multiple arguments can be re-raised correctly by the autoreloader), the script will exit with code `0` and print that the issue has been fixed. Otherwise, it prints the stack trace of the error caused by the simulated behavior and exits with code `1`.
