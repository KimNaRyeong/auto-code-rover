        "intended_behavior": "The exponential function's implementation should account for its periodic nature when dealing with purely imaginary numbers as arguments. This means if the argument is a purely imaginary number, the function should simplify the argument based on Euler's formula, considering the periodicity of `2\u03c0`. This would entail adding logic to detect when the argument is a purely imaginary number that can be reduced via periodicity and applying such a reduction before proceeding with the rest of the calculation. This preserves existing functionality while fixing the issue related to simplification based on periodicity."

        "intended_behavior": "The simplify method should be enhanced to recognize and exploit the periodic nature of complex exponential functions more effectively. This includes recognizing when an expression could be significantly simplified by applying the principle of periodicity for expressions involving `exp` with imaginary arguments. The correction would involve checking for and simplifying expressions where the argument of an exponential function can be adjusted based on its periodicity without altering the existing logic that handles other types of simplifications. This ensures that the simplification process is more comprehensive and accurate for exponential functions with purely imaginary arguments."
