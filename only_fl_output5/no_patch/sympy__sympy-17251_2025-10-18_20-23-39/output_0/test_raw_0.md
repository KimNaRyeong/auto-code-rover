The script defines a test function `test_simplify_exp` that checks whether the `simplify` function correctly handles the periodicity of the exponential function with purely imaginary arguments. 

- If the issue exists, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace of where the error occurred in the script, indicating the issue is present.
- If the `AssertionError` doesn't occur, it implies that the `simplify` and `expand_complex` functions are working as expected regarding the periodicity of the exponential function, and it prints a confirmation message.

Please run this script within the context of your project to check if the issue is present. If the script exits with code `0`, it means the issue regarding the simplification of the exponential function based on its periodicity is fixed. If an `AssertionError` is raised, the script exits with code `1`, indicating the issue is still present.
