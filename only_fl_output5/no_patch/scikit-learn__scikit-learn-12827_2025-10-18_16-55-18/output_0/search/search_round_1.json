Search for the class `QuantileTransformer` in the codebase to understand where it is defined and potentially identify any related documentation or comments that are already present.\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"QuantileTransformer\")\n    ```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions interest in how the quantile transformation maps to a uniform distribution and concerns about the empirical CDF computation, we will look for methods within `QuantileTransformer` that are likely responsible for this behavior. Common statistical terms related to these processes include \"fit\", \"transform\", and possibly methods related to the empirical CDF or quantile calculation.\n    ```python\n    search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"QuantileTransformer\")\n    search_method_in_class(\"transform\", \"QuantileTransformer\")\n    ```\n\n3. It's also helpful to see if there's any code that directly references empirical CDF or related statistical terms within the scope of the `QuantileTransformer`. This can help clarify the implementation details the issue is asking for.\n    ```python\n    search_code_in_class(\"empirical\", \"QuantileTransformer\")\n    search_code_in_class(\"cdf\", \"QuantileTransformer\")\n    ```\n\nThese API calls should provide a solid basis for understanding how the `QuantileTransformer` is implemented and identifying the specific parts of the documentation that need enhancement."

Given the specifics of the issue, search for snippets or methods that might be involved in computing or referencing the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF), or any implementation detail related to quantile transformation, by searching the entire codebase for relevant snippets of code. This is a broader approach since we don't have specific method names or exact snippets to look for:\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"empirical CDF\")\n    search_code(\"quantile transformation\")\n    ```\n\nThese calls should help identify where in the codebase the `QuantileTransformer` is defined and provide insight into its implementation, specifically regarding how it performs the quantile transformation or computes the empirical CDF, which are central to the issue reported."
