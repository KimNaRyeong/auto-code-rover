Given the error from the previous execution attempt, it looks like there was an issue with the way the Django project setup was handled within the script. The error message indicates a problem with the URL configuration, which isn't actually relevant to our script that focuses on Django models and database operations. So, I'll adjust the script setup to avoid this issue, positively ensuring we don't depend on URL configuration and thus sidestep the encountered `ImproperlyConfigured` exception related to URLconf.

This updated script will directly set up models, execute the migrations programmatically (without relying on Django's `manage.py migrate`), and run the test case to reproduce the described issue without necessitating an actual URL configuration.

```python
import sys
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models, connections, DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS
from django.db.models import F, FloatField, OuterRef, Subquery, Sum, Count, Case, When
from django.db.models.functions import Round
from django.core.management.color import no_style
from django.core.exceptions import FieldError

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    traceback.print_exception(type(e), e, e.__traceback__, file=sys.stderr)

# Define a Django-compatible settings environment
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=[
        '__main__',
    ]
)

from django.apps import apps
apps.populate(settings.INSTALLED_APPS)

# Define models inline
class User(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class OtherModel(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    total = models.IntegerField()

class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Book(models.Model):
    authors = models.ManyToManyField(Author, related_name='books')
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

# Function to programmatically create the table schema (migrations)
def create_tables():
    connection = connections[DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS]
    with connection.schema_editor() as editor:
        editor.create_model(User)
        editor.create_model(OtherModel)
        editor.create_model(Author)
        editor.create_model(Book)

# Create tables
create_tables()

# Begin testing the aggregation issue
try:
    # Assuming the models are defined in the global scope above (i.e., User, OtherModel, Book, Author)
    # Populate database for test (omitted for brevity, use your setup or factories as necessary)

    # Reproducing the issue with a complex query involving annotated and aggregated fields
    annotated_authors = Author.objects.annotate(
        total_books=Subquery(
            Book.objects.filter(authors=OuterRef("pk"))
                        .annotate(total=Count("pk"))
                        .values("total")
        )
    ).aggregate(
        sum_total_books=Sum("total_books"),
        avg_conversion_rate=Case(
            When(
                sum_total_books=0,
                then=0,
            ),
            default=Round(
                (Sum("total_books") / Sum("total_books")) * 100, 2
            ),
            output_field=FloatField(),
        )
    )

    print("Aggregation attempted without raising FieldError, change detected.")
except FieldError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit("FieldError encountered, issue reproduced.")

```

This streamlined script aims directly at the core of your issue by focusing on Django model definitions and database interactions without additional complexities such as URL routing. Furthermore, it demonstrates an attempt to reproduce the aggregation issue directly. Adjustments were made to remove unnecessary parts and focus solely on reproducing the described issue within a minimal and self-contained example.
