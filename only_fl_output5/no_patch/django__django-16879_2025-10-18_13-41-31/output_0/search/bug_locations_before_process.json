This may involve ensuring that the aggregation process can handle dynamic field references created through annotations and process them correctly in conditional statements. The functionality must continue to allow for the aggregation of values across the dataset, while also handling conditional logic without throwing a `FieldError`."

This may require adjustments to how annotated fields are tracked or how their references are resolved in subsequent query stages. The adjustment must preserve the method's ability to add annotations to querysets without affecting existing functionality unrelated to the issue."
