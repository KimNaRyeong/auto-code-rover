Based on your request to create a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that can reproduce the issue, the below example captures the essence of the problem described. This script is quite specific in attempting to re-create the reported bug under Django's ORM system and will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue persists or exit with code 0 when the issue is resolved. I have updated and included proper model creation and database setup for a clean execution environment.

Please note, for this script to run, you should have Django installed in your Python environment and should modify `DATABASES` setting according to your database setup if you're not using SQLite.

```python

reproducer.py
This script aims to reproduce the aggregation issue described, with Django ORM.

Before running this script, make sure you have Django installed in your environment. You can run it directly via `python3 reproducer.py` (assuming Django is properly installed). This script should ideally be run in an environment where you are okay with creating a `db.sqlite3` file, as it doesn't clean up the SQLite database file after execution. If the issue described in the initial problem exists, the script will raise an exception and print a stack trace, helping you debug the problem in your Django setup. If the aggregation works as expected (which should be the case once the issue is fixed in Django), it will simply print "Test passed, issue seems fixed."
