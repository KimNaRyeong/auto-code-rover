Keeping everything below the horizontal line is good, but the bottom looks asymmetric, and it makes the \u220f bigger than it needs to be.\n- The \u220f is too fat IMO.\n- It might look better if we extended the top bar. I'm unsure about this.\nCompare this\n```\n\u221e\n\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\n\u2502     \u2502  1\n\u2502     \u2502  \u2500\u2500\n\u2502     \u2502   2\n\u2502     \u2502  n\nn = 1\n```\nThat's still almost twice as wide as the equivalent Sum, but if you make it much skinnier it starts to look bad.\n```\n\u221e\n____\n\u2572\n\u2572   1\n\u2572  \u2500\u2500\n\u2571   2\n\u2571   n\n\u2571\n\u203e\u203e\u203e\u203e\nn = 1\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to pretty printing improvements for the `Product` class, especially focusing on making the \u220f presentation more aesthetic and compact, the following API calls would be useful:\n\n1. **Search for the `Product` class**: This will help us to locate the files and code base areas where the `Product` class is defined. Understanding the structure and existing methods of this class is crucial before making any modifications.\n   - `search_class(\"Product\")`\n\n2. **Search for pretty print method**: Since the issue is specifically related to pretty printing, locating the method(s) responsible for this functionality is necessary. It's likely that a method within the `Product` class or a related utility function is used for formatting the pretty print output.\n   - `search_method(\"pprint\")`\n   \n3. **Search the pretty print method in `Product` class**: Narrowing down the search specifically to methods within the `Product` class will provide a direct insight into how pretty printing for products is currently implemented.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"pprint\", \"Product\")`\n   \n4. **Search for code related to unicode handling**: Since the issue mentions differences in presentation with and without unicode, locating how unicode is currently handled will be beneficial. This can give insights into where adjustments need to be made for improving the presentation.\n   - `search_code(\"use_unicode\")`\n   \n5. **Searching for specifics in pretty print formatting**: To address the issue of reducing the fatness of the \u220f and removing the extra line, searching for specific code snippets related to these elements could be directly informative. For example, locating where the box drawing for pretty print starts and ends might reveal where to make adjustments.\n   - `search_code(\"\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\")`\n   - `search_code(\"oo\\n_____\")`\n\nThese calls will provide a comprehensive understanding of how pretty printing is currently implemented for the `Product` class and where modifications can be made to address the issues outlined."
