Creating a standalone `reproducer.py` for this specific issue — where Napoleon's `Attributes:` directive ignores the `:noindex:` option — involves directly simulating the scenario described, but considering the constraints, we'll simulate as closely as possible within a standalone Python script environment. This means we'll craft Sphinx documentation alongside our Python code to check if the issue is reproducible within this script's execution. We will check for the presence of attributes in the generated index file as a basis to determine if the `:noindex:` option is respected.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_environment():
    os.makedirs("src", exist_ok=True)
    with open("src/example_google.py", "w") as f:

    cmd = ["sphinx-build", "-b", "html", ".", "_build"]

        content = f.read()
        # Simple check to see if the attribute is listed
        if 'attr1' in content:
            raise AssertionError("Attribute 'attr1' is present in the HTML despite :noindex:. Issue is present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        setup_environment()
        build_docs()
        check_issue()
        print("Issue is fixed, exiting with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except AssertionError as error:
        print("Reproduced the issue:")
        print_stacktrace(error)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Failed to test due to an unexpected error:")
        print_stacktrace(e)

```

In this script:

1. **Setup Environment**: First, the script prepares a minimal Sphinx environment by creating a Python file with Google-style docstrings and a Sphinx `conf.py` tailored to use `sphinxcontrib.napoleon`.

2. **Build Docs**: It calls Sphinx to build the documentation. This step is where the script attempts to replicate the initial build issue.

3. **Check Issue**: Finally, it checks the generated HTML for evidence of the issue, specifically looking for an attribute that should have been excluded due to the `:noindex:` option.

This script, however, doesn't directly replicate the intricate details of a real Sphinx project environment and its interaction with Napoleon's Attribute directive. Instead, it simulates the conditions under which the issue could be identified within a constrained script execution scope.

Given the complexity and specificity of the issue, you might need to adjust the document and configuration examples according to your actual Sphinx setup and documentation structure for accurate reproduction and testing.
