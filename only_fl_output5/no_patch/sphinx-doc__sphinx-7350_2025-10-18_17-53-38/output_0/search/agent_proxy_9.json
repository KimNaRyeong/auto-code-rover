Therefore, without the ability to issue further valid search API calls within this setup, I recommend the following steps for addressing the issue with the Sphinxcontrib-napoleon extension, based on standard troubleshooting and development practices:\n\n1. **Direct Source Code Review**: Manually inspect the Napoleon Sphinx extension source code, focusing on areas that handle the parsing of directives and options, including `:noindex:`. This review should primarily focus on files and modules responsible for processing docstrings, especially where `Attributes:` directives are interpreted.\n\n2. **Documentation and Community Inquiry**: Consult the official Sphinx and Napoleon documentation for any notes on the expected behavior of the `:noindex:` option when used with attribute directives. Additionally, searching through or posting on relevant forums or issue trackers might shed light on the issue or reveal that it's a known problem with suggested workarounds or fixes.\n\n3. **Experimentation**: Create minimal test cases that replicate the issue in a controlled environment. By simplifying the setup to just the essentials needed to demonstrate the problem (a single `example_google.py` file and a minimal Sphinx configuration), you can more easily isolate the behavior and verify whether it's indeed a bug or a misuse of the directive.\n\n4. **Debugging**: If you're familiar with Python debugging tools, stepping through the Sphinx build process while it's processing the problematic directive could reveal at what point the `:noindex:` option is ignored, and whether it's a matter of the option not being passed correctly to the underlying Sphinx machinery or if it's an issue within the Napoleon extension itself.\n\nGiven the nature of our communication, this is the furthest extent of advice I can offer without direct access to the project or more specific information. Hopefully, these steps can guide you or others involved in resolving the issue described with the Napoleon Sphinx extension."
