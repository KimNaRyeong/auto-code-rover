        "intended_behavior": "This method should be able to correctly interpret and normalize values in scientific notation, such as 0E+1, into a Decimal format that can be validated against max_digits and decimal_places without error. Specifically, when a value like 0E+1 is encountered, it should treat it as equivalent to 0.0 or the appropriate normalized decimal value. The normalization process (Decimal('0E+1').normalize()) mentioned in the issue could be integrated here in a way that does not break existing functionality for other valid decimal inputs."

It needs to validate such values against the max_digits and decimal_places without raising a ValidationError for correctly formatted inputs. This would entail an adjustment to how the total digit count and decimal places are calculated to accommodate scientific notation where appropriate."
