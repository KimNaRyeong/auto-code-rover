Given the feedback on the previous attempt and the error due to Django's settings not being configured, it appears necessary to initialize Django settings manually within the script. The following revised version of `reproducer.py` will ensure Django is correctly set up to reproduce the issue independently:

```python
# reproducer.py

import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from decimal import Decimal
from django.core.validators import DecimalValidator
from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError

def setup_django_environment():
    settings.configure(
        INSTALLED_APPS=[
            'django.contrib.auth',
            'django.contrib.contenttypes',
            'django.contrib.admin',
        ],
        USE_I18N=True,
    )
    django.setup()

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    setup_django_environment()

    value = '0E+1'
    validator = DecimalValidator(max_digits=8, decimal_places=7)
    try:
        # Validate that 0E+1 is correctly treated as a valid Decimal value.
        validator(Decimal(value))
    except ValidationError as e:
        # The issue is present; print the stack trace and raise AssertionError
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError(f"Validation failed for {value}") from e

    print(f"{value} validated successfully.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

When you run `python3 reproducer.py`, it first sets up the minimal Django environment required by initializing settings that prevent Django from raising `ImproperlyConfigured` errors due to missing settings. It then proceeds to reproduce the issue as before.

- If the issue with validating `0E+1` as a decimal is present, the script will print a stack trace due to the `ValidationError` and then raise an `AssertionError`.
- If the issue is not present (meaning Django correctly validates `0E+1` as a decimal), the script will print a message indicating successful validation and exit with code 0, showing that the issue has been resolved or does not exist.
