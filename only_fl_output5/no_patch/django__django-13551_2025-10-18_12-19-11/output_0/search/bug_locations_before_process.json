        "intended_behavior": "This method currently generates a hash value used for password reset tokens. To resolve the issue, the method should be modified to include the user's email address as part of the hash value. This ensures that if the user's email address changes after a token has been issued but before it is used, the token would be invalidated, as the comparison of hash values in check_token would fail. The change should be made while ensuring that the method continues to function as expected for user models that do not utilize email addresses. This could involve a conditional inclusion of the email address in the hash component only if the user model has an email field that is not blank."
