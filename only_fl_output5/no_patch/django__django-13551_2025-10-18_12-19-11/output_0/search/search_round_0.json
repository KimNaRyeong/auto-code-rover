        "content": "To gather the required context for resolving the issue described, we will need to find out more about a few key elements mentioned in the issue. Specifically, we need to understand how password reset tokens are generated and possibly invalidated when a user changes their email address. The issue suggests modifying the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator._make_hash_value()` method and also hints at possibly extending or modifying behavior in `AbstractBaseUser` related to authentication and email handling. Let's strategize the API calls accordingly:\n\n1. **Look for the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class**: It's mentioned that we might need to add the user's email address into the method `_make_hash_value`. Locating this class and method will provide insight into how tokens are currently being generated.\n   \n2. **Search for the `_make_hash_value` method in `PasswordResetTokenGenerator`**: Since we need to add an email address into this method, understanding its current implementation is crucial.\n\n3. **Review the `AbstractBaseUser` class**: The issue mentions that not every user is forced to have an email as per `AbstractBaseUser`, suggesting that the solution might involve working with this class to ensure that the password reset logic takes email changes into account properly.\n\nBased on this strategy, here are the search API calls we should execute:\n\n- `search_class(\"PasswordResetTokenGenerator\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_make_hash_version\", \"PasswordResetTokenGenerator\")`\n- `search_class(\"AbstractBaseUser\")`\n\nThese calls will help us gather necessary code snippets and class/method definitions related to the issue."
