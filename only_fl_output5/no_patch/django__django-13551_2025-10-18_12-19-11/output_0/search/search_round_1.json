        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### PasswordResetTokenGenerator Class\n- **File Location:** `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py`\n- **What does this part of the code do?** This class is responsible for generating and checking password reset tokens. It contains methods for creating a token, checking a provided token's validity, and generating a hash value for the token using a user's state and a timestamp.\n- **Relationship with the bug:** The bug is directly related to this class since the issue revolves around the mechanism that should invalidate password reset tokens when a user's email changes. The `_make_hash_value` method within this class is a critical component, as it generates part of the token data. The suggestion from the issue involves modifying this method to include the user's email, making the token tied specifically to the email address at the time of token creation.\n- **Intended behavior:** The intended behavior after resolving the issue would be for the `_make_hash_value` method to incorporate the user's current email address into the hash. This change would mean that if the email address changes after the token is issued but before it is used, the token would no longer be valid because the hash value generated during the check (which would include the new email) would not match the hash value in the token generated before the email change.\n\n#### AbstractBaseUser Class\n- **File Location:** `django/contrib/auth/base_user.py`\n- **What does this part of the code do?** This class provides a core set of functionalities for custom user models in Django. It includes methods for managing passwords, session authentication hashes, and user identifications (e.g., username).\n- **Relationship with the bug:** The issue mentions that \"nothing forces a user to even have an email as per AbstractBaseUser.\" This class is crucial because any solution to the issue must consider that an email field might not be universally present or enforced in user models inheriting from `AbstractBaseUser`. Adjustments or checks made in the password reset flow need to be compatible with this flexibility.\n- **Intended behavior:** While this class does not directly handle the email change logic, it's important for ensuring that any solution respects the base user model's design. If we decide to factor the token generation method to consider email changes, this class or its derivatives might need to be adapted to ensure they can handle or trigger token invalidation appropriately\u2014keeping in mind that the presence of an email field cannot be assumed by default.\n\n#### Conclusion and Next Steps\n1. The next logical step is to examine the `_make_hash_value` method in `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` more closely to understand its current implementation. A typo was made in the previous request; we should have searched for `_make_hash_value` instead of `_make_hash_version`.\n\n2. It's also worth considering how user models deal with email changes and ensuring any changes made to the token generation or validation logic do not introduce breaking changes for user models not using emails.\n\nGiven these insights, the following corrected and additional API calls are necessary:\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_make_hash_value\", \"PasswordResetTokenGenerator\")`: To correct the earlier typo and examine the current implementation.\n- `search_code(\"email change\")`: It might be helpful to see how email changes are handled in the project, if at all, to understand any existing mechanisms that might relate to token invalidation."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

To resolve the issue, the method should be modified to include the user's email address as part of the hash value. This ensures that if the user's email address changes after a token has been issued but before it is used, the token would be invalidated, as the comparison of hash values in `check_token` would fail. The change should be made while ensuring that the method continues to function as expected for user models that do not utilize email addresses. This could involve a conditional inclusion of the email address in the hash component only if the user model has an email field that is not blank.\n   \n   **Additional Consideration:**\n   \n   Given the nature of the issue, a thorough review should be conducted to ensure that the modification:\n   - Does not unintentionally invalidate tokens for user models where an email field is not relevant or used.\n   - Is compatible with custom user models extending `AbstractBaseUser`, ensuring that the fix does not introduce breaking changes or assumptions about model fields that are not universally applicable."
