Debian Jessie ships with 3.8.7 and was EOL June 30, 2020.\nSQLite 3.9.0 was released in October 2015. SQLite version support seems like a similar situation as GEOS libraries which we generally support about 5 years after released.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue regarding dropping support for SQLite versions below 3.9.0, it is crucial to identify where the SQLite version check is performed and then update the version check logic accordingly. We should look for any database configuration, initialization code, or utility functions that specifically check the SQLite version. Given the nature of the project, it's reasonable to assume this logic could be encapsulated in methods related to database connection setup or version verification. Let's invoke the following search API calls for this purpose:\n\n1. `search_method(\"get_sqlite_version\")`: This call aims to find a method that might be responsible for retrieving the SQLite version, which is crucial for determining support logic.\n2. `search_code(\"SQLITE_VERSION\")`: This search is to find any direct references to a SQLite version identifier, which could be involved in version check logic.\n3. `search_code(\"minimum version\")`: This could help in finding comments or code that explicitly mentions a minimum required version for dependencies, which might include SQLite."
