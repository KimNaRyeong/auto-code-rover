The intended behavior here should involve ensuring that on initialization or connection to the SQLite database, the version of SQLite is checked to be 3.9.0 or higher. If not, an appropriate error message should be raised to inform the user that their SQLite version is no longer supported. This enforcement ensures the application leverages the required SQLite features efficiently and avoids runtime errors related to unsupported versions.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - File: `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py`\n  - Description: The schema file manages database schema operations, such as table creation, modification, and deletion. Given the introduction of features like indexes on expressions in SQLite 3.9.0, this file should be updated to explicitly use these features without fallbacks for older versions. The intended behavior is to remove checks or conditional logic that was in place to support SQLite versions lower than 3.9.0, and directly implement the schema manipulations assuming the availability of these features. This location is critical for leveraging database features that are conditional on the SQLite version.\n\nThese locations are key points where the SQLite version impacts the functionality and performance of Django projects, and updating them is vital to enforcing the new minimum version requirement. The emphasis should be on removing outdated compatibility layers and clearly documenting the new requirements within the codebase."
