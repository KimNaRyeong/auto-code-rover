Debian Jessie ships with 3.8.7 and was EOL June 30, 2020.\nSQLite 3.9.0 was released in October 2015. SQLite version support seems like a similar situation as GEOS libraries which we generally support about 5 years after released.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue regarding dropping support for SQLite versions below 3.9.0, it is crucial to identify where the SQLite version check is performed and then update the version check logic accordingly. We should look for any database configuration, initialization code, or utility functions that specifically check the SQLite version. Given the nature of the project, it's reasonable to assume this logic could be encapsulated in methods related to database connection setup or version verification. Let's invoke the following search API calls for this purpose:\n\n1. `search_method(\"get_sqlite_version\")`: This call aims to find a method that might be responsible for retrieving the SQLite version, which is crucial for determining support logic.\n2. `search_code(\"SQLITE_VERSION\")`: This search is to find any direct references to a SQLite version identifier, which could be involved in version check logic.\n3. `search_code(\"minimum version\")`: This could help in finding comments or code that explicitly mentions a minimum required version for dependencies, which might include SQLite."

This can include initialization of the SQLite database, settings, or configuration files where the database engine is defined, and any utility methods that might pertain to database compatibility checks. \n\nLet's consider alternative approaches:\n\n1. **Search for SQLite Initialization or Configuration**: SQLite database initialization or configuration might not explicitly call out \"get_sqlite_version\" or directly reference `SQLITE_VERSION`, but it could involve specific settings or configuration classes/methods.\n\n2. **Check for Compatibility or Requirement Checks**: There might be methods that check compatibility or prerequisites for the database at the beginning of a connection setup. These methods might not be named specifically after SQLite but could still apply version checks.\n\n3. **Database Connection and Setup**: By focusing on the broader scope of database connection and setup, we might uncover how and where the project interacts with SQLite, which could lead us to version management.\n\nLet's conduct the following searches based on these insights:\n\n1. `search_method(\"database_connection\")`: To find methods responsible for establishing database connections, which might include version checks.\n2. `search_method(\"check_database_compatibility\")`: To uncover any methods aimed specifically at checking database version compatibility.\n3. `search_code(\"sqlite3\")`: This search aims to find any references to SQLite in the codebase, which might not be version-specific but could lead us to relevant areas of the code.\n4. `search_code(\"database backend\")`: Because the issue involves supporting specific versions of a database, any code segment mentioning \"database backend\" could be crucial for identifying how the project handles different databases, including SQLite."
