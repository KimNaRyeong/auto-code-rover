        "intended_behavior": "The `Subquery` class should be enhanced to allow `OuterRef` references to be used within queries combined by `union` or the `|` operator. This enhancement must ensure that when these combined queries are used in a `Subquery` that is then used within an `annotate` call, the outer references are preserved and correctly interpreted by the ORM. This means adjusting the `as_sql` method or the logic that handles the references to recognize and properly handle these patterns as valid use cases."

        "intended_behavior": "The `as_sql` method of `ResolvedOuterRef` is responsible for raising the ValueError when it encounters what it deems an improper reference to an outer query. The intended behavior here should be to adjust the validation logic so that it correctly identifies valid use cases where `OuterRef` is used within combined queries (`union` or `|`). Importantly, this adjustment must not relax restrictions to the point where genuinely invalid references are allowed; it should only accommodate the valid scenarios described in the issue."
