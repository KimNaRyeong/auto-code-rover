        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, I would need to inspect the implementation of several components mentioned in the bug report. Specifically, we need to look at how `Subquery`, `OuterRef`, and query operations like `union` and the `|` operator are implemented or handled, as well as how `annotate` is functioning in this scenario.\n\nGiven this information, here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. Search for the class where `annotate` might be defined or handled, as this method is directly involved in the issue:\n```\nsearch_method(\"annotate\")\n```\n\n2. Search for any implementation or usage details of `Subquery` and `OuterRef` since these are directly mentioned as not working as expected:\n```\nsearch_class(\"Subquery\")\nsearch_class(\"OuterRef\")\n```\n\n3. Since the issue mentions a problem with using `union` and `|` operators in a specific context, information on these implementations or their handling might be crucial:\n```\nsearch_code(\"union\")\nsearch_code(\"|\")\n```\n\n4. The error mentions an inability to use the queryset due to a reference to an outer query. It's likely useful to investigate how querysets handle references to outer queries overall:\n```\nsearch_code(\"contains a reference to an outer query\")\n```\n\nThese calls aim to provide an overview of how the related methods and operators are implemented and how they interact within the project's larger framework, focusing specifically on their relation to `Subquery`, `OuterRef`, and queryset operations mentioned in the issue."
