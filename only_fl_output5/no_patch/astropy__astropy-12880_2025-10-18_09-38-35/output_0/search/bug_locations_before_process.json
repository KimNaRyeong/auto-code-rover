        "intended_behavior": "The get_cols method currently rejects datetime64 datatypes due to strict validation against the ECSV_DATATYPES list. To resolve the issue: - This method should be adjusted to either include datetime64 in the ECSV_DATATYPES list or implement a special case handling for datetime64 to ensure backward compatibility with ECSV files created with older versions of Astropy. The exact mechanism might involve:   - Directly adding datetime64 (and potentially other related types for future-proofing) to the ECSV_DATATYPES tuple.   - Adding a conditional check within the get_cols method to accept datetime64 datatypes explicitly, perhaps with additional logic to handle any special cases or conversions required for this datatype. - This adjustment should ensure that the rest of the ECSV handling logic (including serialization, deserialization, and datatype conversion) remains functional and that this change does not introduce regressions for other datatypes. - It's crucial to maintain the existing functionality for all currently supported datatypes, ensuring that this extension only enhances compatibility without affecting the robustness and reliability of ECSV reading and writing operations. These changes aim to preserve the existing functionality while extending support to include datetime64 datatype columns, directly addressing the issue without negatively impacting the utility or performance of the system for current users."
