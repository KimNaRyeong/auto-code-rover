Given that the initial attempt did not reproduce the issue due to an unrelated error (with `np.unicode_` in numpy 2.0), I understand the ask is to focus on addressing the original problem statement regarding xarray's behavior with dimensions that do not exist during weighted operations. Let's attempt a corrected version of the `reproducer.py` that encapsulates the intended check while ensuring compatibility and adhering to the provided guidelines for error handling and reporting. 

Please note, the core of this script aims to reproduce the situation where a weighted operation in xarray does not raise an error when provided with a non-existent dimension, contrary to expectations based on similar "unweighted" operations. Adjustments might be necessary depending on changes in the xarray or related libraries' behaviors beyond the knowledge cutoff date.

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_weighted_operation_with_nonexistent_dim():
    try:
        ds = xr.tutorial.open_dataset("air_temperature")
        # Trigger a weighted operation using a non-existent dimension
        weighted = ds.weighted(xr.ones_like(ds["air"]))
        result = weighted.mean("nonexistent_dimension")
        # If the operation does not raise an error, we manually raise an AssertionError
        raise AssertionError("Weighted operation did not raise an error with a non-existent dimension.")
    except KeyError as expected:
        # If a KeyError is raised, it means the function behaved as expected
        print("Function correctly raised a KeyError with a non-existent dimension.")
    except Exception as e:
        # This block catches any other exceptions, indicating an unexpected behavior
        print("An unexpected exception was raised:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

try:
    test_weighted_operation_with_nonexistent_dim()
except AssertionError as error:
    print_stacktrace(error)
    exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero code indicating the presence of the issue
else:
    print("No AssertionError raised, issue appears resolved.")
    exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating the absence of the issue
```

This script is designed to be executed in an environment where the xarray library and its dependencies are properly installed and updated to a state reflecting the behavior as of the last known update. Keep in mind, behaviors could have evolved if the xarray library has addressed this inconsistency in versions released after the knowledge cutoff in December 2023.
