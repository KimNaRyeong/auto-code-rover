            "content": "Given the issue description, it seems we need to look into how weighted operations, such as `weighted().mean()`, are handled within the `xarray` library and what happens when a non-existent dimension is passed. The example provided in the issue demonstrates a use case where a dimension named \"dummy\" is passed to the `mean()` method on a weighted dataset and its behavior is in question.\n\nTo gather enough context to address this issue, I suggest the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `weighted` method to understand how it is implemented and where it exists:\n   - `search_method(\"weighted\")`\n\n2. Since the example specifies a `.mean()` operation on the `weighted` result, look for the implementation of `mean` within the context of weighted operations:\n   - `search_method(\"mean\")`\n\n3. The expectation mentioned involves error handling when dimensions don't exist. It might be beneficial to search for any existing error handling or checks related to dimensions within the codebase. This is a bit broad, so a specific method or class isn't targeted here, but understanding how dimension checks are generally handled could be useful:\n   - `search_code(\"check for dimension\")`\n\nThese calls aim to provide a comprehensive view of how weighted operations are handled, especially regarding dimension existence checks, within the `xarray` library's codebase."
