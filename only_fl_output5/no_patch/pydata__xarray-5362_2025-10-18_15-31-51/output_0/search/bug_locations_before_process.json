        "intended_behavior": "The method `mean` within this file should include a check to verify if the specified dimension (or dimensions) exists within the data. If a non-existent dimension is provided, the method should raise a ValueError with a clear message indicating the invalid dimension. This enhancement would align the behavior of weighted mean operations with that of unweighted operations, enhancing consistency and predictability for the library users. The existing functionality, where valid dimensions are processed to calculate the mean, should be preserved, ensuring that this change only affects cases where invalid dimensions are specified."
