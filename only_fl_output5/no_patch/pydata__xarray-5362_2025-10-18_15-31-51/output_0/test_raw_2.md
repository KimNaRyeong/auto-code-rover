Certainly! Based on the initial issue described, I'll structure a standalone Python script, `reproducer.py`, focused on reproducing the specific behavior of xarray's weighted operation with nonexistent dimensions. The script will attempt to catch if the operation erroneously proceeds without raising an error when it should. 

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def perform_weighted_operation_with_nonexistent_dimension():
    ds = xr.tutorial.open_dataset("air_temperature")
    try:
        # Attempt to perform a weighted operation using a nonexistent dimension
        ds.weighted(xr.ones_like(ds["air"])).mean("nonexistent_dimension")
        # If no error is raised, we assert an issue exists
        raise AssertionError("No error raised for weighted operation with nonexistent dimension")
    except AssertionError as e:
        # Catching manually raised AssertionError to handle it separately
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        # If any other exception is caught, we assume the function behaved correctly by not allowing the operation
        print("An error was correctly raised for weighted operation with a nonexistent dimension:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return  # Exit the function normally, indicating expected behavior
    # If we reach this point without an exception, it means the operation failed to raise an error as expected

try:
    perform_weighted_operation_with_nonexistent_dimension()
except AssertionError as e:
    # Output the stack trace for the AssertionError indicating the presence of the issue
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero exit code indicating failure/the presence of the issue
else:
    print("No issue detected: the operation correctly raised an error with a nonexistent dimension.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with a zero exit code indicating success/no issue detected
```

This script attempts to perform a weighted operation using `xarray` on a dataset where the given dimension does not exist. It expects an error to be raised, suggestive of proper exception handling by the xarray library for this case. If the operation somehow succeeds without raising an error or the expected error type is not caught, the script will raise an `AssertionError`, indicating this mismatch between expected and actual behavior. If an error is correctly raised, it will catch that as an indication of correct behavior and terminate normally with a success status.
