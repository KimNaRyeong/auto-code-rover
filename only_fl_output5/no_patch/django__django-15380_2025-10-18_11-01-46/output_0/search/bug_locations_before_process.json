        "intended_behavior": "This method should robustly handle the renaming of both models and fields, especially when these occur in a single migration operation. The specific issue arises due to a `KeyError` when accessing `self.to_state.models` with an old model name, which suggests that the method lacks proper checks or updates to model names after they have been renamed. To resolve the issue, the method must ensure that any references to old model names are updated to their new names before attempting to access them in `self.to_state.models`. This update process should occur before the method attempts to access the model state by its name, ensuring that renames are accounted for. Additionally, it should gracefully handle cases where the model or field does not exist due to renaming, either by verifying the existence before access or by catching and handling `KeyError` exceptions appropriately. This adaptation will preserve the existing functionality of detecting and applying renamed fields and models correctly, avoiding runtime errors during migrations."
