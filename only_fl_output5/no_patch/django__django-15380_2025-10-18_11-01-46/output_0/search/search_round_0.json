        "content": "To gather enough context for resolving the issue related to the migration autodetector crashing when renaming a model and field, we'll need to explore several components of the Django codebase focusing on the management commands, migration framework, and particularly the autodetector system.\n\nBased on the traceback and the description of the issue, the following API calls will be necessary:\n\n1. We'll start by inspecting the implementation of the `makemigrations` command to understand how it invokes the migration autodetector.\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_file(\"handle\", \"/django/django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the error trace points to the `changes` method in the autodetector and its invocation, we should look into the autodetector's `changes` method to understand its inputs, outputs, and overall functionality.\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"changes\", \"MigrationAutodetector\")\n   ```\n\n3. The final failure occurs in the `generate_renamed_fields` method, indicating an issue with handling renamed fields. To solve the problem, we need a deeper understanding of this method, making it essential to review its code.\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"generate_renamed_fields\", \"MigrationAutodetector\")\n   ```\n\n4. The issue mentions a KeyError in accessing `self.to_state.models`. To understand how `self.to_state.models` is structured and utilized, a direct lookup around the area where `old_model_name` is used within `generate_renamed_fields` is necessary.\n   ```python\n   search_code_in_file(\"self.to_state.models[\", \"/django/django/db/migrations/autodetector.py\")\n   ```\n\n5. Lastly, given the issue indicates a regression in a specific commit (`aa4acc164d1247c0de515c959f7b09648b57dc42`), understanding changes made in that commit could provide insights. Directly searching for the commit content is not possible through these APIs, but understanding the mentioned methods and their context will indirectly reveal the changes impact.\n\nBy analyzing the output from these API calls, we can piece together the detailed behavior of the autodetector during the rename operations and identify the root cause of the issue. This strategy focuses on understanding both the specific method reported in the issue (`generate_renamed_fields`) and the broader system in which it operates (migration autodetection, state modeling)."
