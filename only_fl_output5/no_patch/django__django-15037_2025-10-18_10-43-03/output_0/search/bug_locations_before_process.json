        "intended_behavior": "The code within this file and class, particularly in the method(s) processing foreign key relationships, needs to be enhanced to accurately detect and represent foreign keys that reference unique fields other than the primary key of another table. When inspectdb encounters a foreign key constraint, it should examine if the reference is to a primary key or to a unique field within the referenced table. If the foreign key references a unique field that is not the primary key, the generated Django model field should correctly specify this relationship, possibly through a correctly configured to_field argument in the ForeignKey field definition. This modification must preserve inspectdb's existing functionality for all other types of field and constraint interpretations, ensuring that only the handling of foreign keys to unique fields is adjusted without negatively impacting the interpretation of foreign keys to primary keys or any other database schema elements."
