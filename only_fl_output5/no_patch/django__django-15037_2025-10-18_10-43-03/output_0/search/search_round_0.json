        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how the project's code handles the generation of models from database schemas, specifically in relation to foreign keys that reference specific fields other than the primary key. The problem seems related to how Django's `inspectdb` command interprets foreign keys, which implies looking into the Django core code that implements `inspectdb`. Here's how we'll proceed to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. **Search for the `inspectdb` Command Implementation**: Since `inspectdb` is a management command in Django, we should start by looking for the class implementing this command. It's likely to be a class named something like `Command` within a file related to `inspectdb`.\n\n2. **Identify How Foreign Keys are Handled**: The next step is to understand how `inspectdb` processes foreign keys. This involves identifying methods within the `Command` class or related utilities that parse and generate model fields from foreign key constraints.\n\nBased on this approach, here are the API calls we'll use:\n\n- `search_method(\"inspectdb\")`: To find references to the `inspectdb` method or command across the project, which could lead us to the file and class handling its logic.\n- `search_code(\"class Command\"):`: This code snippet search might help us identify the file where the `inspectdb` command class is defined, assuming it follows Django's convention for management commands."
