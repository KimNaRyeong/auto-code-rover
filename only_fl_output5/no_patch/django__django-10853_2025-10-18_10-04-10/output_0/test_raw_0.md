This script attempts to use a window function in SQLite within a `try-except` block to catch the `sqlite3.OperationalError`. It assumes the presence of the issue if an `OperationalError` occurs, likely due to trying to use window functions in a version of SQLite that doesn't support them (pre-3.25.0). 

If the operation is successful, no exceptions will be raised, indicating the issue is fixed, as the SQLite version supports window functions.

The script will exit with code 0, suggesting no problem if the window functions are supported, or if another unrelated error occurs, it will print that unexpected error and exit with code 1. If the `AssertionError` is raised, it signifies that the window functions feature issue is present, and the script will exit with code 1 as well.
