        "content": "Here is an issue:\n\nSQLite (pre 3.25.0) does not support window functions, raises OperationalError\nDescription\n\t\nWindow functions are supported in SQLite 3.25.0 and newer, but Python 3.6.7 and 3.7.1 only ships with SQLite 3.21.0. Window function syntax is invalid for older versions.\nAs per the title, window functions therefore aren't supported, but Django doesn't check the SQLite version or availability of window functions. Instead, when the generated SQL is executed, the sqlite3 Python library raises the SQLite syntax error as sqlite3.OperationalError, which in turn is reraised as django.db.utils.OperationalError.\nI believe this is not intended behaviour, as it is incredibly confusing, and not documented. Typically, if a database feature is not supported, Django will explicitly raise an error when attempting it, rather than allowing the SQL execution to fail. It is also normally documented.\nThe following code raises an exception (it should work for any model):\nfrom django.db.models import F, Window\nfrom django.db.models.functions.window import RowNumber\n# import the model\nMyModel.objects.annotate(rn=Window(expression=RowNumber(), order_by=[F('pk')]))\nBasic Python code that will also raise sqlite3.OperationalError:\nimport sqlite3\nconn = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")\nc = conn.cursor()\nc.execute(\"CREATE TABLE t0(x INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, y TEXT)\")\nc.execute(\"INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (1, 'aaa'), (2, 'ccc'), (3, 'bbb')\")\nc.execute(\"SELECT x, y, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY y) AS row_number FROM t0 ORDER BY x\")\nTested on master branch (commit c5568340a525ab9c6898ed02c257394cc47285d7) with Python 3.6.6 64-bit (Windows 10 x64). This likely also affects 2.0 and 2.1 branches.\n"

If the version is lower than 3.25.0, it raises an `AssertionError` immediately. Otherwise, it proceeds to attempt using the window function, which should only fail if an unexpected issue occurs or if there was an error in the version check logic."
