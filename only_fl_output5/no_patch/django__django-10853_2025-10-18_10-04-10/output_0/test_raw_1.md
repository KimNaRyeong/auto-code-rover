Given the requirements for `reproducer.py` and including the function to print the stack trace clearly, here is an adjusted version that takes into account the need for the script to check SQLite version compatibility with window functions, specifically handling the scenario where the SQLite version pre-3.25.0 does not support window functions. This script will raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present due to an older version of SQLite being used, which does not support window functions:

```python
# reproducer.py
import sqlite3
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_sqlite_window_functions_support():
    conn = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
    c = conn.cursor()
    # Check SQLite version
    sqlite_version = sqlite3.sqlite_version_info
    if sqlite_version < (3, 25, 0):
        print(f"SQLite version {sqlite_version[0]}.{sqlite_version[1]}.{sqlite_version[2]} detected. This version does not support window functions.")
        raise AssertionError("SQLite version does not support window functions")
    
    try:
        c.execute("CREATE TABLE t0(x INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, y TEXT)")
        c.execute("INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (1, 'aaa'), (2, 'ccc'), (3, 'bbb')")
        # This query uses window functions, which are not supported in SQLite versions before 3.25.0
        c.execute("SELECT x, y, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY y) AS row_number FROM t0 ORDER BY x")
    except sqlite3.OperationalError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("SQLite version does not support window functions") from e
    finally:
        conn.close()

def main():
    try:
        test_sqlite_window_functions_support()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Issue present:", e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Unexpected error occurred.", e)
        sys.exit(1)
    print("No issue detected. SQLite window functions are supported.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This revised script now first checks if the SQLite version it's connected to supports window functions by comparing the version number before attempting to use them. If the version is lower than 3.25.0, it raises an `AssertionError` immediately. Otherwise, it proceeds to attempt using the window function, which should only fail if an unexpected issue occurs or if there was an error in the version check logic.
