        "content": "<issue>SQLite (pre 3.25.0) does not support window functions, raises OperationalError\nDescription\nWindow functions are supported in SQLite 3.25.0 and newer, but Python 3.6.7 and 3.7.1 only ships with SQLite 3.21.0. Window function syntax is invalid for older versions.\nAs per the title, window functions therefore aren't supported, but Django doesn't check the SQLite version or availability of window functions. Instead, when the generated SQL is executed, the sqlite3 Python library raises the SQLite syntax error as sqlite3.OperationalError, which in turn is reraised as django.db.utils.OperationalError.\nI believe this is not intended behaviour, as it is incredibly confusing, and not documented. Typically, if a database feature is not supported, Django will explicitly raise an error when attempting it, rather than allowing the SQL execution to fail. It is also normally documented.\nThe following code raises an exception (it should work for any model):\nfrom django.db.models import F, Window\nfrom django.db.models.functions.window import RowNumber\n# import the model\nMyModel.objects.annotate(rn=Window(expression=RowNumber(), order_by=[F('pk')]))\nBasic Python code that will also raise sqlite3.OperationalError:\nimport sqlite3\nconn = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")\nc = conn.cursor()\nc.execute(\"CREATE TABLE t0(x INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, y TEXT)\")\nc.execute(\"INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (1, 'aaa'), (2, 'ccc'), (3, 'bbb')\")\nc.execute(\"SELECT x, y, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY y) AS row_number FROM t0 ORDER BY x\")\nTested on master branch (commit c5568340a525ab9c6898ed02c257394cc47285d7) with Python 3.6.6 64-bit (Windows 10 x64). This likely also affects 2.0 and 2.1 branches.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the context gathered from the API calls provides insights into how Django represents and processes annotations and window functions within queries, as well as error handling mechanisms. Here's an assessment based on the questions provided:\n\n### Analysis of the `DatabaseErrorWrapper` Class (`django/db/utils.py`)\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `DatabaseErrorWrapper` class in `django/db/utils.py` is designed to act as a context manager or a wrapper around database operations. It likely facilitates capturing database errors (including `OperationalError`) and re-raising them, possibly after some kind of processing or logging. The existence of `__enter__`, `__exit__`, and `__call__` methods suggests it's used to wrap database operations in a `with` statement to handle exceptions gracefully.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug:**\n   - Since the bug involves an `OperationalError` being raised due to an unsupported feature in SQLite, `DatabaseErrorWrapper` could be the place where these errors are captured when executing queries that include window functions on unsupported SQLite versions. However, the absence of a direct `execute` method in the `DatabaseErrorWrapper` suggests that the actual execution handling and error capturing might be done elsewhere, with `DatabaseErrorWrapper` perhaps being used to manage these errors.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n   - Ideally, the intended behavior would involve detecting unsupported SQL features (like window functions in SQLite versions before 3.25.0) before attempting execution and either preventing the query with a clear, user-friendly error or providing a fallback mechanism. The `DatabaseErrorWrapper` could facilitate better error messaging around unsupported features.\n\n### Analysis of the `Window` Class (`django/db/models/expressions.py`)\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `Window` class represents the SQL window functions in Django ORM. It allows specifying window functions in queries by setting expressions, partitions, orders, and frames for the window operation. The `as_sql` method generates the SQL representation of the window function for execution by the database backend.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug:**\n   - Since the issue pertains to window functions not being supported by the SQLite version shipped with certain Python versions, this class is central to the problem. The `as_sql` method would generate SQL that is not compatible with SQLite versions before 3.25.0, leading to the operational error.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n   - The class should probably include a mechanism to check if the current database backend supports the requested window function and raise a clear and informative error before generating and attempting to execute the SQL. This could involve querying the database version or capabilities at runtime before the `as_sql` method returns the generated SQL.\n\n### Analysis of the `annotate` Method (`django/db/models/query.py`)\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `annotate` method is used to attach additional information to objects returned by a query. This can include aggregations, window functions, or other computed data. It modifies the query set to include these annotations in the returned results.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug:**\n   - Annotations can include window functions, which are central to the reported issue. When a developer uses `annotate` with a `Window` function in an environment with an unsupported SQLite version, it results in an operational error upon execution.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:**\n   - The method should validate or check if the used expressions (including window functions) are supported by the database backend in use. If a feature is unsupported, like window functions on older SQLite versions, it should prevent the query execution and raise a descriptive error early.\n\nGiven this analysis, additional steps could involve inspecting the implementation of database feature checks, specifically how Django determines the capabilities of the database engine in use, and looking more closely at where SQL execution happens and errors are first caught. Since the direct search for `sqlite3.OperationalError` didn't yield results, exploring error handling in the connection or query execution path more broadly may be necessary. Consider searching for how Django checks the SQLite version or captures errors during query execution:\n\n- `search_method(\"check_sqlite_version\")`\n- `search_code(\"OperationalError\")` (to potentially catch a broader net of where `sqlite3.OperationalError` might be referenced or handled)."

Before generating the SQL, it should verify if the version supports window functions (SQLite 3.25.0 or higher). If the version does not support window functions, the method should raise a clear, descriptive error indicating that the operation cannot be performed due to the lack of support in the SQLite version being used. This error should suggest the user upgrade their SQLite version if possible. This check can preserve existing functionality by only altering behavior in cases where the operation would lead to an SQL syntax error due to version incompatibilities.\n\n### Bug Location 2:\n**File:** `django/db/models/query.py`  \n**Class:** `QuerySet`  \n**Method:** `annotate`  \n\n**Intended Behavior:**  \nIn the `annotate` method, when processing annotations that involve window functions, add a preliminary check to confirm if the underlying database engine supports those window functions. This could involve extending the `_validate_values_are_expressions` method (or where appropriate within this workflow) to include checks for database feature support, particularly focusing on window functions for SQLite. In case the database does not support the feature, a descriptive error should be raised early in the process, advising on the lack of support and possible resolutions (e.g., database upgrade). This approach maintains the method's core functionality while improving error handling and messaging for unsupported features.\n\nBy implementing these intended behaviors, Django can provide more informative errors to developers attempting to use window functions with versions of SQLite that do not support them, preventing the confusion currently caused by generic `OperationalError`s."
