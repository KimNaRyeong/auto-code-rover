        "intended_behavior": "The `as_sql` method inside the `Window` class should include a check for the SQLite version if the database connection is to SQLite. Before generating the SQL, it should verify if the version supports window functions (SQLite 3.25.0 or higher). If the version does not support window functions, the method should raise a clear, descriptive error indicating that the operation cannot be performed due to the lack of support in the SQLite version being used. This error should suggest the user upgrade their SQLite version if possible. This check can preserve existing functionality by only altering behavior in cases where the operation would lead to an SQL syntax error due to version incompatibilities."

        "method": "annotate",
        "intended_behavior": "In the `annotate` method, when processing annotations that involve window functions, add a preliminary check to confirm if the underlying database engine supports those window functions. This could involve extending the `_validate_values_are_expressions` method (or where appropriate within this workflow) to include checks for database feature support, particularly focusing on window functions for SQLite. In case the database does not support the feature, a descriptive error should be raised early in the process, advising on the lack of support and possible resolutions (e.g., database upgrade). This approach maintains the method's core functionality while improving error handling and messaging for unsupported features."
