        "content": "<issue>SQLite (pre 3.25.0) does not support window functions, raises OperationalError\nDescription\nWindow functions are supported in SQLite 3.25.0 and newer, but Python 3.6.7 and 3.7.1 only ships with SQLite 3.21.0. Window function syntax is invalid for older versions.\nAs per the title, window functions therefore aren't supported, but Django doesn't check the SQLite version or availability of window functions. Instead, when the generated SQL is executed, the sqlite3 Python library raises the SQLite syntax error as sqlite3.OperationalError, which in turn is reraised as django.db.utils.OperationalError.\nI believe this is not intended behaviour, as it is incredibly confusing, and not documented. Typically, if a database feature is not supported, Django will explicitly raise an error when attempting it, rather than allowing the SQL execution to fail. It is also normally documented.\nThe following code raises an exception (it should work for any model):\nfrom django.db.models import F, Window\nfrom django.db.models.functions.window import RowNumber\n# import the model\nMyModel.objects.annotate(rn=Window(expression=RowNumber(), order_by=[F('pk')]))\nBasic Python code that will also raise sqlite3.OperationalError:\nimport sqlite3\nconn = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")\nc = conn.cursor()\nc.execute(\"CREATE TABLE t0(x INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, y TEXT)\")\nc.execute(\"INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (1, 'aaa'), (2, 'ccc'), (3, 'bbb')\")\nc.execute(\"SELECT x, y, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY y) AS row_number FROM t0 ORDER BY x\")\nTested on master branch (commit c5568340a525ab9c6898ed02c257394cc47285d7) with Python 3.6.6 64-bit (Windows 10 x64). This likely also affects 2.0 and 2.1 branches.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about how Django interacts with SQLite and handles SQL executions. The issue description suggests a few starting points:\n- The interaction with SQLite, likely through Django's ORM.\n- How Django checks for database feature support.\n- Where in the Django codebase OperationalErrors are caught and re-raised.\n\nGiven these hints, the following API calls will help gather the necessary context:\n\n1. To understand how Django interacts with SQLite and potentially checks for feature support like window functions:\n   - `search_method(\"create_connection\")`\n   - `search_method(\"features\")`\n\n2. To find where OperationalErrors might be caught and re-raised, which could be in Django's database backend or ORM layer:\n   - `search_class(\"DatabaseErrorWrapper\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"execute\", \"DatabaseErrorWrapper\")`\n\n3. To look into how Django's ORM handles window functions specifically, since the issue arises when using window functions with a SQLite backend that doesn't support them:\n   - `search_class(\"Window\")`\n   - `search_method(\"annotate\")`\n\n4. Finally, to inspect the error handling around SQL execution to pinpoint where adjustments could be made to raise a more informative error or check SQLite version before executing window functions:\n   - `search_code(\"sqlite3.OperationalError\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a clear view of the relevant sections of Django's codebase to address the reported issue."
