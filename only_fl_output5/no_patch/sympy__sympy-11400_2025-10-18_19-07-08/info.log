285 
286     Parameters
287     ==========
288 
289     expr : Expr
290         A sympy expression to be converted.
291     assign_to : optional
292         When given, the argument is used as the name of the variable to which
293         the expression is assigned. Can be a string, ``Symbol``,
294         ``MatrixSymbol``, or ``Indexed`` type. This is helpful in case of
295         line-wrapping, or for expressions that generate multi-line statements.
296     precision : integer, optional
297         The precision for numbers such as pi [default=15].
298     user_functions : dict, optional
299         A dictionary where the keys are string representations of either
300         ``FunctionClass`` or ``UndefinedFunction`` instances and the values
301         are their desired C string representations. Alternatively, the
302         dictionary value can be a list of tuples i.e. [(argument_test,
303         cfunction_string)].  See below for examples.
304     dereference : iterable, optional
305         An iterable of symbols that should be dereferenced in the printed code
306         expression. These would be values passed by address to the function.
307         For example, if ``dereference=[a]``, the resulting code would print
308         ``(*a)`` instead of ``a``.
309     human : bool, optional
310         If True, the result is a single string that may contain some constant
311         declarations for the number symbols. If False, the same information is
312         returned in a tuple of (symbols_to_declare, not_supported_functions,
313         code_text). [default=True].
314     contract: bool, optional
315         If True, ``Indexed`` instances are assumed to obey tensor contraction
316         rules and the corresponding nested loops over indices are generated.
317         Setting contract=False will not generate loops, instead the user is
318         responsible to provide values for the indices in the code.
319         [default=True].
320 
321     Examples
322     ========
323 
324     >>> from sympy import ccode, symbols, Rational, sin, ceiling, Abs, Function
325     >>> x, tau = symbols("x, tau")
326     >>> ccode((2*tau)**Rational(7, 2))
327     '8*sqrt(2)*pow(tau, 7.0L/2.0L)'
328     >>> ccode(sin(x), assign_to="s")
329     's = sin(x);'
330 
331     Simple custom printing can be defined for certain types by passing a
332     dictionary of {"type" : "function"} to the ``user_functions`` kwarg.
333     Alternatively, the dictionary value can be a list of tuples i.e.
334     [(argument_test, cfunction_string)].
335 
336     >>> custom_functions = {
337     ...   "ceiling": "CEIL",
338     ...   "Abs": [(lambda x: not x.is_integer, "fabs"),
339     ...           (lambda x: x.is_integer, "ABS")],
340     ...   "func": "f"
341     ... }
342     >>> func = Function('func')
343     >>> ccode(func(Abs(x) + ceiling(x)), user_functions=custom_functions)
344     'f(fabs(x) + CEIL(x))'
345 
346     ``Piecewise`` expressions are converted into conditionals. If an
347     ``assign_to`` variable is provided an if statement is created, otherwise
348     the ternary operator is used. Note that if the ``Piecewise`` lacks a
349     default term, represented by ``(expr, True)`` then an error will be thrown.
350     This is to prevent generating an expression that may not evaluate to
351     anything.
352 
353     >>> from sympy import Piecewise
354     >>> expr = Piecewise((x + 1, x > 0), (x, True))
355     >>> print(ccode(expr, tau))
356     if (x > 0) {
357     tau = x + 1;
358     }
359     else {
360     tau = x;
361     }
362 
363     Support for loops is provided through ``Indexed`` types. With
364     ``contract=True`` these expressions will be turned into loops, whereas
365     ``contract=False`` will just print the assignment expression that should be
366     looped over:
367 
368     >>> from sympy import Eq, IndexedBase, Idx
369     >>> len_y = 5
370     >>> y = IndexedBase('y', shape=(len_y,))
371     >>> t = IndexedBase('t', shape=(len_y,))
372     >>> Dy = IndexedBase('Dy', shape=(len_y-1,))
373     >>> i = Idx('i', len_y-1)
374     >>> e=Eq(Dy[i], (y[i+1]-y[i])/(t[i+1]-t[i]))
375     >>> ccode(e.rhs, assign_to=e.lhs, contract=False)
376     'Dy[i] = (y[i + 1] - y[i])/(t[i + 1] - t[i]);'
377 
378     Matrices are also supported, but a ``MatrixSymbol`` of the same dimensions
379     must be provided to ``assign_to``. Note that any expression that can be
380     generated normally can also exist inside a Matrix:
381 
382     >>> from sympy import Matrix, MatrixSymbol
383     >>> mat = Matrix([x**2, Piecewise((x + 1, x > 0), (x, True)), sin(x)])
384     >>> A = MatrixSymbol('A', 3, 1)
385     >>> print(ccode(mat, A))
386     A[0] = pow(x, 2);
387     if (x > 0) {
388        A[1] = x + 1;
389     }
390     else {
391        A[1] = x;
392     }
393     A[2] = sin(x);
