Search for the class or method that handles generating C code, as the issue specifically mentions `ccode`. This is likely where we need to implement support for `sinc`.\n2. Given the suggestion in the issue, it's likely that we'll need to find where `Piecewise` expressions are handled in C code generation to model after it for `sinc`.\n\nHere are the specific API calls that will gather the necessary context:\n\n- `search_method(\"ccode\")`: This will help us find the method that is used to generate C code, which is directly related to the issue.\n- `search_class(\"Piecewise\")`: Since the issue suggests using a `Piecewise` function as a workaround, finding this class may give us clues on how to implement the fix.\n- `search_code(\"Ne(theta, 0)) ? (\\\\n   sin(theta)/theta\\\\n)\\\\n: (\\\\n   1\\\\n)\")`: This specific code snippet from the workaround might help us locate how `Piecewise` expressions are converted into C code, which could be similar to how we'd implement `sinc`."
