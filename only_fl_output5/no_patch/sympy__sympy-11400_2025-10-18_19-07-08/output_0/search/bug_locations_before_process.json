        "intended_behavior": "The `ccode` function needs to be extended to handle `sinc(x)` expressions specifically. Since `sinc` is not directly supported in C, the intended behavior should involve translating `sinc(x)` to a piecewise expression equivalent, which the `ccode` function can already handle efficiently. The translation should embody the mathematical definition of `sinc(x)`, typically `sin(x)/x` for `x != 0` and `1` for `x = 0`. This behavior should be integrated into the `ccode` method, ensuring that the `sinc(x)` function is interpreted correctly and translated into a C-compatible piecewise statement. This interpretation should occur before the function attempts any direct translation of `sinc`, ideally via a pre-processing step within `ccode` that identifies `sinc` expressions and converts them to their piecewise equivalent. This modification must preserve the existing functionality of `ccode`, meaning all other expressions it currently handles should remain unaffected by this addition. The implementation can potentially leverage existing mechanisms within `ccode` that deal with function substitution or piecewise expressions to integrate this feature seamlessly. Additionally, to support this fix robustly, documentation within `ccode` should be updated to include `sinc(x)` in the list of supported expressions, possibly with a brief note on its internal translation to a piecewise construct for clarity to future maintainers and users."
