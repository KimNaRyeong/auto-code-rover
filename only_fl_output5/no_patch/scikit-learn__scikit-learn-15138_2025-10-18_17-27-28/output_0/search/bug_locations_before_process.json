        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `fit` method of the `StackingClassifier` class needs to be modified or extended to support an additional option that allows including the original dataset features (`X`) along with the predictions of the base estimators when training the final estimator. Specifically, this involves: Introducing a new parameter, possibly named `use_features_in_secondary`, which when set to `True`, will include the original features `X` along with the base estimators' predictions as input to the final estimator during the fit process. The existing functionality, where the final estimator is trained solely on the predictions of the base estimators, must be preserved when `use_features_in_secondary` is `False`. This modification should conditionally concatenate the original features `X` to the output of the base estimators' predictions before fitting the final estimator, ensuring that when `use_features_in_secondary=True`, both the predictions and original features are used for the final training step. Care must be taken to handle any dimensionality and data type issues arising from concatenating original features with predictions, especially considering compatibility with different types of final estimators and ensuring that feature scaling or normalization steps applied to `X` during initial training are consistently applied here as well. Documentation within the method should be updated to describe the new parameter and its impact on the training process, emphasizing when and why it might be beneficial to use this option. It is essential to ensure that any new code paths introduced by this change do not affect the existing default behavior of the `StackingClassifier` when `use_features_in_secondary` is not enabled, preserving backward compatibility."
