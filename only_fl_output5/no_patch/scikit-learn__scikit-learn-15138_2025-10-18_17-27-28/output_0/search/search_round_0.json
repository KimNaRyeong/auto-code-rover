        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we first need to identify the class and methods within the scikit-learn library that handle stacking classifiers. Given the issue description, we can infer that we're dealing with stacking classifiers, specifically with the training of the final estimator and possibly how it integrates with the original dataset. The StackingClassifier or an equivalent might be the relevant class, and methods inside might deal with fitting the model and managing the training data for the final estimator.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls to gather necessary code context:\n\n1. **Search for the class related to stacking:** We need to find the specific class in scikit-learn that handles stacking of classifiers. The appropriate class name is likely to be `StackingClassifier`, based on common naming conventions in scikit-learn for ensemble methods.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"StackingClassifier\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the method that fits the model:** Within the `StackingClassifier` class, there should be a method responsible for fitting the model, probably named something like `fit` or similar. This is where modifications might be needed to incorporate the use of the original dataset along with the predictions.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"StackingClassifier\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for method handling the final estimator:** We also need to find the specific method within the `StackingClassifier` that manages the training of the final estimator. This might be a part of the `fit` method or a standalone method that deals with preparing the data for the final estimator and the training process.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"fit_final_estimator\", \"StackingClassifier\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Look for existing handling or documentation mentioning using the original dataset:** It's also valuable to check if there's already a part of the code or documentation comment that mentions the possibility of using the original dataset for training the final estimator. This could provide hints on existing support or consideration for such feature.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"use_features_in_secondary\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches should give us a good starting point to understand the current implementation of the `StackingClassifier`, how it trains the final estimator, and where we might introduce changes to include an option for using the original dataset in training the final estimator."
