Given the issue description, we can infer that we're dealing with stacking classifiers, specifically with the training of the final estimator and possibly how it integrates with the original dataset. The StackingClassifier or an equivalent might be the relevant class, and methods inside might deal with fitting the model and managing the training data for the final estimator.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls to gather necessary code context:\n\n1. **Search for the class related to stacking:** We need to find the specific class in scikit-learn that handles stacking of classifiers. The appropriate class name is likely to be `StackingClassifier`, based on common naming conventions in scikit-learn for ensemble methods.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"StackingClassifier\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the method that fits the model:** Within the `StackingClassifier` class, there should be a method responsible for fitting the model, probably named something like `fit` or similar. This is where modifications might be needed to incorporate the use of the original dataset along with the predictions.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"StackingClassifier\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for method handling the final estimator:** We also need to find the specific method within the `StackingClassifier` that manages the training of the final estimator.

This could provide hints on existing support or consideration for such feature.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"use_features_in_secondary\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches should give us a good starting point to understand the current implementation of the `StackingClassifier`, how it trains the final estimator, and where we might introduce changes to include an option for using the original dataset in training the final estimator."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides valuable information for addressing the issue regarding adding an option to use the original dataset when training the `StackingClassifier`'s final estimator. Here's the analysis based on the questions posed:\n\n### Analyzing the `fit` method in `StackingClassifier`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n   The `fit` method in the `StackingClassifier` is responsible for fitting the model to the given training data. It takes `X` and `y` as inputs, which represent the features and target values of the training data, respectively. Additionally, it accepts `sample_weight`, which can be used to weight the samples if not all samples are equally important. The method ensures that the target values (`y`) are correctly formatted for classification and then proceeds with the fitting process by calling the `fit` method of its superclass with the processed targets.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   The `fit` method is central to the issue as it handles the training data. The enhancement proposed in the issue would likely involve modifying this method (or the methods it calls) to optionally include the original features (`X`) along with the predictions of the base estimators when fitting the final estimator. Currently, this method does not indicate any functionality for combining the original dataset with the predictions of the base models before fitting the final estimator.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   The intended behavior would be to modify or extend the `fit` method to incorporate an option that allows the final estimator to be trained not only on the predictions of the base estimators (which is the default stacking behavior) but also on the original training dataset itself. This would align with practices seen in certain Kaggle competitions where both the original features and the predictions of base models are used for the final model training to potentially improve the model's performance.\n\n### Steps Forward Based on Missing Context\n\nSince there was no direct finding of a `fit_final_estimator` method or mentions of `use_features_in_secondary`, we should consider alternate approaches to find related functionality that deals with how the final estimator is trained with the ensemble of predictions from the base estimators.\n\n- **Exploring the superclass and related methods:** The `fit` method mentions calling `super().fit()`, indicating the process involves superclass functionality. It would be useful to explore the `_BaseStacking` superclass to understand how it handles the training process, particularly how predictions from base estimators are prepared and utilized.\n\n- **Investigating how base estimators' predictions are used:** Since our goal involves potentially modifying how these predictions (and possibly the original dataset) are fed into the final estimator, understanding the existing mechanism is crucial. This can involve searching for methods related to generating base estimators' predictions or how the final estimator is trained.\n\nGiven this analysis, further API calls should aim to uncover:\n1. How the superclass `_BaseStacking` handles the fitting process and the training of the final estimator.\n2. Any mechanism that shows how predictions from base estimators are managed and prepared for training the final estimator, which could lead to insights on where and how to introduce the original dataset into the process.\n\nLet's proceed with:\n\n```python\nsearch_class_in_file(\"_BaseStacking\", \"sklearn/ensemble/_stacking.py\")\nsearch_method_in_file(\"super().fit\", \"sklearn/ensemble/_stacking.py\")\n```"

Location 1: File: sklearn/ensemble/_stacking.py, Class: StackingClassifier, Method: fit\n   - Intended Behavior: To resolve the issue, the `fit` method of the `StackingClassifier` class needs to be modified or extended to support an additional option that allows including the original dataset features (`X`) along with the predictions of the base estimators when training the final estimator. Specifically, this involves:\n     - Introducing a new parameter, possibly named `use_features_in_secondary` (aligning with the naming suggested in the issue and consistent with similar functionality in other libraries), which when set to `True`, will include the original features `X` along with the base estimators' predictions as input to the final estimator during the fit process.\n     - The existing functionality, where the final estimator is trained solely on the predictions of the base estimators, must be preserved when `use_features_in_secondary` is `False`.\n     - This modification should conditionally concatenate the original features `X` to the output of the base estimators' predictions before fitting the final estimator, ensuring that when `use_features_in_secondary=True`, both the predictions and original features are used for the final training step.\n     - Care must be taken to handle any dimensionality and data type issues arising from concatenating original features with predictions, especially considering compatibility with different types of final estimators and ensuring that feature scaling or normalization steps applied to `X` during initial training are consistently applied here as well.\n     - Documentation within the method should be updated to describe the new parameter and its impact on the training process, emphasizing when and why it might be beneficial to use this option.\n     - It is essential to ensure that any new code paths introduced by this change do not affect the existing default behavior of the `StackingClassifier` when `use_features_in_secondary` is not enabled, preserving backward compatibility."
