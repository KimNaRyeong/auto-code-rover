To create a standalone `reproducer.py` script that reproduces the issue you described and meets your requirements, we must carefully initialize the Django application within the script. This is to ensure that when the script is executed, it properly sets up the Django environment, models, and database connections. Furthermore, the script will utilize your function to print stack traces for any exceptions, including `AssertionError` when the issue is present. This script aims to reproduce the issue where `Exists` annotations could return non-boolean results such as `None`.

```python
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Exists

# Define a function to print stack trace
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Configure settings for Django project
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=(
        '__main__',  # This script will be the app
    ),
    USE_TZ=True,
)

# Define models
class A(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'

class B(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'

try:
    # Initialize Django
    django.setup()
    execute_from_command_line(['django-admin', 'migrate'])

    # Creating test data
    A.objects.create()
    B.objects.create()

    # Test case 1: Query with results
    result_true = A.objects.annotate(should_be_bool=Exists(B.objects.all())).first().should_be_bool
    assert result_true is True, "Query with results did not return True"

    # Test case 2: Query with no results
    result_false = A.objects.annotate(should_be_bool=Exists(B.objects.none())).first().should_be_bool
    assert result_false is False, "Query with no results did not return False"

    # If no exceptions were raised, print confirmation and exit with code 0
    print("Test cases passed. Issue seems to be fixed.")

except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)
```

Please, note that this script:
- Sets up a temporary Django environment, using an in-memory SQLite database for simplicity.
- Defines two simple models (`A` and `B`) to reproduce the issue.
- Checks the behavior of `Exists` with a queryset that should return results and with `none()`, expecting `True` and `False` respectively.
- Utilizes the custom `print_stacktrace` function to handle and output exceptions, ensuring that any failure is clearly communicated with a stack trace.
- If the issue is not reproduced (i.e., `Exists` works as expected without returning `None`), the script prints a confirmation message and exits with code 0.
