        "content": "<issue>Exists annotations can return non-boolean results (i.e. None) if used with an empty QuerySet.\nDescription\nI suspect this is following on from, but potentially separate to #33018 -- because that ticket starts out using Django 3.2 to observe that an empty queryset (EmptyQuerySet or whatever, via none()) can short circuit evaluation to be 0 as ... in the SQL query, which is exactly the same problem I observed.\nHowever, as far as I can tell, the result of an Exists(queryset.none()) can still return values outside of True/False, namely, None.\nUsing Django main as of 4593bc5da115f2e808a803a4ec24104b6c7a6152 (from Wed Jan 11 ... 2023), here's the behaviour on both postgres and sqlite. In both scenarios I'm using 3.10.2 with psycopg2==2.9.3 and sqlite3.sqlite_version is 3.37.0 and sqlite3.version is 2.6.0.\nIPython outputs 8 and 11 are the problems.\nclass A(models.Model):\npass\nclass B(models.Model):\npass\nIn [1]: from app.models import A, B\nIn [2]: A.objects.using(\"pg\").create()\nOut[2]: <A: A object (1)>\nIn [3]: B.objects.using(\"pg\").create()\nOut[3]: <B: B object (1)>\nIn [4]: A.objects.using(\"sqlite\").create()\nOut[4]: <A: A object (1)>\nIn [4]: B.objects.using(\"sqlite\").create()\nOut[4]: <B: B object (1)>\nIn [5]: from django.db.models import Exists\nIn [6]: A.objects.using(\"sqlite\").annotate(should_be_bool=Exists(B.objects.all())).first().should_be_bool\nOut[6]: True\nIn [7]: A.objects.using(\"sqlite\").annotate(should_be_bool=Exists(B.objects.filter(pk=99999999))).first().should_be_bool\nOut[7]: False\nIn [8]: A.objects.using(\"sqlite\").annotate(should_be_bool=Exists(B.objects.none())).first().should_be_bool\n# This is the problem, it returned neither True nor False\nIn [9]: A.objects.using(\"pg\").annotate(should_be_bool=Exists(B.objects.all())).first().should_be_bool\nOut[9]: True\nIn [10]: A.objects.using(\"pg\").annotate(should_be_bool=Exists(B.objects.filter(pk=99999999))).first().should_be_bool\nOut[10]: False\nIn [11]: A.objects.using(\"pg\").annotate(should_be_bool=Exists(B.objects.none())).first().should_be_bool\n# This is the problem, it returned neither True nor False\nAnd the queries, which are the same for postgres & sqlite:\n# ...\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"app_a\".\"id\", EXISTS(SELECT 1 AS \"a\" FROM \"app_b\" LIMIT 1) AS \"should_be_bool\" FROM \"app_a\" ORDER BY \"app_a\".\"id\" ASC LIMIT 1',\n'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"app_a\".\"id\", EXISTS(SELECT 1 AS \"a\" FROM \"app_b\" U0 WHERE U0.\"id\" = 99999999 LIMIT 1) AS \"should_be_bool\" FROM \"app_a\" ORDER BY \"app_a\".\"id\" ASC LIMIT 1',\n'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"app_a\".\"id\", NULL AS \"should_be_bool\" FROM \"app_a\" ORDER BY \"app_a\".\"id\" ASC LIMIT 1',\n'time': '0.001'}\nGiven Exists has an output_field of BooleanField and that definition doesn't have null=True as an argument, it seems incongruent from both an expectations (\"exists sounds boolean\") and implementation (\"it doesn't say it could be null\") standpoint.\nWhilst the problem exists in main, it has also changed behaviour (presumably or potentially unexpectedly) since 3.2, where postgres and sqlite actually do different things, hence we tested both above. So main is now consistent, but I'd personally argue it's consistently wrong (for a given value thereof, no judgement made!)\nIn 3.2.16, under sqlite, using annotate(x=Exists(y.none())) returns False but on main it now returns None (see above) -- the 3.2 behaviour is correct for my expectations\nIn [4]: A.objects.using(\"sqlite\").annotate(should_be_bool=Exists(B.objects.none())).first().should_be_bool\nOut[4]: False\nIn [5]: connections['sqlite'].queries\nOut[5]:\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"app_a\".\"id\", 0 AS \"should_be_bool\" FROM \"app_a\" ORDER BY \"app_a\".\"id\" ASC LIMIT 1',\n'time': '0.000'}\nIn 3.2.16 with postgres we get neither None nor False but the integer 0 instead:\nIn [4]: A.objects.using(\"pg\").annotate(should_be_bool=Exists(B.objects.none())).first().should_be_bool\nOut[4]: 0\nIn [5]: connections['pg'].queries\nOut[5]:\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"app_a\".\"id\", 0 AS \"should_be_bool\" FROM \"app_a\" ORDER BY \"app_a\".\"id\" ASC LIMIT 1',\n'time': '0.001'}\nSo we can observe that under 3.2 using the 0 AS ... behaviour\nsqlite appears to behave correctly (returning False)\npostgres appears to behave incorrectly (failing to cast a raw integer to a boolean)\nAnd under main using the NULL AS ... behaviour\nsqlite no longer behaves the same, returning None where I'd expect False (or even True given the way SQL EXISTS works...)\npostgres behaves differently, 0 is now None but I'd still expect True or False as the output.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insight into the `Exists` class and its use in Django, helping to formulate a resolution strategy for the reported bug. Let's break down the results:\n\n1. **Exist Class in `django/db/models/expressions.py`:**\n   - The `Exists` class inherits from `Subquery` and overrides its template to use the SQL `EXISTS` clause, designed to return a boolean value indicating whether a subquery returns any results.\n   - It has an output field explicitly defined as a `BooleanField()`, which underlines the expectation that its instances should always yield a boolean value.\n   \n   **Analysis & Relation to the Bug:** Since the `Exists` class is intended to produce boolean outputs, the reported issue (where it returns `None` for an empty queryset) is unexpected. This suggests either an issue in how `Exists` deals with the `EmptyQuerySet` or how the result is interpreted and cast by Django or the underlying database.\n\n2. **`__init__` Method of `Exists`:**\n   - The initialization sets up the `Exists` instance and makes a call to `self.query.exists()`, likely preparing the SQL query that checks for existence.\n   \n   **Analysis & Relation to the Bug:** The `__init__` method shows how `Exists` integrates with querysets. The fact that `self.query.exists()` is invoked hints at how Django internally marks the query to be evaluated as an existence check. This part doesn't directly illuminate the issue but confirms that `Exists` manipulates the query for its purpose.\n\n3. **Absence of `as_sql` Method Results & `annotate(should_be_bool=Exists` Code:**\n   - The inquiry for an `as_sql` method within `Exists` and specific usage patterns of `Exists` in annotation didn't yield results.\n   \n   **Analysis:** This absence suggests we may need to look further into how `Exists` is translated into SQL by Django's ORM, particularly in how `Subquery` superclass or related queryset mechanics convert or interpret the `EXISTS` SQL clause into a Django model field value. The `as_sql` method might be defined in a parent class or related utility function.\n\n4. **Search for `queryset.none()`:**\n   - References to `queryset.none()` in various parts of the codebase indicate it's a commonly used method to return an `EmptyQuerySet`.\n   \n   **Analysis & Relation to the Bug:** `queryset.none()` is directly related to the issue since the bug surfaces when `Exists` wraps an `EmptyQuerySet`. This could imply there's an inconsistency in how `EmptyQuerySet` results are handled or coerced into boolean values.\n\n**Next Steps for Further Context:**\nConsidering the insights and missing pieces, additional API calls should aim to understand:\n- How Django translates the `Exists` queryset to SQL and back to a Python boolean value.\n- If there's special handling for `EmptyQuerySet` in the ORM that could affect the `Exists` behavior.\n- How the result of `Exists` is processed when fetching from the database and converted back to the model field value.\n\nBased on these considerations, the following API calls are suggested:\n- `search_method_in_class(\"as_sql\", \"Subquery\")` to understand how the SQL is generated.\n- `search_method(\"boolean_cast\")` or similar, to find how Django casts database results to boolean fields, assuming such a utility exists or is used implicitly."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g.

Specifically, when `Exists` wraps an `EmptyQuerySet`, it should explicitly result in `False`, adhering to the logical expectation that an empty queryset does not exist. This behavior should be consistent across different database backends (like PostgreSQL and SQLite as mentioned in the issue). The implementation should make sure that any SQL generated for an `EmptyQuerySet` inside an `Exists` accurately translates back to a boolean value in Python, avoiding `None` or any non-boolean value. Debugging and fixing this behavior might involve adjusting the `__init__` method to properly configure the queryset it wraps or modifying how the `as_sql` method (on `Exists` or within its inheritance chain) handles the conversion when dealing with an empty subquery, ensuring the output is always boolean."
