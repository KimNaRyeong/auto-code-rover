        "intended_behavior": "The `as_sql` method, within the context of an `Exists` instance that wraps an `EmptyQuerySet`, should be adjusted to ensure the SQL output always results in a boolean value. When `Exists` wraps an `EmptyQuerySet`, the SQL generated should explicitly handle this scenario, possibly by ensuring that the SQL statement evaluates to `False` directly, rather than yielding `None` or relying on the database's default handling of an empty subquery which can be inconsistent across different backends."
