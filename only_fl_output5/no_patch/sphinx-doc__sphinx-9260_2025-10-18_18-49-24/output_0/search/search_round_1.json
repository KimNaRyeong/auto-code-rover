        "content": "<issue>Linkchecker croaks on specific anchors of GitHub-rendered reStructuredText documents\nDear Sphinx developers,\nfirst things first: Thanks a stack for your paramount work on Sphinx. You already saved many souls of people writing technical documentation and probably also beyond this audience.\nWe just observed a minor woe with Sphinx' linkchecker we wanted to share with you. We really like that the linkchecker is able to check anchors within HTML documents as contributed by @intgr on behalf of #842.\nWith kind regards,\nAndreas.\n---\n**Describe the bug**\nWe had the link [1] in our documentation, and, maybe after upgrading to more recent versions of Sphinx, the linkchecker suddenly started croaking on that. After changing it to [2], it worked again. When inspecting the source code of the respective HTML page, you can clearly see that the anchor name `#user-content-make-changes` defined by\n```html\n<a name=\"user-content-make-changes\"></a>\n<a id=\"user-content-make-changes\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#make-changes\">\n```\nis technically correct. However, it apparently has worked before by referencing `#make-changes`. So, we are wondering if something changed on GitHub's reStructuredText renderer or even Browsers interpreting the HTML link anchors differently. When invoking those links [1,2] in the Browser, actually both work, including navigation to the appropriate place within the page. Funny, hm?\n[1] https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst#make-changes\n[2] https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst#user-content-make-changes\n**Expected behavior**\nTechnically, from the perspective we know our way around HTML, the behavior is probably the right thing and correct.\nHowever, as we can see, something might have been changed on the HTML standard that Browsers are capable of interpreting different styles of defining link anchors. So, it might be worth to revisit this space and maybe improve the linkchecker implementation on those aspects.\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Linux\n- Python version: 3.9.2\n- Sphinx version: 3.5.2\n- Firefox: 86.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "To investigate and solve the issue with the linkchecker functionality in Sphinx, especially in relation to GitHub-rendered reStructuredText documents and their anchor handling, let's gather relevant code. Given the details in the issue, the focus should be on the linkchecker component of Sphinx, inspecting how it processes anchors in HTML documents. We need to look into how Sphinx's linkchecker validates links, how it parses and handles anchors, and if there's been any update or change in this functionality that might have led to the problem described.\n\nFirst, we need to find the code related to the linkchecker. Since Sphinx is a large project, it's likely organized across multiple files. The linkchecker functionality could be encapsulated in a class or a set of functions dedicated to checking links. It's probable that there's a specific method for parsing and validating anchors in URLs, which might need adjustments to accommodate changes in how browsers or GitHub's reStructuredText renderer handle anchors.\n\nHere are the search API calls we could use to gather the necessary context for addressing the issue:\n\n1. **Searching for the LinkChecker Class**: Assuming the linkchecking functionality is within a class named something like \"LinkChecker\", we should first locate this class. If the class name differs, an alternative approach would have to be considered based on Sphinx's documentation or the project's structure.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"LinkChecker\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Searching for Methods Related to Anchor Handling**: Assuming we find the class and that there's a method specifically for handling anchors, we would next look into methods possibly named or related to anchor validation or parsing within this class.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"validate_anchor\", \"LinkChecker\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"parse_anchor\", \"LinkChecker\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Looking for the Method that Performs URL Checks**: Since the issue involves checking URLs, identifying the method responsible for this within the context of the LinkChecker or a similar functionality might provide insights.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"check_url\", \"LinkChecker\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Searching for Code Handling Specific HTML Anchor Elements**: Given the specifics of the issue mentioning `<a name=\"user-content-make-changes\"></a>` and `<a id=\"user-content-make-changes\" class=\"anchor\">`, searching for code snippets that look for these patterns could be insightful. It's possible that the current implementation specifically looks for `id` or `name` attributes directly, which might need adjustment.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code('<a name=\"')\n   search_code('<a id=\"')\n   ```\n\nThese API calls should help in gathering code context related to the problem described in the issue. With the obtained context, we can then look into how the implementation might be adjusted to handle both styles of anchors (`#make-changes` and `#user-content-make-changes`) as GitHub appears to do."

        "content": "Analyzing the obtained snippet from the `search_code(\"<a name=\")` result gives us some insight, although it doesn't directly address the main concern of the linkchecker functionality described in the issue. However, let's break down what we have and proceed with further steps to gather more relevant context.\n\n### Analysis of the Collected Code Snippet\n\n- **What this part of the code does**: The provided code snippet comes from `sphinx/builders/changes.py` within a `ChangesBuilder` class and a `write` function. The function includes a method `hl` that adds an anchor to a line, suggesting it's meant for highlighting or referencing specific lines within the document. Specifically, it injects an HTML snippet `<a name=\"L%s\"> </a>` for line numbering, which could be used for internal links within generated documents.\n\n- **The relationship between this part of the code and the bug**: Although the issue revolves around the handling of anchors in linked documents, this snippet deals with generating anchors for line references within Sphinx-generated documents. While it doesn't directly address the issue of link checking, it does illuminate how Sphinx uses anchor tags (`<a name=...`) internally, which is part of the broader conversation about anchor handling.\n\n- **Intended behavior given the issue description**: Ideally, this snippet should have little to do directly with the described bug, as it concerns document generation rather than link checking. However, understanding that Sphinx does handle anchors in some capacity might give a baseline expectation for its internal processing of HTML. For the issue at hand, we'd be looking for code that deals with the validation or checking of external links and anchors in those links, particularly how different forms of anchor references are handled or resolved.\n\nGiven the absence of direct hits concerning the linkchecker functionality and considering the misunderstanding of a correctly named class or method that would correspond to the linkchecker functionality, it's essential to refine our search approach to focus more broadly on functionality possibly related to link checking or validation within Sphinx.\n\n### Next Steps for Further API Calls\n\nGiven the initial searches did not yield results directly related to the `LinkChecker` or similar functionalities, it's clear we need to explore alternative strategies:\n\n1. **Broaden the search for link checking functionality**: We should look for functions or classes that might be related to link checking without assuming specific names. This could involve searching for keywords related to links, such as \"check\" and \"url\" or \"anchor\".\n\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"check_links\")\n   search_method(\"validate_links\")\n   search_code(\"link check\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for Sphinx mechanisms handling external resources**: Another angle is to explore how Sphinx processes external references in documents, which might bring up relevant mechanisms involved in link checking.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"external references\")\n   search_code(\"parse_url\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Examine Documentation Generation Process**: Since the issue arises in the context of generated documentation, examining code responsible for parsing and rendering might also be insightful.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"render_documentation\")\n   search_method(\"generate_html\")\n   ```\n\nThese approaches aim to cover broader aspects of Sphinx's functionality that could intersect with the link checking process, hopefully uncovering the relevant parts of the codebase that could be contributing to the issue described."
