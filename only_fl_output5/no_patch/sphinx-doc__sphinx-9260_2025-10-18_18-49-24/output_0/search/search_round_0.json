        "content": "<issue>Linkchecker croaks on specific anchors of GitHub-rendered reStructuredText documents\nDear Sphinx developers,\nfirst things first: Thanks a stack for your paramount work on Sphinx. You already saved many souls of people writing technical documentation and probably also beyond this audience.\nWe just observed a minor woe with Sphinx' linkchecker we wanted to share with you. We really like that the linkchecker is able to check anchors within HTML documents as contributed by @intgr on behalf of #842.\nWith kind regards,\nAndreas.\n---\n**Describe the bug**\nWe had the link [1] in our documentation, and, maybe after upgrading to more recent versions of Sphinx, the linkchecker suddenly started croaking on that. After changing it to [2], it worked again. When inspecting the source code of the respective HTML page, you can clearly see that the anchor name `#user-content-make-changes` defined by\n```html\n<a name=\"user-content-make-changes\"></a>\n<a id=\"user-content-make-changes\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#make-changes\">\n```\nis technically correct. However, it apparently has worked before by referencing `#make-changes`. So, we are wondering if something changed on GitHub's reStructuredText renderer or even Browsers interpreting the HTML link anchors differently. When invoking those links [1,2] in the Browser, actually both work, including navigation to the appropriate place within the page. Funny, hm?\n[1] https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst#make-changes\n[2] https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst#user-content-make-changes\n**Expected behavior**\nTechnically, from the perspective we know our way around HTML, the behavior is probably the right thing and correct.\nHowever, as we can see, something might have been changed on the HTML standard that Browsers are capable of interpreting different styles of defining link anchors. So, it might be worth to revisit this space and maybe improve the linkchecker implementation on those aspects.\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Linux\n- Python version: 3.9.2\n- Sphinx version: 3.5.2\n- Firefox: 86.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "To investigate and solve the issue with the linkchecker functionality in Sphinx, especially in relation to GitHub-rendered reStructuredText documents and their anchor handling, let's gather relevant code. Given the details in the issue, the focus should be on the linkchecker component of Sphinx, inspecting how it processes anchors in HTML documents. We need to look into how Sphinx's linkchecker validates links, how it parses and handles anchors, and if there's been any update or change in this functionality that might have led to the problem described.\n\nFirst, we need to find the code related to the linkchecker. Since Sphinx is a large project, it's likely organized across multiple files. The linkchecker functionality could be encapsulated in a class or a set of functions dedicated to checking links. It's probable that there's a specific method for parsing and validating anchors in URLs, which might need adjustments to accommodate changes in how browsers or GitHub's reStructuredText renderer handle anchors.\n\nHere are the search API calls we could use to gather the necessary context for addressing the issue:\n\n1. **Searching for the LinkChecker Class**: Assuming the linkchecking functionality is within a class named something like \"LinkChecker\", we should first locate this class. If the class name differs, an alternative approach would have to be considered based on Sphinx's documentation or the project's structure.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"LinkChecker\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Searching for Methods Related to Anchor Handling**: Assuming we find the class and that there's a method specifically for handling anchors, we would next look into methods possibly named or related to anchor validation or parsing within this class.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"validate_anchor\", \"LinkChecker\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"parse_anchor\", \"LinkChecker\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Looking for the Method that Performs URL Checks**: Since the issue involves checking URLs, identifying the method responsible for this within the context of the LinkChecker or a similar functionality might provide insights.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"check_url\", \"LinkChecker\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Searching for Code Handling Specific HTML Anchor Elements**: Given the specifics of the issue mentioning `<a name=\"user-content-make-changes\"></a>` and `<a id=\"user-content-make-changes\" class=\"anchor\">`, searching for code snippets that look for these patterns could be insightful. It's possible that the current implementation specifically looks for `id` or `name` attributes directly, which might need adjustment.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code('<a name=\"')\n   search_code('<a id=\"')\n   ```\n\nThese API calls should help in gathering code context related to the problem described in the issue. With the obtained context, we can then look into how the implementation might be adjusted to handle both styles of anchors (`#make-changes` and `#user-content-make-changes`) as GitHub appears to do."
