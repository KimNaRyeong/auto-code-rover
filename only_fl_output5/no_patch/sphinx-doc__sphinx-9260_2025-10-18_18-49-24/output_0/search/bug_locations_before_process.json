        "intended_behavior": "The code responsible for extracting and validating hyperlinks within linkcheck.py should be enhanced to recognize and correctly handle GitHub-specific anchor formats (such as #user-content- prefixed anchors). This involves adjusting both the extraction logic, to identify these anchor references within HTML content, and the validation logic, to ensure these anchors are checked in a way that accommodates GitHub's approach to rendering them. The validation process should regard both traditional anchors (#anchor-name) and GitHub-specific anchor formats as valid, preventing false negatives where valid links are mistakenly flagged as broken due to a mismatch in anchor naming conventions. This enhancement should be implemented in a way that preserves existing functionality for all other types of links and does not interfere with Sphinx's handling of other reStructuredText directives or external link checkers. Providing a configuration option or automatically detecting GitHub-rendered documents to apply this specific checking logic could be considered to maintain general applicability and backward compatibility."
