This Python script, `reproducer.py`, attempts to reproduce the issue described. It checks if the anchors (with and without the `user-content-` prefix) exist on the GitHub-rendered reStructuredText document by searching for their presence within the fetched HTML content. An `AssertionError` is raised if the expected fragment is not found in the content, with a stack trace printed for debugging purposes. 

The script exits with code 0 if no issue is found (i.e., if both fragment checks pass successfully), indicating that the original problem described (where only one style of anchor link worked) is no longer present. 

It's important to note that this script uses a very simplistic method for checking the presence of anchors in the HTML and does not fully parse the document. A robust solution for a real-world application should involve proper HTML parsing to accurately verify the existence and functionality of the links.
