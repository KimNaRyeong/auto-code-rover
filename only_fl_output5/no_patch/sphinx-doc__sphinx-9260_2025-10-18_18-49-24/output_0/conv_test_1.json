You already saved many souls of people writing technical documentation and probably also beyond this audience.\r\n\r\nWe just observed a minor woe with Sphinx' linkchecker we wanted to share with you. We really like that the linkchecker is able to check anchors within HTML documents as contributed by @intgr on behalf of #842.\r\n\r\nWith kind regards,\r\nAndreas.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nWe had the link [1] in our documentation, and, maybe after upgrading to more recent versions of Sphinx, the linkchecker suddenly started croaking on that. After changing it to [2], it worked again. When inspecting the source code of the respective HTML page, you can clearly see that the anchor name `#user-content-make-changes` defined by\r\n```html\r\n<a name=\"user-content-make-changes\"></a>\r\n<a id=\"user-content-make-changes\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#make-changes\">\r\n```\r\nis technically correct. However, it apparently has worked before by referencing `#make-changes`. So, we are wondering if something changed on GitHub's reStructuredText renderer or even Browsers interpreting the HTML link anchors differently. When invoking those links [1,2] in the Browser, actually both work, including navigation to the appropriate place within the page. Funny, hm?\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst#make-changes\r\n[2] https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst#user-content-make-changes\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nTechnically, from the perspective we know our way around HTML, the behavior is probably the right thing and correct. \r\n\r\nHowever, as we can see, something might have been changed on the HTML standard that Browsers are capable of interpreting different styles of defining link anchors. So, it might be worth to revisit this space and maybe improve the linkchecker implementation on those aspects.\r\n\r\n**Environment info**\r\n- OS: Linux\r\n- Python version: 3.9.2\r\n- Sphinx version: 3.5.2\r\n- Firefox: 86.0\r\n\n"

It checks if the anchors (with and without the `user-content-` prefix) exist on the GitHub-rendered reStructuredText document by searching for their presence within the fetched HTML content. An `AssertionError` is raised if the expected fragment is not found in the content, with a stack trace printed for debugging purposes. \n\nThe script exits with code 0 if no issue is found (i.e., if both fragment checks pass successfully), indicating that the original problem described (where only one style of anchor link worked) is no longer present. \n\nIt's important to note that this script uses a very simplistic method for checking the presence of anchors in the HTML and does not fully parse the document. A robust solution for a real-world application should involve proper HTML parsing to accurately verify the existence and functionality of the links."
