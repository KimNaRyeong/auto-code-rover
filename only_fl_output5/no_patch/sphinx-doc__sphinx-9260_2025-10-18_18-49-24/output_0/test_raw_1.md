Given the constraints and requirements, we can attempt a more basic approach to simulate reproducing the issue without relying on external packages like `requests`. This script will instead use `urllib` from Python's standard library to fetch the page content and verify the existence of the anchor tags. This should avoid the `ModuleNotFoundError` issue reported previously.

Please note: This script now assumes the described behavior regarding link anchors within GitHub-rendered reStructuredText documents. It checks if navigating to the specified anchors is possible by analyzing the content fetched directly from the given URLs. However, it does not accurately replicate browser behavior or Sphinx's link checking and therefore might not catch all nuances of the issue.

```python
import urllib.request
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def fetch_page_source(url: str) -> str:
    try:
        with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as response:
            return response.read().decode('utf-8')
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

def check_anchor_in_source(source_code: str, anchor: str) -> bool:
    return f'id="{anchor}"' in source_code or f'name="{anchor}"' in source_code

def main():
    base_url = "https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst"
    original_anchor = "make-changes"
    new_anchor = "user-content-make-changes"
    
    page_source = fetch_page_source(base_url)
    
    original_exists = check_anchor_in_source(page_source, original_anchor)
    new_exists = check_anchor_in_source(page_source, new_anchor)
    
    # Expecting the new anchor style to work, given the described issue.
    try:
        assert new_exists, f"New style anchor '{new_anchor}' not found in source."
        assert original_exists, f"Original style anchor '{original_anchor}' should also exist."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    
    print("Both original and new style anchors exist in source. Issue not reproduced.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script:
- Retrieves page source code from a specified URL.
- Checks for the presence of both the new (`user-content-make-changes`) and original (`make-changes`) anchor formats in the page source.
- Raises an `AssertionError` if either the new format is not found (indicating the issue exists) or the original format is unexpectedly missing (which could indicate a different issue or a change in GitHub's rendering).
- Uses the standard `urllib` module for HTTP requests to avoid external dependencies.
- Exits with code 0 when both anchor formats are detected, implying the issue is not reproduced under these test conditions.
