        "intended_behavior": "The code within `_scale_back_ascii` aims to replace the exponent separator in floating-point numbers from 'D' to 'E' in the `output_field`. The intended behavior is to ensure that this replacement actually occurs, correcting the bug where the `replace` method's result was not used. To achieve this, the method should assign the result of the `replace` operation back to `output_field`. This ensures that any 'D' characters found in floating-point representations in this field are correctly replaced with 'E', thus preserving the intended functionality of standardizing the format of floating-point numbers across the data processed by `FITS_rec`."
