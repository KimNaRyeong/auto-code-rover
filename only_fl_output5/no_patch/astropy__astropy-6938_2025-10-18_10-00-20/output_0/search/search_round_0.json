The following API calls will be helpful:\n\n1. **Search for the code snippet in the given file**: Since the issue clearly points to a block of code within ``fitsrec.py``, we should first locate this exact part of the code and surrounding context to understand how it's being used.\n\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))\", \"fitsrec.py\")`\n\n2. **Get code around the problematic line**: After identifying the location of this code snippet, retrieving the surrounding code could provide insight into how `output_field` is being manipulated and why the intended `replace` operation is critical at this point. Since we don't know the exact line number yet, this step will have to wait until after the results of the first call are known.\n\n3. **Search for the class definition where this code belongs**: Understanding the class structure where this method belongs could provide more context on how data is processed. Assuming `output_field` is a member of a class within `fitsrec.py`, it's relevant to understand its class context.\n\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"fitsrec\", \"fitsrec.py\")`\n\nThis approach should give us enough information to start assessing how best to address the reported issue, specifically by understanding the intention and execution flow of the problematic code snippet within its broader class and file context."
