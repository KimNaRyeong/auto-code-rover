This `reproducer.py` script is written to execute the specific test case described in the provided issue report within a standalone Python file. By encoding a dictionary key as bytes and then passing it alongside a file within a multipart/form-data POST request, the script attempts to reproduce the issue where certain field names might be incorrectly encoded or misrepresented in the prepared request body.

The script makes use of the `print_stacktrace` function to clearly print stack traces for raised exceptions, providing valuable debugging information about the execution path leading up to the exception. 

Upon executing the script:
- If the issue is present, and an `AssertionError` is caught, it will print the stack trace and exit with code 0, indicating the reproduction of the issue.
- If an unexpected exception occurs, it prints the stack trace and exits with code 1, indicating an error in the test setup or another unrelated issue.
- If no exceptions are raised, it prints "Test passed. No issues detected." and exits with code 1, meaning the issue does not exist or has been fixed in the environment being tested.
