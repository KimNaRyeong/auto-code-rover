This particularly applies to handling multipart/form-data where field names and file names might be encoded. The method should maintain the original encoding of these names, whether ASCII or UTF-8, ensuring they are represented correctly in the HTTP request body without additional markings (like b'' for byte strings) that are not part of the actual content. The preservation of existing functionality related to handling various data types (such as files, streams, and regular form data) is crucial, with the fix specifically aimed at correcting the representation of encoded names."

This includes ensuring that when field names or file names are provided in an encoded format (such as UTF-8), these names are incorporated into the multipart body accurately and without unintended alterations. The method must handle these names in a way that does not introduce Python byte notation (b'') into the resulting HTTP body. This is critical for maintaining compliance with how such data should be transmitted over HTTP, enabling interoperability with systems expecting correctly formatted multipart/form-data payloads. All existing functionalities for encoding and preparing multipart requests should be preserved, with the fix specifically targeting the accurate inclusion of encoded names."
