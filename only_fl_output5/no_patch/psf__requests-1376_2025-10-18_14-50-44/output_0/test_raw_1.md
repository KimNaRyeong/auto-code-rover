This script has been revised from the previous one with a clearer emphasis on casting and verifying encoded field names, aiming at reproducing the described issue within a standalone file. The test function creates a multipart/form-data `POST` request including both a file and a data payload where the field names are encoded explicitly. It checks if the encoding is handled correctly in the prepared body of the request by looking for the presence and absence of specific byte patterns. If the assertions fail, indicating the problem is present, `print_stacktrace` is called to print a detailed traceback, and the script exits with code 1. If no exceptions are raised, it implies the issue has been resolved or does not exist in the tested environment, leading the script to exit successfully with code 0.
