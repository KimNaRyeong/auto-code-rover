They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)\nThanks!\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue regarding `urllib3` exceptions passing through the `requests` API, and to understand if `requests` aims to wrap `urllib3` exceptions within its own exception handling mechanism (`requests.exceptions`), we need to delve into specific parts of the `requests` codebase. Specifically, looking for how `requests` handles exceptions, especially those originating from `urllib3`, and if there's a mechanism that catches `urllib3` exceptions to wrap them in `requests.exceptions`.\n\nGiven this, here are the necessary API calls to start gathering context:\n\n1. Search for the `requests.exceptions` module to understand the existing exception hierarchy and see if there's an existing module or class designed to wrap `urllib3` exceptions:\n   - `search_code(\"requests.exceptions\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` being direct exceptions from `urllib3` that are not appropriately wrapped, it's crucial to find how `requests` is currently handling or failing to handle these exceptions:\n   - `search_class(\"DecodeError\")`\n   - `search_class(\"TimeoutError\")`\n\n3. To get a broader context of how exceptions are handled across the `requests` package, especially regarding interaction with `urllib3`, investigate the core request-making method or any relevant method that might deal with wrapping or catching exceptions:\n   - `search_method(\"request\")`\n   - `search_code(\"urllib3.exceptions\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to elucidate the structure and strategy around exception handling within `requests`, particularly in relation to `urllib3` exceptions, which is fundamental for crafting a solution to wrap `urllib3` exceptions appropriately within `requests.exceptions`."
