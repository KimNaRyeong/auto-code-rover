The intended behavior here should be to ensure that all exceptions from `urllib3`, specifically `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`, are caught and re-raised as comparable `requests.exceptions`. For `DecodeError`, an appropriate `requests` exception might be a new exception that accurately describes the error (e.g., `ContentDecodeError`), reflecting an issue with decoding response content. For `TimeoutError`, since `requests` already defines timeout exceptions, it could be mapped to `requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout` or a new more specific timeout exception if the existing ones do not accurately capture the scenario (e.g., `ProxyTimeoutError` for proxy timeout issues). This would involve adding or modifying exception handling blocks where `urllib3` exceptions are currently caught."

        "intended_behavior": "Given that this file likely orchestrates higher-level session requests and might also handle exceptions thrown during such operations, ensuring that `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` from `urllib3` are correctly caught and wrapped here as well is essential. If `adapters.py` is the primary location for direct `urllib3` interactions, then `sessions.py` would be a secondary layer that might still encounter these exceptions if they slip through the first layer of handling. The intended behavior would be similar to `adapters.py`: updating catch blocks to include `urllib3`'s `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`, wrapping and re-raising them as `requests.exceptions`. This ensures that even if direct interactions with `urllib3` in `sessions.py` might throw these exceptions, they're still handled according to `requests`' design principles."
