Considering the feedback, it indicates that `django-admin` was not found in the path, which led to the failure of the test. This scenario can occur if Django is not properly installed in your environment or if the environment itself is not correctly activated. 

To circumvent this issue and ensure our script uses the correct Django environment, we can adjust the script to programmatically execute Django's `startproject` command. This adjustment requires importing Django's command execution functions directly rather than relying on a shell command. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import os
import sys

# Ensure Django is set up correctly
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'mysite.settings')
import django
django.setup()

from django.core.management import call_command
from django.core.management.base import CommandError

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_project(project_name):
    try:
        # This will run the 'startproject' command programmatically
        call_command('startproject', project_name)
        print(f"Project '{project_name}' created successfully.")
    except CommandError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

def check_umask_effect(project_name, expected_permissions):
    settings_path = os.path.join(project_name, project_name, 'settings.py')
    if not os.path.isfile(settings_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Expected file '{settings_path}' not found.")
    actual_permissions = oct(os.stat(settings_path).st_mode)[-3:]
    if actual_permissions != expected_permissions:
        raise AssertionError(f"File permissions of '{settings_path}' are {actual_permissions}, expected {expected_permissions}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    project_name = "test_project"
    expected_permissions = '600'  # As an example, expecting read+write for the owner only

    # Set a umask value here if necessary, e.g., os.umask(0o077)
    # Not setting here due to potential system-wide effects and variances

    # Ensure environment is cleaned before running
    if os.path.exists(project_name):
        print(f"Cleanup required for '{project_name}' directory.")
        sys.exit(1)

    create_project(project_name)

    try:
        check_umask_effect(project_name, expected_permissions)
        print("The issue is fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    finally:
        # Cleanup
        import shutil
        shutil.rmtree(project_name, ignore_errors=True)
```

This script programs the Django environment to run the `startproject` command within the script, checks the file permission of `settings.py` against the expected permissions, and cleans up by deleting the created project.

Please note:

- This script directly uses Django's `call_command` function to programmatically create a new project. It assumes Django is installed and configured in the current Python environment.
- Before executing this script, ensure Django is installed using `pip install django`.
- Adjust `expected_permissions` based on the `umask` you're testing with. The example given (`'600'`) assumes a `umask` that would result in files being created with read+write permissions for the owner only, without considering the actual `umask` value set. You might need to adjust this as per your `umask` settings.
- This script does basic cleanup but be cautious about where you run it to avoid unintentional data loss.
