Below is a standalone `reproducer.py` script designed to replicate the described issue with the `startproject` command not honoring `umask` settings. This script sets a specific `umask`, creates a Django project using a direct call to replicate `django-admin startproject` functionality, and checks if the permissions of a generated file (like `settings.py`) honor the `umask`. Make sure Django is installed in your environment where you're running this script.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import stat
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_file_permissions(file_path, expected_permissions):
    # Stat the file to get its current permissions
    current_permissions = oct(stat.S_IMODE(os.lstat(file_path).st_mode))
    assert current_permissions == expected_permissions, \
        f"File permissions for {file_path} are {current_permissions}, expected {expected_permissions}."

def set_umask_and_create_project():
    # Set umask to 077
    os.umask(0o077)

    # Determine temporary project path
    project_path = "test_project"
    settings_path = os.path.join(project_path, "settings.py")

    try:
        # Using Django's command programmatically might not be stable across versions,
        # so we mimic the command line usage
        subprocess.check_call(["django-admin", "startproject", project_path])
        
        # Check settings.py permissions
        expected_permissions = "0o600" if os.name != 'nt' else "0o666"  # Windows doesn't strictly apply umask like POSIX
        check_file_permissions(settings_path, expected_permissions)

    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    finally:
        # Clean up: Try to remove created files if they exist
        try:
            if os.path.exists(settings_path):
                os.remove(settings_path)
            if os.path.exists(project_path):
                os.rmdir(project_path)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Cleanup failed: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    set_umask_and_create_project()
```

Before you run `python3 reproducer.py`, ensure two things:
1. You have Django installed in your Python environment. If not, install it using `pip install django`.
2. You are running it in a directory where you have permissions to create and remove files and directories, ideally outside of any existing Django project to avoid any conflicts.

When the issue persists (i.e., `startproject` does not honor `umask`), this script will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace of the issue. When the issue is resolved (meaning `startproject` correctly honors `umask` settings), the script should exit with code `0` without any exceptions.
