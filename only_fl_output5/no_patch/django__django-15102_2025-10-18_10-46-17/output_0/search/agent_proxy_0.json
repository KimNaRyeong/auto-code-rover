The implementation of the `startproject` command, likely located within a management command file.\n2. How files are being created or copied during the `startproject` process, which seems not to respect the user's `umask`.\n3. The error encountered related to file permissions during the `startproject` operation.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls will be useful to gather adequate context to address the issue:\n\n- `search_method(\"startproject\")`: This will help identify where and how `startproject` is implemented.\n- `search_code(\"fp = open(main_settings_file, 'w')\")`: Since the error message directly mentions this piece of code, finding it will provide exact context on how file creation is handled and why it's not respecting `umask`.\n\nThese searches will help in finding the relevant sections of the code that need modification to honor `umask` settings when creating new files and directories as part of the `startproject` command."
