        "intended_behavior": "The `Normalize` class should have a mechanism to notify attached observers (like `AxesImage`) of changes to its state (e.g., changes to `vmin`, `vmax`). It might involve designing a new method or integrating with an existing event/callback system within matplotlib to ensure scalar-mappable objects are informed of updates. This method should trigger a cascade of updates without leading to infinite recursion, ensuring all objects sharing the `Normalize` instance refresh their visuals accordingly while also preventing unnecessary updates if the normalization parameters haven't materially changed."

        "intended_behavior": "Modify or ensure there's an efficient way for `AxesImage` (and potentially other scalar-mappable objects) to respond to notifications from its `Normalize` object. This might involve implementing an event listener within the class that, upon receiving a change notification from `Normalize`, triggers a redrawing of the image with the new normalization parameters. It's crucial that this method handles updates expediently, conserving system resources and maintaining responsiveness, especially in interactive environments."
