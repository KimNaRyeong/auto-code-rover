        "intended_behavior": "This method needs to ensure that fractional powers and expressions involving roots are printed in a simplified form that mirrors the readability and simplicity of the pretty printer. Specifically, when dealing with expressions like exp(-x)*log(x), it should prefer a representation that closely matches the pretty printer's output, such as avoiding unnecessary fractions when a root or simpler expression is possible. Furthermore, examining expressions that result in division (e.g., 1/(x+y)/2), ensuring that the division is represented clearly and consistently with pretty print outputs."

        "intended_behavior": "Considering there wasn't a direct corresponding method like _print_Mul or handling for logarithm found for LatexPrinter, a more thorough review or potential implementation update might be needed to ensure division and logarithmic expressions are handled in a way that does not introduce inconsistencies with the pretty printer. This might involve enhancing existing methods or ensuring that settings (like fold_frac_powers) are leveraged correctly to maintain consistency with pretty printing philosophies."
