        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how the LaTeX and pretty printers are implemented and where inconsistencies may arise. The issue mentions specific cases involving the `exp`, `log`, and division operations in conjunction with variable declarations. Given this, we should focus on finding the relevant parts of the codebase that handle these operations' printing.\n\nFirst, we aim to find out which classes or methods are responsible for rendering LaTeX and pretty print representations. Since `exp`, `log`, and basic arithmetic operations like division are fundamental, they are likely handled by methods dedicated to printing within specific classes related to mathematical expressions and symbols. Therefore, the search will target the LaTeX and pretty print functionalities and where the operations mentioned in the issue are implemented or overridden.\n\nLet's make the following API calls:\n- search_class(\"LatexPrinter\")\n- search_class(\"PrettyPrinter\")\n- search_method(\"latex\")\n- search_method(\"pprint\")\n- search_code(\"exp(-x)*log(x)\")\n- search_code(\"1/(x + y)/2\")"
