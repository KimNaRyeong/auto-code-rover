Sure, I'll craft a `reproducer.py` Python script for you to reproduce the reported inconsistencies between the LaTeX and pretty printers. This script will perform checks to see if the outputs from both printers are inconsistent, and if they are, it will raise an `AssertionError` to demonstrate the presence of the issue.

```python
import sympy as sp

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_inconsistency(expr, latex_representation, pprint_representation, assumptions={}):
    # Set assumptions for variables if provided
    for var, assumption in assumptions.items():
        sp.var(var, **assumption)
    
    # Generate LaTeX and pretty print (pprint) formats
    latex_output = sp.latex(expr)
    pprint_output = sp.pretty(expr)

    # Check consistency
    if latex_output != latex_representation or pprint_output.strip() != pprint_representation:
        raise AssertionError("Inconsistent outputs detected")

def main():
    try:
        # First Case
        x = sp.symbols('x', positive=True)
        check_inconsistency(sp.exp(-x) * sp.log(x),
                            '\\frac{1}{e^{x}} \\log{\\left (x \\right )}',
                            " -x\nℯ  ⋅log(x)",
                            assumptions={'x': {'positive': True}})
        
        # Second Case without assumptions affecting printing
        x, y = sp.symbols('x y')
        check_inconsistency(1/(x + y)/2,
                            '\\frac{1}{2 x + 2 y}',
                            "    1\n─────────\n2⋅(x + y)")
    
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise   # Re-raise the exception to ensure the script exits as non-zero when issue exists

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script checks for the specific inconsistencies between LaTeX and pretty print outputs for the given expressions. If the output matches the expected (indicating the issue is resolved), the script will exit with code 0. Otherwise, it will raise an `AssertionError` showing the inconsistency, accompanied by a stack trace for better debugging.
