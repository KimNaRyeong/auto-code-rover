            "content": "To address the issue related to `plt.scatter` effectively, we need to find where `scatter` is implemented in the Matplotlib codebase. Given the provided APIs, the most straightforward approach is to locate the scatter method within the appropriate class. Since `plt.scatter` is likely a method of a plotting class, let's begin by searching for the `scatter` method directly in the entire codebase and also locate any relevant class that might contain this method. Additionally, because the issue mentions keyword arguments (`kwargs`) `linewidths`, `linewidth`, `edgecolors`, and `edgecolor`, it's beneficial to find instances where these are handled or checked. \n\nHere are the necessary API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"scatter\")` - This will help us locate the `scatter` method's definition.\n2. `search_code(\"linewidths\")` - To locate where `linewidths` is used or handled in the codebase.\n3. `search_code(\"linewidth\")` - Similarly, to find references to the singular form.\n4. `search_code(\"edgecolors\")` - To find where `edgecolors` is handled.\n5. `search_code(\"edgecolor\")` - To locate usage or handling of `edgecolor`."
