        "intended_behavior": "The existing functionality of the `scatter` method should be preserved while incorporating a parameter check to raise an error if both singular and plural forms of `linewidth(s)` and `edgecolor(s)` are specified by a user. This involves adding a check near the start of the method to detect the presence of these conflicting parameters and raise a ValueError with a message indicating that both forms cannot be used simultaneously. This validation should occur before any processing of the parameters takes place, ensuring that the API's behavior remains clear and predictable to the end-users, and downstream libraries can handle or avoid such conflicts in their usage of Matplotlib."
