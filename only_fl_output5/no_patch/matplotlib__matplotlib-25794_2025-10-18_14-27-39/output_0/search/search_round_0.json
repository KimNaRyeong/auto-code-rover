        "content": "<issue>Raise when both singular and plural scatter attributes are specified\n### Problem\n`plt.scatter` accepts both singular and plural forms of the `linewidth(s)` and `edgecolor(s)` attributes. The plural forms are documented in the function signature, but the singular forms actually take precedence if both are specified.\nThis adds some complexity for downstream libraries and confusion for their users (cf. https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues/2384).\n### Proposed Solution\nSmall change: Matplotlib could raise when both the singular and plural forms are specified.\nLarger change: I will confess that I don't know why the plural forms of the kwargs exist. If there's not a strong reason for the duplication, perhaps they could be deprecated, or at least \"formally discouraged\"?\n### Additional context and prior art\nScatter does a lot of argument checking on the `c`/`color` parameters (too much at times, \ud83d\ude09), so there's some local precedence for a lot of handholding. On the other hand, matplotlib generally doesn't raise when both long- and short-forms of kwargs are given `e.g. `edgecolor` and `ec`).\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue related to `plt.scatter` effectively, we need to find where `scatter` is implemented in the Matplotlib codebase. Given the provided APIs, the most straightforward approach is to locate the scatter method within the appropriate class. Since `plt.scatter` is likely a method of a plotting class, let's begin by searching for the `scatter` method directly in the entire codebase and also locate any relevant class that might contain this method. Additionally, because the issue mentions keyword arguments (`kwargs`) `linewidths`, `linewidth`, `edgecolors`, and `edgecolor`, it's beneficial to find instances where these are handled or checked. \n\nHere are the necessary API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"scatter\")` - This will help us locate the `scatter` method's definition.\n2. `search_code(\"linewidths\")` - To locate where `linewidths` is used or handled in the codebase.\n3. `search_code(\"linewidth\")` - Similarly, to find references to the singular form.\n4. `search_code(\"edgecolors\")` - To find where `edgecolors` is handled.\n5. `search_code(\"edgecolor\")` - To locate usage or handling of `edgecolor`."
