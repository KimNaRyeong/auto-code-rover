Look for the `manage.py` file since it's mentioned in the issue description, focusing on any available commands argument parsing.\n2. Search for any related classes or methods in the Django codebase that might be involved in the implementation of `diffsettings` command.\n\nBased on these steps, here are the specific API calls:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"diffsettings\", \"manage.py\")` to find if the `diffsettings` command is directly referenced or handled in `manage.py`.\n- `search_method(\"handle\")` as Django management commands usually define a `handle` method where the command's logic is implemented.\n- `search_class(\"Command\")` since Django management commands typically inherit from a `Command` class, and we might need to see its structure to understand how to extend or modify the behavior of `diffsettings`.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"add_arguments\", \"Command\")` to find out how arguments are currently added to commands, which could help in adding a new argument for specifying another settings module."
