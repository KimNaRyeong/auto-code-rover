This argument could be called `--default` or `--compare-to`, providing users the ability to compare their current settings against a module other than Django's default settings. The implementation should ensure that this new argument is processed correctly and passed along to where the settings comparison is actually performed."

        "intended_behavior": "The `handle` method needs to be extended to accept the argument introduced in `add_arguments`. It should conditionally load the specified settings module\u2019s settings if the new argument is provided and fall back to Django\u2019s default settings otherwise. The comparison logic would then compare the currently active settings against either the specified module's settings or the default ones, as appropriate. This allows for the preservation of existing functionality while introducing the capability to compare settings against a user-defined module."
