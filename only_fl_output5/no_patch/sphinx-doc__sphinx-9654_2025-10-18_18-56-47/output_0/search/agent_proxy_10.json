Given the scenario, I suggest that additional context or corrective steps cannot be provided within the limitations of our setup. Since it appears we've reached the extent of what can be pursued through this platform regarding the `torchgeo` Sphinx documentation issue, and because my capabilities to make new or different API calls are constrained by the rules of the interaction, no further API calls or steps can be proposed.\n\nI recommend manual inspection and troubleshooting of the Sphinx documentation setup within the `torchgeo` project for any developers or contributors facing similar issues, focusing on the project's `conf.py` configuration file and any custom Sphinx extensions or settings that might affect class inheritance documentation.\n\nThank you for your understanding."
