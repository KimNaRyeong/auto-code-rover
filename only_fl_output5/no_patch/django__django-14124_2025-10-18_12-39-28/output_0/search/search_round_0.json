The signature variable in this function is expected to match (request, exception) for all handlers except for handler500 which is expected to have only (request). A positional argument, template_name is also present.\nWhile using class based views, we get two positional arguments (self, request) and then it recieves *args and * *kwargs. The check is permitting other handlers as the number of arguments coincidentally match.\nI suggest a fix in the _check_custom_error_handlers which first checks if the handler* are function based or class based, and then it preceed the check with the appropriate number of arguments.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to inspect the Django framework's codebase, particularly the area around custom error handlers and their checks. The specific parts of interest are:\n1. The `_check_custom_error_handlers` function in `django/urls/resolver.py`, as mentioned in the issue description. This function seems to be central to the reported problem.\n2. We also need insight into how Django typically handles Class-Based Views (CBVs) to understand the expected signatures of such views and compare them against what `_check_custom_error_handlers` expects.\n3. The class `MyView` mentioned as being used for `handler404` and `handler500` could provide clues on how class-based views are being implemented in the user's project, but since it's a user-defined class, it might not be directly accessible through this interface.\n\nFirst, let's examine the `_check_custom_error_handlers` function to understand its current implementation and logic for checking handler signatures.\n\nNext, we'll look into any documentation or implementation details in Django that specify how Class-Based Views should handle requests and exceptions, especially in the context of being used as error handlers. This part might not be directly accessible through API calls here but understanding Django's expectations for CBV request handling is critical.\n\nBased on the described approach, I will execute the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"_check_custom_error_handlers\", \"django/urls/resolver.py\")` - This call aims to find the implementation details of the `_check_custom_error_handlers` method within the indicated file, to understand the logic that leads to the reported issue.\n\n2. `search_class(\"View\")` - Since most, if not all, Class-Based Views in Django inherit from `django.views.generic.View` or its subclasses, this call aims to gather information on how CBVs are structured, especially regarding their method signatures for handling requests.\n\nThese two calls should provide a good starting point for understanding the issue and considering possible patches."
