The signature variable in this function is expected to match (request, exception) for all handlers except for handler500 which is expected to have only (request). A positional argument, template_name is also present.\nWhile using class based views, we get two positional arguments (self, request) and then it recieves *args and * *kwargs. The check is permitting other handlers as the number of arguments coincidentally match.\nI suggest a fix in the _check_custom_error_handlers which first checks if the handler* are function based or class based, and then it preceed the check with the appropriate number of arguments.\n</issue>"

The specific parts of interest are:\n1. The `_check_custom_error_handlers` function in `django/urls/resolver.py`, as mentioned in the issue description. This function seems to be central to the reported problem.\n2. We also need insight into how Django typically handles Class-Based Views (CBVs) to understand the expected signatures of such views and compare them against what `_check_custom_error_handlers` expects.\n3. The class `MyView` mentioned as being used for `handler404` and `handler500` could provide clues on how class-based views are being implemented in the user's project, but since it's a user-defined class, it might not be directly accessible through this interface.\n\nFirst, let's examine the `_check_custom_error_handlers` function to understand its current implementation and logic for checking handler signatures.\n\nNext, we'll look into any documentation or implementation details in Django that specify how Class-Based Views should handle requests and exceptions, especially in the context of being used as error handlers. This part might not be directly accessible through API calls here but understanding Django's expectations for CBV request handling is critical.\n\nBased on the described approach, I will execute the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"_check_custom_error_handlers\", \"django/urls/resolver.py\")` - This call aims to find the implementation details of the `_check_custom_error_handlers` method within the indicated file, to understand the logic that leads to the reported issue.\n\n2. `search_class(\"View\")` - Since most, if not all, Class-Based Views in Django inherit from `django.views.generic.View` or its subclasses, this call aims to gather information on how CBVs are structured, especially regarding their method signatures for handling requests.\n\nThese two calls should provide a good starting point for understanding the issue and considering possible patches."

        "content": "Analyzing the context from the search results about the Django framework's handling of class-based views (CBVs) and the apparent absence of the mentioned method `_check_custom_error_handlers` in `django/urls/resolver.py`, let's delve into what we know and what steps we may need to take next:\n\n### Analysis of `View` Class in `django/views/generic/base.py`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `View` class from the search result serves as the base class for all class-based views in Django. It defines a basic structure for CBVs, including:\n- A set of HTTP method names that are supported by default.\n- An `__init__` method, which isn't displayed but is implied to be part of the class's structure.\n- The `as_view` class method, which is crucial for turning a CBV into a callable view that can be used in URLs.\n- The `setup`, `dispatch`, `http_method_not_allowed`, and `options` methods for handling HTTP requests.\n- A method for determining allowed HTTP methods.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nThe central piece here, the `as_view` method, is directly related to the issue. When a CBV is used as an error handler (like `handler404` or `handler500`), it's the `as_view()` method that converts the class into a view function Django can use. However, the issue mentions a mismatch in the expected arguments (`request`, possibly vs. `request, exception`), which hints that the way `dispatch` and consequently the entire class structure handles arguments may not align with what Django's error handling check expects for `handler500`.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nThe class should allow graceful handling of error scenarios, particularly when configured as `handler500`. The intended behavior would be to allow a CBV to serve as `handler500` without raising configuration errors regarding argument counts. Given the issue description, it seems that the system's expectations for a `handler500` method's arguments don't account for the class-based nature of the view.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the failure to locate `_check_custom_error_handlers` in `django/urls/resolver.py`, we need to reconsider our approach. It's possible there was a typo in the file path, the method name, or that the method resides in a different part of the Django codebase that deals with URL resolution or system checks. \n\n1. Since the initial search for `_check_custom_error_handlers` returned no results, it's worth considering alternative paths where this functionality might be implemented. We could search more broadly for the method across the codebase or look into other files related to URL configuration and error handling in Django.\n\n2. Additionally, a review of the Django documentation or source code related to error handlers (`handler404`, `handler500`, etc.) in the context of CBVs might offer some insights. Since direct API calls to this documentation or source code structure might not be possible here, a conceptual approach would involve looking into Django's system checks framework, which ensures user-defined error handlers meet specific criteria.\n\n### Alternative API Calls to Consider\nGiven the above analysis, the next step should ideally focus on locating the check system that raises the issue for `handler500`:\n- `search_method(\"_check_custom_error_handlers\")`: Broaden the search throughout the Django codebase to find where this method might be defined or used.\n- `search_code(\"System check identified some issues\")`: This can help locate where Django raises system check errors related to URL configurations, potentially leading us to how these checks are implemented and where the `handler500` specifics are validated.\n\nWithout direct access to the codebase origins or the ability to make additional API calls based on this theoretical approach, these steps are speculative but would follow a logical process based on typical debugging and code exploration strategies."

Since the explicit location of the bug in the Django framework related to handling `handler500` as a Class-Based View which raises a `SystemCheckError` could not be determined without the exact context or finding the `_check_custom_error_handlers` method or similar, no specific files, classes, and methods can be pinpointed as bug locations based on the provided and found information.\n\nHowever, based on the issue description and the general understanding of Django's operation, an intended behavior to resolve the issue can be conceptualized as follows:\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\n\nThe code responsible for executing system checks on custom error handlers, particularly `handler500`, should differentiate between function-based views and class-based views. This involves recognizing when a view is defined using `.as_view()` and accordingly adjusting the expectations for argument signatures to accommodate the inherent `self` parameter passed to class-based view methods.\n\n- **File**: Potentially within `django/urls/resolver.py` or a file responsible for system checks related to URL configurations.\n- **Class & Method**: The class or function that conducts system checks on custom handlers like `handler500`, possibly `_check_custom_error_handlers` or a similar validation function, requires adjustment.\n- **The adjustment**: It needs to incorporate logic that identifies a class-based view is being used as an error handler. Then, if it's class-based, the system should not raise an error when the view accepts `(self, request)` as its parameters, with allowances for `*args` and `**kwargs` for additional flexibility. Specifically for `handler500`, the system should validate that the view can indeed function with only the `request` parameter being explicitly handled, possibly by verifying if it is capable of responding without requiring an `exception` argument, which is not provided to `handler500` views by Django during runtime.\n\nThis tailored check aims to maintain Django's robust error handling and customisability, permitting developers to use class-based views for `handler500` without encountering system check errors due to argument count mismatches."
