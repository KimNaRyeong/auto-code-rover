        "content": "To gather sufficient context for addressing the reported issue, here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. Search for documentation or implementation details related to `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` in the `ModelAdmin` class. These are likely defined in Django's admin framework. Thus, we need to find where these are implemented or defined to understand how they currently work and identify where the system checks could be added or improved.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"filter_horizontal\", \"ModelAdmin\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"filter_vertical\", \"ModelAdmin\")\n   ```\n\n2. Look for any existing system checks in Django that relate to the `ManyToManyField`. This will help in understanding how system checks are currently implemented, especially in relation to model fields. This context is necessary for designing a new system check that would warn users about the unintended use of `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` with `ManyToManyField` having a custom through model.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"check\", \"ManyToManyField\")\n   ```\n\n3. Search for any code snippets that explicitly use `ManyToManyField(through=\"\")`. This can provide context on how these relationships are defined within the framework and could give insights into common patterns that could be checked for in the new system check.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"ManyToManyField(through=\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive view into how `filter_horizontal`, `filter_vertical`, and `ManyToManyField` with `through` parameter are implemented and used within Django. This information will be critical for developing an effective patch that addresses the reported issue."
