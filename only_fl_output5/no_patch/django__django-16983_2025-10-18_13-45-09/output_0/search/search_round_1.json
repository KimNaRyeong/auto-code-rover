Search for documentation or implementation details related to `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` in the `ModelAdmin` class. These are likely defined in Django's admin framework. Thus, we need to find where these are implemented or defined to understand how they currently work and identify where the system checks could be added or improved.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"filter_horizontal\", \"ModelAdmin\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"filter_vertical\", \"ModelAdmin\")\n   ```\n\n2. Look for any existing system checks in Django that relate to the `ManyToManyField`. This will help in understanding how system checks are currently implemented, especially in relation to model fields. This context is necessary for designing a new system check that would warn users about the unintended use of `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` with `ManyToManyField` having a custom through model.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"check\", \"ManyToManyField\")\n   ```\n\n3.

        "content": "Based on the results from the API calls, let's analyze the context collected:\n\n1. **`filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` in `ModelAdmin`**:\n   - The search for methods `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` in `ModelAdmin` returned no results. This implies that they are not methods but attributes used in the `ModelAdmin` class. In Django admin, `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` are attributes that specify fields where a horizontal or vertical filtering widget should be used in the admin interface, specifically for `ManyToManyField` relations. Given the issue reported, the misunderstanding seems to stem from these attributes' inability to support `ManyToManyField` with a custom through model.\n   \n   **Next steps based on analysis**: Since these are attributes, it's essential to look into the admin system checks where the validation of `ModelAdmin` configurations occurs. This will help us find a place where a new check could potentially be added to validate `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` usages.\n\n2. **`check` method in `ManyToManyField`**:\n   - The `check` method in `ManyToManyField`, found within `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, performs various checks to ensure the field is configured correctly. These checks include uniqueness validation, relationship model checks, ignored options verifications, and table uniqueness checks among others.\n   \n   **Relationship to the bug**: The issue at hand concerns the `ManyToManyField` when it's utilized with a custom `through` model alongside `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical`, which is apparently not covered in these checks or is not clearly documented. The presence of a `check` method already performing validations means it could be an appropriate place to add a new validation concerning the usage of `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` with `through`.\n\n   **Intended behavior**: Based on the issue, the intended behavior would be for Django to provide feedback (via system checks) when a developer attempts to use `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` with a `ManyToManyField` that declares a custom intermediary model. This new check would guide developers away from this configuration, preventing confusion and potential runtime issues.\n\nGiven this context and analysis:\n\n- It is apparent that to address the reported issue, we should focus on enhancing the system checks within the `ManyToManyField` class and possibly within the admin system checks that involve `ModelAdmin` configurations.\n- Since `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` are attributes rather than methods, we should look for their processing or validation mechanisms within the system checks related to `ModelAdmin` or the broader admin configuration checks to identify where our new validation logic could be seamlessly integrated.\n\n**Next steps based on analysis**:\n\n- Investigate how `ModelAdmin` attributes are validated within the Django admin system checks framework. This can involve looking for a method or function that processes or checks the configuration of `ModelAdmin` instances, including attributes like `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical`.\n\n  ```python\n  search_method(\"check\")\n  search_code(\"ModelAdmin\")\n  ```\n\nThese steps aim to find where the logic for validating `ModelAdmin` configurations resides, which in turn could inform us about potential insertion points for our new validation logic concerning `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` usage with `ManyToManyField` having a custom through model."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

However, we lack direct insight into where `ModelAdmin` attributes like `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` are validated or how `ModelAdmin` configurations are checked in the admin framework. This context is crucial for precisely locating where to add the new system check. Therefore, it would be beneficial to perform one more round of search focusing on `ModelAdmin` and potentially system checks related to admin configuration. Here are the API calls that could provide this missing context:\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"system checks ModelAdmin\")\nsearch_code(\"admin check framework\")\n```\n\n2. **Where are bug locations**:\n\n- **Location 1:**\n  - **File**: `django/db/models/fields/related.py`\n  - **Class**: `ManyToManyField`\n  - **Method**: `check`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: This method should include a new validation check that ensures `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` is not used with `ManyToManyField` configured with a custom through model. This check should generate a warning or error within the Django system checks framework if such a configuration is detected, guiding developers to avoid this unsupported setup. This preserves the existing functionality of ensuring `ManyToManyField` configurations are valid but extends it to catch this specific misuse.\n\n- **Location 2**:\n  - **Intended location**: We need to find where `ModelAdmin` configurations are validated, specifically concerning `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical`. The exact file and class are not identified yet due to the current lack of direct context. However, the intended behavior at this location would be to extend the validation logic (or add new if none exists specifically for these attributes) to ensure they are compatible with the fields they are configured to manage, explicitly checking against the unsupported `ManyToManyField` with a custom `through` attribute. \n\nGiven the current context, further analysis is needed to accurately identify the second bug location related to `ModelAdmin`. The suggested additional search queries aim to fill this gap."
