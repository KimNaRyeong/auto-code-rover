Since the direct relationship between ManyToManyField instances and ModelAdmin instances might not be straightforward to establish within this context, the feasible approach is to issue a guideline or warning in the Django documentation or framework messages indicating the incompatibility of filter_horizontal and filter_vertical with ManyToManyField(through=\"...\")."
