However, `type(BaseClass.baseclass_class_property)` returns the type of the returned object, since essentially, a `@classmethod@property` ends up behaving like a class attribute. So Sphinx doesn't really have a chance to extract the docstring.\n**EDIT 2:** Seems like this will get fixed in python 3.10, cf. https://bugs.python.org/issue43682.\n> Static methods (`@staticmethod`) and class methods (`@classmethod`) now inherit the method attributes (`__module__`, `__name__`, `__qualname__`, `__doc__`, `__annotations__`) and have a new __wrapped__ attribute.\nI will try to test this with the beta release.\n-----\n### Describe the bug\n> Changed in version 3.9: Class methods can now wrap other descriptors such as property().\nThat is, since python version 3.9 we can write code like\n```python\nclass A:\n@classmethod\n@property\ndef f(cls):\n\"\"\"Some class property.\"\"\"\nreturn \"property\"\n```\nHowever, sphinx does not seem to document any such methods (regular `@property` decorated methods get documented just fine.)\n### How to Reproduce\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/randolf-scholz/sphinx_demo\ncd sphinx_demo/docs\nmake html\n# open _build/html/dummy_module.submodule.html\n```\nThe following methods were erroneously not documented:\n- `MetaClass.metaclass_class_property`\n- `MetaClass.metaclass_abstract_class_property`\n- `BaseClass.baseclass_class_property`\n- `BaseClass.baseclass_abstract_class_property`\n- `SubClass.subclass_class_property`\n- `SubClass.subclass_abstract_class_property`\n### Expected behavior\nMethods that are decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property` should be documented appropriately.\n### Your project\nhttps://github.com/randolf-scholz/sphinx_demo\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nUbuntu 20.04.2 LTS\n### Python version\n3.9.6\n### Sphinx version\n4.0.3\n### Sphinx extensions\nsphinx.ext.autodoc, sphinx.ext.autosummary\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

The inability to find these classes and methods could imply that either those components are dynamically generated, exist in a less standard or unconventional file structure, or possibly, that there's a misunderstanding or typo in the reported class and method names. Given the nature of Sphinx and its operation on static files, it's also possible we need to look at how the Sphinx documentation is configured.\n\nGiven the lack of direct results, we should consider alternative strategies to understand the context and structure of the project concerning the reported issue. Here are some next steps we can take:\n\n1. **Examine Sphinx Configuration:** Since the issue is with Sphinx documentation generation, examining the Sphinx configuration file (`conf.py`) might provide insights into how the documentation is set up, including any custom Sphinx extensions or configurations that might affect the documentation of class methods decorated with `@classmethod` and `@property`.\n   \n2. **Investigate Documentation Generation Process:** Understanding how the Sphinx `autodoc` extension is being used to generate documentation for the project could reveal why these decorated methods are not being documented. This may involve looking at the directives used in the `.rst` files within the `docs` directory.\n\n3. **Search for Sphinx Extension Usage:** Given that the issue mentions a specific behavior change in Python 3.9 and 3.10 regarding `@classmethod` and `@property`, checking how custom or third-party Sphinx extensions might interact with these Python features could be informative. It's possible a custom extension or a specific setup in the project is needed to handle these cases.\n\nConsidering these strategies, let's make some additional API calls to gather more context:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"conf.py\", \"docs/sphinx_demo/conf.py\")`: Search for the Sphinx configuration file to understand how the documentation is built.\n- `search_code(\"autodoc\")`: Search for any mention of the `autodoc` Sphinx extension which is commonly used for documenting Python codebases.\n- `search_code(\".rst\")`: Search for reStructuredText (`.rst`) files or references, as these files commonly contain directives for Sphinx documentation.\n\nThese searches aim to gather more information about the Sphinx setup and any custom handling that may affect the documentation of methods decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property`."

However, based on the description of the issue and the general knowledge of how Sphinx, Python decorators, and document generation work, I can make hypothetical assumptions about potential bug locations and the intended behavior needed to resolve the issue.\n\n### Hypothetical Bug Locations and Intended Behaviors\n\n1. **Bug Location:** It seems there might be misconfiguration or a lack of specific handling in the Sphinx documentation setup, especially related to how `@classmethod` and `@property` decorators are interpreted when used together. However, without direct evidence from the project's Sphinx configuration (`conf.py`) or the Python source files, specific file names, classes, and methods cannot be provided.\n\n2. **Intended Behavior:** The intended behavior would involve ensuring that Sphinx is correctly identifying and documenting methods decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property`. This could potentially require either or both of the following:\n   - **Modification to Sphinx Configuration (`conf.py`):** Ensure that Sphinx is configured to recognize and document Python decorators correctly, especially when used in combination. This might involve customizing the `autodoc` settings or using a specific Sphinx extension designed to handle this case.\n   - **Adjustments to Source Code or Use of Sphinx Extensions:** In cases where upgrading the Python version to 3.10 or above (which includes fixes that could potentially resolve the issue as mentioned in the bug description) is not feasible, ensuring that any custom workaround or adaptations are in place within the project could be necessary. This might include creating custom Sphinx extensions or decorators that facilitate the correct documentation of these methods.\n\nDue to the lack of direct access to the codebase or the specific configurations used within the Sphinx documentation setup for this project, these assumptions about bug locations and intended behavior remain speculative. Further investigations or access to the project's source code and Sphinx setup would be necessary to provide a concrete and actionable resolution to the reported issue."

These snippets are found in specific files such as `doc/conf.py` and various example extensions (`recipe.py`, `todo.py`, `helloworld.py`). \n\n2. **Use of `.rst` Files:**\n   - The extensive appearance of `.rst` files across several directories hints at a comprehensive documentation structure that likely utilizes Sphinx's reStructuredText capabilities for documentation. These files could contain directives or references that are pivotal for auto-documentation processes.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Custom Setup Configurations (Sphinx Extensions):**\n   - The files unearthed through `def setup(app):` signify custom configurations or extensions possibly crafted to augment or modify Sphinx's documentation process. \n   - **Relationship to Bug:** If these custom setups or extensions influence how Sphinx processes Python decorators, they might be directly related to the issue of Sphinx failing to document `@classmethod` and `@property` decorated methods.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** These setups should be configured or modified to ensure Sphinx correctly identifies and documents methods with the aforementioned decorators. This might involve either changing how Sphinx introspects these methods or explicitly instructing Sphinx to document them as properties of the class.\n\n2. **Documentation Sources and Structure (.rst Files):**\n   - The widespread presence of `.rst` files indicates the structure and sources of Sphinx documentation within the project. These files could define the scope of documentation or include specific Sphinx directives that influence documentation generation.\n   - **Relationship to Bug:** If certain `.rst` files or their contents are responsible for dictating which elements of the codebase are documented, any omissions or misconfigurations could lead to the observed issue.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Ensure `.rst` files include or reference the classes and methods in question, potentially using Sphinx directives such as `.. autoclass::` or `.. autoattribute::` to explicitly document the decorated methods.\n\n### Suggestions for Further Actions\n\nGiven this analysis, further action should focus on reviewing and possibly adjusting:\n- **`doc/conf.py`:** Inspect this file for custom Sphinx configurations related to autodocumenting decorators. Look for extensions settings or hooks that could be modified to include `@classmethod` and `@property` decorated methods.\n- **Custom Extensions:** Examine the custom extensions (`recipe.py`, `todo.py`, `helloworld.py`) for logic that could be influencing how decorated methods are treated. Adjustments here might be necessary to ensure comprehensive documentation.\n- **.rst Documentation:** Review the directives used in `.rst` files closely to ensure they are correctly instructing Sphinx to document the relevant classes and their decorated methods.\n\nThis approach aims to tackle the issue holistically by considering both the customization of Sphinx through extensions and the explicit documentation directives found within `.rst` files."
