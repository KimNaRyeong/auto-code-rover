If the child class has the `__init__` method (using typed parameters) and I try to reassign the attribute from `Generic` class I got the following error:\n```text\nWARNING: :1: (WARNING/2) Field list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.\n```\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n```\n$ git clone git@github.com:dry-python/returns.git\n$ cd returns\n$ poetry install\n$ cd docs\n$ poetry run make html\n```\nCode example:\n* Python script\n```python\nfrom typing import (\nClassVar,\nType,\nTypeVar,\nGeneric,\n)\n_ValueType = TypeVar('_ValueType')\nclass MyGeneric(Generic[_ValueType]):\n#: Doc comment example.\nsome_type: ClassVar[Type['MyGenericChild']]\nclass MyGenericChild(MyGeneric[_ValueType]):\ndef __init__(self, inner_value: _ValueType) -> None:\npass\nMyGeneric.some_type = MyGenericChild\n```\n* rst\n```rst\n.. test:\nTest\n====\n.. automodule:: lib.test\n:members:\n```\nIf you try to modify something in the script maybe the error will not appear, it's a very specific corner case!\n**Expected behavior**\nThe warning should not appear!\n**Your project**\n[returns](https://github.com/dry-python/returns)\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Linux 5.7.9-1-MANJARO\n- Python version: 3.8.3\n- Sphinx version: 3.1.1\n- Sphinx extensions:\n```text\nsphinx.ext.autodoc\nsphinx.ext.doctest\nsphinx.ext.todo\nsphinx.ext.coverage\nsphinx.ext.viewcode\nsphinx.ext.autosummary\nsphinx.ext.napoleon\nm2r\nsphinx_autodoc_typehints\nsphinxcontrib.mermaid\nhoverxref.extension\n```\n---\nrelated issue https://github.com/dry-python/returns/issues/568\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue efficiently and provide a comprehensive context for resolving the bug related to Sphinx documentation in a Python project with generics, we will perform a series of targeted searches. The objective is to understand how the `Generic` class and its subclass `MyGeneric` and `MyGenericChild` are used within the project, especially relating to the documentation comments that seem to cause Sphinx warnings.\n\n1. **Investigate the `MyGeneric` and `MyGenericChild` Classes**: As the issue describes a problem related to these two classes, it's critical to find the definitions and usages of these classes within the project. This will provide insight into their implementation and how they interact with the Sphinx documentation tools.\n\n   - `search_class(\"MyGeneric\")`\n   - `search_class(\"MyGenericChild\")`\n\n2. **Search for `__init__` Method in `MyGenericChild` Class**: Since the issue mentions a problem when the child class (`MyGenericChild`) defines an `__init__` method, obtaining the implementation details of this method is essential.\n\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"MyGenericChild\")`\n\n3. **Review Documentation Comments**: Given that the issue is triggered by the documentation comments, analyzing how these comments are written and related to the problematic attribute might reveal practices leading to Sphinx warnings. Specifically, we need to examine comments for the `some_type` attribute in the `MyGeneric` class.\n\n   - `search_code(\"some_type: ClassVar[Type['MyGenericChild']]\")`\n\n4. **Analyze Sphinx Configuration**: Since the behavior is observed during the Sphinx documentation generation process, reviewing the Sphinx configuration used within the `returns` project might be beneficial. It could reveal specific settings or extensions that are relevant to the issue.\n\n   - `search_file(\"conf.py\")` in the Sphinx documentation directory (assuming this API exists or using a similar API command adjusted according to available options to target Sphinx's `conf.py`).\n\nThese searches aim to gather comprehensive context around the usage of generic classes and documentation within the project, focusing on areas most likely to be related to the documentation generation issues reported. This context will be pivotal in determining the root cause of the Sphinx warning and formulating a fix."
