Given the nature of the issue being specific to the interaction between Sphinx and Python code, particularly how Sphinx processes doc comments in generics and class extensions, directly reproducing the issue and capturing the Sphinx warning through a standalone Python execution script is not feasible. The original problem occurs during the Sphinx documentation generation process, not during Python runtime. However, the initial intent can be reformulated to script an approach that attempts to programmatically trigger the Sphinx build process, capturing its output for analysis. This approach still doesn't fit within the simple execution context described but would involve programmatically running Sphinx and checking its output for the specific warning.

Below is a conceptual Python script intended to run Sphinx programmatically and check for the presence of the described warning. Because the original task's context doesn't exactly align with programmatically handling Sphinx output, the script serves more as a conceptual approach rather than a precise solution. 

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_sphinx_build():
    try:
        # This is a simplified way to call Sphinx build from Python. 
        # You should adjust the paths and options according to your project's setup.
        result = subprocess.run(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', './docs', './docs/_build/html'], capture_output=True, text=True)
        output = result.stdout + result.stderr

        # Check for the specific Sphinx warning.
        if "WARNING: :1: (WARNING/2) Field list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent." in output:
            raise AssertionError("Issue detected: Sphinx warning related to doc comments with generics.")

        print("No issue detected. Sphinx build completed without the specific warning.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("AssertionError occurred. Printing stack trace...")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Indicate failure
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred. Printing stack trace...")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Indicate failure

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_sphinx_build()
```

**Note:**
This script attempts to invoke the Sphinx build process, capturing its output to search for the specific warning message. However, depending on your project's specific configuration (paths, Sphinx setup, etc.), adjustments will be necessary. Moreover, executing Sphinx builds programmatically requires the Sphinx environment to be properly configured and may not be as straightforward in isolated or controlled environments. 

This pattern provides insight into how Python can be used to script and automate the detection of specific conditions in build processes or output logs, although it diverges from executing simple Python code to directly reproduce behavior observed during Sphinx documentation generation.
