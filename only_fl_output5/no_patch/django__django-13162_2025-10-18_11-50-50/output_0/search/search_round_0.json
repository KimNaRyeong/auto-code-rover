For example:\n0003_merge_20160102_0304.py\nThis name is more opaque than necessary. When one reads it, it isn't immediately clear which migrations were merged. One must inspect the file to find that information.\nInstead, I suggest the default filename should be created by combining the files being merged. This way, it includes the information without requiring one to inspect the file. This information is also useful in the migrate command's output. As it is most likely to merge two migrations files, this should remain a reasonable length.\nFor example:\n0003_merge_0002_conflicting_second_0002_second.py\nIf preferable, we could decide to join the names in other ways too. For example, separate names by __ (two underscores) or exclude prefix numbers. To start, I'll go with the easiest approach unless there is strong preference for a different naming scheme.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to find the relevant parts of the codebase where merge migration filenames are generated. This involves locating the method that handles the generation of filenames for migrations and understanding how the current timestamp-based naming is implemented. Subsequently, we can explore how to modify this to include the names of the migrations being merged.\n\nBased on the description, it seems like we're dealing with a system that handles database migrations, possibly in a Django-like framework where migrations are named based on their sequence and purpose, with merge migrations being a special case.\n\nGiven this, the necessary steps might include:\n1. Finding the class or module where migration filenames are generated.\n2. Identifying the specific method within that class or module responsible for naming merge migrations.\n3. Understanding the current implementation to see how it uses timestamps.\n4. Finding how migration files are identified or named, to see if there's a pattern or specific method that assigns names to regular (non-merge) migrations.\n\nTo start with, we don't have explicit class or method names to look for, as the issue description doesn't provide these. However, we can make some educated guesses for the search:\n\n- The process is likely handled in a class dedicated to migrations; names like `Migration`, `Migrations`, or `MigrationUtils` are common.\n- The method responsible for naming might include terms like `generate`, `name`, or `filename`, possibly combined with `merge`.\n\nGiven this, let's proceed with the following API calls for an initial search:\n\n1. Search for a broad term related to the codebase structure regarding migration management. We're looking for classes first, assuming that the naming functionality would be encapsulated within a class method.\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class(\"Migrations\")\n```\n\n2. Since we're not sure about the exact naming convention or method names used for the filename generation, let's look for code snippets that mention \"merge\" and \"filename\" or \"timestamp\" in the context of migrations. This broad search might give us leads on specific files or methods to target:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_code(\"merge migration filename\")\nsearch_code(\"timestamp\")\n```\n\nAlthough these steps will not directly resolve the issue, they're aimed at narrowing down the search to find the exact location(s) in the codebase that need modification. After identifying the pertinent class and method, we can refine our search or proceed to modify the code accordingly."
