For example:\n0003_merge_20160102_0304.py\nThis name is more opaque than necessary. When one reads it, it isn't immediately clear which migrations were merged. One must inspect the file to find that information.\nInstead, I suggest the default filename should be created by combining the files being merged. This way, it includes the information without requiring one to inspect the file. This information is also useful in the migrate command's output. As it is most likely to merge two migrations files, this should remain a reasonable length.\nFor example:\n0003_merge_0002_conflicting_second_0002_second.py\nIf preferable, we could decide to join the names in other ways too. For example, separate names by __ (two underscores) or exclude prefix numbers. To start, I'll go with the easiest approach unless there is strong preference for a different naming scheme.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to find the relevant parts of the codebase where merge migration filenames are generated. This involves locating the method that handles the generation of filenames for migrations and understanding how the current timestamp-based naming is implemented. Subsequently, we can explore how to modify this to include the names of the migrations being merged.\n\nBased on the description, it seems like we're dealing with a system that handles database migrations, possibly in a Django-like framework where migrations are named based on their sequence and purpose, with merge migrations being a special case.\n\nGiven this, the necessary steps might include:\n1. Finding the class or module where migration filenames are generated.\n2. Identifying the specific method within that class or module responsible for naming merge migrations.\n3. Understanding the current implementation to see how it uses timestamps.\n4. Finding how migration files are identified or named, to see if there's a pattern or specific method that assigns names to regular (non-merge) migrations.\n\nTo start with, we don't have explicit class or method names to look for, as the issue description doesn't provide these. However, we can make some educated guesses for the search:\n\n- The process is likely handled in a class dedicated to migrations; names like `Migration`, `Migrations`, or `MigrationUtils` are common.\n- The method responsible for naming might include terms like `generate`, `name`, or `filename`, possibly combined with `merge`.\n\nGiven this, let's proceed with the following API calls for an initial search:\n\n1. Search for a broad term related to the codebase structure regarding migration management. We're looking for classes first, assuming that the naming functionality would be encapsulated within a class method.\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class(\"Migrations\")\n```\n\n2. Since we're not sure about the exact naming convention or method names used for the filename generation, let's look for code snippets that mention \"merge\" and \"filename\" or \"timestamp\" in the context of migrations. This broad search might give us leads on specific files or methods to target:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_code(\"merge migration filename\")\nsearch_code(\"timestamp\")\n```\n\nAlthough these steps will not directly resolve the issue, they're aimed at narrowing down the search to find the exact location(s) in the codebase that need modification. After identifying the pertinent class and method, we can refine our search or proceed to modify the code accordingly."

However, the search for \"timestamp\" has pinpointed several files that could be of interest, particularly within the context of migrations and their naming conventions in a Django-like environment.\n\nFrom the files listed, those under `django/db/migrations/` are most relevant to our issue:\n- `writer.py`\n- `utils.py`\n- `migration.py`\n\n**1. What these parts of the code do**:\n- `writer.py`: Likely involved in writing or generating the migration files, including their filenames. This file could contain the logic for naming migrations, possibly where the timestamp format is defined and applied.\n- `utils.py`: This could host utility functions related to migrations, possibly including helper methods that are used in the process of generating migration filenames or handling timestamp data.\n- `migration.py`: Likely defines the structure or base class for migrations, including properties like the migration's name, dependencies, and possibly methods related to merging migrations.\n\n**2. The relationship between these parts and the bug**:\nThe bug concerns improving the default naming scheme of merge migrations to include more descriptive identifiers instead of just a timestamp. The files identified, specifically `writer.py` and potentially `utils.py`, are where the current naming scheme is implemented and therefore are directly related to where changes need to be made to address the issue.\n\n**3. The intended behavior of these parts of the code**:\n- For `writer.py`, the intended behavior would be to adjust its filename generation logic for merge migrations so that the filename reflects the names of the migrations being merged, rather than simply using a timestamp.\n- For `utils.py`, if it contains utility functions for filename generation or timestamp handling in the context of migrations, its intended behavior might need to be modified to support or facilitate the new naming convention.\n- `migration.py` might require adjustments if the new naming scheme affects how merge migrations are identified, instantiated, or handled within the migration workflow.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps would involve a closer inspection of these files to pinpoint where the filename generation logic for merge migrations is implemented. Specifically, focusing on `writer.py` seems promising, as it likely contains the core functionality for generating migration filenames.\n\nTo proceed, we can make the following API calls:\n1. Examine `writer.py` to find methods related to filename generation:\n```plaintext\nsearch_code_in_file(\"merge\", \"django/db/migrations/writer.py\")\nsearch_code_in_file(\"filename\", \"django/db/migrations/writer.py\")\n```\n2. Look into `migration.py` to see how merge migrations are defined or handled, which may give clues on how the names are set:\n```plaintext\nsearch_code_in_file(\"merge\", \"django/db/migrations/migration.py\")\n```\n\nThis approach should provide enough context to start formulating a strategy for implementing the suggested improvement to merge migration filenames."

Currently, this method likely generates names based on a timestamp. The new implementation should construct filenames by combining the names of the migrations being merged, ensuring the generated name provides clearer insight into the nature of the merge without needing to inspect the file's content. This change must preserve the ability to uniquely identify each migration, potentially by including a simplified timestamp or sequence number to handle cases where the same migrations are merged more than once or in different orders.\n\n**Bug Location 2:**\n- File: `django/db/migrations/migration.py`\n- Although this location may not directly relate to the generation of filenames, adjustments here might be necessary to support or enhance the clarity of merge migration naming. For instance, if this file contains representations (classes or methods) that manage how migrations are identified or interacted with, ensuring these structures can handle, recognize, and work with the new naming scheme is crucial. The intended behavior would ensure that any changes to naming conventions do not disrupt the functionality of migrations, such as applying, rolling back, or listing migrations.\n\nIn both cases, the existing functionality to handle migrations, identify them, and perform database schema changes must be preserved. The enhancement should be focused solely on improving clarity and understanding of merge migration filenames for developers and system administrators interacting with the migrations."
