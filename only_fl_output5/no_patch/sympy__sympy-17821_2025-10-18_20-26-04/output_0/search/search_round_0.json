In many cases we could generate those equations ourselves instead of typing them manually (I found errors while doing #11014 for example).\nThis PR should demonstrate the idea.  @asmeurer what do you think?  Will this work?  Its certainly nice for maintainance, although it is probably slightly less readable...\n(If we want to do this widely, the latex printer could probably be optimized for things like `^{2}` and when it uses `\\left(` instead of `(`.)\n#### Release notes\n* core\n* Catalan can be rewritten as a sum\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, I need to gather context about the `Catalan` and its possible interaction with `Sum`, as well as understand how LaTeX equations are currently being handled within the documentation. This involves exploring the implementation of `Catalan`, searching for any existing method that might relate to `rewrite` functionality, and examining how LaTeX equations are generated or embedded within the docs.\n\nHere are the API calls I would make to gather more context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Catalan\")` - To find the implementation details or any references of the `Catalan` class in the codebase.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"rewrite\", \"Catalan\")` - To check if there's already a `rewrite` method in the `Catalan` class that can be extended or modified.\n3. `search_code(\"latex\")` - To find instances where LaTeX is being generated or used within the docs to understand the current approach and how equations are incorporated.\n\nThese calls should help in understanding both the implementation details required for `Catalan.rewrite(Sum)` and how LaTeX equations are managed, providing a starting point for implementing the changes requested in the issue."
