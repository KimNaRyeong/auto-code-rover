This involves exploring the implementation of `Catalan`, searching for any existing method that might relate to `rewrite` functionality, and examining how LaTeX equations are generated or embedded within the docs.\n\nHere are the API calls I would make to gather more context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Catalan\")` - To find the implementation details or any references of the `Catalan` class in the codebase.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"rewrite\", \"Catalan\")` - To check if there's already a `rewrite` method in the `Catalan` class that can be extended or modified.\n3. `search_code(\"latex\")` - To find instances where LaTeX is being generated or used within the docs to understand the current approach and how equations are incorporated.\n\nThese calls should help in understanding both the implementation details required for `Catalan.rewrite(Sum)` and how LaTeX equations are managed, providing a starting point for implementing the changes requested in the issue."
