        "intended_behavior": "The `__init__` method of `ExpressionWrapper` should ensure that when an `output_field` is provided, it is correctly utilized throughout the expression handling, particularly in combined expressions where field types might differ. This includes enforcing consistency in how `output_field` is respected by subsequent operations or annotations that use the wrapped expression. If an explicit `output_field` cannot be honored due to type conflicts in combined expressions, clear and informative error handling should guide the developer towards resolving the issue."

        "intended_behavior": "This method should have enhanced logic to handle scenarios where expressions involve mixed field types, particularly those that cannot be automatically resolved to a common type (e.g., `IntegerField` and `AutoField`). When `output_field` is explicitly provided, this setting should preempt and resolve any conflicts arising from mixed types within an expression. If automatic resolution is not possible due to ambiguity or conflict between mixed types, it should either fallback to the explicit `output_field` provided or raise an error that explicitly states the need for an `output_field` declaration by the developer. This approach will safeguard against regressive behavior between different Django versions and ensure consistency in handling mixed-type expressions."
