        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search API calls, let's focus on understanding how `ExpressionWrapper`, `F`, `_resolve_output_field`, `select_format`, and the use of `output_field` in the codebase relate to the issue described. Here\u2019s a detailed analysis:\n\n### ExpressionWrapper and F\n\n1. **What they do:** `ExpressionWrapper` is a class that wraps expressions, allowing them to have an explicit `output_field` which is necessary when Django's ORM cannot automatically determine the output field type. `F` expressions are used to refer to model field values within queries. They are part of Django's mechanism for creating complex queries that involve operations on model fields without resorting to raw SQL.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:** The issue arises when performing operations between different field types (`IntegerField` and `AutoField` in this case) without specifying an explicit `output_field`. This leads to Django throwing an exception because it cannot determine the appropriate output field type for the combined expression.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:** The intended behavior would be for `ExpressionWrapper` to handle combined expressions involving different field types gracefully when an `output_field` is explicitly specified, and not lose or mismatch this information leading to a `FieldError`. This implies that `ExpressionWrapper` and `F` should work in tandem to ensure that the output of the operation they define is correctly typed according to the explicit or inferred `output_field`.\n\n### _resolve_output_field\n\n1. **What it does:** This method likely plays a critical role in determining the output field type of an expression when it is not explicitly provided. It probably attempts to infer the type based on the combined expression's components.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:** The error message in the issue points directly to `_resolve_output_field`, suggesting that it is unable to correctly infer the output field type for the combined expression. This could be because the method does not have a clear strategy for handling operations between different model field types without an explicit `output_field`.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:** `_resolve_output_field` should either correctly infer the output field type for combined field operations or enforce the need for an explicit `output_field` in cases where automatic inference is not possible. For the reported bug, this function should ideally identify that the operation's result cannot be inferred straightforwardly from `IntegerField` and `AutoField` and require an explicit `output_field`.\n\n### select_format\n\n1. **What it does:** `select_format` seems to be related to how expressions are converted into their SQL representation, including how the output fields are formatted in a `SELECT` statement.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:** The stack trace mentions checking for `select_format` capabilities on `output_field`, implying a potential issue in how expressions involving mixed field types are handled in SQL queries. The problem might lie in the method's handling (or the lack thereof) of mixed types without an explicitly defined `output_field`.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:** When `select_format` is called on an expression, it should correctly handle and format the SQL output according to the `output_field` specified. In the issue's context, it means that the method should respect and correctly apply the explicit `output_field` throughout the query building process, ensuring that the final SQL query is correctly typed and formed.\n\n### Use of output_field in the codebase\n\nThe widespread references to `output_field` across the codebase hint at its importance in Django's ORM layer. The issue's nature suggests a potential gap or regression in how output fields are determined or applied in complex expressions or when transitioning between different versions of Django (from 3.0.8 to 3.2 as mentioned).\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven this analysis, to further isolate and address the bug, a closer examination of the implementations within `expressions.py` for `ExpressionWrapper`, the behavior and interaction between `ExpressionWrapper` and `F` regarding `output_field`, and a detailed review of `_resolve_output_field`'s logic in handling mixed types are necessary. Additionally, understanding the internal workings of `select_format` and ensuring it correctly applies `output_field` even in complex query scenarios would be pivotal steps. These investigations should clarify whether there's a regression or a need for more explicit usage instructions for `output_field` in Django 3.2."

This includes enforcing consistency in how `output_field` is respected by subsequent operations or annotations that use the wrapped expression. If an explicit `output_field` cannot be honored due to type conflicts in combined expressions, clear and informative error handling should guide the developer towards resolving the issue.\n\n### Bug Location 2:\n- **File:** django/db/models/expressions.py\n- **Class:** Expression\n- **Method:** `_resolve_output_field`\n\n**Intended Behavior:** This method should have enhanced logic to handle scenarios where expressions involve mixed field types, particularly those that cannot be automatically resolved to a common type (e.g., `IntegerField` and `AutoField`). When `output_field` is explicitly provided, this setting should preempt and resolve any conflicts arising from mixed types within an expression. If automatic resolution is not possible due to ambiguity or conflict between mixed types, it should either fallback to the explicit `output_field` provided or raise an error that explicitly states the need for an `output_field` declaration by the developer. This approach will safeguard against regressive behavior between different Django versions and ensure consistency in handling mixed-type expressions."
