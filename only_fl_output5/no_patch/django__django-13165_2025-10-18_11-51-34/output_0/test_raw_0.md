Below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that reproduces the described issue. This script creates a minimal Django environment, defines a `Mallets` model similar to the one stated, and then executes the query that leads to the problem. If the issue is present, the script will catch the exception, print a detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function, and assert to ensure the condition is met for the reproduction scenario. When the issue is fixed, it should not raise an `AssertionError` and should exit with code 0.

This script sets up a minimal Django configuration, defines the models directly within the script for simplicity and isolation, and then attempts the problematic query to reproduce the `FieldError` described. The script adjusts for a potential misinterpretation in the original description where `Sum` was used instead of `Avg` in one instance, focusing on reproducing the error as described with `ExpressionWrapper`.

Please ensure Django is installed and available in your Python environment before running this script. Adjustments may be required based on the specific versions of Django and Python you are using, as well as considering any future fixes that might address this issue after the provided knowledge cut-off date.
