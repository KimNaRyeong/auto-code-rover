For this purpose, the necessary steps include:\n\n1. **Find where the `Row` class is declared** to understand its structure and why it can't be pickled.\n2. **Examine the implementation of `values_list`** when the `named=True` parameter is used, specifically how it returns an instance of `django.db.models.query.Row`.\n3. **Explore how `Row` instances are being created** and why they might be failing to pickle.\n\nBased on these steps, here are the API calls we need to make:\n\n- `search_class(\"Row\")`: To find the declaration and implementation of the `Row` class.\n- `search_method(\"values_list\")`: To understand how `values_list` works, especially when it's called with `named=True`.\n\nThese calls will provide the necessary context to start addressing the bug."
