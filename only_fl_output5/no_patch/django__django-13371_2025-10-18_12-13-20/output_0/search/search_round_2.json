When used with `flat=True`, it can only be called with one field, and it will return a flat list of that field rather than a list of tuples. When `named=True`, it should return named tuples, making the query results more readable by accessing values through names rather than positions.\n\n#### Relationship with the Bug\n\nThe reported issue is with objects returned by `values_list` when `named=True` being not pickleable. In the code, when `named` is set to `True`, the `_iterable_class` is set to `NamedValuesListIterable`, which suggests that the problem may lie with how instances of `NamedValuesListIterable` are created or handled, specifically regarding their ability to be pickled.\n\nGiven there's a `PicklingError` for `django.db.models.query.Row`, which is not directly mentioned in the provided code snippet, it implies that `NamedValuesListIterable` uses `Row` or a mechanism that dynamically creates a named tuple or a similar structure considered as `Row` somewhere else in the Django codebase.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\n\nThe intended behavior here is that when `values_list(named=True)` is called, it should return an instance or a set of instances that are easily serializable (pickleable) so that they can be cached or stored in sessions without causing serialization errors. \n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven that searching directly for the `Row` class returned no results and considering the nature of the `NamedValuesListIterable` and its relation to the issue, the next logical steps would be:\n\n1. **Search for `NamedValuesListIterable` class** to understand how it works, how it uses `Row`, and why `Row` instances can't be pickled. This will give insights into how named tuples are generated and might point to where the `Row` class or structure is defined or used.\n   \n2. **Search for any `__reduce__` method** within the Django models or query code that could explain how Django intends for these objects to be pickled. The `__reduce__` method is a special method in Python that defines custom pickling behavior.\n\n3. **Examine how caching mechanisms** (like in `cacheops` or Django's own caching framework) interact with query results to see if the issue could also be related to how these mechanisms attempt to serialize `Row` instances.\n\nTaking these analyses into account, the following API calls could help gather the necessary context:\n\n- `search_class(\"NamedValuesListIterable\")`: To explore how named tuples are being created/handled.\n- `search_code(\"__reduce__\")`: To find any custom serialization logic that could be related to `Row` instances."

However, the code snippet provided does not detail the implementation of `create_namedtuple_class` nor the `__iter__` method, which are critical for understanding how named tuples are generated and iterated over.\n\n#### Relationship with the Bug\n\nGiven the issue describes a problem with the pickleability of the `Row` objects generated by `NamedValuesListIterable` (through `values_list` method of `QuerySet` with `named=True`), it implies a connection to how `NamedValuesListIterable` creates and uses these `Row` objects. The bug is likely related to the dynamic nature of the `Row` objects or named tuples generated by `NamedValuesListIterable` and their incompatibility with Python's pickle module.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\n\nThe intended behavior of `NamedValuesListIterable` should be to generate named tuple classes that are fully pickleable. This means ensuring that the dynamically created namedtuple (or `Row`) classes include all necessary serialization information, possibly by implementing custom serialization methods (`__getstate__`, `__setstate__`, or `__reduce__`) if the default behavior is not sufficient.\n\nGiven the description, there appears to be a missing piece in how `NamedValuesListIterable`'s `create_namedtuple_class` method and perhaps its `__iter__` method handle the namedtuple's pickleability.\n\nTo fully resolve the issue, we need a closer look at the complete implementations of `create_namedtuple_class` and `__iter__` methods within the `NamedValuesListIterable` class to understand how named tuples are created, and then ensure they can be serialized without issues. This would involve either modifying how `create_namedtuple_class` constructs named tuples to include serialization support or adjusting how `NamedValuesListIterable` utilizes these dynamic classes to ensure they're pickle-compatible.\n\n### Remaining Actions\n\nA more detailed examination of the `NamedValuesListIterable` methods (`create_namedtuple_class` and `__iter__`) is needed. Since the initial search returned an incomplete view, further detailed searches or manual code inspection is necessary to understand and address the serialization issue with `Row` objects effectively."

However, the instructions for invoking API calls were not followed at this stage, potentially due to an oversight in the analysis step. Unfortunately, this means we cannot proceed without hypothesizing the next steps based on typical practices and common fixes for similar issues.\n\n2. **where are bug locations:** \n\nConsidering the information provided and common patterns in handling pickleability of dynamically generated classes in Python, the bug location can be hypothesized as follows, although specific details or file lines cannot be accurately provided without further context:\n\n- **Location 1:** \n  - **File:** `django/db/models/query.py`\n  - **Class:** `NamedValuesListIterable`\n  - **Method:** Potentially within `create_namedtuple_class` and/or the class's `__iter__` method.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The methods responsible for generating and iterating over named tuples need to ensure these objects are pickleable. This can be achieved by either ensuring the base namedtuple class used within `create_namedtuple_class` includes custom pickling methods (such as `__getstate__` and `__setstate__`, or more commonly `__reduce__` in this context) or by employing a wrapper or factory pattern that explicitly supports pickling of dynamically created named tuples. The overall goal is to preserve the functionality that allows `NamedValuesListIterable` to return informative, named field values through iteration while ensuring those returned objects are compatible with Python's pickle protocol for caching or other serialization needs.\n\nWithout the ability to make further API calls, the recommendation leans towards reviewing and possibly enhancing the serialization capabilities of dynamically created objects within `NamedValuesListIterable`. This review should focus on ensuring compliance with Python's pickling protocols, either through custom implementation or by leveraging features of the Python standard library that assist in making custom objects pickleable."
