        "content": "From the collected context:\n\n### Analysis of `values_list` Method\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `values_list` method from the Django `QuerySet` class allows a user to specify a list of model fields and returns a QuerySet that returns tuples of those values. When used with `flat=True`, it can only be called with one field, and it will return a flat list of that field rather than a list of tuples. When `named=True`, it should return named tuples, making the query results more readable by accessing values through names rather than positions.\n\n#### Relationship with the Bug\n\nThe reported issue is with objects returned by `values_list` when `named=True` being not pickleable. In the code, when `named` is set to `True`, the `_iterable_class` is set to `NamedValuesListIterable`, which suggests that the problem may lie with how instances of `NamedValuesListIterable` are created or handled, specifically regarding their ability to be pickled.\n\nGiven there's a `PicklingError` for `django.db.models.query.Row`, which is not directly mentioned in the provided code snippet, it implies that `NamedValuesListIterable` uses `Row` or a mechanism that dynamically creates a named tuple or a similar structure considered as `Row` somewhere else in the Django codebase.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\n\nThe intended behavior here is that when `values_list(named=True)` is called, it should return an instance or a set of instances that are easily serializable (pickleable) so that they can be cached or stored in sessions without causing serialization errors. \n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven that searching directly for the `Row` class returned no results and considering the nature of the `NamedValuesListIterable` and its relation to the issue, the next logical steps would be:\n\n1. **Search for `NamedValuesListIterable` class** to understand how it works, how it uses `Row`, and why `Row` instances can't be pickled. This will give insights into how named tuples are generated and might point to where the `Row` class or structure is defined or used.\n   \n2. **Search for any `__reduce__` method** within the Django models or query code that could explain how Django intends for these objects to be pickled. The `__reduce__` method is a special method in Python that defines custom pickling behavior.\n\n3. **Examine how caching mechanisms** (like in `cacheops` or Django's own caching framework) interact with query results to see if the issue could also be related to how these mechanisms attempt to serialize `Row` instances.\n\nTaking these analyses into account, the following API calls could help gather the necessary context:\n\n- `search_class(\"NamedValuesListIterable\")`: To explore how named tuples are being created/handled.\n- `search_code(\"__reduce__\")`: To find any custom serialization logic that could be related to `Row` instances."

This suggests that the mechanism through which named tuples (or similar structures) are created and returned needs to be adjusted or extended to ensure pickleability. This might involve either ensuring the `Row` class (or the dynamically generated named tuple) includes necessary methods for serialization (`__getstate__` and `__setstate__`, or `__reduce__`) or changing how `NamedValuesListIterable` constructs its return values to ensure they are inherently pickleable by Python's pickle module.\n\nWithout further context on how `NamedValuesListIterable` handles the creation of `Row` instances or how it's supposed to enable their serialization, exact bug fixes are speculative. The intended behavior hints at needing a consistent serialization strategy that doesn't interrupt Django's current functionalities."
