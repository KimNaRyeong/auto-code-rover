Instead, it should refer to self.prog_name. This can fixed as follows:\nparser = CommandParser(\nprog=self.prog_name,\nusage='%(prog)s subcommand [options] [args]',\nadd_help=False,\nallow_abbrev=False)\nI'm aware that execute_from_command_line is a private API, but it'd be really convenient for me if it worked properly in my weird embedded environment where sys.argv[0] is \u200bincorrectly None. If passing my own argv to execute_from_command_line avoided all the ensuing exceptions, I wouldn't have to modify sys.argv[0] globally as I'm doing in the meantime.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the collected context from the provided search results, let's analyze each part:\n\n### ManagementUtility Class\n\n- **File:** `django/core/management/__init__.py`\n- **Description:** This class is responsible for handling management commands. It parses command line arguments (`argv`) and determines what action to take based on those arguments. The `__init__` method initializes the instance with the provided arguments or `sys.argv` if none are provided. The `execute` method plays a significant role in executing commands by preprocessing options to extract `--settings` and `--pythonpath`.\n\n### CommandParser Class\n\n- **File:** `django/core/management/base.py`\n- **Description:** `CommandParser` extends `ArgumentParser` from Python's standard `argparse` module, tailored for Django's command-line argument parsing needs. The overridden `__init__` method can accept extra arguments specific to Django's management command framework.\n\n### CommandParser Instantiation in ManagementUtility.execute\n\n- **Location:** In the `execute` method of `ManagementUtility`, in `django/core/management/__init__.py`.\n- **Analysis:** The instantiation of `CommandParser` here does not utilize the `prog` argument. Instead, it relies on a usage string that eventually substitutes `%(prog)s` with the default, which `argparse` determines from `sys.argv[0]`. This is highlighted as the issue.\n\n### execute_from_command_line Function\n\n- **File:** `django/core/management/__init__.py`\n- **Description:** This function serves as an entry point for executing management commands. It creates an instance of `ManagementUtility` by passing `argv` and then calls its `execute` method.\n\n### Analysis of the Issue and Intended Behavior\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `ManagementUtility` class, particularly its `execute` method, prepares command line parsing, including handling global options like `--settings` and `--pythonpath`. The `CommandParser` class is designed to parse these command-line arguments.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The bug is related to how `CommandParser` is instantiated in the `execute` method of `ManagementUtility`. The `prog` name, which should ideally be set to `self.prog_name` determined at initialization from `argv`, defaults to the program name derived from `sys.argv[0]`. This mismatch can cause inconsistency, especially in environments where `sys.argv[0]` does not accurately reflect the executed command.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior is to ensure that `CommandParser` respects the `prog_name` determined by `ManagementUtility` during its instantiation. This would involve explicitly passing the `self.prog_name` to `CommandParser` as the `prog` argument, aligning the program name used in command line parsing with the one determined by `ManagementUtility`. This change would ensure that in environments where `sys.argv[0]` is not accurate or is `None`, `ManagementUtility` still provides consistent and correct command-line parsing behavior.\n\nThe collected context does clarify the issue at hand and directs us towards the necessary change. Explicitly specifying the `prog` argument when instantiating `CommandParser` inside the `execute` method of `ManagementUtility` should resolve the reported issue."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.
