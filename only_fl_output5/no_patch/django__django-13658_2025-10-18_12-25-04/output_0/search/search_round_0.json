Instead, it should refer to self.prog_name. This can fixed as follows:\nparser = CommandParser(\nprog=self.prog_name,\nusage='%(prog)s subcommand [options] [args]',\nadd_help=False,\nallow_abbrev=False)\nI'm aware that execute_from_command_line is a private API, but it'd be really convenient for me if it worked properly in my weird embedded environment where sys.argv[0] is \u200bincorrectly None. If passing my own argv to execute_from_command_line avoided all the ensuing exceptions, I wouldn't have to modify sys.argv[0] globally as I'm doing in the meantime.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue described, we need to look into the implementation details of several components mentioned in the issue. Specifically, we need to examine how `ManagementUtility` is implemented, how it instantiates `CommandParser`, and how it uses the `prog_name`. We also need a closer look at the `execute_from_command_line` method, as it's indirectly mentioned through the usage context. Here is a list of API calls that would provide the required information:\n\n1. **Search for the `ManagementUtility` class:** This will help us find in which file(s) the class is defined, and give us a starting point for further searches.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"ManagementUtility\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the `CommandParser` class:** Since the issue involves how `CommandParser` is instantiated, knowing where it is defined is crucial for understanding its `__init__` method and its `prog` argument.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"CommandParser\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for the usage of `CommandParser` within the `ManagementUtility` class:** This will help us locate the exact spot in the code where the problematic instantiation occurs.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"CommandParser(usage='%(prog)s subcommand [options] [args]', add_help=False, allow_abbrev=False)\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Search for the `execute_from_command_line` method:** Even though the issue does not directly modify this method, understanding its implementation can help us better understand the context in which `argv` and `prog_name` are used.\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"execute_from_command_line\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls will provide a comprehensive overview of the involved components and their interactions, allowing us to gather the required context for resolving the issue."
