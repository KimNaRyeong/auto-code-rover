        "intended_behavior": "In the `execute` method of the `ManagementUtility` class, when instantiating the `CommandParser`, the `prog` argument should be explicitly set to `self.prog_name` to ensure that the program name used in the command line parsing reflects the name determined by `ManagementUtility`, rather than defaulting to `sys.argv[0]`. This change avoids inconsistencies and potential errors in environments where `sys.argv[0]` does not accurately reflect the executed command or is `None`, thereby preserving the existing functionality of the code while addressing the reported issue."
