        "content": "Analyzing the collected context reveals several important aspects that can be directly related to the issue described:\n\n1. **Regarding `ManifestStaticFilesStorage`**:\n   - The search result confirms that `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` is defined in `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py` and inherits from `ManifestFilesMixin` and `StaticFilesStorage`.\n   - This inheritance is crucial because it suggests that the implementation of `post_process` that we are concerned with could be located either in `ManifestFilesMixin`, `StaticFilesStorage`, or one of their ancestors. The issue arises within this method, so we need to understand how these parent classes implement `post_process`.\n\n2. **Regarding the `post_process` method**:\n   - Although the specific search for the `post_process` method within `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` returned no direct results, it indicates that `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` does not override the `post_process` method itself. Thus, the method must be inherited from one of its base classes (`ManifestFilesMixin` or `StaticFilesStorage`), pointing towards broader inheritance dynamics at play.\n   \n3. **Context around the problematic line (`substitutions` variable)**:\n   - From the snippet around line 251, we see that there is an intention to post-process files, with a distinction between adjustable files and those not marked for adjustment. The snippet reveals a structure for handling paths (possibly file paths that match certain patterns meant for post-processing) and mentions a singular pass, implying there could be multiple passes intended under certain conditions.\n   - This part of the code is supposed to handle files in a way that's adjusted by certain patterns. The error reported (`UnboundLocalError: local variable 'substitutions' referenced before assignment`) suggests that there's a logical path (or condition) where `substitutions` (or a similarly intended variable, as it's not directly shown in the snippet) is referenced without being initialized first. This uninitialized scenario apparently can occur when `max_post_process_passes` is set to 0, preventing the code from entering a loop where `substitutions` would be set.\n   - The intended behavior seems to be that the system should cope gracefully when `max_post_process_passes` is set to 0, either by not entering paths requiring `substitutions` or by ensuring that `substitutions` or its functionality is not required when no post-processing passes are to be made. \n\nBased on this analysis, the next steps involve:\n- Diving deeper into the source code to find out where `max_post_process_passes` is checked and how it influences the `post_process` logic, specifically within the parent classes of `ManifestStaticFilesStorage`.\n- Understanding the initialization and usage scope of `substitutions` or its equivalent in the code snippet's context to devise a solution that either initializes it conditionally or ensures that the logic flow does not expect its initialization when `max_post_process_passes=0`.\n\nGiven the need to look further into where `post_process` is implemented, the next logical step would be:\n- To search for the `post_process` method in the `ManifestFilesMixin` or `StaticFilesStorage` to understand how they implement it and to find the exact place where `max_post_process_passes` influences the flow.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed with the following API call to locate the implementation of `post_process` that affects `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` through inheritance:\n- `search_method_in_class(\"post_process\", \"ManifestFilesMixin\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"post_process\", \"StaticFilesStorage\")`"

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

When `max_post_process_passes` is 0, indicating that no post-processing should happen, the method should ensure that any variable or process which depends on the execution of a post-processing loop (like `substitutions` or in this context, handling of paths for adjustment) are either not necessary or are safely bypassed.\n   - To solve the `UnboundLocalError` reported in the issue, the method needs to initialize or conditionally handle variables like `substitutions` (or its practical equivalent given the variable name wasn't directly mentioned in the provided snippet) at the beginning of the method. This way, even if the post-processing loop is skipped due to `max_post_process_passes` being set to 0, the code will not attempt to reference an uninitialized variable.\n   - Preserve the existing functionality by ensuring that when `max_post_process_passes` is greater than 0, the method behaves exactly as before, processing files according to the specified patterns and applying any necessary adjustments.\n   - An addition could be made to explicitly check the value of `max_post_process_passes` at the start of `post_process` and initialize or adjust the workflow accordingly to prevent attempts at post-processing when it is set to 0."
