Specifically, we need to look into `ManifestStaticFilesStorage`, the `post_process` method, and how `max_post_post_process_passes` is implemented and used. Based on these requirements, the following API calls will be necessary:\n\n1. **Search for the `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` class in the codebase** to understand its structure and inheritance, which will help us modify it correctly.\n   \n   `search_class(\"ManifestStaticFilesStorage\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `post_process` method within the `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` class**, as this is where the issue is occurring. This will help us understand how `substitutions` is being used and why it might not be initialized correctly.\n   \n   `search_method_in_class(\"post_process\", \"ManifestStaticFilesStorage\")`\n\n3. **Get the code around the problematic line** to understand the context of the `substitutions` variable usage and initialization. The issue points to a code block around lines 246 to 257 in the `storage.py` where the error occurs.\n\n   `get_code_around_line(\"django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py\", 251, 5)`\n\nThese API calls will provide a comprehensive view of the problem, the affected methods, and the overall class structure, enabling us to formulate an effective solution."
