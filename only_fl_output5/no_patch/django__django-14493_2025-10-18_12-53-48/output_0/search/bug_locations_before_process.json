        "intended_behavior": "The code within `post_process` should correctly handle scenarios where `max_post_process_passes` is set to 0. When `max_post_process_passes` is 0, indicating that no post-processing should happen, the method should ensure that any variable or process which depends on the execution of a post-processing loop (like `substitutions` or in this context, handling of paths for adjustment) are either not necessary or are safely bypassed. To solve the `UnboundLocalError` reported in the issue, the method needs to initialize or conditionally handle variables like `substitutions` (or its practical equivalent given the variable name wasn't directly mentioned in the provided snippet) at the beginning of the method. This way, even if the post-processing loop is skipped due to `max_post_process_passes` being set to 0, the code will not attempt to reference an uninitialized variable. Preserve the existing functionality by ensuring that when `max_post_process_passes` is greater than 0, the method behaves exactly as before, processing files according to the specified patterns and applying any necessary adjustments. An addition could be made to explicitly check the value of `max_post_process_passes` at the start of `post_process` and initialize or adjust the workflow accordingly to prevent attempts at post-processing when it is set to 0."
