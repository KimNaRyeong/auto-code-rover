To tackle this request effectively, a `reproducer.py` file is required that can work standalone, while also integrating seamlessly with a Django project environment, to reproduce the issue with `fields.E305`. This script will assume a Django project setup is in place. Ensure you replace `your_project_name.settings` in the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` line with your actual Django project settings.

```python
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Setup Django environment
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project_name.settings')

import django
django.setup()

from django.core.management import call_command
from django.db import models

# Definition of dummy apps to simulate the issue with fields.E305
try:
    # Temporary application definition
    class TemporaryAppConfig(django.apps.AppConfig):
        name = 'temp_app'
        verbose_name = "Temporary App"

    # Simulated model to act as target for ManyToManyField
    class CommonModel(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

        class Meta:
            app_label = 'temp_app'

    # First model defining a ManyToManyField with related_name='+' pointing to CommonModel
    class ModelA(models.Model):
        related_items = models.ManyToManyField(CommonModel, related_name='+')

        class Meta:
            app_label = 'temp_app'

    # Second model defining a ManyToManyField with the same related_name='+' pointing to CommonModel
    class ModelB(models.Model):
        related_items = models.ManyToManyField(CommonModel, related_name='+')

        class Meta:
            app_label = 'temp_app'

    # Dynamically adding the app and models to the Django app registry
    django.apps.apps.register_app_config(TemporaryAppConfig('temp_app', django.apps.apps))

    # Attempt to make migrations for the dynamically created temporary app
    call_command('makemigrations', 'temp_app')

    print("The issue was not reproduced. Exiting with code 0.")
    sys.exit(0)

except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    # An assertion to explicitly mention the E305 error
    assert "fields.E305" in str(e), "The expected issue fields.E305 was not detected. Different issue occurred."
    sys.exit(1)
```

**Note:**
1. **Replace `'your_project_name.settings'`** with the actual Django settings module path of your project.
2. This script aims to dynamically create a Django application context and models therein to simulate the `fields.E305` issue. **However, direct manipulation of Django's app registry is not a standard or recommended practice** and may lead to unexpected behavior in different environments or Django versions. This approach is purely for demonstrating a potential way to programmatically simulate the problem.
3. Running this script (`python3 reproducer.py`) is done in the context of a Django project. It assumes that the Django framework is installed and all project settings (including database configurations) are correctly set up to handle migrations.
4. The script might need adjustments based on the specific project setup or Django version used.
