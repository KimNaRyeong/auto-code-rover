This version will ensure Django's settings are properly initialized at runtime, taking into account the prior issues encountered. Remember, this script is designed to be placed in the root of a Django project where `manage.py` resides.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport django\n\nos.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project_name.settings')\ndjango.setup()\n\nfrom django.core.management import call_command\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.apps import AppConfig\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\nclass ReproducerAppConfig(AppConfig):\n    name = 'reproducer_app'\n    verbose_name = \"Reproducer App\"\n\n    def ready(self):\n        try:\n            # Dynamically create models to simulate the issue\n            class CommonModel(models.Model):\n                name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n                class Meta:\n                    app_label = 'reproducer_app'\n\n            class ModelA(models.Model):\n                related_items = models.ManyToManyField(CommonModel, related_name='+')\n                class Meta:\n                    app_label = 'reproducer_app'\n\n            class ModelB(models.Model):\n                related_items = models.ManyToManyField(CommonModel, related_name='+')\n                class Meta:\n                    app_label = 'reproducer_app'\n\n            # Attempt to create migrations to trigger the potential error\n            call_command('makemigrations', 'reproducer_app')\n\n            print(\"No issue detected.\", file=sys.stderr)\n            sys.exit(0)\n\n        except Exception as e:\n            print_stacktrace(e)\n            sys.exit(1)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # This is a workaround to simulate creating an app dynamically. Replace 'your_project_name.settings' with your Django settings module.\n    try:\n        app_config = ReproducerAppConfig('reproducer_app', 'your_project_name')\n        app_config.ready()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        assert \"fields.E305\" in str(e), \"The expected issue fields.E305 was not detected.\"\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Settings Module:** Replace `'your_project_name.settings'` with your correct Django project settings module path. If you're unsure, this information is typically found at the top of your project's `manage.py` or inside the `settings.py` file.\n\n2. **Execution:** This script should be executed in the root directory of the Django project, where the `manage.py` file resides. Run it using `python3 reproducer.py`.\n\n3. **Environment Setup:** The script assumes Django is installed in your environment and is configured to run. If you have multiple Django settings or a non-standard project layout, additional adjustments might be needed.\n\n4. **Dynamic Model Creation:** Instead of creating migrations as originally intended, this updated approach dynamically generates models within an app's context to attempt to simulate the described issue. Due to the dynamic nature of model creation here, actual database migrations might not be necessary to trigger the error, depending on how Django's migration framework interacts with dynamically declared models at runtime.\n\n5. **Troubleshooting:** If the script doesn't work as expected, ensure that your Django project is properly set up and that the Django settings are correctly specified in the environment. The script may require adjustments to fit into unique project structures or settings configurations."
