Given the nature of the problem, it seems we're dealing with a specific pattern of model definition and migration generation that triggers the `fields.E305` error. \n\nHere are the API calls I would like to invoke to gather the required context:\n\n1. **search_code** with `code_str: \"ManyToManyField\"` to find instances of `ManyToManyField` usage in the entire codebase. This can help in identifying how widespread and in what context `ManyToManyField` is being used, especially with the `related_name='+'`.\n   \n2. **search_code** with `code_str: \"related_name='+'\"` to specifically find instances where `related_name='+'` is being used in conjunction with `ManyToManyField` or any other relevant field, to understand the exact configuration that leads to the issue.\n\n3. **search_code** with `code_str: \"class Meta:\"` to explore model meta options across the project. This might unveil any patterns or practices around model names that could be at the heart of the issue described, especially considering models with the same name in different apps.\n\nThese searches should provide a broad overview of the models and their relationships, particularly focusing on the use of `ManyToManyFields` and related names, which are central to the reported issue."
