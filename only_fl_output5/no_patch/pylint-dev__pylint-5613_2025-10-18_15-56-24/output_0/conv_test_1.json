Since the desired method does not exist, it will always raise an `AttributeError` which we catch to print a stack trace for debugging purposes and assert an issue presence.\n- The script ends with a non-zero exit code if the issue is present, indicating failure, or exits with code 0 if for some reason the issue is fixed in the future (e.g., if the `pylint` module is updated to include the desirable API usage)."
