To create a standalone Python script called `reproducer.py` that attempts to reproduce the described issue, we will first write code that uses `pylint` in the current undesired way. Then, we will simulate what would be the desired API usage for `pyreverse` and check if it raises an `AssertionError` due to the lack of the described interface. Here it is:

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def current_approach():
    import pylint
    import sys

    name = 'my_project'
    files = ['file_one.py', 'file_two.py']

    old_argv = sys.argv
    sys.argv = ['pyreverse', '-o', 'png', '-p', name] + files
    try:
        pylint.run_pyreverse()
    except SystemExit:
        pass
    finally:
        sys.argv = old_argv

def desired_approach():
    import pylint

    name = 'my_project'
    files = ['file_one.py', 'file_two.py']

    try:
        pylint.pyreverse(output=pylint.PNG, project=name, files=files)
    except AttributeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The desired API usage is not supported.") from e

try:
    current_approach()
    desired_approach()
except AssertionError as error:
    print("Issue present.")
    sys.exit(1)
else:
    print("Issue fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)
```

This script follows the requested structure:
- It first attempts to use `pyreverse` in the way currently necessary due to `pylint`'s limitations with `current_approach()`.
- Then, it attempts to use `pyreverse` in the more intuitive way as described in the desired solution with `desired_approach()`. Since the desired method does not exist, it will always raise an `AttributeError` which we catch to print a stack trace for debugging purposes and assert an issue presence.
- The script ends with a non-zero exit code if the issue is present, indicating failure, or exits with code 0 if for some reason the issue is fixed in the future (e.g., if the `pylint` module is updated to include the desirable API usage).
