Given the clarification needed to accurately simulate both the current problem and what the desired solution would look like (and integrating the requirement for an improved approach to handle dependencies such as `toml`), let's adjust the approach slightly.

Since the previous script attempt did not directly target the original issue described but instead failed due to a missing module dependency (`toml`), the updated version of `reproducer.py` will include a mechanism to validate the presence of required dependencies and then attempt to perform operations using both the current undesired approach and the desired but unimplemented approach. It will not truly execute `pyreverse` as that would require a specific environment setup and actual Python files to analyze, but it will check for the ability to call such a function with the desired parameters.

Please ensure all dependencies, including `pylint` and `toml`, are installed in your environment before running this script. If `toml` is missing, install it via pip: `pip install toml`.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_dependencies():
    """Ensure all required dependencies are present."""
    try:
        import pylint
        import toml  # Import to check if toml is installed, required for pylint
    except ImportError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit("Missing dependencies. Please ensure all required packages are installed.")

def current_approach():
    """Simulates the current, undesired way to use pylint's pyreverse."""
    import pylint
    name = 'dummy_project'
    files = ['dummy_file.py']

    sys.argv = ['pyreverse', '-o', 'png', '-p', name] + files
    try:
        # Assuming pylint has been properly patched to avoid actual execution.
        pylint.run_pyreverse()
    except SystemExit:
        pass  # Expected behavior, as pylint calls sys.exit.

def desired_approach():
    """Attempts to use pyreverse in a more intuitive way, illustrating the desired solution."""
    import pylint
    try:
        # This will throw AttributeError until pylint provides this interface
        pylint.pyreverse(output=pylint.PNG, project='dummy_project', files=['dummy_file.py'])
        print("Desired method is available:", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(0)
    except AttributeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The desired API usage is not supported.") from e

def main():
    check_dependencies()
    try:
        current_approach()
        desired_approach()
    except AssertionError:
        print("Issue is present.")
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version includes a check for dependencies at the beginning and differentiates clearly between the current approach and the desired behavior, raising `AssertionError` if the desired method is not supported. Note that the actual logic in `current_approach` and `desired_approach` are placeholders to illustrate the issue and assume that pylint has been appropriately patched or configured to safely run or simulate running the tool within this script's context. This script expects to output a trace and exit with code 1 to indicate the issue presence accurately.
