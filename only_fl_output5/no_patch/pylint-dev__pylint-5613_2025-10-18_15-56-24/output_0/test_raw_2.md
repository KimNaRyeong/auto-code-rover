Based on your instructions, here is a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py`. This script aims to reproduce the issue as described earlier. It tries to simulate the current problem of invoking `pyreverse` from within a Python script using `sys.argv` modification, which is not an ideal or direct approach. Then, it attempts to make a call as per the desired solution you've outlined, which would ideally be a directly accessible API function within `pylint` but is expected to fail since such an API does not currently exist. The script will raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present (i.e., the desired API call fails due to non-existence) and print a stack trace of the issue. It should exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed (i.e., if the desired API call succeeds).

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    import sys
    try:
        import pylint
        # Simulating the undesired current approach
        name = 'my_project'
        files = ['file1.py', 'file2.py']
        sys.argv = ['pyreverse', '-o', 'png', '-p', name] + files
        try:
            pylint.run_pyreverse()
        except SystemExit:
            pass  # As mentioned, pylint exits the script.
        
        # Attempting the desired solution
        pylint.pyreverse(output='png', project=name, files=files)
        print("No AssertionError: Desired API is available")
        sys.exit(0)
    
    except ImportError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit("Pylint is not installed. Please install it to reproduce the issue.")
    
    except AttributeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Desired API usage is not supported.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
```

In the current `pylint` package setup (as of my last update), the `pylint.pyreverse` function in the manner described by your desired solution does not exist. Thus, running this script is expected to catch an `AttributeError`, indicating that the specific API call (`pylint.pyreverse(...)`) is not supported. This scenario reproduces the issue and correctly handles it by printing a detailed traceback, allowing for clear identification of the problem point in the code.

Please remember that the function `pylint.pyreverse()` as described in your desired solution does not actually exist in `pylint`. Thus, when this issue is "fixed", it would mean such a function or a similar API has been implemented in the `pylint` library. Therefore, to truly verify the fix, the script (and potentially the `pylint` library) would need to be updated accordantly.
