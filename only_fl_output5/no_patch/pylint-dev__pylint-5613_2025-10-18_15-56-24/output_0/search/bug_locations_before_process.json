        "intended_behavior": "Modify or extend the Run class to include a method or constructor enhancement that allows calling pyreverse programmatically with explicitly named parameters such as output, project, and files. This new method or constructor should: - Accept the new parameters directly, removing the need to manipulate sys.argv for parameter passing. - Preserve the existing functionality for users that prefer the command-line interface, ensuring backward compatibility. - Provide clear and concise documentation on how to use this new programmatically accessible feature, facilitating easier integration and use within Python scripts or applications."
