        "content": "Given the information we have now, let's analyze what we have and consider our next steps:\n\n1. **run_pyreverse Method Context**\n   - The method `run_pyreverse()` is defined in `pylint/__init__.py` and it suggests a straightforward execution pattern for pyreverse by importing `Run` from `pylint.pyreverse.main` and executing it with the arguments provided via `sys.argv[1:]`. \n   - **Relation to the Issue**: The current problem involves invoking `pyreverse` in a less direct and less Pythonic manner, specifically by manipulating `sys.argv`. The presence of `run_pyreverse` suggests there already is an entry point to pyreverse, but it relies on command-line argument passing, which is exactly what the issue aims to improve upon.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Ideally, according to the issue description, we\u2019d prefer a programmatic API that doesn't rely on manipulating `sys.argv` but rather directly accepts parameters in a function call. The presence of `run_pyreverse` could be a starting point for creating or modifying an API method that conforms to the requested design.\n\n2. **No Direct Command-Line Code Found**\n   - The search for the specific command-line usage did not yield results, emphasizing the lack of direct examples of invoking pyreverse programmatically in a way that aligns with the issue\u2019s desired solution. This further implies the necessity to modify or extend existing functionalities to achieve the desired API style for pyreverse.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven this analysis, our next step should involve understanding the structure and capabilities of the `PyreverseRun` class referenced in the `run_pyreverse` method, seeing as this class likely handles the execution of pyreverse. By understanding its constructor and available methods, especially looking for any that accept arguments for output format, project name, and files, we can potentially modify or extend its functionality to create a more direct and flexible API as requested.\n\nTherefore, the following API call is needed next:\n\n- **search_class(\"Run\")**: We specify `\"Run\"` instead of `\"PyreverseRun\"` because the latter is an alias used in the `run_pyreverse()` function, and we want to examine the class that implements pyreverse's functionalities."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.
