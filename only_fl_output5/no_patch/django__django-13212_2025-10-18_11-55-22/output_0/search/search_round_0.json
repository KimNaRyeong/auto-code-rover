For example:\n\u201cblah\u201d is not a valid email.\nBy making built-in validators provide value to ValidationError, one can override an error message and use a %(value)s placeholder.\nThis placeholder value matches an example already in the docs:\n\u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/validators/#writing-validators\n</issue>"

This search could reveal code patterns or existing implementations that follow this design, thus I'll search for a snippet that might match commonly named functions or classes related to validators.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"def validate\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Search for current usage of `ValidationError`**: This will help us understand how `ValidationError` is currently instantiated, especially in the context of validators.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"ValidationError(\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls should provide a well-rounded view of how `ValidationError` is used and how validators are implemented, which is crucial for suggesting a method to include the provided value in error messages."
