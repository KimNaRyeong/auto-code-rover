        "intended_behavior": "The `prepare_lookup_value` function should be enhanced to support values containing commas for keys ending with `__in`. This change must allow such values to be included without being split incorrectly. One approach to achieving this could involve introducing a mechanism to handle escape characters or using a different delimiter to separate values meant for the `__in` lookup.\n\nSpecifically, the function should:\n- Detect and correctly handle escaped commas within a value string, ensuring that such values are not split. This could mean treating a sequence like \"\\,\" as a literal comma within a single value, rather than as a separator.\n- Alternatively, support a different delimiter (e.g., a semicolon `;`) for splitting multiple values, with clear documentation indicating this behavior to developers and users.\n- Maintain backward compatibility by not altering the current behavior for inputs without escaped commas or the specified delimiter. This ensures that existing applications relying on the `__in` lookup continue to function as before.\n\nEither approach would require clear documentation to ensure developers understand how to correctly format their queries when intending to use values that include commas. This change aims to enhance the flexibility and usability of the Django admin's filtering capabilities while preserving existing functionality for backward compatibility."
