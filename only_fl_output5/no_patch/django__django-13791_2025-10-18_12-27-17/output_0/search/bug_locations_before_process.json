        "intended_behavior": "The `parse_duration` function needs to properly account for negative durations when the timedelta only has days. Specifically, when parsing an ISO 8601 duration string that signifies a negative duration consisting solely of days (e.g., `-P1D`), the resultant `datetime.timedelta` object should correctly reflect a negative number of days (i.e., `datetime.timedelta(days=-1)`). To resolve the issue, a modification is required whereby the application of the sign to the `days` part ensures that negative durations are faithfully represented, even when other time components (hours, minutes, seconds, microseconds) are not specified in the duration string. This adjustment must preserve the existing functionality for parsing other forms of duration strings (positive durations, durations including time components other than days, etc.) while fixing the incorrect handling of negative durations as described in the issue."
