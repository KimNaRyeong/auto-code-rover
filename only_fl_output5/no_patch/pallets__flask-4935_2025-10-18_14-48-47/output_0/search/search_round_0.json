        "content": "<issue>Nested blueprints are not respected when mounted on subdomains\nHello, and thanks for all your work \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\nNested blueprints [as described in the docs](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/blueprints/#nesting-blueprints) work perfectly fine when using `url_prefix`. However, when mounting the parent blueprint using a subdomain, the child routes are not accessible.\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom flask import Blueprint\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config[\"SERVER_NAME\"] = \"localhost:5000\"\nparent = Blueprint(\"parent\", __name__)\nchild = Blueprint(\"child\", __name__)\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\nreturn \"index\"\n@parent.route('/')\ndef parent_index():\nreturn \"parent\"\n@child.route('/child/')\ndef child_index():\nreturn \"child\"\nparent.register_blueprint(child)\napp.register_blueprint(parent, subdomain=\"api\")\nif __name__ == '__main__':\napp.run(debug=True)\n```\nThe index route works as expected:\n```\n\u276f http http://localhost:5000/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 5\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:44:10 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\nindex\n```\nSo does the parent route in the subdomain:\n```\n\u276f http http://api.localhost:5000/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 6\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:44:06 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\nparent\n```\nBut the child responds with a 404:\n```\n\u276f http http://api.localhost:5000/child/\nHTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 207\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:45:42 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=en>\n<title>404 Not Found</title>\n<h1>Not Found</h1>\n<p>The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.</p>\n```\nIf we change the `subdomain=\"api\"` for `url_prefix=\"/api\"` when registering the blueprint however everything works as expected:\n```\n\u276f http http://localhost:5000/api/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 6\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:46:53 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\nparent\n\u276f http http://localhost:5000/api/child/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 5\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:46:59 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\nchild\n```\nThis was surprising to me as I expected the same nesting to apply regardless of whether the parent is mounted using a subdomain or a URL prefix. Am I missing something?\nEnvironment:\n- Python version: 3.10\n- Flask version: 2.2.2\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather context for resolving the issue about nested blueprints not being respected when mounted on subdomains, the following API calls would be useful:\n\n1. Search for the Flask class to get a general understanding of how blueprints are handled:\n   - `search_class(\"Flask\")`\n\n2. Since the issue is related to blueprint registration, specifically with the handling of subdomains and nested blueprints, search for the `Blueprint` class as well:\n   - `search_class(\"Blueprint\")`\n\n3. The `register_blueprint` method is directly mentioned as the method used to nest blueprints and trigger the issue. We need to understand how it works, especially with subdomains:\n   - `search_method(\"register_blueprint\")`\n\n4. Given the involvement of Flask's application and routing system, looking into the `url_map` attribute of the Flask app might give clues about how routes are registered and stored, especially with subdomains:\n   - `search_code(\"url_map\")` in the Flask class to understand how the application manages URL mappings which might affect how nested blueprints are recognized when subdomains are used.\n\nThese searches aim to understand how Flask handles blueprint nesting, particularly with subdomains, and identify any discrepancies or limitations in the implementation."
