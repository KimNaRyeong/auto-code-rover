        "content": "<issue>Nested blueprints are not respected when mounted on subdomains\nHello, and thanks for all your work \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\nNested blueprints [as described in the docs](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/blueprints/#nesting-blueprints) work perfectly fine when using `url_prefix`. However, when mounting the parent blueprint using a subdomain, the child routes are not accessible.\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom flask import Blueprint\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config[\"SERVER_NAME\"] = \"localhost:5000\"\nparent = Blueprint(\"parent\", __name__)\nchild = Blueprint(\"child\", __name__)\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\nreturn \"index\"\n@parent.route('/')\ndef parent_index():\nreturn \"parent\"\n@child.route('/child/')\ndef child_index():\nreturn \"child\"\nparent.register_blueprint(child)\napp.register_blueprint(parent, subdomain=\"api\")\nif __name__ == '__main__':\napp.run(debug=True)\n```\nThe index route works as expected:\n```\n\u276f http http://localhost:5000/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 5\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:44:10 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\nindex\n```\nSo does the parent route in the subdomain:\n```\n\u276f http http://api.localhost:5000/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 6\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:44:06 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\nparent\n```\nBut the child responds with a 404:\n```\n\u276f http http://api.localhost:5000/child/\nHTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 207\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:45:42 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=en>\n<title>404 Not Found</title>\n<h1>Not Found</h1>\n<p>The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.</p>\n```\nIf we change the `subdomain=\"api\"` for `url_prefix=\"/api\"` when registering the blueprint however everything works as expected:\n```\n\u276f http http://localhost:5000/api/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 6\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:46:53 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\nparent\n\u276f http http://localhost:5000/api/child/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 5\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:46:59 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\nchild\n```\nThis was surprising to me as I expected the same nesting to apply regardless of whether the parent is mounted using a subdomain or a URL prefix. Am I missing something?\nEnvironment:\n- Python version: 3.10\n- Flask version: 2.2.2\n</issue>"

Search for the Flask class to get a general understanding of how blueprints are handled:\n   - `search_class(\"Flask\")`\n\n2. Since the issue is related to blueprint registration, specifically with the handling of subdomains and nested blueprints, search for the `Blueprint` class as well:\n   - `search_class(\"Blueprint\")`\n\n3. The `register_blueprint` method is directly mentioned as the method used to nest blueprints and trigger the issue. We need to understand how it works, especially with subdomains:\n   - `search_method(\"register_blueprint\")`\n\n4. Given the involvement of Flask's application and routing system, looking into the `url_map` attribute of the Flask app might give clues about how routes are registered and stored, especially with subdomains:\n   - `search_code(\"url_map\")` in the Flask class to understand how the application manages URL mappings which might affect how nested blueprints are recognized when subdomains are used.\n\nThese searches aim to understand how Flask handles blueprint nesting, particularly with subdomains, and identify any discrepancies or limitations in the implementation."

It is responsible for routing requests to the appropriate view function, managing the application configuration, sessions, and supporting functionalities for responses, request handling, and templating.\n- **Relation to Bug**: The Flask class supports subdomains through its configuration, as seen in the `SERVER_NAME` config and the `subdomain_matching` initialization parameter. However, the problem description and the lack of direct reference in this part of the code to how subdomains might affect nested blueprints' routing indicates that this overarching mechanism may not fully account for or integrate with nested blueprints when it comes to subdomain handling.\n- **Intended Behavior**: Ideally, when a parent blueprint is registered with a subdomain, all nested child blueprints should inherit this context and be routed properly under the same subdomain, unless overridden.\n\n### Analysis of `Blueprint` Class in `blueprints.py`\n- **Responsibilities and Capabilities**: The Blueprint class allows for the modular definition of application components and features, with the ability to register routes, error handlers, template filters, and more. Blueprints can be nested, which suggests a hierarchical structure in handling URLs and application structuring.\n- **Relation to Bug**: The issue occurs at the intersection of blueprint nesting (`parent.register_blueprint(child)`) and subdomain assignment (`app.register_blueprint(parent, subdomain=\"api\")`). Although the Blueprint class provides for hierarchical structuring, the description does not show handling or inheriting of subdomains in nested blueprints, potentially the crux of the issue.\n- **Intended Behavior**: On registering a parent blueprint with a subdomain, any nested blueprints should automatically respect this subdomain, making their routes accessible under the parent blueprint's subdomain without additional need for subdomain specification.\n\n### Missing Context: `register_blueprint` Method and `url_map`\nAlthough the `register_blueprint` method exists in both `Flask` and `Blueprint` classes, details on how it manages subdomains, especially with nested blueprints, were not presented. How `register_blueprint` specifically contributes to routing, subdomain management, and the URL map (`url_map`) needs further examination. The `url_map` is central to Flask's routing system, mapping URLs to endpoint and view function; understanding its interaction with blueprints and subdomains is key to addressing the issue.\n\n### Next Steps\nConsidering the missing context and analyzing what's next:\n1. **`register_blueprint` Investigation**: Further investigation into `register_blueprint` within both `Flask` and `Blueprint` classes, focusing on parameters and logic related to subdomains, is necessary.\n2. **URL Map Management**: Since my attempt to directly search for `url_map` handling within Flask (from the class context) failed, a more appropriate approach would be to investigate where and how Flask's `url_map` integrates with blueprint registration, specifically:\n   - `search_code(\"url_map\")` in the `app.py` (correcting the initial incorrect file reference).\n   - Understanding how the `url_map` integrates with blueprints can reveal whether and where the routing logic could fail or ignore nested blueprints under a subdomain.\n\nGiven these insights, a further deep-dive into the specifics of `register_blueprint` and `url_map` relation to blueprint registration is crucial for next steps."

        "content": "### Analysis of `register_blueprint` in `app.py`\n\n#### What it does:\n- This method registers a `Blueprint` to the Flask application, allowing for blueprint-specific routes, error handlers, and other features to be integrated into the app. It can accept keyword arguments to override blueprint defaults, including `url_prefix` and `subdomain`, which are crucial for this issue.\n\n#### Relationship to the Bug:\n- Given the issue description, the bug seems to relate to how the `subdomain` parameter is handled (or not handled) when registering nested blueprints. While the method allows specifying a subdomain when registering a blueprint, the behavior as it relates to nested blueprints and their access to the specified subdomain is not clear from this snippet alone. It's possible that the logic to adequately propagate subdomain settings to nested blueprints during registration is lacking or malfunctioning.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\n- To resolve the issue, when a parent blueprint is registered with a `subdomain`, this setting should implicitly apply to all its registered child blueprints unless explicitly overridden. This would ensure nested routes are correctly accessible under the parent blueprint's subdomain.\n\n### Analysis of `register_blueprint` in `blueprints.py`\n\n#### What it does:\n- This method allows for blueprint nesting by letting one blueprint register another. This functionality underpins the modular composition of Flask applications, enabling a structured and hierarchical organization of routes and features.\n\n#### Relationship to the Bug:\n- The mechanism by which subdomains are supposed to cascade down through nested blueprints appears to be missing or not functioning correctly. This method facilitates blueprint nesting but does not explicitly address how subdomains should be propagated or managed within these nested structures.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\n- The intended behavior should ensure that when blueprints are nested, the subdomain context of the parent is properly applied to its children, allowing for consistent and predictable URL space under a given subdomain. Further, any mechanism for overriding the subdomain on a per-blueprint basis within the hierarchy should be clear and functional.\n\n### Analysis of `url_map` in `app.py`\n\n#### What it does:\n- The `url_map` is an integral part of the Flask app responsible for keeping track of all the URL rules and their associated view functions. It's how Flask knows what code to execute for a given URL, laying the groundwork for Flask's routing mechanism.\n\n#### Relationship to the Bug:\n- The relationship here lies in how the `url_map` is constructed, especially in terms of incorporating the routes from blueprints and subsequently, how those blueprints' routes are modified by subdomain specifications. The bug may stem from a lack of integration or consideration of subdomain information when registering nested blueprint routes into the `url_map`.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\n- The intended behavior would ensure the `url_map` correctly interprets and implements subdomain information for routes, particularly for nested blueprints. This involves ensuring that when blueprint routes are added to the `url_map`, any specified subdomain settings are appropriately applied and reflected in the way routes are matched.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we've identified potential bug locations and described the intended behavior necessary to resolve the issue with nested blueprints and subdomains. Specifically, enhancements or fixes may need to be applied to how `register_blueprint` methods in both `app.py` and `blueprints.py` handle subdomain propagation for nested blueprints, along with ensuring the `url_map` correctly processes and respects these settings."

Bug Locations and Intended Behavior:\n\n**Location 1**:  \n- **File**: `src/flask/app.py`\n- **Class**: `Flask`\n- **Method**: `register_blueprint`\n\n**Intended Behavior**:  \nThe `register_blueprint` method should ensure that when a blueprint is registered with a `subdomain`, this configuration cascades down to any nested blueprints. The intended behavior would therefore involve checking if the `subdomain` parameter is set during blueprint registration and, if so, propagating this setting to all child blueprints registered within it. This mechanism should respect existing functionalities, such as allowing child blueprints to specify their subdomain if different from the parent's. This will require careful design to ensure backward compatibility and avoid unintended behavior changes.\n\n**Location 2**:  \n- **File**: `src/flask/blueprints.py`\n- **Class**: `Blueprint`\n- **Method**: `register_blueprint`\n\n**Intended Behavior**:  \nThis `register_blueprint` method within the `Blueprint` class should also support the correct handling and propagation of `subdomain` configurations to nested blueprints. When a blueprint is registered to another (nesting), the method should check if the parent blueprint has a `subdomain` set and apply it to the child unless the child explicitly overrides it. This enhances modularity and predictability, ensuring that developers can structure their Flask applications in hierarchical and compartmentalized ways without losing the ability to organize routes under specific subdomains.\n\n**General Approach for Both Locations**:  \n- Ensure that the subdomain setting, if present, is propagated from parent to child blueprints during the registration phase.\n- Provide a mechanism or option for child blueprints to either inherit the parent's subdomain or define their own.\n- Maintain backward compatibility by ensuring that existing applications without subdomain specifications in blueprints behave as before.\n- Update documentation to clearly describe how subdomains should be handled with nested blueprints, including examples of the intended behavior to aid developers in correctly using this functionality.\n\nThrough these modifications, the Flask framework can better support complex applications that require modular routing structures under varying subdomains, addressing the reported issue and enhancing overall framework capabilities."
