Based on the specific requirements and the function provided for printing the stack trace, the revised standalone Python file `reproducer.py` is designed to reproduce the issue as described. This script ensures the detection and demonstration of the nested blueprints issue when mounted on subdomains in a Flask application. Please ensure that Flask is installed in your environment before running this script. 

```python
# reproducer.py
from flask import Flask, Blueprint

def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    # Ensure the server name matches your local development setup
    app.config["SERVER_NAME"] = "localhost:5000"
    parent = Blueprint("parent", __name__)
    child = Blueprint("child", __name__, url_prefix='/child')

    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        return "index"
    
    @parent.route('/')
    def parent_index():
        return "parent"

    @child.route('/')
    def child_index():
        return "child"

    # Nest the child blueprint inside the parent
    parent.register_blueprint(child)
    # Register the parent blueprint with a subdomain
    app.register_blueprint(parent, subdomain="api")
    return app

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_child_route_accessible():
    app = create_app()
    client = app.test_client()
    with app.app_context(), app.test_request_context():
        # Modify the HOST header to target the subdomain
        response = client.get("/child/", headers={"Host": "api.localhost:5000"})
        assert response.status_code == 200, "Child route under subdomain is not accessible, should return HTTP 200"

def main():
    try:
        test_child_route_accessible()
        print("Issue is fixed, exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Issue is present, raising AssertionError.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code indicating the issue is present
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit due to an unexpected error

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script intentionally attempts to confirm the accessibility of a nested blueprint's route when it's part of a blueprint mounted on a subdomain. It first constructs a minimal Flask application with the necessary nested blueprints and server configuration. Then, it simulates a web request aimed at the child blueprint's route under the specified subdomain, expecting a successful HTTP 200 response to assert that the issue is fixed. If the assertion fails due to a route not being accessible (e.g., receiving a 404 Not Found error), it indicates the described issue is present, prints a stack trace for debugging, and exits with code 1. This behavior provides clear feedback about the presence of the problem under investigation.
