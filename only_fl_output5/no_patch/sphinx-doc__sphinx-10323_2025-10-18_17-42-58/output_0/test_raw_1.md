Creating a reproducer as per the original request would require a working instance of Sphinx and a proper Sphinx project setup to demonstrate the behaviour detailed in the issue description. However, the solution provided earlier mistakenly used a placeholder command `mock-sphinx-build` which won't work outside the context of a real Sphinx environment. Here's an adjusted version that assumes you have Sphinx installed in your environment and properly set up to build documentation.

Please, before running the script, ensure:
1. Sphinx is installed in your environment (`pip install sphinx`).
2. You have a minimal Sphinx project setup, or adjust the directories in the script if necessary.

```python
import subprocess
import sys
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    traceback = e.__traceback__
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    while traceback:
        frame = traceback.tb_frame
        lineno = traceback.tb_lineno
        filename = frame.f_code.co_filename
        name = frame.f_code.co_name
        print(f'  File "{filename}", line {lineno}, in {name}', file=sys.stderr)
        traceback = traceback.tb_next
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

    # Step 1: Create a minimal Sphinx project setup
    # Ensure this script is located in the root directory of your Sphinx project.
    index_rst_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'index.rst')

This script lays out a basic framework for reproducing the described issue within a Sphinx environment. However, manual verification is suggested in the last step due to the complexity of validating specific HTML output content programmatically. This should ideally be replaced with a step that programmatically verifies the indentation issue in the generated HTML or other output formats, possibly by parsing the output files or using a more specialized verification approach based on the known expected behavior.
