        "intended_behavior": "The `run` method of the `LiteralInclude` directive should be adjusted to ensure that when `prepend` or `append` options are used, the leading whitespace of these strings is preserved and correctly applies to the included content. This means improving how this method processes the `prepend` and `append` options to maintain the original formatting intentions. Specifically, it involves enhancing the logic that handles the inclusion of external content to ensure that any added `prepend` or `append` text aligns correctly with the intended code block indentation, without stripping or misinterpreting leading whitespace."
