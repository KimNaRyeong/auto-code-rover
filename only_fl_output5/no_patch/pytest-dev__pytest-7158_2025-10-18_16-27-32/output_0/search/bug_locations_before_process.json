The specific location where skip reports are formatted should ensure that file paths are adjusted to reflect their relative paths from the invocation directory. If file paths are presented as absolute paths during the formatting of skip messages, a modification is needed to convert these paths to be relative based on the current directory from which pytest was invoked. This would resolve the issue by displaying paths in the skip report as the user expects, maintaining uniformity with how paths are referenced throughout pytest's output."

        "intended_behavior": "Given the extensive role of this file in handling Python test items, including their collection and reporting, a deeper look into the methods that prepare test reports, especially skipped tests, might be required. The intended behavior here would be to ensure that when tests are skipped, and the reports are being prepared, any paths are accurately construed relative to the invocation point or adjusted accordingly if the computation of relative paths is found to be incorrect or not applied at this stage. This adjustment would correct the issue where paths are not shown as expected when tests are skipped."
