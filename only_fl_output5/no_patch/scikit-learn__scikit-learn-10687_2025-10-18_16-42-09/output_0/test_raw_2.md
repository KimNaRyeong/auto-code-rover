Based on your requirements, here's a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that follows your specifications for testing the issue with the `linear_model.Lasso` in scikit-learn, specifically concerning the shape of `coef_` when `fit_intercept=False` is used. This script aims to reproduce the stated issue and handle the outcome appropriately:

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_lasso_coef_shape_issue():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn import linear_model

    # Create dummy data
    X = np.c_[np.ones(3)]
    y = np.ones(3)

    # Create and train Lasso model with fit_intercept=True
    est_intercept = linear_model.Lasso(fit_intercept=True)
    est_intercept.fit(X, y)

    # AssertionError will not be raised here as this is expected to work
    assert est_intercept.coef_.shape == (1,), "Unexpected shape for coef_ with intercept."

    try:
        # Create and train Lasso model with fit_intercept=False
        est_no_intercept = linear_model.Lasso(fit_intercept=False)
        est_no_intercept.fit(X, y)

        # This is where the issue is expected to occur
        assert est_no_intercept.coef_.shape == (1,), "Unexpected shape for coef_ without intercept."
        print("No issue: The shape of coef_ is as expected.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 if the assertion fails

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_lasso_coef_shape_issue()
```

This script checks whether the shape of `coef_` is as expected when a `Lasso` model is trained with `fit_intercept=False`. According to the description of the issue, there is an expectation that an `AssertionError` should be raised due to an unexpected shape of `coef_`. The script will rightly catch this error, print the stack trace for clarity on where exactly the issue occurs, and then exit with code 1 to indicate the presence of the bug.

If the issue is fixed, the script will simply print a message saying "No issue: The shape of coef_ is as expected." and exit with code 0, indicating the absence of a bug.
