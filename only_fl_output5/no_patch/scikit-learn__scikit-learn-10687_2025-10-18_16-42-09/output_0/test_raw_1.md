Given the constraints and requirements for a standalone script to reproduce the described issue with `linear_model.Lasso` in scikit-learn, and the need for the script to raise an `AssertionError` for the ongoing issue while exiting with code 0 when the issue is resolved, here is a revised version of the script:

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_lasso_coef_shape():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn import linear_model

    try:
        # Test with fit_intercept=True
        est_intercept = linear_model.Lasso(fit_intercept=True)
        est_intercept.fit(np.c_[np.ones(3)], np.ones(3))
        assert est_intercept.coef_.shape == (1,), "Shape mismatch for coef_ with intercept."

        # Test with fit_intercept=False
        est_no_intercept = linear_model.Lasso(fit_intercept=False)
        est_no_intercept.fit(np.c_[np.ones(3)], np.ones(3))
        assert est_no_intercept.coef_.shape == (1,), "Shape mismatch for coef_ without intercept."
        print("Test passed: The shape of coef_ is as expected.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_lasso_coef_shape()
```

This `reproducer.py` script checks for the shape of `coef_` attribute for `linear_model.Lasso` instances (with both `fit_intercept=True` and `fit_intercept=False`) against the expected shape. If the shape is not as expected, an error message is printed along with a stack trace. This bug was identified in the issue as specifically regarding the `fit_intercept=False` case, and the script correctly exits with a nonzero exit code if the issue is reproduced, thus signaling an error. If fixed, the script will exit with code 0, indicating success.
