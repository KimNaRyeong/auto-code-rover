        "intended_behavior": "The handling of the fit_intercept attribute needs to ensure that the initialization and manipulation of coef_ are correctly performed, especially concerning its shape with respect to fit_intercept=False. The coordinate descent call within fit (around line 748 to line 758) explicitly sets fit_intercept=False that should instead respect the self.fit_intercept value. The intended behavior is to make the fit_intercept handling in this section dynamic based on the model's initialization parameter, such that when fit_intercept=False, the method should still correctly infer the shape of coef_ for both single and multi-feature datasets without forcing an incorrect shape assumption that contradicts the user's configuration. This ensures that when users check the shape of coef_ post-fitting, it aligns with the expectation for the model's configuration, preserving the model's accuracy and general functionality. Correcting this ensures that coef_'s shape is correctly managed per the user's expectations and the documented behavior of the ElasticNet (and by inheritance, the Lasso) model when fit_intercept is set to False."
