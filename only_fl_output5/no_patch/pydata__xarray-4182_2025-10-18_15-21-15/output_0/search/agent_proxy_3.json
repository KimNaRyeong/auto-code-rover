This likely involves adjusting how the `sections` list is constructed or rendered into HTML, such as by altering CSS classes or attributes applied to these sections to ensure they render in an expanded state initially. The overall structure and other functionalities of the method should remain unchanged to continue providing a comprehensive and interactive HTML representation.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `xarray/core/formatting_html.py`\n  - **Function:** `dataset_repr`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The `dataset_repr` function should also be adjusted to ensure that the HTML representation of `Dataset` objects has sections for dimensions, coordinates, data variables, and attributes expanded by default. Similar to `array_repr`, this might require modifications to the HTML or CSS logic within this function to display content sections in an expanded state upon initial rendering. The goal is to enhance data visibility and access for users without compromising on the detailed insights provided by these representations.\n\nThe adjustments in both locations aim to improve user accessibility and usability by making vital data and metadata immediately visible in the HTML representations, aligning with the issue's aims for enhanced consistency and discovery in graphical notebook environments."
