However, the analysis hints at two potential locations that will likely need modifications:\n\n- **Location 1:** \n  - **File:** It is likely in a file associated with `formatting_html`, where `array_repr` is implemented.\n  - **Class/Method:** The `array_repr` method responsible for generating the HTML representation of `DataArray` objects.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** This method should be modified so that the HTML rendering of `DataArray` (and potentially `Variable`, if shared) includes sections for data and attributes that are expanded by default. This may involve adjusting HTML templates or the conditional logic within the method that constructs the HTML. The changes should ensure that users can immediately see these details without additional interaction, improving usability and consistency with text representations.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** Presumably in a `formatting_html`-related file where `dataset_repr` is defined.\n  - **Class/Method:** The `dataset_repr` method that constructs the HTML representation of `Dataset` objects.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Similar to `array_repr`, `dataset_repr` should be adjusted to ensure that the data and attributes sections of a `Dataset`'s HTML representation are expanded by default. The functionality for generating the overall representation should be preserved, with modifications focused on the visibility state of relevant sections.\n\nThese intended behaviors aim to resolve the usability concern brought up in the issue by making the HTML representations of `DataArray`, `Variable`, and `Dataset` more accessible and informative at first glance, without requiring user interaction to uncover essential data and attributes.\n"
