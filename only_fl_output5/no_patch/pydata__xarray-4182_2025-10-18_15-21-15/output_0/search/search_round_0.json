        "content": "To resolve the issue of pre-expanding data and attributes in DataArray/Variable HTML representations in xarray, we need to gather more context about the HTML representation generation for these types. The relevant classes are likely `DataArray` and `Variable`, and we need to look into the implementation details of how their HTML representations are currently being generated. Additionally, understanding how dask array representations are integrated could be beneficial, given the mention of a \"really nice repr for nested dask arrays.\"\n\nHere are the API calls we should make to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"DataArray\")`: This will help us find the file(s) where `DataArray` is implemented, which is crucial for understanding how its HTML representation is generated.\n2. `search_class(\"Variable\")`: Similar to `DataArray`, this will provide us with the location and context of the `Variable` class implementation.\n3. `search_method(\" _repr_html_\")`: Since the issue discusses HTML representations, we're specifically interested in methods that generate these, which are likely named `_repr_html_` or similar, according to Python's conventions for special methods used by IPython and Jupyter to generate HTML representations.\n4. `search_code(\"html template\")`: We are looking for any snippets that might involve HTML templates for rendering `DataArray` or `Variable` objects, as modifications here may be required to pre-expand sections by default.\n5. `search_code(\"dask array representation\")`: Given the mention of a specific representation for nested dask arrays, finding code snippets related to this could uncover how these representations are integrated and potentially modified."
