        "content": "Given the results from the search queries, let's analyze the collected context:\n\n1. **`execute_sql_flush` method in `django/db/backends/base/operations.py`:**\n\n    - This part of the code defines the `execute_sql_flush` method within what seems to be a base class for database operations in Django. It\u2019s responsible for executing a list of SQL statements to flush (clear) the database. The method uses a transaction to ensure atomicity, indicating that it's a critical operation that modifies the database state significantly.\n    \n    - **Relation to the issue:** This is directly related to the issue since it's the method whose signature we're looking to simplify by removing the `using` parameter. According to the issue, `using` should be inferred from `self.connection.alias` instead of being explicitly passed.\n    \n    - **Intended behavior:** Post-refactoring, this method will automatically use `self.connection.alias` internally to determine the database alias to use for the flushing operation, removing the need for callers to pass this as an argument. This simplifies the method call and reduces the dependency on callers to know the correct database alias.\n\n2. **Usage of `execute_sql_flush` in `django/core/management/commands/flush.py`:**\n\n    - This code snippet shows the `execute_sql_flush` method being called within a Django management command named `flush`. The command acts on a user's confirmation to proceed with flushing the database, executing a list of SQL statements provided in `sql_list`, and handling any exceptions that occur.\n    \n    - **Relation to the issue:** This usage highlights how the `execute_sql_flush` method is called in practice, including the explicit passing of the `database` (as the `using` argument) and `sql_list`. This is a live example of the method signature's effects on caller code.\n    \n    - **Intended behavior:** With the proposed changes, this call would be simplified to `connection.ops.execute_sql_flush(sql_list)`, implicitly using `database` from `self.connection.alias` within the method implementation. This would not only simplify the method call but potentially make the code cleaner and reduce duplication of the logic to determine the database alias (`using` parameter).\n\nGiven these insights, the next steps involve refactoring the `execute_sql_flush` method to not require the `using` argument explicitly and adjusting all instances of its usage throughout the codebase accordingly. Post-refactoring, it\u2019s crucial to validate that the method correctly infers `using` from `self.connection.alias` in all contexts where it is called."

The issue and the method usage within the codebase are clear from the search results.\n\n2. **Where are bug locations:**\n\n   - **Location 1:**\n     - File: `django/db/backends/base/operations.py`\n     - Class: Not explicitly mentioned but implied to be a base class for database operations, likely `BaseDatabaseOperations` or a similar parent class.\n     - Method: `execute_sql_flush`\n     \n     - **Intended Behavior:** The method needs to be refactored to no longer require the `using` argument. Instead, it should internally use `self.connection.alias` to determine the database alias for executing the SQL flush. This change preserves the functionality of flushing the database while simplifying the method signature and its calls throughout the codebase.\n   \n   - **Location 2:**\n     - File: `django/core/management/commands/flush.py`\n     \n     - **Intended Behavior:** Since the signature of `execute_sql_flush` would change by removing the `using` parameter, all calls to this method need to be updated accordingly. In this location, the call inside the `flush` management command should be updated to no longer pass the `database` as an argument to `execute_sql_flush`. Instead, it should only pass `sql_list`, relying on the updated method to correctly infer the database from `self.connection.alias`.\n   \nThese adjustments ensure the method is simplified as requested, reducing complexity and potential errors by eliminating the need for calling code to specify which database to operate on explicitly. This streamlines the usage of `execute_sql_flush` across the Django project, maintaining existing functionality while simplifying the method's interface."
