Below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that follows your instructions. The script attempts to replicate the issue described, using the `requests` library to send an HTTP GET request that results in a 301 redirect to an HTTPS URL. When the issue is present, it prints a stack trace of the error using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. It raises an `AssertionError` if the error occurs, indicating the issue is present. The script exits with code 0 if the issue is fixed (i.e., if no `TypeError` is raised).

```python
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_pyopenssl_redirect():
    try:
        requests.get('https://httpbin.org/status/301')
        assert True, "Issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0."
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue is present.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_pyopenssl_redirect()
```

This script assumes that the described environment and dependencies from your issue description are correctly installed and set up (namely `requests`, `pyOpenSSL`, and related packages in their specified versions). Please ensure you have the correct virtual environment activated when you run this script. Also, note that because the script's behavior relies on external dependencies and their interaction, you might need to adjust the import statement or URLs if the context or libraries have changed since the issue was reported.
