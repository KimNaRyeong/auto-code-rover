Given the clarifications and focusing on reproducing the exact issue related to a 301 response handling in Python using specific versions of the libraries mentioned, here is an updated standalone Python script. This script strictly aims to trigger the described error relating to redirect handling in the presence of the specified package versions and their conflict with Python 3's expectations around string types (bytes vs. Unicode).

This script, named `reproducer.py`, should be run in an environment that precisely matches the versions of `requests`, `pyOpenSSL`, `cryptography`, `ndg-httpsclient`, and `pyasn1` as you've described. It's designed to directly reproduce the TypeError when handling redirects under these conditions.

```python
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_pyopenssl_redirect():
    try:
        # This GET request will cause a 301 redirect, intended to trigger the described issue
        requests.get('https://httpbin.org/status/301')
        # If the exception isn't raised, we assume the issue is fixed or not present.
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Raise an assertion error if the TypeError occurs, indicating the issue is present.
        raise AssertionError("Issue is present.") from e
    else:
        print("No issue detected. Exiting with code 0.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_pyopenssl_redirect()
    # If the script reaches this point without exceptions, exit code 0 will indicate success/no issue.
```

Keep in mind:

- This script assumes that your Python environment has the exact versions of the packages as described.
- If your project or environment setup differs (especially in a more updated or different configuration), you may need to adjust the script or environment accordingly.
- The described issue is somewhat dependent on the versions of the Python packages and their compatibility with each other and with the Python version itself. Given the rapid evolution of these libraries, the specific issue might be resolved in later versions.
- Before running this script, ensure your environment matches the specified package versions to accurately reproduce the described problem.
