I see that after the redirect is received the returned URL is [decoded to a Unicode string](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/requests/adapters.py#L181). Then requests passes the response to `resolve_redirects` which uses the url to make a new request. This leads to a Unicode string being passed to urllib3 and eventually pyopenssl.

Locate the part of the code where the URL is decoded to a Unicode string in the `requests` library. As mentioned, this happens after a `301` redirection response is handled. Since the exception stack trace points to an interaction with `pyOpenSSL`, it implies the issue might lie in how `requests` processes redirects and how it interfaces with `urllib3`, which in turn interfaces with `pyOpenSSL`. The issue description points to a specific line in `requests/adapters.py`. Although I cannot directly use the line number to find the relevant code without knowing the exact version of the Requests library, I can look for the method that could be handling the redirect flow. The method name isn't explicitly mentioned, but from the context, it likely involves redirect resolution logic.\n\n2. Since `resolve_redirects` seems to be a crucial part of the flow where the bug occurs, an investigation into its implementation should provide insights into how URLs are re-requested after a redirect. This method likely belongs to the Requests library or closely associated with its handling of responses.\n\nBased on this, I will issue the following API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"resolve_redirects\")`: To identify the `resolve_redirects` method's definition in the codebase. This could help in understanding how the URLs are handled and passed through the system.\n\n- `search_code(\"if not isinstance(buf, bytes):\"): To find instances where there is a type check for `buf` against bytes, potentially leading to the exception mentioned in the issue.\n\nThese searches aim to locate the parts of the codebase where the redirect is handled and where the type check that is causing the exception occurs. This should provide a more comprehensive context for the problem at hand."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the `resolve_redirects` method in `requests/sessions.py`, let's address the posed questions:\n\n### What does this part of the code do?\nThis part of the code is responsible for handling HTTP redirects. When a response with a status code indicating a redirect (such as 301, 302, etc.) is received, the method generates a sequence of follow-up requests until a non-redirect response is obtained or the maximum number of redirects is exceeded. It handles the redirection logic, including modifying the request's URL based on the \"Location\" header, adjusting the HTTP method in specific cases (e.g., converting POST to GET after a 301 or 302), removing specific headers, and managing cookies.\n\n### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\nThe issue stems from handling Unicode strings within redirect URL processing. The `resolve_redirects` function plays a crucial role here, as it orchestrates the creation of new requests based on the \u201cLocation\u201d header. The error described (`TypeError: buf must be a byte string`) happens downstream, likely when this prepared request is sent out, which implies that data not properly encoded as bytes is being passed along to lower-level libraries (like `pyOpenSSL` in this context).\n\n### Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\nThe intended behavior would be to correctly handle the redirect URLs, ensuring that by the time any data reaches `pyOpenSSL` or any part of the request sending process that expects bytes, it is properly encoded. This means any URL or headers that might be interpreted as Unicode strings need to be encoded to byte strings before they are passed on, adhering to the expectations of the lower-level network libraries.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis:\nGiven the direct search for the `if not isinstance(buf, bytes):` condition did not yield results, it's likely this check occurs in dependencies (like `pyOpenSSL`) rather than in the `requests` codebase directly. However, knowing that `resolve_redirects` might be improperly handling URL strings before they're sent out, our attention should lean towards how the `requests` library and its dependencies manage string encoding, specifically for URLs.\n\nThe error traceback suggests `pyOpenSSL`'s `sendall` method is where the type check fails, but since that method isn't part of the `requests` library directly, we should instead focus on how `requests` prepares data for transmission.\n\n**Refined Investigative Actions:**\n1. **Verify Encoding of URL Strings:** Ensure that URLs (especially those obtained from redirects) are correctly encoded into byte strings before any network transmission functions are called.\n   \n2. **Trace Data Handling to pyOpenSSL:** Since the initial search didn't locate the exact point of failure within `pyOpenSSL`, it would be practical to examine how encoded URLs are processed or modified further down the sending chain, particularly when transitioning from `requests`/`urllib3` to `pyOpenSSL`.\n\n3. **Inspect Higher Level `send` Method:** Because the `resolve_redirects` method concludes by sending the new request, an investigation into the `self.send` implementation in `requests/sessions.py` could reveal how the request data is prepared and potentially illuminate where the conversion to byte strings should be enforced or verified.\n\nAs a next step, it seems reasonable to investigate the `send` method within `requests/sessions.py` to understand how outgoing requests are processed after being prepared, keeping an eye out for encoding handling:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"send\", \"requests/sessions.py\")`: To examine how requests are sent and ensure data passed to lower-level libraries conforms to expected formats.\n\nThis next step can give clues about the missing link between redirect handling in the `requests` library and the encoding expectations of `pyOpenSSL`."

Given the issue with `pyOpenSSL` expecting byte strings (and not Unicode strings), the method must ensure that any data, specifically URLs, being prepared for a redirect request, is properly encoded to bytes before being passed down the chain where it eventually gets to `pyOpenSSL`.\n\n   This adjustment aims at preserving the existing functionality of handling redirects seamlessly while ensuring that the encoding of URLs and possibly other header fields is compatible with the expected byte string format of lower-level networking libraries. The method should specifically:\n\n   - Verify the encoding of the URL from the \"Location\" header is in byte string format before proceeding with the creation of a new request. If it's not, the method should encode it accordingly.\n   - Ensure that any other headers or data appended to the request that might be subject to encoding issues are also addressed similarly.\n\n   This corrective action would rectify the exception being thrown when handling 301 redirects with the latest `pyOpenSSL` version, as described in the issue."
