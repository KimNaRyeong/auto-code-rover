        "intended_behavior": "The `resolve_redirects` method in the `SessionRedirectMixin` class is tasked with handling HTTP redirects properly. Given the issue with `pyOpenSSL` expecting byte strings (and not Unicode strings), the method must ensure that any data, specifically URLs, being prepared for a redirect request, is properly encoded to bytes before being passed down the chain where it eventually gets to `pyOpenSSL`.\n\nThis adjustment aims at preserving the existing functionality of handling redirects seamlessly while ensuring that the encoding of URLs and possibly other header fields is compatible with the expected byte string format of lower-level networking libraries. The method should specifically:\n\n- Verify the encoding of the URL from the \"Location\" header is in byte string format before proceeding with the creation of a new request. If it's not, the method should encode it accordingly.\n- Ensure that any other headers or data appended to the request that might be subject to encoding issues are also addressed similarly.\n\nThis corrective action would rectify the exception being thrown when handling 301 redirects with the latest `pyOpenSSL` version, as described in the issue."
