Given the constraints and objective, here's a `reproducer.py` script designed to specifically replicate the issue outlined, leveraging the provided function to print a stack trace for better visibility:

```python
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_pyopenssl_redirect():
    try:
        # The GET request should force a redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, reproducing the issue.
        response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/status/301')
        # Assert a response was received to ensure the test proceeds to completion only under correct conditions.
        assert response.status_code == 200, "Did not receive a 200 OK response after redirect."
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Instead of just raising the AssertionError, it captures any exception and asserts false,
        # ensuring that it prints the stack trace and exits with a failure state if any exception is caught.
        assert False, "An error occurred during the request."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_pyopenssl_redirect()
        print("No issue detected. Exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        # This makes sure that if an AssertionError is raised, it exits with a non-zero code indicating failure.
        print(f"AssertionError: {e}")
        exit(1)
```

This script performs a simple HTTP request that is expected to be redirected (using a `301` status code), with the setup presumably prone to causing an issue with pyOpenSSL when certain types of string objects are passed. Please, make sure all the dependencies are installed and match the versions indicated in the description to ensure the environment is correctly set up to trigger the issue. 

If the issue is properly reproduced, the script should exit with code `1` due to an assertion failure, and it will print a detailed stack trace. If the issue doesn't occur, indicating a fixed or non-existent problem under the tested conditions, it will exit with code `0`, signaling the absence of the problem.
