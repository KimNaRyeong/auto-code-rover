        "intended_behavior": "After removing a lookup from the `class_lookups` dictionary, the method should also clear the lookup cache to prevent potential bugs associated with stale or incorrect lookups being used until the cache is manually cleared. This can be achieved by adding a call to `cls._clear_cached_lookups()` at the end of the method's implementation, similar to how the `register_lookup` method operates. This ensures that both registration and unregistration of lookups consistently manage the cache, thereby maintaining the integrity and accuracy of lookup operations."
