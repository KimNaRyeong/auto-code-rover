Corresponding to this change, minor changes need to be brought in the schema.tests.SchemaTests.test_func_unique_constraint_lookups test.\nThe PR generated is \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/15569\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue and collect the necessary context for resolving it, I will perform a series of targeted searches based on the information provided. The issue revolves around the `RegisterLookupMixin` class and specifically its `_unregister_lookup` method, needing changes to clear a lookup cache. Also, it was mentioned that adjustments are needed in a test within `schema.tests.SchemaTests.test_func_unique_constraint_lookups`. Here is a plan to gather the required context:\n\n1. Retrieve the source code of the `RegisterLookupMixin` class to understand its current implementation and how it manages its lookup cache.\n2. Get the implementation details of both `_unregister_lookup` and `register_lookup` methods within the `RegisterLookupMixin` class to see how cache manipulation is currently handled and how it differs between registering and unregistering lookups.\n3. Investigate the specific test `test_func_unique_constraint_lookups` within `SchemaTests` to see the expected behavior and how it may need to change following the modifications in `RegisterLookupMixin`.\n\nBased on this plan, I will invoke the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"RegisterLookupMixin\")`: To get an overview and implementation details of the `RegisterLookupMixin` class.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"_unregister_lookup\", \"RegisterLookupMixin\")`: To get the implementation of the `_unregister_lookup` method.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"register_lookup\", \"RegisterLookupMixin\")`: To get the implementation of the `register_lookup` method.\n4. `search_class_in_file(\"SchemaTests\", \"tests/schema/tests.py\")`: To find the `SchemaTests` class within the specific file path mentioned to look for the `test_func_unique_constraint_lookups` test case.\n5. `search_method_in_file(\"test_func_unique_constraint_lookups\", \"tests/schema/tests.py\")`: To get the details of the `test_func_unique_constraint_lookups` test method within `SchemaTests`."
