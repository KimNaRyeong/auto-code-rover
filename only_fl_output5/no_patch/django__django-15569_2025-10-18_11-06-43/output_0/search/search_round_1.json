        "content": "The collected context from the `RegisterLookupMixin` class and its methods provides valuable insights into the bug and its potential resolution.\n\n### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### RegisterLookupMixin Class\n\nThe `RegisterLookupMixin` serves as a mixin for registering and unregistering lookup types in Django models. Lookups extend the querying capabilities of Django's ORM, allowing for custom query expressions. This class manages a collection of these lookups.\n\n#### _unregister_lookup Method\n\nThe `_unregister_lookup` method is designed to remove a given lookup from the class's lookups. The provided code snippet shows that this operation simply deletes the lookup from the `class_lookups` dictionary based on the `lookup_name`. However, it doesn't clear the cache of lookups, which could lead to stale or incorrect lookups being used until the cache is manually cleared or invalidated otherwise.\n\n#### register_lookup Method\n\nContrary to `_unregister_lookup`, the `register_lookup` method concludes by invoking `cls._clear_cached_lookups()`, which is presumably a method intended to clear any cached lookups. This ensures that after a new lookup is registered, any cache that could contain stale lookups is cleared, preventing the ORM from using outdated lookups.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\n\nGiven the issue description and analyzing the current implementation, the intended behavior of `_unregister_lookup` should include clearing the cache of lookups just like `register_lookup` does. This change ensures consistency in cache handling between registration and unregistration of lookups, preventing potential bugs associated with stale data persisting in the cache.\n\n### Next Steps for Resolution\n\n- **Implement Cache Clearing in _unregister_lookup**: Amend the `_unregister_lookup` method to invoke `cls._clear_cached_lookups()` after removing the lookup from `class_lookups`. This change aligns the unregistration process with the registration process in terms of cache management.\n\n- **Locate and Update Related Tests**: Since the initial attempts to locate the `test_func_unique_constraint_lookups` method were unsuccessful due to a missing file path, an alternative approach to find and analyze this test case is needed. Given the detailed issue description, the test is expected to verify the functional behavior of unique constraint lookups, which may depend on the lookup caching mechanism. Updating this test will likely involve ensuring that it checks for the correct behavior following cache clearance on lookup unregistration.\n\nGiven the collected context and understanding the core issue, the next step would be to correct the file path error in searching for the `SchemaTests` and specifically the `test_func_unique_constraint_lookups` test method. A broader approach might be needed, such as searching for the `SchemaTests` class or the test method across the entire codebase without specifying a file path, acknowledging that the provided file path was incorrect or outdated."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

This can be achieved by adding a call to `cls._clear_cached_lookups()` at the end of the method's implementation, similar to how the `register_lookup` method operates. This ensures that both registration and unregistration of lookups consistently manage the cache, thereby maintaining the integrity and accuracy of lookup operations."
