However, when the colorbar is extended using extend='both', the black lines at the extremities do not show up.\n### Code for reproduction\n```python\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.colors import from_levels_and_colors\nmy_cmap = mpl.cm.viridis\nbounds = np.arange(10)\nnb_colors = len(bounds) + 1\ncolors = my_cmap(np.linspace(100, 255, nb_colors).astype(int))\nmy_cmap, my_norm = from_levels_and_colors(bounds, colors, extend='both')\nplt.figure(figsize=(5, 1))\nax = plt.subplot(111)\ncbar = mpl.colorbar.ColorbarBase(ax, cmap=my_cmap, norm=my_norm, orientation='horizontal', drawedges=True)\nplt.subplots_adjust(left=0.05, bottom=0.4, right=0.95, top=0.9)\nplt.show()\n```\n### Actual outcome\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34058459/164254401-7516988d-1efb-4887-a631-de9a68357685.png)\n### Expected outcome\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34058459/164254881-92c167b7-aa13-4972-9955-48221b38b866.png)\n### Additional information\n_No response_\n### Operating system\n_No response_\n### Matplotlib Version\n3.5.1\n### Matplotlib Backend\n_No response_\n### Python version\n_No response_\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\n_No response_\n</issue>"

Let's focus on the relevant classes and methods that are likely involved in creating the colorbar and handling its appearance, including drawing the edges and extending it:\n\n1. Since the colorbar is created with `mpl.colorbar.ColorbarBase`, we need to look into the `ColorbarBase` class.\n2. To understand how the edges are drawn, especially when `drawedges` is set to `True`, we should explore methods that are related to drawing or rendering the colorbar.\n3. Considering the extension of the colorbar (`extend='both'`), we should investigate how this attribute is handled.\n\nLet's start with the following API calls for gathering sufficient context to address the issue efficiently:\n\n1. Search for the `ColorbarBase` class to understand its implementation.\n2. Search for methods within `ColorbarBase` that could be responsible for drawing edges or handling the `extend` attribute."

Searching for broader terms might help.\n\n2. **Look into Colorbar Creation and Rendering Code**: The issue describes a problem that occurs at the rendering phase of the colorbar, specifically its edges and extensions. We might need to explore how Matplotlib creates and renders colorbars in general.\n\n3. **Search for Colorbar Rendering Functions**: Since class and method searches did not work, functions or utility code that handle rendering might not be methodically encapsulated in the way we expected. \n\nLet's adjust our search strategy based on these considerations:\n\n- **Search for code related to the colorbar creation and rendering**: Since `ColorbarBase` was not found, there may be relevant functions or methods under different names involved in creating or rendering the colorbar.\n\n- **Search for methods or code involving drawing of edges or handling of extensions**: There could be functions specifically designed for handling the visual aspects of the colorbar, including the drawing of edges or the logic for extending the colorbar at both ends.\n\nGiven these strategies, here are the API calls we can make next:\n\n1. Search the entire codebase for code snippets that create or manipulate colorbars, particularly looking for any snippet involving edge drawing or extensions. This could lead us to the relevant parts of the Matplotlib codebase responsible for these features.\n\n2. While specific method names were not successful in the initial search, searching for keywords related to the bug (like \"colorbar\", \"drawedges\", or \"extend\") in code snippets might shed light on how these features are implemented.\n\nLet's make the following adjusted API calls:\n\n- `search_code(\"colorbar\")`: to find any code snippet related to the creation or manipulation of colorbars.\n- `search_code(\"drawedges\")`: to explore how edges are drawn on colorbars or any other related components.\n- `search_code(\"extend\")`: to understand how the extension of colorbars is handled in the codebase."

The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

        "content": "Given the limitations in executing further API calls and the hypothetical nature of the scenario without access to actual search results, I'll outline a hypothetical resolution based on common practices in software development and my understanding of how colorbar extensions and edge drawing might be implemented in a project like Matplotlib.\n\n### 1. Do we need more context:\n\n---\n\n### 2. Where are bug locations:\n\n#### **Location 1:**\n- **File:** `colorbar.py` (Hypothetical file based on where one would expect to find colorbar-related logic in Matplotlib)\n- **Class:** `ColorbarBase` (Even though we couldn't find it through the search, it's reasonable to assume the existence of such a class based on the usage in the issue description)\n- **Method:** `draw_all` (Hypothetically responsible for drawing the colorbar itself, including its edges and extensions)\n\n#### **Intended Behavior:** \nThe `draw_all` method inside the `ColorbarBase` class should be modified or extended to ensure that when the `drawedges` option is set to `True` and `extend` is set to 'both', 'min', or 'max', the edges at the extremities of the colorbar are also drawn. This could involve adjusting the logic that handles the drawing of edge lines to account for the extended parts of the colorbar. It should preserve the existing functionality for all other cases (e.g., when `drawedges` is `False` or `extend` is `neither`). \n\nAdditionally, within the colorbar drawing logic, there should be a check to ensure that when extensions are added, path creation for edge lines includes these areas. It's possible the current implementation neglects to draw edge lines in these extended regions due to a conditional check that fails to consider the `extend` attribute.\n\n---\n\nThis hypothetical resolution is based on an educated guess of where such functionality might reside within the Matplotlib codebase and how it might be implemented. Without direct access to the code via the described API calls, exact filenames, class names, and method names might differ. Normally, one would follow up this guesswork with actual inspections of the code, reading documentation, or checking the Matplotlib project's issue tracker and source code repository to confirm these assumptions."
