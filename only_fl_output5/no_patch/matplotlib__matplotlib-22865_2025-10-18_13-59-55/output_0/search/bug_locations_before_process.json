        "intended_behavior": "The `draw_all` method inside the `ColorbarBase` class should be modified or extended to ensure that when the `drawedges` option is set to `True` and `extend` is set to 'both', 'min', or 'max', the edges at the extremities of the colorbar are also drawn. This could involve adjusting the logic that handles the drawing of edge lines to account for the extended parts of the colorbar. It should preserve the existing functionality for all other cases (e.g., when `drawedges` is `False` or `extend` is `neither`). Additionally, within the colorbar drawing logic, there should be a check to ensure that when extensions are added, path creation for edge lines includes these areas. It's possible the current implementation neglects to draw edge lines in these extended regions due to a conditional check that fails to consider the `extend` attribute."
