        "content": "To address the regression issue described, where `copy(deep=True)` inadvertently changes the dtype of index variables from Unicode (`<U*`) to object in the `xarray` library, we should focus on locating the implementation details of the `copy` method for both `Dataset` and `DataArray` objects. We also need to examine how index variables are copied or manipulated during the deep copy process. Thus, our search strategy will target:\n\n1. The implementation of the `copy` method in `Dataset` and `DataArray`.\n2. How index variables are treated during the copy operations.\n3. Any recent changes in the copy mechanism (since the change occurred after version 0.12.1).\n\nTo achieve this, we will perform the following API calls:\n\n- Search for the `copy` method within the `Dataset` class.\n- Search for the `copy` method within the `DataArray` class.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class('copy', 'Dataset')\nsearch_method_in_class('copy', 'DataArray')\n```"
