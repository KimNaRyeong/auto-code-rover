To address the task at hand accurately, I am providing a corrected version of the `reproducer.py` script that specifically targets the described issue regarding the casting of Unicode indices to object dtype in the context of using `xarray` for copying datasets and data arrays deeply. This new script makes sure to properly reproduce the issue and checks for data type integrity after the deep copy operation as initially intended. Please note that due to the setup requirements, this script assumes the presence of a compatible `xarray` environment where the regression can be observed when running against versions of `xarray` >= 0.12.2 and not manifest in versions <= 0.12.1.

```python
import xarray
import numpy as np
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    ds = xarray.Dataset(
        coords={'x': ['foo'], 'y': ('x', ['bar'])},
        data_vars={'z': ('x', ['baz'])})

    # Executing deep copy
    deep_copied_ds = ds.copy(deep=True)
    deep_copied_z = ds.z.copy(deep=True)

    # Validating dtype consistency post deep copy
    try:
        # Checking for regression where dtype changes to object
        assert deep_copied_ds.x.dtype == np.dtype('<U3'), "Dataset.copy(deep=True) altered dtype to 'object'."
        assert deep_copied_z.coords['x'].dtype == np.dtype('<U3'), "DataArray.copy(deep=True) altered dtype to 'object'."

        print("No regression detected. Exiting with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Indicating presence of the issue

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script precisely attempts to identify the problem related to the casting of Unicode indices to object dtype within deep copies of datasets and data arrays using `xarray`. It should exit with code 0, indicating no issues when the regression is not present, and exit with code 1, capturing and printing the stack trace when the unexpected dtype casting occurs, thus signaling the presence of the regression.
