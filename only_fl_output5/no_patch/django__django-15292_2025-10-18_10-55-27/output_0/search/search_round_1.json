The provided information mentions a specific regression commit and specific class view names, suggesting the need to look into how these names are formatted or retrieved.\n\n1. To get more context on how the view names are being manipulated or presented, especially in the context of CBVs, I will start by searching for the `Http404View` class to understand its implementation, since that's the specific example provided:\n\n```\nsearch_class(\"Http404View\")\n```\n\n2. Given that the issue involves how the views are reported, especially in debug pages, there likely exists a method or function responsible for formatting or extracting these view names. However, without knowing the exact method name, I will search for code snippets that could involve the extraction or formatting of class-based view names, which could be involved in the process of generating the error information on the debug page:\n\n```\nsearch_code(\"Raised by:\")\n```\n\nThese API calls aim to find relevant class implementations and any snippets where the view name formatting could be manipulated, directly addressing the issue's context."

The issue revolves around the incorrect reporting of class-based view names in technical 404 debug pages, indicating a problem in either how the view names are captured or how they are displayed in debug information.\n\nSince class-based views (CBVs) and technical 404 debug pages are involved, we can hypothesize that the mechanisms or utilities responsible for parsing the view names or managing debug information could be the culprit. Given that the regression was mentioned with a specific commit hash, but we cannot search by commit, let's focus on broad mechanisms in Django that handle class names, views, and debug information.\n\nHere are the revised API calls based on these considerations:\n\n1. **Search for utilities or mechanisms handling debug information**: Since Django debug pages display detailed information about errors, including which view raised the error, there must be a part of the framework that handles this logic. We can search for methods or code snippets that are likely involved in processing or displaying debug information. Specifically, we should look for code that might be involved in formatting class names or extracting view details for error reporting.\n\n```\nsearch_code(\"get_resolver_match\")\nsearch_method(\"technical_404_response\")\n```\n\n2. **Examining how view names are formatted or extracted in general**: Since the problem could be in how the view names are transformed into their string representation, it might be worth looking for any utility functions or methods that specifically deal with transforming class-based views into their string names for logging or reporting purposes.\n\n```\nsearch_code(\"view.__class__\")\n```\n\nThese API calls are aimed at finding potentially relevant parts of the Django framework (or the specific project, if it overrides or extends Django's default behaviors) that could influence how view names are processed and reported in debug scenarios. By examining utilities related to error handling and debug information formatting, as well as how class-based view names might be handled, we hope to pinpoint where the regression might have been introduced."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Since actual search results have not yielded direct insights and given the limitations in executing the plan without real output, the precise bug locations cannot be specified based on the information available. However, based on the description of the issue and understanding of how such features are generally implemented in Django, we can theorize potential locations and their intended behavior:\n\nLocation 1: \n- File: Potentially within files managing error handling or debug pages in Django, such as those handling HTTP 404 errors or the technical response mechanism (`views/debug.py`, `middleware/debug.py`, or similar).\n- Class: The class or utility responsible for formatting error messages or extracting view names for the technical 404 response. This might not be explicitly named in the given context, but it's where the view name is prepared for display.\n- Method: A method within this class/utility that formats the view names to be displayed in the debug page. The specific method name cannot be provided without more context.\n\nIntended Behavior:\n- The method responsible for formatting the view names for display in the debug pages should correctly handle class-based views (CBVs). Instead of displaying the class representation including the module and class name in Python's `<class 'module.ClassName'>` format, it should be able to parse and extract the class name alone (`module.ClassName`).\n- This behavior should ensure that when technical information is displayed for debugging purposes, the class-based view names are shown in a user-friendly and consistent manner, easily identifiable by developers debugging the issue.\n- For this correction, the handling should account for different types of views (e.g., function-based views, class-based views) and display their names appropriately, applying the correct parsing logic based on the view type.\n- This would likely involve adjusting or adding logic to the method to check if the view is a class-based view and then formatting the name accordingly before it is included in the error information displayed on the debug page.\n\nWithout direct search results, these details remain speculative, and actual file names, class names, and method names would need to be identified through a detailed examination of the Django framework's source code related to error handling, especially for technical 404 responses."
