Given the regression mentioned, it is imperative to understand how the view names are being handled or transformed when raised by the 404 debug page. The provided information mentions a specific regression commit and specific class view names, suggesting the need to look into how these names are formatted or retrieved.\n\n1. To get more context on how the view names are being manipulated or presented, especially in the context of CBVs, I will start by searching for the `Http404View` class to understand its implementation, since that's the specific example provided:\n\n```\nsearch_class(\"Http404View\")\n```\n\n2. Given that the issue involves how the views are reported, especially in debug pages, there likely exists a method or function responsible for formatting or extracting these view names. However, without knowing the exact method name, I will search for code snippets that could involve the extraction or formatting of class-based view names, which could be involved in the process of generating the error information on the debug page:\n\n```\nsearch_code(\"Raised by:\")\n```\n\nThese API calls aim to find relevant class implementations and any snippets where the view name formatting could be manipulated, directly addressing the issue's context."
