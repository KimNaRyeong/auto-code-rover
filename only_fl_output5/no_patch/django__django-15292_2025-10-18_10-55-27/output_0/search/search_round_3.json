The issue revolves around the incorrect reporting of class-based view names in technical 404 debug pages, indicating a problem in either how the view names are captured or how they are displayed in debug information.\n\nSince class-based views (CBVs) and technical 404 debug pages are involved, we can hypothesize that the mechanisms or utilities responsible for parsing the view names or managing debug information could be the culprit. Given that the regression was mentioned with a specific commit hash, but we cannot search by commit, let's focus on broad mechanisms in Django that handle class names, views, and debug information.\n\nHere are the revised API calls based on these considerations:\n\n1. **Search for utilities or mechanisms handling debug information**: Since Django debug pages display detailed information about errors, including which view raised the error, there must be a part of the framework that handles this logic. We can search for methods or code snippets that are likely involved in processing or displaying debug information. Specifically, we should look for code that might be involved in formatting class names or extracting view details for error reporting.\n\n```\nsearch_code(\"get_resolver_match\")\nsearch_method(\"technical_404_response\")\n```\n\n2. **Examining how view names are formatted or extracted in general**: Since the problem could be in how the view names are transformed into their string representation, it might be worth looking for any utility functions or methods that specifically deal with transforming class-based views into their string names for logging or reporting purposes.\n\n```\nsearch_code(\"view.__class__\")\n```\n\nThese API calls are aimed at finding potentially relevant parts of the Django framework (or the specific project, if it overrides or extends Django's default behaviors) that could influence how view names are processed and reported in debug scenarios. By examining utilities related to error handling and debug information formatting, as well as how class-based view names might be handled, we hope to pinpoint where the regression might have been introduced."

Since actual search results have not yielded direct insights and given the limitations in executing the plan without real output, the precise bug locations cannot be specified based on the information available. However, based on the description of the issue and understanding of how such features are generally implemented in Django, we can theorize potential locations and their intended behavior:\n\nLocation 1: \n- File: Potentially within files managing error handling or debug pages in Django, such as those handling HTTP 404 errors or the technical response mechanism (`views/debug.py`, `middleware/debug.py`, or similar).\n- Class: The class or utility responsible for formatting error messages or extracting view names for the technical 404 response. This might not be explicitly named in the given context, but it's where the view name is prepared for display.\n- Method: A method within this class/utility that formats the view names to be displayed in the debug page. The specific method name cannot be provided without more context.\n\nIntended Behavior:\n- The method responsible for formatting the view names for display in the debug pages should correctly handle class-based views (CBVs). Instead of displaying the class representation including the module and class name in Python's `<class 'module.ClassName'>` format, it should be able to parse and extract the class name alone (`module.ClassName`).\n- This behavior should ensure that when technical information is displayed for debugging purposes, the class-based view names are shown in a user-friendly and consistent manner, easily identifiable by developers debugging the issue.\n- For this correction, the handling should account for different types of views (e.g., function-based views, class-based views) and display their names appropriately, applying the correct parsing logic based on the view type.\n- This would likely involve adjusting or adding logic to the method to check if the view is a class-based view and then formatting the name accordingly before it is included in the error information displayed on the debug page.\n\nWithout direct search results, these details remain speculative, and actual file names, class names, and method names would need to be identified through a detailed examination of the Django framework's source code related to error handling, especially for technical 404 responses."

We're working with a scenario that lacks direct answers, so I'll refine the approach considering typical Django constructs and components that could be involved in the issue at hand.\n\n1. **Search for Debug Page Rendering Logic**: The Django debug page, especially the technical 404 page, must have specific rendering logic. Since we're dealing with the presentation of class views, it's prudent to explore the rendering process of these pages.\n\n   ```\n   search_code(\"technical_404_response\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Examine Class Formatting Utility**: It's likely there's a utility function or method involved in formatting the class names for presentation. This could be centrally located in Django's utilities or more closely tied to error handling.\n\n    ```\n    search_code(\"__name__\")\n    search_code(\"__module__\")\n    ```\n\nThese refined searches aim to capture the broader context within which class names are formatted and presented on debug pages, hopefully leading us to the mechanism where the regression could have been introduced. The issue description suggests a misrepresentation of class names, implicating a breakdown or change in how these names are assembled or displayed.\n\nFurther actions depend on the results of these searches. If they yield parts of the code responsible for error page rendering or class name formatting, those sections could be examined to understand how they currently operate and how they might be failing to properly handle class-based view names.\n\nShould these searches come up empty or not provide enough context to directly address the bug, the next steps would involve a manual review of the commit mentioned in the issue description (0c0b87725bbcffca3bc3a7a2c649995695a5ae3b) within the Django project's repository, if accessible. This would potentially allow for a pinpointing of the changes introduced that caused the regression, albeit that's a step that cannot be directly facilitated through the API calls here.\n\nGiven the current limitations, we'd aim to use the outcomes of these searches or similar logical paths within the project's structure and version history to hone in on the problematic code."

Let's analyze the results:\n\n**1. Django's Technical 404 Response Handling**\n\n- The snippet from `django/views/debug.py` defines `technical_404_response`, a function responsible for creating a technical 404 error response. This function is triggered when a 404 error occurs, and it takes the request and the exception as arguments. Given that the issue pertains to how class-based views (CBVs) are represented in debug pages, this function is likely involved in preparing or rendering the information that includes the CBV names.\n  \n- The relationship of this part to the bug lies in the mechanism for formatting or extracting the view names from the exception to display them in the debug page. If the view name extraction or formatting logic within or invoked by this function incorrectly handles CBVs, it could lead to the described issue.\n\n- The intended behavior would be to properly format the CBV name, removing the unnecessary representation details like `<class 'view_tests.views.Http404View'>` and correctly displaying it as `view_tests.views.Http404View`. Adjustments in this area might involve parsing the exception details to extract and format class names appropriately for CBVs when constructing the debug response.\n\n\n**2. Use of `__name__` and `__module__` in Class Representation**\n\n- The extensive matches for `__name__` and `__module__` throughout the codebase, particularly in files related to models, views, and system utilities, indicate these attributes are widely used for reflection, object identification, and representation purposes within Django. These attributes are key to understanding and manipulating Python class names and modules in a dynamic context, which is common in Django's dynamic URL routing, view resolution, and error reporting systems.\n\n- Given the issue's nature, the bug's relationship to this usage is likely within the context of dynamically identifying and naming view classes when errors occur, particularly in generating debug information for 404 errors. The incorrect representation of CBV names suggests that somewhere within Django's error handling or debug information generation process, there's a misapplication of these attributes resulting in the full Python class representation being output instead of a more readable class path.\n\n- The intended behavior would involve correctly leveraging `__name__` and `__module__` to dynamically and accurately represent view classes in debug information. Specifically, the code should concatenate these attributes in a readable format (e.g., `<module>.<ClassName>`) rather than outputting the direct result of `exception.__class__` or similar, which includes the less-readable angle-bracketed class representation. \n\nTo resolve the reported issue, one would need to inspect or adjust the way `technical_404_response` and possibly other functions that handle error reporting use `__name__` and `__module__` to format CBV names. A patch might involve refining the logic within `technical_404_response` or associated utility functions to ensure CBVs are represented consistently and clearly in debug outputs, aligning with Django's conventions and developers' expectations."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

Specifically, when a CBV is implicated in a 404 error, the function should format the view's name by correctly combining the view's module (`__module__`) and the class name (`__name__`) instead of showing the default Python representation (`<class 'module.ClassName'>`). This adjustment will ensure the debug information is presented in a readable and useful format, specifically `module.ClassName`, which aligns with the issue's requirement. This may involve inspecting the `exception` argument to determine if the error involves a class-based view and, if so, applying the appropriate formatting logic.\n\nThe resolution involves parsing the view or class reference from the exception object more gracefully, ensuring that the technical information rendered on a debug page for a 404 error reflects a clean, user-friendly representation of class-based views. This preserves the existing functionality\u2014providing detailed debug information for developers\u2014while correcting the format in which CBV names are displayed."
