        "intended_behavior": "This function, which is responsible for generating the technical 404 error response, should include enhanced logic for formatting class-based view names. Specifically, when a CBV is implicated in a 404 error, the function should format the view's name by correctly combining the view's module (`__module__`) and the class name (`__name__`) instead of showing the default Python representation (`<class 'module.ClassName'>`). This adjustment will ensure the debug information is presented in a readable and useful format, specifically `module.ClassName`, which aligns with the issue's requirement. This may involve inspecting the `exception` argument to determine if the error involves a class-based view and, if so, applying the appropriate formatting logic."
