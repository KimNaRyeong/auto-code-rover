Specifically, we aim to understand how `HttpResponseBase` and potentially any subclass handle the deletion of cookies and whether the `SameSite` attribute handling, as mentioned in the issue, is indeed lacking or improperly implemented. Here are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. Search for the `HttpResponse` class to find the file it is defined in because the issue mentions modifications to `HttpResponse.delete_cookie`.\n2. Search for the `HttpResponseBase` class, as the issue specifically mentions this class's `delete_cookie` method might not be setting the `SameSite` setting correctly.\n3. Search for the `delete_cookie` method in the entire codebase to identify if there are multiple implementations or overrides in different parts of the codebase.\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class(\"HttpResponse\")\nsearch_class(\"HttpResponseBase\")\nsearch_method(\"delete_cookie\")\n```"
