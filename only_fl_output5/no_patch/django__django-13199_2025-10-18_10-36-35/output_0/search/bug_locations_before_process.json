        "intended_behavior": "The `delete_cookie` method should be updated to preserve the `SameSite` attribute of a cookie when it is being deleted. This can be achieved by modifying the method signature to include a `samesite` parameter, which should then be passed to the `set_cookie` method within. The `samesite` parameter should default to a sensible value (such as 'Lax', following the Django project-wide setting for `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` if it exists) to ensure backward compatibility and adherence to modern security practices. The modification would ensure that when cookies are deleted, they maintain the `SameSite` attribute, thus preventing the browser warnings described in the issue and ensuring that the behavior of cookies (especially around cross-site request handling) remains consistent before and after deletion."
