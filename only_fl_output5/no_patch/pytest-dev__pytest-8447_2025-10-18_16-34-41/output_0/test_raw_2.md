Given the requirements and the objective to programmatically reproduce the issue involving `pytest` plugins that leads to a `TypeError` related to an unexpected keyword argument `'path'`, we can construct a Python script that dynamically creates a minimal plugin environment mimicking the scenario described. This script will set up a minimal test situation to trigger the specific error, capture it, and display the stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. However, it's essential to note that extending beyond the subprocess method to reproduce the internal workings accurately involves directly interacting with `pytest` through its API and possibly requiring the presence of the problematic plugins within the environment.

```python
import pytest
from _pytest.config import Config
import os

# Define the function to print stack trace as provided
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Dummy test file creation simulating the situation
os.makedirs("tests", exist_ok=True)
with open("tests/test_dummy.py", "w") as f:
    f.write("def test_dummy():\n    assert True")

# Attempt to reproduce the issue through pytest's API directly
try:
    config = Config.fromdictargs(args={}, kwargs={
        'plugins': ['pytest_black', 'pytest_checkdocs']
    })
    result = pytest.main(['tests'], plugins=[config])
    if result != 0:
        raise AssertionError("Test execution failed, indicating potential issue presence.")
except TypeError as e:
    print("TypeError caught as anticipated, demonstrating the issue.")
    print_stacktrace(e)
except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected error occurred; this might indicate a problem in the reproduction attempt.")
    print_stacktrace(e)
else:
    print("No issues detected, the test ran successfully.")
```

Save the above script as `reproducer.py` at your project's root level and execute it with `python3 reproducer.py`.

Please note the following:
- The approach attempts to directly use `pytest`'s API to create a situation that would trigger the same issue described. It assumes the presence of the problematic plugins to properly set up the environment.
- The script creates a dummy test file to ensure there's at least one test for `pytest` to collect, mirroring the setup described in the issue.
- The catch for `TypeError` specifically targets the reported error related to the keyword argument `'path'`; however, the approach might need adjustments according to the actual plugin implementations and their compatibility with the `pytest` version in use.

Remember, reproducing plugin-related issues might require the plugins (`pytest-black`, `pytest-checkdocs`) to be installed in your environment. This script assumes those plugins are accessible in the environment where the script is executed.
