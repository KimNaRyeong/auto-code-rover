Here is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that attempts to reproduce the issue described. This script simulates the use of pytest with plugins like pytest-black and pytest-checkdocs that cause an unexpected keyword argument `'path'` error due to a likely incompatibility or misuse of the pytest API. Please place this file in the root directory of the project and run it using `python3 reproducer.py`.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def test_reproduce_issue():
    try:
        import pytest
        from pluggy import HookCallError
        from pytest_black import BlackItem
        from pytest_checkdocs import CheckdocsItem

        # Mocking an empty test file expected by both plugins
        test_file_path = "test_something.py"
        with open(test_file_path, "w") as f:
            pass  # Simply create an empty file

        # Mocking the pytest plugin collect phase
        # Attempt to simulate what happens in the plugin without actual pytest execution
        try:
            # Trying to replicate the scenario with pytest-black
            black_item = BlackItem.from_parent(None, fspath=test_file_path)  # This should cause an error
        except TypeError as e:

        except TypeError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)

        # If we reach this point without an exception, the issue is not reproduced
        assert False, "The expected TypeError was not raised. Issue might have been resolved."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "An unexpected error occurred."


if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_reproduce_issue()
        print("The issue has been successfully reproduced and the expected exception was caught.")
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        # Exiting with code 0 indicating the script worked as intended, even if the issue exists
        exit(0)
```

This script does not precisely replicate the pytest environment or its interaction with its plugins but instead aims to simulate the component that is causing the issue based on the error descriptions provided. Due to the complexity and environment-specific nature of pytest plugins working together, actual behavior may vary and might not be perfectly emulated in a simple script.
