Specifically, when plugins are creating new items (BlackItem, CheckdocsItem, or similar), they should ensure that they are utilizing the from_parent method correctly, passing fspath as part of the constructor's parameters while gracefully handling compatibility with the expected signatures of pytest's node and item classes."
