Specifically, we're interested in understanding how the `from_parent` method is expected to be used with `BlackItem` and `CheckdocsItem`, as well as inspecting the definitions and usages of `__init__` methods that are not accepting `path` as a keyword argument.\n\nFirst, let's target the classes mentioned and their `from_parent` method implementations, if available directly:\n1. Search for the class `BlackItem` to understand how it's structured.\n2. Search for the class `CheckdocsItem` to understand its structure as well.\n3. Since `pytest_collect_file` is mentioned as the point of failure, searching for this method's usage in both related plugins (pytest-black and pytest-checkdocs) could provide insight into how they're attempting to use `from_parent`. However, without the specific file names, we'll look for the method itself to see if there are comments or other methods nearby that could give us clues about the correct usage or recent changes.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"BlackItem\")\nsearch_class(\"CheckdocsItem\")\nsearch_method(\"pytest_collect_file\")\n```\n\nThese searches will help us to understand the expected parameters and structure of the `BlackItem` and `CheckdocsItem` classes, how `from_parent` is supposed to work with these classes, and the context around the `pytest_collect_file` method which might be influencing the incorrect argument usage."
