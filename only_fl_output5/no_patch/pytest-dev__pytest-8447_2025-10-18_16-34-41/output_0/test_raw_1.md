Given the feedback and the aim to create a more accurate reproducer for the issue described, let's amend the approach to directly invoke pytest programmatically in a manner that simulates the environment causing the error. We'll create a script that sets up a minimal test file and then runs pytest with the necessary plugins programmatically, checking for the presence of the specific TypeError.

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_pytest_with_plugin(plugin):
    try:
        # Create an empty test file
        test_file_name = 'test_something.py'
        open(test_file_name, 'w').close()

        # Command to run pytest programmatically with the specified plugin
        command = [
            sys.executable, '-m', 'pytest',
            '--plugins', plugin,
            test_file_name
        ]
        result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True)

        if "TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'path'" in result.stderr:
            raise AssertionError("Issue with 'path' keyword argument found.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        # If the specific TypeError is caught, that means the issue is present
        print("AssertionError: ", e)
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An error occurred:", e)
        print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    plugins = ['pytest-black', 'pytest-checkdocs']
    for plugin in plugins:
        print(f"Testing with {plugin}...")
        run_pytest_with_plugin(plugin)
```

This script attempts to mimic the situation where pytest is run with either the `pytest-black` or `pytest-checkdocs` plugin and checks if the "unexpected keyword argument 'path'" error occurs. 

Note that this script may not directly catch the exception in a `try...except` block because it executes pytest as a subprocess. Instead, it looks for the specific error message in the standard error output from pytest. If the error message is found, it raises an `AssertionError`, which indicates that the described issue is present.

The script doesn't precisely emulate the internal pytest environment, rather it checks if running pytest with each plugin leads to the particular error message, which is the main concern described in the initial problem. 

Also, note that to accurately test this script, the environment should have the necessary plugins (`pytest-black` and `pytest-checkdocs`) along with `pytest` installed. This can be done via pip beforehand.
