Given the feedback that the previous script failed due to a missing module error with `skimage`, I'll adjust the approach to avoid using external libraries that may not be present or installed in the target environment. Since we are working with images, we can accomplish a basic comparison using `matplotlib`'s functionality alone, which should be sufficient for detecting significant discrepancies between the two saved images without needing a structural similarity index. This will sidestep the issue of unmet dependencies.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_figure_save():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    # Set up figure
    matplotlib.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use'] = True
    fig, ax_dict = plt.subplot_mosaic('AB;AC', figsize=(6, 9), width_ratios=[3, 2],
                                      layout='compressed')

    arr = np.arange(100).reshape((10, 10))
    for key in ["B", "C"]:
        ax_dict[key].imshow(arr)
        
    # Save the figure twice
    fig.savefig("test1.png", bbox_inches="tight")
    fig.canvas.draw()  # Redraw the canvas before the second save
    fig.savefig("test2.png", bbox_inches="tight")

    # Load saved images and compare
    image1 = plt.imread("test1.png")
    image2 = plt.imread("test2.png")

    # Checking if the arrays are identical
    if not np.array_equal(image1, image2):
        raise AssertionError("The images are not identical.")

try:
    test_figure_save()
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Ensure the script exits with a non-zero code for failure cases.
else:
    print("Issue not found, images match.")
    exit(0)
```

This modified version does the following:

- It uses `matplotlib` to load and compare the images. This avoids the dependency on `skimage` or other external libraries not directly related to the initial problem context.
- It compares the images directly using `numpy.array_equal`, which checks if the two arrays are exactly the same. This method is suitable for this scenario since any difference in the layout settings should result in a noticeable change in the saved images.
- By drawing the canvas (`fig.canvas.draw()`) before saving the second time, it ensures any dynamic changes are rendered, though this might not be strictly necessary for this reproducibility script. It's more of a safegaurd against potential drawing issues.
