To address the issue accurately with an executable python file named `reproducer.py`, here is a corrected and complete script. This version corrects earlier omissions and errors, incorporating the function to print stack traces for exceptions as requested. It also ensures that necessary imports are made and follows the proper structure to attempt to reproduce the bug related to the "compressed layout setting" being forgotten on the second save as described.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_figure_save():
    import matplotlib
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    arr = np.arange(100).reshape((10, 10))

    matplotlib.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use'] = True

    fig, ax_dict = plt.subplot_mosaic('AB;AC', figsize=(6, 9), width_ratios=[3, 2],
                                      layout='compressed')

    for key in ["B", "C"]:
        ax_dict[key].imshow(arr)
        
    fig.savefig("test1.png", bbox_inches="tight")
    fig.savefig("test2.png", bbox_inches="tight")

    # Attempt to compare saved images by size (an indirect approach to detect changes)
    size1 = plt.imread("test1.png").size
    size2 = plt.imread("test2.png").size

    if size1 != size2:
        raise AssertionError("Image sizes do not match, indicating a potential issue.")

try:
    test_figure_save()
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Ensure the script exits with a non-zero code for failure cases.
else:
    print("Issue not found, or the images match.")
    exit(0)
```

This script checks whether the issue, as stated, can be reproduced in the user's environment. It attempts to capture the described bug regarding matplotlib's behavior when saving figures with compressed layout settings. It saves two images under the assumption that any significant discrepancy due to the bug would result in different image sizes, which can be a simple yet effective way to detect differences without comparing the actual image content. 

Please note, this approach makes an indirect comparison by checking file sizes, effectively assuming that different layouts result in different image sizes/file sizes, which might not capture all variations of the bug (especially subtle layout shifts that don't affect file size). However, this should suffice for most scenarios where the layout dramatically changes.
