Here are the API calls we need to make:\n\n1. Check how `subplot_mosaic` is implemented since it's directly involved in arranging the subplots and might handle the \"compressed\" layout.\n2. Look into the implementation of `savefig` to understand how it processes `bbox_inches=\"tight\"` and if it changes any layout settings.\n3. Investigate how `rcParams` are applied and if changing them directly might cause issues with repeated save operations.\n\nBased on this, here are the specific API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"subplot_mosaic\")`: To get insight into how `subplot_mosaic` method works and how it handles the \"compressed\" layout.\n- `search_method(\"savefig\")`: To understand how the `savefig` function behaves, especially with `bbox_inches=\"tight\"` parameter and within the context of saving figures multiple times with layout constraints.\n- `search_code(\"rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use'] = True\")`: To find out where and how `rcParams` are being modified in the codebase, possibly affecting layout behavior between saves."
