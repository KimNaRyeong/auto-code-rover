        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. modelformset_factory (django/forms/models.py)\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `modelformset_factory` function is responsible for creating a `FormSet` class for a specified Django model class. It configures options such as fields, form widgets, labels, help_texts, and error messages, among others, based on the given parameters. This factory function also determines which form and formset base classes to use and sets up validation settings.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug**\n  The issue arises when `empty_permitted` is explicitly passed via `form_kwargs` to a formset, resulting in a crash upon rendering the `empty_form`. The `modelformset_factory` does not directly handle `form_kwargs` for `empty_form`, instead, this is delegated to the `FormSet` class it creates. There's no explicit handling of `empty_permitted` for `empty_form` in the code snippet provided.\n\n- **Intended behavior**\n  Based on the issue, `empty_permitted` should either be ignored or correctly handled for `empty_form` to prevent the `KeyError` during rendering. The factory function should ensure that formsets are flexible enough to handle `form_kwargs` without causing errors for properties irrelevant to `empty_form`.\n\n#### 2. BaseFormSet.empty_form (django/forms/formsets.py)\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `empty_form` property in the `BaseFormSet` class generates a template form that's used for JavaScript-based form duplication on the client side. It specifically sets `empty_permitted` to `True` and then applies additional form kwargs through `self.get_form_kwargs(None)`. This form is meant to be a blueprint rather than a form to be directly filled out and submitted.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug**\n  The bug occurs when rendering this `empty_form` in a scenario where `empty_permitted` is explicitly passed via `form_kwargs`. The `empty_form` method does hardcode `empty_permitted=True`, but since it also dynamically applies `form_kwargs`, there's a potential overlap or conflict which could trigger the observed crash.\n\n- **Intended behavior**\n  The `empty_form` should gracefully handle or ignore `empty_permitted` passed through `form_kwargs`, ensuring it does not cause crashes or unexpected behavior when being rendered in templates.\n\n#### 3. BaseFormSet.__init__ (django/forms/formsets.py)\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `__init__` method for `BaseFormSet` initializes formset instances with several parameters, including `form_kwargs`, which is stored directly without any specific processing. This suggests that `form_kwargs` is intended to be flexible and used downstream, presumably in creating individual form instances.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug**\n  Since `__init__` simply stores `form_kwargs`, the handling or mismanagement of these kwargs, especially with respect to `empty_form`, could directly relate to the bug. `form_kwargs` being passed down to the `empty_form` without considering its relevance or potential conflicts could cause the `KeyError`.\n\n- **Intended behavior**\n  The initialization should ensure `form_kwargs` are handled in a way that prevents key conflicts or errors in `empty_form` and other formset forms. Specifically, there should be a mechanism to either filter out or adequately manage `empty_permitted` when passed to `empty_form`.\n\n#### Next Steps for Further Context\n\nGiven the results and the inability to find direct usage of `{{ formset.empty_form }}` in the codebase, a closer examination of template rendering mechanisms in Django for formsets might be needed. Additionally, it's worth investigating how `get_form_kwargs` is implemented and works within the `BaseFormSet` class, as this could shed light on how kwargs are passed to `empty_form`:\n\n- Investigate implementation of the `get_form_kwargs` method used by `empty_form`.\n  ```python\n  search_method_in_class(\"get_form_kwargs\", \"BaseFormSet\")\n  ```\n\nThese actions should help bridge the gap between the observed issue and the underlying cause, ultimately guiding towards a solution."

An approach could be to modify the `get_form_kwargs` method (used within `empty_form`) to exclude `empty_permitted` from the kwargs for `empty_form` only. This preserves the intended behavior of making `empty_form` validation-agnostic while ensuring that user-specified `form_kwargs` do not lead to errors.\n\n   - **Location 2**: File: `django/forms/formsets.py`, Class: `BaseFormSet`, Method: `__init__`\n   \n     **Intended Behavior**: Though `__init__` might not directly contribute to the bug, ensuring that `form_kwargs` is handled appropriately could prevent similar issues. A safeguard or documentation note could be added to clarify how `form_kwargs` will be used throughout the formset, especially with respect to special properties like `empty_permitted`. However, the primary fix should focus on `empty_form` handling of `form_kwargs` to directly resolve the issue at hand without altering the basic functionalities of `__init__`."
