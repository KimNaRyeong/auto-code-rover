An approach could be to modify the `get_form_kwargs` method (used within `empty_form`) to exclude `empty_permitted` from the kwargs for `empty_form` only. This preserves the intended behavior of making `empty_form` validation-agnostic while ensuring that user-specified `form_kwargs` do not lead to errors."

A safeguard or documentation note could be added to clarify how `form_kwargs` will be used throughout the formset, especially with respect to special properties like `empty_permitted`. However, the primary fix should focus on `empty_form` handling of `form_kwargs` to directly resolve the issue at hand without altering the basic functionalities of `__init__`."
