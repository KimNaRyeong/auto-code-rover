        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to collect context about the Django codebase related to formsets and the handling of `empty_permitted` in form kwargs. Specifically, we should look at how formsets manage their `empty_form` property to understand why passing `empty_permitted` in `form_kwargs` is causing a `KeyError`.\n\nTo gather the required context, we will perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. Search for the definition and implementation of `modelformset_factory` to understand its behavior and parameters, especially concerning `form_kwargs`.\n   ```python\n   search_function(\"modelformset_factory\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the issue involves formsets and their `empty_form`, we should explore how `empty_form` is implemented within the formset class. This means we need the class definition of the formset that handles the `empty_form` logic.\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"empty_form\", \"BaseFormSet\")\n   ```\n\n3. The issue description suggests that a `KeyError` occurs due to passing `empty_permitted` in `form_kwargs`, so it would be beneficial to inspect how `form_kwargs` are processed within the formset's logic, especially where `empty_form` is generated.\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"BaseFormSet\")\n   ```\n\n4. Since the crash happens when rendering the `empty_form` in a template, examining the rendering process for formsets in templates might provide additional insights. This involves searching how Django templates handle rendering formsets and the `empty_form`.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"{{ formset.empty_form }}\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches will help gather the necessary code context to understand the cause of the issue and identify where modifications need to be made to resolve it."
