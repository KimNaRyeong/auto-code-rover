It must ensure that the metadata and data representation for VLAs are consistent, such that when a FITS file is written and later compared to itself or an identical copy using FITSDiff, no differences are reported due to mismanagement or incorrect metadata handling of VLAs. The fix should preserve the existing functionality for handling regular arrays and other data types, ensuring only VLAs handling is adjusted if found to be the cause of the issue."

The goal here is to ensure that VLAs are accurately represented in table HDUs, aligning data storage with expectations and FITS standards. Any fix should address potential inconsistencies in VLA handling that might affect FITSDiff's ability to correctly compare FITS files, especially ensuring that comparisons of the file to itself correctly report as identical."
