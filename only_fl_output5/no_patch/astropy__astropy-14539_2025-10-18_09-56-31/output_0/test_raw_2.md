To address the issue and ensure the correct execution of the script, we will include a check for missing dependencies like the `packaging` module, which was missing in the previously attempted execution environment. The revised `reproducer.py` script will attempt to reproduce the issue with `io.fits.FITSDiff` and include error handling for missing dependencies. It will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present and exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed, as requested.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_dependencies():
    try:
        import astropy
        import packaging.version
    except ImportError as e:
        missing_module = str(e).split("'")[1]
        print(f"Missing required dependency: {missing_module}")
        print("Please install the missing module and try again.")
        exit(1)

def reproduce_issue():
    from astropy.io import fits
    col = fits.Column('a', format='QD', array=[[0], [0, 0]])
    hdu = fits.BinTableHDU.from_columns([col])
    hdu.writeto('diffbug.fits', overwrite=True)

    try:
        identical = fits.FITSDiff('diffbug.fits', 'diffbug.fits').identical
        assert identical, "FITSDiff reports differences between identical files."
        print("No issue detected, FITSDiff correctly reports no differences.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Issue detected: FITSDiff incorrectly reports differences between identical files.")
        raise e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_dependencies()
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with an error code
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with an error code
    else:
        exit(0)  # Exit with no error if the issue is not reproduced
```

This Python script, `reproducer.py`, should be placed in the root directory of the project and executed with Python 3 using the command `python3 reproducer.py`. The script first checks for the necessary dependencies (`astropy` and `packaging`) and then proceeds to reproduce the issue with `io.fits.FITSDiff`. If the script raises an `AssertionError`, this indicates the issue is present, and the custom `print_stacktrace` function will provide comprehensive error details. If the script does not encounter the issue, it will exit with code 0, signaling that the issue was not reproduced under the current conditions.
