Below is an updated version of the `reproducer.py` file designed to reproduce the issue as specified, with the function `print_stacktrace` correctly formatted and included in the script. This script will produce an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, allowing it to serve as a test verifying the bug's existence. The script will exit with a status code of 0 if the issue is resolved, indicating the absence of the bug.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    from astropy.io import fits
    col = fits.Column('a', format='QD', array=[[0], [0, 0]])
    hdu = fits.BinTableHDU.from_columns([col])
    hdu.writeto('diffbug.fits', overwrite=True)

    try:
        identical = fits.FITSDiff('diffbug.fits', 'diffbug.fits').identical
        assert identical, "FITSDiff reports differences between identical files."
        print("No issue detected, FITSDiff correctly reports no differences.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        raise AssertionError("FITSDiff reports differences between identical files.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with an error code
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with an error code
    else:
        exit(0)  # Exit with no error if the issue is not reproduced
```

When executing `python3 reproducer.py`, the script checks for the specific issue with `io.fits.FITSDiff` reporting differences between identical files potentially caused by variable-length arrays. If the issue exists, it will trigger an `AssertionError`, and the custom `print_stacktrace` function will provide detailed information, making it easier to understand and debug the problem. If the script completes without triggering the `AssertionError`, it will exit with code 0, indicating that the problem has been resolved or does not exist in the current environment.
