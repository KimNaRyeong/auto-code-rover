Based on your request for a Python script that should reproduce the issue of `CountVectorizer` with a custom analyzer ignoring the input argument and follow the given specifications, here's a standalone `reproducer.py` script. This script is designed to directly address the issue, expecting `CountVectorizer` to not work as intended when the input type is explicitly set to 'filename' with a custom analyzer function. Please note, the expected behavior and precise nature of the "fix" can vary depending on the interpretation of the original issue:

```python
# reproducer.py
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_test_file(content, filename="test_file.txt"):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(content)

def main():
    # Setup - creating a test file
    test_content = "hello world"
    test_filename = "test_file.txt"
    create_test_file(test_content, test_filename)

    try:
        cv = CountVectorizer(analyzer=lambda x: x.split(), input='filename')
        # Attempt to fit using a list that should be interpreted as filenames due to input type
        cv.fit([test_filename])
        
        # Expected to raise an error if attempting to use 'filename' input with a custom analyzer,
        # as the custom analyzer should only receive raw document content, not filenames.
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present: CountVectorizer with custom analyzer is not ignoring the 'input' argument as expected.")

    except ValueError as e:
        # This catch block is based on the prediction that a ValueError might occur if the implementation checks for consistency
        # between the 'analyzer' and 'input' arguments.
        print("Issue fixed or behavior changed. ValueError caught indicating potential input type checks.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(0)
    
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred, possibly indicating a different problem.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except SystemExit as e:
        pass  # Exiting gracefully, status code should already be set by main()
    except Exception as ex:
        print("An unexpected exception prevented the script from executing properly.")
        print_stacktrace(ex)
        sys.exit(2)
```

Please ensure that this script is executed in an environment where `scikit-learn` is properly installed and built, as your reported error suggests an issue with the `scikit-learn` installation or build process, not necessarily with the `CountVectorizer` itself.
