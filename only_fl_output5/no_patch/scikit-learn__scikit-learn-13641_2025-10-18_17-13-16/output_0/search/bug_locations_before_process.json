        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the intended behavior should ensure that when the `input` parameter is set to 'filename' or 'file', the `CountVectorizer` properly handles file inputs\u2014specifically, it should check if the input is meant to be treated as file paths and then read the content from these files before applying the custom analyzer function. This ensures that the custom analyzer can work seamlessly with file inputs as well, without ignoring the `input` parameter.\n\n- In the `__init__` method, the existing functionality is preserved by maintaining all current parameter defaults and behaviors. However, documentation or validation logic around the `input` parameter may need to be updated to reflect its compatibility with custom analyzers when set to handle filenames.\n\n- In the `fit` method, the intended behavior would be adding logic to handle the 'filename' or 'file' input. This could involve:\n\n  1. Detecting when the `input` parameter is set to these values.\n  2. Implementing a mechanism to read document content from the files specified in the input list.\n  3. Ensuring that this content is then processed by the custom analyzer if one is provided.\n\nThis approach maintains the existing functionality for all other use cases (e.g., when `input='content'`) and extends the class's capabilities to handle file inputs with custom analyzers correctly. The solution should also strive to minimize code duplication, perhaps by abstracting file reading logic into a helper method if not already present and reusable within the class."
