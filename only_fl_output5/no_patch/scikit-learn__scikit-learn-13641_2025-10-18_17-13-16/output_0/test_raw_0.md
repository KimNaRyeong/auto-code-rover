This script will attempt to reproduce the reported issue by initializing a `CountVectorizer` with a custom analyzer and setting the `input` argument to `'filename'`. Since the correct behavior regarding the `input` argument in combination with a custom analyzer is unclear without further clarification or documentation, the script assumes that the presence of `AssertionError` indicates the issue is present when the initial expectations are not met. If improvements or fixes are applied to `CountVectorizer` handling, adjustments to the assert condition and message might be necessary to reflect the correct behavior.
