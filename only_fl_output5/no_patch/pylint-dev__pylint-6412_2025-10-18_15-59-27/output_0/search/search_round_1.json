Specifically, we need to know how the `__implements__` attribute is being used and potentially locate where the change to use `ABCMeta` could be integrated. Let's start by gathering the necessary code context:\n\n1. First, to get an overview of where checkers and reporters are defined, we should look for any class that is being used as a checker or reporter. However, without specific class names, we need to find a broader entry point. Let's start by locating the core of PyLinter's functionality related to checker and reporter categorization.\n   \n2. We need to find the location where PyLinter deals with the `__implements__` attribute. This might be in a method that processes plugins or initializes them.\n\n3. Finally, understanding how PyLinter initializes its plugins (checkers/reporters) can provide insight into where to best integrate the ABCMeta check and retain backward compatibility with the `__implements__` method.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls seem pertinent:\n\n- `search_code(\"__implements__\")` to find how and where `__implements__` is used in the codebase.\n- `search_class(\"PyLinter\")` to get a sense of the PyLinter class and potentially identify methods dealing with plugin initialization or categorization.\n\nThese calls aim to give us a good starting point for understanding the current implementation and how to approach adding support for `isinstance` checks with `ABCMeta`."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insights into how `__implements__` is currently used in the Pylint codebase and how the `PyLinter` class is structured, which should inform our approach to implementing the feature requested in the issue.\n\n### Analysis of `__implements__` Usage\n\nThe search results showing usage of `__implements__` reveal a few key points:\n\n1. **Deprecation of `__implements__`:** The code snippet from `pylint/interfaces.py` indicates an ongoing deprecation of `__implements__` in favor of using basic inheritance patterns. This deprecation warning suggests a strategic move away from the custom `__implements__` approach towards more conventional Python class inheritance mechanisms, which aligns with the issue's proposal to use `ABCMeta`.\n\n2. **Use in Plugin System:** The references in `pylint/interfaces.py` and `pylint/pyreverse/inspector.py` show that `__implements__` is used to determine if certain classes (likely checkers or reporters) implement specific interfaces. This functionality is crucial for plugin categorization and interaction within Pylint.\n\n### Relationship with the Issue\n\nThe issue aims to replace or augment the `__implements__` mechanism with `ABCMeta` to categorize checkers and reporters, suggesting a shift towards Python's abstract base classes for interface definition and checking. The deprecation of `__implements__` and its role in plugin categorization directly relate to the issue's goals by indicating where and how the project's code could evolve to incorporate `ABCMeta`.\n\n### PyLinter Class Structure\n\nThe overview of the `PyLinter` class provides insight into areas relevant to the proposed changes:\n\n1. **Plugin Loading and Registration:** Methods such as `load_default_plugins`, `register_checker`, and `register_reporter` are potential points of integration for the new `ABCMeta` check. Since these methods deal with loading and registering plugins (checkers/reporters), enhancing them to include `isinstance` checks alongside the existing `__implements__` logic could be an effective strategy.\n\n2. **Initialization and Configuration:** The `initialize` method and related configuration loading methods may need adjustments or enhancements to support the initial setup of `ABCMeta`-based interface checks.\n\n3. **Checker and Reporter Management:** Functions managing or utilizing checkers and reporters, like `get_checkers` or `prepare_checkers`, might also be areas where `isinstance` checks using `ABCMeta` could be integrated.\n\n### Intended Behavior Post-Implementation\n\nThe intended behavior, following the implementation of the feature request, would involve the `PyLinter` class (and potentially other parts of the codebase) using `isinstance` checks alongside or instead of `__implements__` checks to categorize and manage checkers and reporters. Such a change aims to standardize the way these components are recognized and processed within Pylint, leveraging Python's built-in mechanisms for enforcing interface compliance and improving plugin extensibility and maintenance.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps could include identifying specific places where `ABCMeta` can be introduced, planning for the coexistence or phased removal of `__implements__`, and ensuring that any new class definitions for checkers or reporters conform to this revised approach."

This means that when checkers or reporters are registered, the PyLinter should be able to recognize them based on whether they are instances of a specific abstract base class (or classes), without solely relying on the `__implements__` attribute. This requires defining new abstract base classes for checkers and reporters (if not already defined) using `ABCMeta` and adjusting these methods to recognize checkers and reporters based on these new abstract classes. This modification should preserve backward compatibility by still supporting the `__implements__` attribute during a transition period.\n\n### Bug Location 2:\n- **File:** pylint/interfaces.py\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\n- This file should introduce new abstract base classes for the checkers and reporters using `ABCMeta`. Each checker or reporter class should then be updated to inherit from these new abstract base classes instead of or in addition to using the `__implements__` attribute. The \"implements\" function within interfaces.py could be revised or supplemented with a new mechanism that leverages `isinstance` checks against these new abstract base classes to understand whether a given object conforms to the expected interface.\n\n### General Consideration:\n- Ensure the newly introduced `ABCMeta` classes and the transition to `isinstance` checks do not break the existing plugin/loading mechanism. Maintain a compatibility layer that supports both the new and old ways of defining and categorizing checkers/reporters to ensure a smooth transition for existing plugins."
