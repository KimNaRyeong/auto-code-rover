        "content": "To properly address the issue of supporting `isinstance` checks through `ABCMeta` for checkers and reporters in PyLinter, we need to understand the current implementation of how PyLinter categorizes checkers and reporters. Specifically, we need to know how the `__implements__` attribute is being used and potentially locate where the change to use `ABCMeta` could be integrated. Let's start by gathering the necessary code context:\n\n1. First, to get an overview of where checkers and reporters are defined, we should look for any class that is being used as a checker or reporter. However, without specific class names, we need to find a broader entry point. Let's start by locating the core of PyLinter's functionality related to checker and reporter categorization.\n   \n2. We need to find the location where PyLinter deals with the `__implements__` attribute. This might be in a method that processes plugins or initializes them.\n\n3. Finally, understanding how PyLinter initializes its plugins (checkers/reporters) can provide insight into where to best integrate the ABCMeta check and retain backward compatibility with the `__implements__` method.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls seem pertinent:\n\n- `search_code(\"__implements__\")` to find how and where `__implements__` is used in the codebase.\n- `search_class(\"PyLinter\")` to get a sense of the PyLinter class and potentially identify methods dealing with plugin initialization or categorization.\n\nThese calls aim to give us a good starting point for understanding the current implementation and how to approach adding support for `isinstance` checks with `ABCMeta`."
