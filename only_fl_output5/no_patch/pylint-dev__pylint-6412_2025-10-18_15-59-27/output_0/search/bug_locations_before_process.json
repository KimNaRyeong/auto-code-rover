        "intended_behavior": "In addition to the current functionality, these methods should be enhanced to support `isinstance` checks using `ABCMeta` for categorizing checkers and reporters. This means that when checkers or reporters are registered, the PyLinter should be able to recognize them based on whether they are instances of a specific abstract base class (or classes), without solely relying on the `__implements__` attribute. This requires defining new abstract base classes for checkers and reporters (if not already defined) using `ABCMeta` and adjusting these methods to recognize checkers and reporters based on these new abstract classes. This modification should preserve backward compatibility by still supporting the `__implements__` attribute during a transition period."

        "intended_behavior": "This file should introduce new abstract base classes for the checkers and reporters using `ABCMeta`. Each checker or reporter class should then be updated to inherit from these new abstract base classes instead of or in addition to using the `__implements__` attribute. The \"implements\" function within interfaces.py could be revised or supplemented with a new mechanism that leverages `isinstance` checks against these new abstract base classes to understand whether a given object conforms to the expected interface."
