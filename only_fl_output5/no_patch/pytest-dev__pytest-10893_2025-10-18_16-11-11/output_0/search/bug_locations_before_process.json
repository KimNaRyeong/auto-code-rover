Preserve functionality to recursively remove directory trees while handling errors. This should include a version check to ensure backwards compatibility with versions of Python before 3.12, potentially by conditionally using onerror or onexc based on the Python version in use."

It would then appropriately record the duration of the test execution, aligning with CPython 3.12's expectations for test results. This addition aims to prevent warnings when -We is used, ensuring pytest remains compatible with the latest Python version without causing errors due to unimplemented methods in test result objects."
