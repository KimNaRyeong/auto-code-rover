Something in Pytest's temp path fixtures calls an `rm_rf` function which calls `rmtree` with the `onerror` parameter. https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/6dcd652d4a55bacda01a15017e155caa816e15a5/src/_pytest/pathlib.py#L147 When warnings are treated as errors, this makes pytest fail any test using temp paths.\nAdd `addDuration` to `TestCaseFunction`\ncpython 3.12  (alpha) has added an `addDuration` API to test results (python/cpython#12271).\nThis would not be an issue, except it was designed to trigger a warning if the test result doesn't have such a method (hence e.g. python/cpython#103309). This means when using pytest as runner for unittest tests *and* running `-We` an error is triggered as pytest's test result (which seems to be `TestCaseFunction`) does not support this protocol.\nNow obviously this should be non-blocking, as hopefully nobody is running CI which blocks on testing 3.12, but there you go, I figure an early forewarning can't hurt.\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### `src/_pytest/pathlib.py` and `rm_rf` Function\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `rm_rf` function is designed to recursively remove the contents of a specified path, even if some elements within that path are read-only. It utilizes Python's `shutil.rmtree` function to achieve this, passing an `onerror` callback that is partially applied with the `start_path` variable to handle any errors occurring during the deletion process.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue mentions that the use of `rmtree` with the `onerror` parameter is causing a `DeprecationWarning` in Python 3.12 alpha because `rmtree`'s interface was changed to replace `onerror` with `onexc`. The code snippet from `src/_pytest/pathlib.py` is directly related to the mentioned bug as it shows the exact use of `rmtree` that triggers the warning.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Given the changes in Python 3.12, the intended behavior should remain the same \u2013 to safely remove directory trees handling errors gracefully. However, to adapt to the new Python version, the code must be updated to use the `onexc` parameter instead of `onerror`, adhering to the updated `rmtree` interface while maintaining compatibility with previous Python versions.\n\n#### `TestCaseFunction` in `src/_pytest/unittest.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - `TestCaseFunction` inherits from `Function` and appears to be a wrapper class around a unit test case, providing methods to manage test setup, teardown, error handling, and reporting of test outcomes. It encapsulates test case execution logic, making it compatible with pytest's test runner mechanisms.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue describes a warning triggered by CPython's unittest framework's new `addDuration` API, which expects test result objects to have an `addDuration` method implemented. Since `TestCaseFunction` acts as a pytest representation of a test case, lacking this method means pytest cannot satisfy the new contract expected by CPython, leading to a warning when warnings are treated as errors.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - To resolve the issue, `TestCaseFunction` should implement an `addDuration` method. This method would likely accept the test case and the duration of the test, updating the internal state of the `TestCaseFunction` instance with this information. This would make pytest compatible with the new requirement introduced in Python 3.12, preventing the warning when `-We` is used and thus avoiding errors in test runs under these conditions.\n\n### Next Steps for Patch Development\n\nBased on the analysis, developing a patch would involve:\n\n1. Modifying the `rm_rf` function in `src/_pytest/pathlib.py` to adapt to the `rmtree` interface changes by replacing `onerror` with `onexc`. This may involve checking Python's version at runtime to maintain backward compatibility.\n\n2. Implementing an `addDuration` method in the `TestCaseFunction` class within `src/_pytest/unittest.py` to comply with the new CPython unittest requirement. This includes designing how the duration is captured and stored within instances of `TestCaseFunction`.\n\nFurther detailed analysis and testing are required to implement these changes correctly, ensuring they work across different Python versions while adhering to pytest's architectural principles."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Preserve functionality to recursively remove directory trees while handling errors. This should include a version check to ensure backwards compatibility with versions of Python before 3.12, potentially by conditionally using `onerror` or `onexc` based on the Python version in use.\n\n   - **Location 2:**\n     - **File:** `src/_pytest/unittest.py`\n     - **Class:** `TestCaseFunction`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** Implement a new method `addDuration` within the `TestCaseFunction` class. This method should accept parameters for the test case and the duration of the test. It would then appropriately record the duration of the test execution, aligning with CPython 3.12's expectations for test results. This addition aims to prevent warnings when `-We` is used, ensuring pytest remains compatible with the latest Python version without causing errors due to unimplemented methods in test result objects. \n\nThe preservation of existing functionality while adjusting compatibility to meet new Python version requirements is key to resolving these issues in pytest."
