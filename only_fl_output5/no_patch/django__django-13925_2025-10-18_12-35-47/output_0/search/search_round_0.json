        "content": "To address the issue reported, it's crucial to inspect the implementation details of some entities specifically mentioned in the issue. The primary focus should be on:\n\n1. The inheritance pattern used in the models, especially those inheriting from `Entity`, as mentioned with the example involving class `User`.\n2. The definition of the primary key for the `Entity` class and how it is supposed to propagate to child models.\n3. Current settings or configurations related to `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`, which might be affecting the primary key behavior in Django 3.2 alpha.\n\nGiven this, the API calls required to gather necessary contextual information are:\n\n1. Search for the `Entity` class to understand how the primary key is defined there, which should be inherited by child classes like `User`.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Entity\")\n```\n\n2. Search for the `User` class, as it is explicitly mentioned in the issue. This will help in understanding how the `Entity` class inheritance is handled.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"User\")\n```\n\n3. Since the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting is mentioned in the warnings, it would be helpful to find where and how it might be defined or used within the project codebase. This setting could either be located in a Django settings file or within specific AppConfig classes as per the hints provided in the issue description.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD\")\n```\n\nThese search API calls are targeted to uncover how primary keys are managed in inheritance scenarios within the project and to identify potential mismatches with Django 3.2 alpha's expectations for `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` configuration. This information will be essential for diagnosing the root cause of the issue and forming a strategy for the patch."
