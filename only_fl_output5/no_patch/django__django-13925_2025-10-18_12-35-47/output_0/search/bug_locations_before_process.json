If the project relies on inheriting a custom field as a primary key from a base model, `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` should be set to this custom field type or ensure that the base model's definition does not conflict with auto field creation. This might involve setting `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` to `'django.db.models.BigAutoField'` if larger IDs are preferred or ensuring that it remains `AutoField` if not explicitly required. The target is to make sure primary key generation is consistent and respects model inheritance without generating unnecessary warnings."

The intention here is to address the `models.W042` warning by explicitly defining what Django should use as an auto-created primary key in the absence of a field defined in the model."
