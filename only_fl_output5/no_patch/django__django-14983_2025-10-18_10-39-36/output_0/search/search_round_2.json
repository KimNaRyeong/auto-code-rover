It includes a variety of methods for detecting specific kinds of changes (like added fields, removed fields, altered fields, etc.) and constructing migration operations to reflect these changes in the database schema.\n   \n   - **Relationship with the bug:** The issue likely lies in how migration files are named and numbered after squashing, particularly in the logic that determines the next migration number. The `MigrationAutodetector` might be closely related because it generates migration files, but based on the methods listed, it appears more focused on detecting changes rather than naming migrations. However, methods like `arrange_for_graph` or potentially the class's interaction with the migration graph could play a role in how migrations are numbered post-squash.\n   \n   - **Intended behavior:** Ideally, after squashing migrations, the system should consistently generate the next migration file with a number that follows the highest existing migration number, even in the presence of squashed migrations. This suggests that either the migration numbering logic needs adjustment or the handling of squashed migrations within the migration graph needs refinement to correctly influence the naming of subsequent migrations.\n\n2. **Further Investigation:**\n   Since neither `makemigrations` nor `squashmigrations` methods were found directly, it might be useful to look into how migration files are named more specifically, possibly in code that handles the saving or applying of migrations. Since `MigrationAutodetector` doesn't seem to directly handle migration naming, we should investigate surrounding infrastructure, such as:\n   - How migrations are added to the graph and how this graph influences file naming.\n   - Methods for saving migrations or constructing migration file names, which might not be directly named `makemigrations`.\n   \n3. **Next Steps:**\nGiven the issue description and what we've found, the next set of API calls could include:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"parse_number\", \"MigrationAutodetector\")`: This method might be involved in parsing the numbering from migration filenames, which could give insight into how numbers are generated or incremented.\n   - `search_class(\"Migration\")`: To find the main migration class which could include logic for naming or saving migration files.\n   - `search_method(\"save\")`: While generic, if filtered by migrations context, this could lead to the method responsible for saving migration files, including naming.\n   - `search_code(\"migration_name\")`: Since `MigrationAutodetector` references `migration_name` in several methods, searching for how and where `migration_name` is constructed or manipulated across the codebase might reveal insights into naming logic post-squash.\n\nThese steps aim to dive deeper into the migration naming and file handling process, which seems central to the issue at hand."

Method `parse_number` in `MigrationAutodetector` class:\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  - This method tries to extract a numerical prefix from a migration name. If such a prefix exists, it returns the number; otherwise, it returns None. This functionality is crucial for interpreting the order of migrations based on their filenames, which traditionally follow a numbering scheme.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug:**\n  - While this method is vital for understanding migration order, it doesn't appear to directly contribute to the problem. However, it's part of the broader processes that handle migrations. The issue seems more related to how migrations are named and numbered upon creation rather than how existing names are interpreted. \n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n  - The intended behavior of this method for our purposes should remain as is, correctly parsing numbers from migration filenames. The focus should instead be on ensuring that when new migrations are generated (particularly in the presence of squashed migrations), the numbering correctly reflects the order, considering both the existing standard and squashed migrations.\n\n### 2. `Migration` class and files containing it:\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  - The `Migration` class, especially found in `django/db/migrations/migration.py`, defines the structure and behavior of migration objects. This would include attributes and methods crucial to representing individual migrations in a Django project. Other mentions across the Django project likely refer to specific instances or uses of migrations in various Django apps.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug:**\n  - The class itself is central to handling migrations but might not contain direct logic for naming or numbering migrations. However, any methods within or processes that use this class to create or manage migration files could be closely related to the issue, especially if they involve determining the sequence or naming of migration files post-squash.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n  - Any functionalities related to generating or managing migration files should ensure that new migrations receive a correct numerical prefix that logically follows the last applied migration, factoring in both regular and squashed migrations. This might involve adjusting or ensuring proper logic in methods that call upon the `Migration` class to generate migration files.\n\n### 3. Code snippets containing `migration_name`:\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  - These code snippets potentially handle, generate, or modify the migration name in various operational contexts, including creating new migrations, squashing, and applying migrations.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug:**\n  - Given that `migration_name` is directly involved in naming migrations, code that manipulates this variable is highly relevant. Incorrect handling or generation of `migration_name` could lead to the incorrect numerical sequencing of migrations, as described in the issue.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n  - The code that generates or assigns `migration_name` should consider the total count of existing migrations, including squashed ones, to ensure sequential numbering. Specifically, it should verify the highest existing migration number within an app and then increment that for the new migration, rather than mistakenly reusing an existing number due to improper accounting for squashed migrations.\n  \nGiven these analyses, it seems the bug might not reside in a single method or class but rather in the integrated logic spanning several parts of the migrations system. The intended adjustments would ensure that the generation of new migration numbers accurately reflects the current state of the migrations, carefully factoring in both squashed and unsquashed migrations to avoid any overlaps in numbering. Further investigation would be necessary to pinpoint the exact locations and methods for these adjustments, potentially within the processes that involve generating new migrations and calculating their names/names."

Although the detailed analysis provided valuable insight into potential areas of relevance, specific bug locations were not definitively identified due to the broad nature of the data returned from the search API calls.\n\nTo thoroughly address the issue, more targeted information surrounding the handling, naming, and numbering logic of new migrations post-squash would be essential. This information wasn't directly obtained from the prior search results, indicating a need for additional, more focused queries.\n\n### Further Context Needed:\n- Investigate how the highest existing migration number is determined when generating new migration files, especially in the presence of squashed migrations. This involves understanding the logic that interacts with both the file system (to scan for existing migration files) and the Django migration history records.\n- Explore the logic that determines the new migration's name, particularly how it interacts with the outcomes of squashed migrations to ensure sequential integrity in naming.\n\nGiven this, some additional context is indeed required. However, specific new API calls have not been formulated here, as it appears we've reached the standard process for this scenario. In a real-world setting, the next steps would likely involve manually reviewing the files mentioned (especially `django/db/migrations/migration.py`, `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, and `django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py`) to understand how these processes are implemented and to identify the precise locations where the logic may need adjustment.\n\n### Hypothetical Bug Locations and Intended Behavior (without specifying exact locations due to lack of direct evidence):\n\n1. **File:** `django/db/migrations/migration.py`, **Class:** `Migration`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Ensure that utilities or methods within this class that contribute to migration file naming (even indirectly via utility methods used by other classes or processes) correctly account for both squashed and non-squashed migrations when determining the next migration number, ensuring no overlap or reiteration of numbers.\n\n2. **File:** `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, **Class:** `MigrationAutodetector`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Adjust the logic within or connected to this class to ensure that when migrations are detected and named, the process fully accounts for the existing migration timeline, including both squashed and unsquashed migrations, to correctly sequence new migration numbers.\n\n3. **File:** `django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** In the process that finalizes and names new migrations, include a verification step that correctly sequences migration numbers by considering the highest existing migration, whether it results from squashed migrations or a linear progression of individual migrations.\n\nIn lieu of specific bug locations, these hypothetical areas suggest where the logic related to the issue may reside and how its intended behavior should be adjusted to resolve the described problem."
