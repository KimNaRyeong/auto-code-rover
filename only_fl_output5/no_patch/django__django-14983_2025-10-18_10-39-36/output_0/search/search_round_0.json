It does make sense though when only 0001_squashed_0002_auto_20141202_1234 is left.\nAlthough the latter case eventually hits every project, I'd prefer the former.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To understand and resolve the issue with incorrect migration numbering when squashing migrations, we need to find and examine the part of the codebase that deals with migration generation, especially how filenames are determined after squashing. Key components likely involve the migration creation and squashing logic, which means identifying relevant classes and methods dealing with migrations.\n\n1. We need to find the class responsible for handling migrations in Django. The name `MigrationAutodetector` sounds like a good starting point because it is likely involved in detecting changes to models and generating migration files based on those changes.\n   \n2. We also need to identify the method that generates the migration file names. A method name like `makemigrations` or something similar could be responsible for this part of the process, or potentially a method specifically for determining the next migration number.\n\n3. It would also be beneficial to find the class or method responsible for handling the squashing of migrations, as understanding how squashed migrations are tracked and named could provide insight into why the incorrect numbering occurs.\n\nBased on these needs, the following API calls would be useful:\n\n- `search_class(\"MigrationAutodetector\")`: To find the class responsible for detecting changes and suggesting migrations.\n- `search_method(\"makemigrations\")`: This method might be spread across different classes, looking globally might help locate the relevant part.\n- `search_method(\"squashmigrations\")`: This would help in finding the method(s) responsible for squashing migrations which might give us insight into naming conventions post-squash.\n\nLet's start with these calls to gather the initial context required to address the issue."
