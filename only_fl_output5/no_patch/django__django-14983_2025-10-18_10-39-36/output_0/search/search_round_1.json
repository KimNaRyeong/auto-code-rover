It does make sense though when only 0001_squashed_0002_auto_20141202_1234 is left.\nAlthough the latter case eventually hits every project, I'd prefer the former.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To understand and resolve the issue with incorrect migration numbering when squashing migrations, we need to find and examine the part of the codebase that deals with migration generation, especially how filenames are determined after squashing. Key components likely involve the migration creation and squashing logic, which means identifying relevant classes and methods dealing with migrations.\n\n1. We need to find the class responsible for handling migrations in Django. The name `MigrationAutodetector` sounds like a good starting point because it is likely involved in detecting changes to models and generating migration files based on those changes.\n   \n2. We also need to identify the method that generates the migration file names. A method name like `makemigrations` or something similar could be responsible for this part of the process, or potentially a method specifically for determining the next migration number.\n\n3. It would also be beneficial to find the class or method responsible for handling the squashing of migrations, as understanding how squashed migrations are tracked and named could provide insight into why the incorrect numbering occurs.\n\nBased on these needs, the following API calls would be useful:\n\n- `search_class(\"MigrationAutodetector\")`: To find the class responsible for detecting changes and suggesting migrations.\n- `search_method(\"makemigrations\")`: This method might be spread across different classes, looking globally might help locate the relevant part.\n- `search_method(\"squashmigrations\")`: This would help in finding the method(s) responsible for squashing migrations which might give us insight into naming conventions post-squash.\n\nLet's start with these calls to gather the initial context required to address the issue."

It includes a variety of methods for detecting specific kinds of changes (like added fields, removed fields, altered fields, etc.) and constructing migration operations to reflect these changes in the database schema.\n   \n   - **Relationship with the bug:** The issue likely lies in how migration files are named and numbered after squashing, particularly in the logic that determines the next migration number. The `MigrationAutodetector` might be closely related because it generates migration files, but based on the methods listed, it appears more focused on detecting changes rather than naming migrations. However, methods like `arrange_for_graph` or potentially the class's interaction with the migration graph could play a role in how migrations are numbered post-squash.\n   \n   - **Intended behavior:** Ideally, after squashing migrations, the system should consistently generate the next migration file with a number that follows the highest existing migration number, even in the presence of squashed migrations. This suggests that either the migration numbering logic needs adjustment or the handling of squashed migrations within the migration graph needs refinement to correctly influence the naming of subsequent migrations.\n\n2. **Further Investigation:**\n   Since neither `makemigrations` nor `squashmigrations` methods were found directly, it might be useful to look into how migration files are named more specifically, possibly in code that handles the saving or applying of migrations. Since `MigrationAutodetector` doesn't seem to directly handle migration naming, we should investigate surrounding infrastructure, such as:\n   - How migrations are added to the graph and how this graph influences file naming.\n   - Methods for saving migrations or constructing migration file names, which might not be directly named `makemigrations`.\n   \n3. **Next Steps:**\nGiven the issue description and what we've found, the next set of API calls could include:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"parse_number\", \"MigrationAutodetector\")`: This method might be involved in parsing the numbering from migration filenames, which could give insight into how numbers are generated or incremented.\n   - `search_class(\"Migration\")`: To find the main migration class which could include logic for naming or saving migration files.\n   - `search_method(\"save\")`: While generic, if filtered by migrations context, this could lead to the method responsible for saving migration files, including naming.\n   - `search_code(\"migration_name\")`: Since `MigrationAutodetector` references `migration_name` in several methods, searching for how and where `migration_name` is constructed or manipulated across the codebase might reveal insights into naming logic post-squash.\n\nThese steps aim to dive deeper into the migration naming and file handling process, which seems central to the issue at hand."
