Below is an example standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that attempts to reproduce the issue described. For the given issue, which involves a discrepancy in rendering LaTeX output from Sphinx, the script automates Sphinx project creation, builds the documentation in LaTeX format, and inspects the resulting LaTeX file for the correctly separated terms. An assertion is made against the expected formatting pattern. If the formatting does not match the expected pattern (i.e., newline separation or specific LaTeX constructs indicating separation), an `AssertionError` is raised, alongside a stack trace of the issue. The script exits with code 0 if the LaTeX output meets the expectations (i.e., when the issue is fixed or not present).

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

Please note:
- This script assumes you have Sphinx installed and available in your environment. If not, run `pip install sphinx` before executing the script.
- Adjustments might be needed for the assertion related to the LaTeX content check based on the specific output structure generated by Sphinx for your environment or Sphinx version.
- The example uses `xelatex` as the LaTeX engine; adjust this according to the original issue's context or requirements.
