Given the error messages you've encountered, it seems the primary issue in reproducing the described bug is the absence of the `antlr4` dependency, which is vital for parsing LaTeX expressions with SymPy. Before I modify the script to include a check and reminder for this dependency, let's address the feedback you've provided.

It's important to ensure the environment has all required dependencies correctly installed to avoid errors that prevent script execution. For reproducing the LaTeX parsing issue correctly, you'll need both `sympy` and `antlr4-python3-runtime` installed in your Python environment. The revised `reproducer.py` script will include a pre-check for these dependencies and proceed to reproduce the issue with enhanced error handling:

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_dependencies():
    missing_deps = []
    try:
        import sympy
    except ImportError:
        missing_deps.append('sympy')
    try:
        import antlr4
    except ImportError:
        missing_deps.append('antlr4-python3-runtime')

    if missing_deps:
        raise ImportError(f"Missing dependencies: {', '.join(missing_deps)}. "
                          "Please install them using pip or conda.")

def main():
    check_dependencies()  # Ensure we have all required dependencies.
    
    from sympy.parsing.latex import parse_latex

    try:
        # Parse the given LaTeX expression
        parsed_expression = parse_latex("\\frac{\\frac{a^3+b}{c}}{\\frac{1}{c^2}}")
        # Convert parsed expression to string
        parsed_expression_str = str(parsed_expression)
        # Assert that the parsed expression matches the expected format
        assert parsed_expression_str == '((a**3 + b)/c)/(1/(c**2))', "Parsed expression does not match the expected output."
        print("Parsed expression matches the expected output.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Indicate failure

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Ensure to exit with code 1 in case of any error
    sys.exit(0)  # Indicate success if no exception was raised
```

This script includes a pre-execution check to inform you of missing dependencies (`sympy` and `antlr4-python3-runtime`). Make sure both are installed in your environment to ensure the script functions correctly. Running this script in an environment where these dependencies are met should allow you to successfully reproduce the LaTeX parsing issue or confirm its resolution.
