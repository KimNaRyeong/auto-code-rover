Based on your requirements and the function provided for printing a stack trace, below is the revised standalone Python script intended to reproduce the LaTeX parsing issue. This version directly moves into attempting to parse the problematic LaTeX expression, and it will output a stack trace if the parsed expression doesn't match the expected output. If the parsing works as expected, it should exit with code 0.

Here's how `reproducer.py` should be structured:

```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Ensure the necessary library is imported.
    try:
        from sympy.parsing.latex import parse_latex
    except ImportError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code if sympy is not installed.

    try:
        expression = "\\frac{\\frac{a^3+b}{c}}{\\frac{1}{c^2}}"
        expected = '((a**3 + b)/c)/(1/(c**2))'
        
        # Parse the LaTeX expression.
        parsed_expression = parse_latex(expression)
        # Convert the parsed expression to its string representation.
        parsed_expression_str = str(parsed_expression)
        
        # Check if the parsed expression matches the expected result.
        if parsed_expression_str != expected:
            raise AssertionError("Parsed expression does not match the expected output.")
        print("Issue is not present, parsed expression matches the expected output.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code in case of any exception.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script will try to parse the described LaTeX expression, compare the output with the expected result, and handle the AssertionError accordingly. If the issue persists — meaning the actual parsed result does not equal the expected result — the script will print a stack trace detailing where the mismatch occurs.

Please make sure to install the required `sympy` package (and ensure it's the correct version that still exhibits the issue), as well as any other dependencies that might be required for `sympy.parsing.latex.parse_latex` to work correctly, before running this script.
