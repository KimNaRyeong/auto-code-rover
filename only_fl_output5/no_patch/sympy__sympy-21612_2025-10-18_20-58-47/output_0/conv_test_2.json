        "content": "Given the error messages you've encountered, it seems the primary issue in reproducing the described bug is the absence of the `antlr4` dependency, which is vital for parsing LaTeX expressions with SymPy. Before I modify the script to include a check and reminder for this dependency, let's address the feedback you've provided.\n\nIt's important to ensure the environment has all required dependencies correctly installed to avoid errors that prevent script execution. For reproducing the LaTeX parsing issue correctly, you'll need both `sympy` and `antlr4-python3-runtime` installed in your Python environment. The revised `reproducer.py` script will include a pre-check for these dependencies and proceed to reproduce the issue with enhanced error handling:\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\nimport sys\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef check_dependencies():\n    missing_deps = []\n    try:\n        import sympy\n    except ImportError:\n        missing_deps.append('sympy')\n    try:\n        import antlr4\n    except ImportError:\n        missing_deps.append('antlr4-python3-runtime')\n\n    if missing_deps:\n        raise ImportError(f\"Missing dependencies: {', '.join(missing_deps)}. \"\n                          \"Please install them using pip or conda.\")\n\ndef main():\n    check_dependencies()  # Ensure we have all required dependencies.\n    \n    from sympy.parsing.latex import parse_latex\n\n    try:\n        # Parse the given LaTeX expression\n        parsed_expression = parse_latex(\"\\\\frac{\\\\frac{a^3+b}{c}}{\\\\frac{1}{c^2}}\")\n        # Convert parsed expression to string\n        parsed_expression_str = str(parsed_expression)\n        # Assert that the parsed expression matches the expected format\n        assert parsed_expression_str == '((a**3 + b)/c)/(1/(c**2))', \"Parsed expression does not match the expected output.\"\n        print(\"Parsed expression matches the expected output.\")\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        sys.exit(1)  # Indicate failure\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        main()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        sys.exit(1)  # Ensure to exit with code 1 in case of any error\n    sys.exit(0)  # Indicate success if no exception was raised\n```\n\nThis script includes a pre-execution check to inform you of missing dependencies (`sympy` and `antlr4-python3-runtime`). Make sure both are installed in your environment to ensure the script functions correctly. Running this script in an environment where these dependencies are met should allow you to successfully reproduce the LaTeX parsing issue or confirm its resolution."
