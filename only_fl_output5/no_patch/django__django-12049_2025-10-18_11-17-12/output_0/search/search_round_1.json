From the issue description, the critical part of the code resides within `django/db/migrations/executor.py`. The specific code block mentioned involves column name comparison, and possibly related to the `Executor` class or functions handling database migrations. The description also mentions the use of `migrations.AddField` and an issue with handling case sensitivity in collations, especially with ForeignKey relationships.\n\nWe can start by looking for the `Executor` class in the specified file and the function or method related to getting table descriptions or handling migrations to see how column names are compared.\n\nHence, the initial set of API calls we can use includes:\n- search_class_in_file('Executor', 'django/db/migrations/executor.py')\n- search_method_in_file('get_table_description', 'django/db/migrations/executor.py')\n- search_code_in_file(\"if field.column not in column_names:\", 'django/db/migrations/executor.py')\n\nThese searches aim to provide a detailed look into how migrations are executed with regard to column name handling and might offer insight into how to resolve the case sensitivity issue mentioned."

        "content": "The provided code snippet from `django/db/migrations/executor.py` within the `MigrationExecutor` class, specifically in the `detect_soft_applied` function, gives us a direct look into the part of Django's migration mechanism that's relevant to the reported issue. Let's address the points raised to understand the situation fully:\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `detect_soft_applied` function is responsible for determining whether a migration has been applied without actually running it. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the schema already matches what the migration would do, helping to avoid errors or unnecessary changes. The code snippet shown performs a part of this logic:\n\n- It retrieves a list of column names from a table in the database (`get_table_description` function).\n- It checks if the column specified by a field in a migration file is present in the list of column names from the database (`if field.column not in column_names:`).\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue arises from the case-sensitive comparison done by the condition `if field.column not in column_names:`. In databases with case-insensitive collation, a column named \"countryCode\" would be considered different from \"countrycode\" in a Python comparison, even though the database treats them as identical. This mismatch causes Django to mistakenly think that the required column is not present in the database, leading to errors during migration processes that assume otherwise.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior in handling database migrations, especially when interacting with databases that have case-insensitive collation, would be to perform a case-insensitive comparison of column names. This means the `detect_soft_applied` function needs to ensure that when it checks if a column is present, the comparison accounts for the possibility that the database does not distinguish between \"countryCode\" and \"countrycode\". Essentially, the comparison logic should align with the collation rules of the database being used.\n\nGiven these insights, the next steps would involve adjusting the comparison to be case-insensitive, ensuring compatibility with databases utilizing case-insensitive collation. To proceed, we might need to explore modifying the code block to handle column name comparison in a case-insensitive manner or look into other parts of the Django codebase that handle column and table name comparisons. A potential approach could involve normalizing the case of both the database column names and the column names specified in the migrations before comparing them. \n\nTo further refine the solution, it might be necessary to gather more context on how Django interacts with databases regarding case sensitivity and column name handling. This could involve:\n- Searching for where `get_table_description` is defined to understand its output better.\n- Looking into the database backend (specifically introspection) to see if there's existing functionality for case-insensitive comparison of names.\n- Exploring how Django currently handles database collations and if there\u2019s a standardized approach for case-insensitive operations that could be applied here."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

A potential solution could involve normalizing the case of both the database column names and the column names specified in the migration file before performing the comparison. This could be achieved by converting all column names to lower case (or upper case) before the `if field.column not in column_names:` check. This modification would preserve the existing functionality of detecting whether a migration has been applied, while also addressing the issue of case sensitivity in databases with case-insensitive collation. Here is a suggested approach for modifying the comparison logic:\n\n```python\n# Normalize column names to lower case for case-insensitive comparison\nnormalized_column_names = [column.name.lower() for column in self.connection.introspection.get_table_description(self.connection.cursor(), table)]\nif field.column.lower() not in normalized_column_names:\n    return False, project_state\n```"
