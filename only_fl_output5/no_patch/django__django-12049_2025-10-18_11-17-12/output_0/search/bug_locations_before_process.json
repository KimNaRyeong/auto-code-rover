        "intended_behavior": "The code within this method should be modified to perform case-insensitive comparison of column names to ensure compatibility with databases that use case-insensitive collation. A potential solution could involve normalizing the case of both the database column names and the column names specified in the migration file before performing the comparison. This could be achieved by converting all column names to lower case (or upper case) before the if field.column not in column_names: check. This modification would preserve the existing functionality of detecting whether a migration has been applied, while also addressing the issue of case sensitivity in databases with case-insensitive collation. Here is a suggested approach for modifying the comparison logic:\n\n# Normalize column names to lower case for case-insensitive comparison\nnormalized_column_names = [column.name.lower() for column in self.connection.introspection.get_table_description(self.connection.cursor(), table)]\nif field.column.lower() not in normalized_column_names:\n    return False, project_state"
