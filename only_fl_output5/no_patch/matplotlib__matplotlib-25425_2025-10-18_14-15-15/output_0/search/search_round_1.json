While this indeed corresponds to `AxesImage.get_size`, this is not consistent with the numpy API, where `array.shape = (nrows, ncols)` and `array.size = nrows * ncols`.\nPerhaps we can consider 1) tweaking `__str__` to `AxesImage(shape=(nrows, ncols))` instead, and add `get_shape` as an alias for `get_size`?  Alternatively, `get_shape` could return `self._A.shape` (i.e., including whether the data is colormapped, RGB, or RGBA), and we could use *that* info in `__str__`?  (displaying whether the data is colormapped/RGB/RGBA seems reasonably useful)\n### Proposed solution\n_No response_\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the gathered context along with the issue description provides some insights into the necessary next steps:\n\n1. **AxesImage Class Details**:\n   - The `AxesImage` class, found in `lib/matplotlib/image.py`, does not currently have `get_size`, `__str__`, or `get_shape` methods implemented directly in it. This lack suggests we potentially have the flexibility to introduce the `get_shape` method as requested and adjust the `__str__` representation without conflicting with existing implementations.\n\n2. **Absence of get_size and __str__ Methods**:\n   - Since `get_size` and `__str__` were not found in the `AxesImage` class search results, it implies that `get_size` is not implemented (contradicting the issue's reference) or it's implemented in a superclass or in a way that wasn't directly searchable using the given method name. The absence of `__str__` means a default representation is currently in use, or it's customized in a base class not directly overridden by `AxesImage`.\n   \n3. **Potential to Add get_shape Method**:\n   - There's no existing `get_shape` method within `AxesImage`, which aligns with the issue's suggestion for new functionality. Adding this method could offer a numpy-like API experience, enhancing the library's intuitiveness for its users. Given that usage of `self._A.shape` appears in `lib/matplotlib/image.py`, it's probable `AxesImage` manages its underlying image data in an attribute (`_A`) that supports a `.shape` property, closely mirroring numpy arrays. This implementation detail would be crucial for defining a `get_shape` method accurately.\n\n4. **self._A.shape References**:\n   - With `self._A.shape` being referenced multiple times in `lib/matplotlib/image.py`, there's a solid basis to infer how image dimensions are handled. The use of `self._A.shape` implies that the image data adheres to a structure similar to that of numpy arrays, which usually include dimensions as `(rows, columns, channels)`. Leveraging this for `get_shape` could potentially extend its usage to include depth information, aligning with one of the issue's alternative suggestions.\n\nGiven these insights, to proceed effectively, it\u2019s important to understand how image properties, particularly size and shape, are managed within the `AxesImage` or its base class. Also, reviewing the actual uses of `self._A.shape` within `lib/matplotlib/image.py` is crucial to inform the precise implementation of the `get_shape` method. Further, since neither `get_size` nor `__str__` methods were directly found within `AxesImage`, exploring their implementations in any base classes or superclasses of `AxesImage` is necessary.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis:\n\nTo get more context and find the appropriate places for adding or modifying code:\n- Investigate the superclass(es) of `AxesImage` to find if `get_size` or `__str__` methods are defined there.\n  - `search_class(\"AxesImage\")` ---> Review the `AxesImage` class code for any superclass.\n- Look for `get_size` and `__str__` implementations in the superclass(es).\n  - Since the direct search did not yield results, searching for these methods in the base classes might be required or inspecting more thoroughly the file containing `AxesImage` for inherited methods.\n- Examine how `self._A.shape` is used within `lib/matplotlib/image.py` to understand its data structure and extract necessary details for implementing `get_shape`.\n  - `search_code_in_file(\"self._A.shape\", \"lib/matplotlib/image.py\")`"

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This method should leverage `self._A.shape` to provide the dimensions of the underlying image data. This addition would make the API more consistent with numpy, enhancing user familiarity and expectations around its behavior.\n\n**Bug Location 2**:\n   - File: `lib/matplotlib/image.py`\n   - Class: AxesImage\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Modify or implement the `__str__` method to display the image's shape in a format that is consistent with numpy's `shape` attribute, e.g., `AxesImage(shape=(nrows, ncols[, nchannels]))`. This change requires consulting the new `get_shape` method (or directly `self._A.shape` if more applicable) to produce a more informative and consistent string representation. Such a representation would not only make it clear what the dimensions of the image are but also, if decided upon, include depth information where applicable (colormapped, RGB, RGBA)."
