        "intended_behavior": "This method, if primarily focused on providing dimensions, should be adjusted or clarified to get_shape to align with numpy's terminology and the issue's suggestion. If get_size is meant to exist separately (e.g., for calculating total pixel count), then get_shape should be added as a new method. However, if get_size's logic fits the description of what get_shape aims to achieve, it should be renamed to get_shape and ensure it returns a tuple of the image dimensions, potentially including depth for color images. The method must preserve backward compatibility if possible or provide a clear transition path for users."

        "intended_behavior": "Implement the __str__ method to override the default string representation. This method should utilize the (potentially new) get_shape method or directly access self._A.shape to construct a string that includes the image shape in a manner reflecting the numpy convention, e.g., 'AxesImage(shape=(nrows, ncols[, nchannels]))'. This enhanced description aids in debugging, logging, or any user interface interactions where the object is represented as a string. The implementation should consider the presence of color channels (depth) and include this information in a concise, understandable format."
