While this indeed corresponds to `AxesImage.get_size`, this is not consistent with the numpy API, where `array.shape = (nrows, ncols)` and `array.size = nrows * ncols`.\nPerhaps we can consider 1) tweaking `__str__` to `AxesImage(shape=(nrows, ncols))` instead, and add `get_shape` as an alias for `get_size`?  Alternatively, `get_shape` could return `self._A.shape` (i.e., including whether the data is colormapped, RGB, or RGBA), and we could use *that* info in `__str__`?  (displaying whether the data is colormapped/RGB/RGBA seems reasonably useful)\n### Proposed solution\n_No response_\n</issue>"

Here are the necessary API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `AxesImage` class to understand its structure and currently implemented methods.\n   - `search_class(\"AxesImage\")`\n\n2. Find where the `get_size` method is implemented within the `AxesImage` class to understand its current functionality.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"get_size\", \"AxesImage\")`\n\n3. Look for the `__str__` method in the `AxesImage` class to see how it's currently implemented, as the issue suggests modifying it.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__str__\", \"AxesImage\")`\n\n4. Since adding a `get_shape` method is suggested, we should also check if it already exists or if any method returns `self._A.shape`, as mentioned in the issue's proposed solution.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"get_shape\", \"AxesImage\")`\n   - `search_code(\"self._A.shape\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide us with sufficient context to understand how `get_size`, and `__str__` are implemented in the `AxesImage` class and assess whether a `get_shape` method exists or how to potentially integrate it into the class."
