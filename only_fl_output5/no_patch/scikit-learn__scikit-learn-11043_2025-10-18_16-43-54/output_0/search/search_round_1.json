As noted in #10648, it can be easy for users to miss that they need to set validate=False to pass through a DataFrame without converting it to a NumPy array. I think it would be more user-friendly to have `validate='array-or-frame'` by default, which would pass through DataFrames to the function, but otherwise convert its input to a 2d array. For strict backwards compatibility, the default should be changed through a deprecation cycle, warning whenever using the default validation means a DataFrame is currently converted to an array.\nDo others agree?\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context regarding the `FunctionTransformer` and how it handles Pandas DataFrames and validation:\n\n### `FunctionTransformer` Class\n\n- **Current Behavior**: The `__init__` method of `FunctionTransformer` currently defaults `validate=True`, which implies that input data passed to `FunctionTransformer` methods are checked and converted to a NumPy array by default (`validate=True` triggers a call to `check_array(X, self.accept_sparse)` during `fit`).\n- **Issue Relation**: The issue arises because this default behavior is not ideal for cases where users want to apply transformations on Pandas DataFrames without having them converted to NumPy arrays. The issue suggests changing the default validation behavior so that DataFrames can pass through without conversion, catering to a common use case where functions that work on DataFrames (leveraging their methods or accessors) are used.\n- **Intended Behavior**: The intended modification would likely involve changing how the `validate` parameter is initialized and handled, moving towards a more nuanced approach that distinguishes between DataFrames and other types of array-like inputs. This would involve modifying or extending the validation logic to support a 'array-or-frame' mode.\n\n### `fit` Method in `FunctionTransformer`\n\n- **What It Does**: The `fit` method checks if validation is enabled (`validate=True`) and then validates and converts the input `X` to a numerical array if so. It also includes logic to check the inverse transformation if `check_inverse` is true.\n- **Issue Relation**: The issue directly concerns this behavior because it's here that the DataFrame would be undesirably converted to an array under current defaults.\n- **Intended Behavior**: To resolve the issue, the `fit` method's behavior needs to accommodate the scenario where DataFrames are allowed through without conversion when `validate` is set to a proposed new mode like 'array-or-frame'. It might require either adjusting the call to `check_array` or incorporating a condition that bypasses this call when a DataFrame is detected and a new validation mode is active.\n\n### Usage of `FunctionTransformer` in `_column_transformer.py`\n\n- **Context**: The snippet from `_column_transformer.py` shows a `FunctionTransformer` being instantiated with `validate=False` in the context of handling 'passthrough' transformations. This indicates a manual override of the default validation behavior to ensure no conversion happens for certain transformations.\n- **Issue Relation**: This instance of `FunctionTransformer` use highlights a workaround currently employed to avoid converting data unnecessarily. It exemplifies the kind of user-side adjustments the issue aims to minimize by changing the default behavior of `FunctionTransformer`.\n- **Intended Behavior**: In a scenario where 'array-or-frame' becomes the default, code like this might not need to explicitly set `validate` to `False` for cases where maintaining the input data type is necessary. It suggests that the intended change could lead to cleaner and more intuitive user-code by minimizing the need for such explicit configurations.\n\n**Summary**: The intended behavior to address the issue will involve changing the initialization and handling of the `validate` parameter within `FunctionTransformer` to introduce a default mode that is more discerning of input types, notably accommodating Pandas DataFrames more gracefully. Adjustments in the `fit` method (and potentially others) would be required to materialize this new behavior, ensuring that DataFrames can be used in transformations without automatic conversion to NumPy arrays. This solution would align the tool more closely with user expectations when working with DataFrames and potentially simplify codebases that integrate `FunctionTransformer` in their data preprocessing pipelines."

This mode should distinguish between Pandas DataFrames and other array-like inputs, allowing DataFrames to be passed through without conversion while maintaining the current behavior for other data types. This change must preserve backward compatibility, possibly through a deprecation cycle if changing the default value directly is considered too disruptive.\n\n- **Location 2**: File: `sklearn/preprocessing/_function_transformer.py`, Class: `FunctionTransformer`, Method: `fit`\n    - **Intended Behavior**: Adjust the `fit` method to accommodate the new `'array-or-frame'` validation mode. When this mode is active, the method should allow DataFrames to bypass the `check_array` conversion process. This adjustment should carefully manage the distinction between DataFrames and other array-like inputs to ensure that the new behavior only applies to DataFrame inputs, preserving the functionality for other data types as it currently stands. \n\nBy implementing these changes, the `FunctionTransformer` will be more versatile and user-friendly, particularly for workflows that heavily utilize Pandas DataFrames, while still supporting the wide range of input types it handles today."
