This mode should distinguish between Pandas DataFrames and other array-like inputs, allowing DataFrames to be passed through without conversion while maintaining the current behavior for other data types. This change must preserve backward compatibility, possibly through a deprecation cycle if changing the default value directly is considered too disruptive."

When this mode is active, the method should allow DataFrames to bypass the check_array conversion process. This adjustment should carefully manage the distinction between DataFrames and other array-like inputs to ensure that the new behavior only applies to DataFrame inputs, preserving the functionality for other data types as it currently stands."
