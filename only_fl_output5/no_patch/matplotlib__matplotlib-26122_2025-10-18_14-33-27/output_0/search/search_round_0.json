In that case, the default of `aspect=None` should just mean \"don't modify the aspect\".\n[1] Really, this should be \"something that does not contains transData as a branch\", as in #13642.\nThe current behavior is the reason why #14057 and #14117 need to explicitly set the aspect to \"auto\" in or after the last imshow() call (otherwise, some head-scratching occurs).\nOn the other hand, making this change would once again lead to some seriously non-obvious interaction between parameters (the meaning of `aspect=None` depends on the value of `transform`), which I'm not sure is great either :/\n**Matplotlib version**\n* Operating system: linux\n* Matplotlib version: master/any\n* Matplotlib backend (`print(matplotlib.get_backend())`): qt5agg\n* Python version: 37\n</issue>"
