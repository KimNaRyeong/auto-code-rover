This can be achieved by enclosing the path resolution logic in a `try-except` block specifically catching `ValueError` and logging or ignoring the problematic path. This preserves the ability to watch and reload modified files without crashing when an unexpected path value is encountered."

        "intended_behavior": "Implement a pre-validation or sanitization step for all file paths before they are processed or passed to potentially vulnerable operations. This could involve a utility function to check for and remove or escape null bytes or other characters that could lead to system calls failing or raising exceptions. Ideally, this layer would act as a filter at the earliest point where paths enter the autoreload system from external sources. For the general path handling logic, especially in parts of the code that interact with `pathlib` and filesystem operations like `os.readlink`, enhance resilience by using broader exception handling to capture and manage any unforeseen errors caused by filesystem anomalies. This could include logging warnings for paths that cause issues without halting the server or autoreload process."
