        "content": "Given the detailed stack trace provided in the issue, we know specifically which files and methods are involved. Let's break down the key elements we need to investigate:\n\n1. **StatReloader** - The specific reloader class mentioned in the issue was not provided explicitly, but it's where the issue with auto-reloading might originate from.\n2. **Pathlib and ValueError** - The stack trace references a `ValueError: embedded null byte` during a `path.resolve()` call in `pathlib.py`. It's related to `os.readlink(path)`, implying that the error occurs when trying to resolve symbolic links in the filesystem.\n3. **Key Files and Methods**:\n    - `django/utils/autoreload.py` with methods `run_with_reloader`, `run_loop`, `snapshot_files`, `watched_files`, and `iter_all_python_module_files`. It seems the error occurs when iterating over watched files and attempting to resolve their paths.\n    - The error traceback pinpoints `pathlib.py` and potentially its interaction with `os.readlink()` in the context of Django's autoreloader functionality.\n\nGiven these insights, it will be beneficial to focus on Django's autoreloader mechanism (`autoreload.py`) and how it interacts with file paths, potentially using `pathlib`.\n\nConsequently, I propose the following API calls to gather sufficient context:\n- `search_code(\"autoreload.run_with_reloader\")` to understand how the reloader is initiated.\n- `search_method_in_file(\"run_loop\", \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\")` to examine the loop where file paths are being monitored.\n- `search_method_in_file(\"snapshot_files\", \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\")` for insights into how file paths are being captured for changes.\n- `search_method_in_file(\"watched_files\", \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\")` to see how files are added to the watch list.\n- `search_method_in_file(\"iter_all_python_module_files\", \"/Userz/kez/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/utils/autoreload.py\")` to investigate the collection of module files for reloading.\n- `search_code(\"os.readlink\")` to explore the use of `os.readlink` directly or indirectly within the context of resolving paths, which could lead to understanding the null byte issue.\n\nThese API calls aim to clarify the autoreload mechanism's operation within Django, specifically how it watches files and resolves their paths, which could be where the `ValueError` originates."
