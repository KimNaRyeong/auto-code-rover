Add system checks for invalid model field names for functional indexes in Meta.indexes.
Description
	 
		(last modified by Mariusz Felisiak)
	 
The current system checks don't cover invalid models fields in functional indexes. This is not straightforward because resolving expressions with non-existent throws FieldError, so we cannot just collect columns from Query._gen_cols().
Follow up to #26167.
I attached tests.
