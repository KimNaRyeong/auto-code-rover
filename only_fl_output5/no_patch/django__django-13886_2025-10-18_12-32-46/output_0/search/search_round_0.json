        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather context about how the Django system checks for invalid model fields, especially in the context of functional indexes and the `Meta.indexes` attribute. This involves looking into the Django ORM's internals, specifically focusing on model validation mechanisms and the parsing of `Meta.indexes`.\n\nHere are the API calls that we need to make to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the base class that represents models in Django. This is where we could expect to find validations related to models.\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Model\")\n```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions system checks, there's likely a system check framework or a set of methods dedicated to running these checks. Let's search for any system check framework or methods related to model validation.\n```python\nsearch_method(\"check\")\n```\n\n3. The description mentions `Meta.indexes` specifically, which suggests we should find how this attribute is parsed or validated. Let's search for it in the context of model definitions.\n```python\nsearch_code(\"Meta.indexes\")\n```\n\n4. Given that functional indexes are a newer feature, there might be specific validation methods for indexes. Let's search for any methods that deal with index validation.\n```python\nsearch_method(\"validate_indexes\")\n```\n\n5. The issue description points out a problem with resolving expressions for functional indexes that throw `FieldError`. It indicates a specific mechanism (`Query._gen_cols()`) that might be involved but seems insufficient or not used correctly for functional indexes. Let's get more information about both the handling of expressions in indexes and the `_gen_cols` method.\n```python\nsearch_method(\"_gen_cols\")\n```\n```python\nsearch_code(\"functional indexes\")\n```\n\nThese API calls are intended to retrieve a broad spectrum of related code and documentation, providing a firm basis for understanding the problem and creating a solution to add the necessary system checks for invalid model field names in functional indexes."
