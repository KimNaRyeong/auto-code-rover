        "intended_behavior": "This method currently performs a series of checks on the model. To resolve the issue, it should be extended to include a check that validates fields referenced by functional indexes within Meta.indexes. This requires parsing each index in Meta.indexes to identify any expressions or field names, then validating these against the model's field definitions. Field references within functional indexes need to be validated for their existence to prevent runtime FieldError when expressions with non-existent fields are resolved. This validation should ideally be performed in a manner that catches invalid field references early in the development process, during system checks, without altering the existing functionality of the method."

        "method": "(New Method Required)",
        "intended_behavior": "A new method should be introduced specifically dedicated to validating functional indexes in Meta.indexes. This method will iterate through the indexes defined in Meta.indexes, extract and parse expressions or direct field references, and then check those against the model's defined fields to ensure they are valid. This method should handle complex expressions gracefully, perhaps leveraging the _gen_cols method logic from query.py to break down expressions and identify field references. The primary goal is to detect and flag any references to fields that do not exist on the model, ensuring developers are alerted during the system check phase before runtime or database migration generation. This new method should be called from within the check method to integrate it into the existing model validation workflow."
