        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to adding pretty printing functionality for the `lerchphi` function, we need to understand where and how the `lerchphi` function is implemented and also grasp the current pretty printing architecture. Specifically, we'll need to look into the implementation of `lerchphi` if it's a method or a function, as well as how the pretty printing is handled in `pretty.py`. Hence, the following API calls would be essential:\n\n1. Search across the entire codebase for the `lerchphi` method to understand its implementation and which class or file it belongs to:\n   - `search_method(\"lerchphi\")`\n\n2. Given that the issue mentions `pretty.py`, it's pivotal to understand how pretty printing is currently implemented and if there's an existing structure or method to extend for `lerchphi`:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"def _print\", \"pretty.py\")`\n\n3. Additionally, to specifically target how functions are pretty-printed, it could be beneficial to search for any existing pretty print functions for similar special functions in `pretty.py`, which might give us a template or idea on how to implement pretty printing for `lerchphi`:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"_print_\", \"pretty.py\")`\n\nThese calls aim to get an overview of the `lerchphi` function's current state in the codebase and to understand the pretty printing mechanism set in `pretty.py`, potentially showing us how to extend or add a new pretty print functionality for the `lerchphi` function."
