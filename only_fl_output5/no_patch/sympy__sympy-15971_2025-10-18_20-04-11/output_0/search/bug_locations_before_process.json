        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior here is to add a new method, `_print_lerchphi`, which handles pretty printing for the `lerchphi` function. Since the `lerchphi` method or function itself was not directly found within the search, this suggests that its pretty print functionality would be newly introduced here. The `_print_lerchphi` method should take an instance of the object representing the `lerchphi` function call and return a string that is the pretty-printed version of this function call. This method should format the inputs to the lerchphi function in a way that is consistent with mathematical standards and aligned with the pretty printing of similar mathematical functions within the library. The implementation would involve determining how best to represent the function's signature and its arguments in a visually appealing, readable format that aligns with the rest of SymPy's pretty print functionality."
