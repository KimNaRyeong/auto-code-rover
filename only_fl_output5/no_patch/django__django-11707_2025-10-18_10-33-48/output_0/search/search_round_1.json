So in theory it shouldn't be pickling the QuerySet.\nHowever, the QuerySet is still stored on the instance within the _constructor_args attribute added by the @deconstructible decorator on the BaseExpression base class. So when the inner query object gets pickled, so does the QuerySet, which attempts to evaluate it. In this case, it gets the error \"ValueError: This queryset contains a reference to an outer query and may only be used in a subquery.\" since the inner queryset is being evaluated independently when called from pickle: it calls QuerySet.__getstate__().\nI'm not sure what the best solution is here. I made a patch that adds the following override to __getstate__ to the SubQuery class, which fixes the problem and passes all other Django tests on my machine. I'll submit a PR shortly, but welcome any better approaches since I'm not sure what else that may effect.\nclass Subquery(Expression):\n...\ndef __getstate__(self):\nobj_dict = super().__getstate__()\nobj_dict.pop('_constructor_args', None)\nreturn obj_dict\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insights into the Django model expressions and how they are serialized, which is central to the reported issue. Let's dive into each part of the gathered information:\n\n### Subquery Class in django/db/models/expressions.py\n\n- **What it does**: The `Subquery` class represents a SQL subquery. It is a type of expression that can be used within the Django ORM to encapsulate a subquery inside a larger query. The class inherits from `Expression`, allowing it to integrate smoothly into the query construction process of Django.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: The issue is directly related to this class since the bug is about how instances of `Subquery` are being serialized (pickled). The description mentions that `Subquery` should not be evaluating its queryset when it's being pickled. However, since the `_constructor_args` are being included inadvertently during pickling, it leads to queryset evaluation.\n- **Intended behavior**: Upon serialization (pickling), the `Subquery` instances should not trigger evaluation of the querysets they encapsulate. The goal is to ensure that serialization can happen without side effects such as database queries being executed.\n\n### BaseExpression Class in django/db/models/expressions.py\n\n- **What it does**: `BaseExpression` serves as a foundational class for constructing various types of expressions within Django's ORM. It provides a set of common behaviors and attributes that are shared across different expression implementations.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: This class is pertinent because it implements the `__getstate__` method, which is invoked automatically by Python's pickling mechanism. The presence of `__getstate__` in this class and its behavior directly impact how instances of derived classes like `Subquery` are serialized.\n- **Intended behavior**: The `BaseExpression` class's `__getstate__` is meant to safely allow instances to be serialized, excluding any attributes that might cause issues (like `convert_value` in this case). For `Subquery` and potentially other expressions, there\u2019s a need to ensure no queryset evaluation happens during serialization, which calls for adjusting its serialization logic possibly by modifying `__getstate__`.\n\n### @deconstructible Decorator\n\n- **What it does**: This decorator is used to mark classes as \"deconstructible\" for Django's migrations system. This is important for cases where instances of these classes need to be serialized and deserialized when generating and applying migrations.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: The decorator's application to expressions might be adding unintended attributes (`_constructor_args`) that are causing issues during serialization. This directly ties to the problem described in the issue where the queryset from a `Subquery` gets evaluated upon pickling.\n- **Intended behavior**: Ideally, the `@deconstructible` decorator should make a class easy to serialize for migration purposes without negatively impacting other serialization use cases, such as the one involved in the bug. It may be necessary to adjust how the decorator interacts with expression classes to prevent inadvertent queryset evaluations.\n\n### __getstate__ Method in BaseExpression\n\n- **What it does**: Implements custom behavior for pickling instances of classes derived from `BaseExpression`. It modifies the state of the object by removing the `convert_value` attribute before serialization.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: Since `Subquery` does not have its own `__getstate__` method (as confirmed by the search), it inherits this behavior from `BaseExpression`. The issue suggests that additional customization (removing `_constructor_args`) in the `__getstate__` method for `Subquery` instances might be necessary to fix the bug.\n- **Intended behavior**: The `__getstate__` method should prepare an instance for serialization in a way that prevents execution of code that's not supposed to run during serialization (like evaluating a queryset). The suggestion made in the issue to modify `Subquery`'s state before pickling aligns with this goal.\n\nGiven these analyses, the next logical step could involve developing or adjusting the `__getstate__` method specifically for the `Subquery` class to prevent the known issue while ensuring it does not adversely affect other functionalities."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

This method should ensure all necessary attributes for reconstructing the `Subquery` instance are serialized without triggering database queries or including unnecessary data that could cause the evaluation. The implementation should remove or otherwise handle the `_constructor_args` attribute to prevent the inadvertent serialization of the queryset. Importantly, this change should avoid affecting the normal runtime usage of `Subquery` expressions, maintaining their functionality in query construction and execution. This adjustment aims to align with the behavior observed in other parts of the Django ORM, where serialization is designed not to have side effects such as triggering query execution."
