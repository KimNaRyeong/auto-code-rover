        "intended_behavior": "The `Subquery` class needs to implement a custom `__getstate__` method that prevents the evaluation of the queryset upon pickling, preserving the intended lightweight serialization process. This method should ensure all necessary attributes for reconstructing the `Subquery` instance are serialized without triggering database queries or including unnecessary data that could cause the evaluation. The implementation should remove or otherwise handle the `_constructor_args` attribute to prevent the inadvertent serialization of the queryset. Importantly, this change should avoid affecting the normal runtime usage of `Subquery` expressions, maintaining their functionality in query construction and execution. This adjustment aims to align with the behavior observed in other parts of the Django ORM, where serialization is designed not to have side effects such as triggering query execution."
