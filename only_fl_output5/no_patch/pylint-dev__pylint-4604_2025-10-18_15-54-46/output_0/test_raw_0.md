To create a standalone python script `reproducer.py` that reproduces the reported issue, we'd essentially attempt to mimic the linting process of `pylint` on a sample Python file containing the reported problem. This script should then analyze `pylint`'s output to check if the specific `unused-import` warning for `abc` is mistakenly reported when `abc.ABC` is indeed used in a type comment. 

To achieve this, the script will:
1. Create a temporary Python file with the content containing the alleged issue.
2. Run `pylint` on this file programmatically.
3. Check `pylint`'s output for the reported false positive.
4. Assert the absence of the false positive to confirm the issue.
5. Use the provided `print_stacktrace` function in the case of an unexpected outcome.

Below is the content of `reproducer.py`:

```python
import subprocess
import tempfile
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_pylint_on_code(code: str) -> str:
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, mode='w', suffix='.py') as tmpfile:
        tmpfile_name = tmpfile.name
        tmpfile.write(code)
        tmpfile.close()
        result = subprocess.run(['pylint', tmpfile_name], capture_output=True, text=True)
        os.unlink(tmpfile_name)  # Clean up the temporary file
        return result.stdout + result.stderr

def main():
    code = """\"""Docstring."\""

import abc
from abc import ABC

X = ...  # type: abc.ABC
Y = ...  # type: ABC
"""
    pylint_output = run_pylint_on_code(code)
    expected_warning_text = "unused-import"
    if expected_warning_text in pylint_output:
        e = AssertionError(f"Found unexpected {expected_warning_text} warning in pylint output")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("No unexpected warnings. The issue is likely resolved.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script does the following:
1. Defines a function `print_stacktrace` for detailed error information, as requested.
2. It creates a temporary file with the illustrative code that supposedly triggers the false positive warning.
3. It then runs `pylint` on this temporary file.
4. After obtaining the output, it checks for the presence of the `unused-import` message.
5. If the message is found, it raises an assertion error alongside printing a detailed stack trace of the error; if not, it concludes the issue might be resolved.

Make sure `pylint` is installed in your environment where the script will be executed. This can be done using pip:
```sh
pip install pylint
```

Then, run this script by executing:
```sh
python3 reproducer.py
```

It should raise an `AssertionError` with a detailed stack trace if the issue is present, and exit normally with a success message if the issue is not present (assuming the issue has been resolved in the version of `pylint` you are testing against).
