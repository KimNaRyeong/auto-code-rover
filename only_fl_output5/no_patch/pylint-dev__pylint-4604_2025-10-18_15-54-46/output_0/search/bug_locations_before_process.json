        "intended_behavior": "This code location, being part of the logic that checks for unused imports, needs to be adjusted to correctly identify and ignore import statements that are exclusively used in type annotations within type comments. The ImportsChecker should be enhanced to parse type comments for variable annotations and map these uses back to their respective import statements. This adjustment will preserve the original functionality of detecting genuinely unused import statements while excluding those legitimately used in type comments, thus resolving the false positive issue."

        "method": "",
        "intended_behavior": "If the AST Walker is used for traversing the Python abstract syntax tree and does not currently account for or properly visit type comments, it should be updated or extended to do so. Given the issue is related to imports used within type comments, enhancing the AST Walker to recognize these patterns as valid usage scenarios of the imports will help in accurate lint checks. This ensures that all parts of the code, including type comments, are considered when determining whether an import is used, maintaining the utility of lint checks without compromising on accuracy."
