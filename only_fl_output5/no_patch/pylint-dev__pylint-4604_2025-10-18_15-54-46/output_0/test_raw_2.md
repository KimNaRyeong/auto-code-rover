Given the requirements and the need to correct the previous implementation which did not successfully run the pylint check (due to an environment where pylint was not found), the following version of `reproducer.py` aims to ensure it handles such issues by adding a step to verify the availability of pylint before proceeding. Furthermore, it tailors the execution to ensure clearer visibility into resulting actions, especially for environments where pylint may not be directly accessible or installed globally.

```python
import subprocess
import sys
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def pylint_installed():
    """Checks if pylint is installed and available in PATH."""
    result = subprocess.run(["which", "pylint"], capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result.returncode == 0

def write_temp_python_file(filename="temp_pyfile.py"):
    code = """\"\"\"Docstring.\"\"\"

import abc
from abc import ABC

X = ...  # type: abc.ABC
Y = ...  # type: ABC
"""
    with open(filename, "w") as file:
        file.write(code)
    return filename

def pylint_check(filename):
    result = subprocess.run(["pylint", filename], capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result.stdout + '\n' + result.stderr

def main():
    if not pylint_installed():
        print("Pylint is not installed or not found in PATH. Please ensure Pylint is properly installed.")
        sys.exit(1)

    filename = write_temp_python_file()
    try:
        pylint_output = pylint_check(filename)
        
        # If "unused-import" warning with "import abc" is in output, issue is present.
        if "unused-import" in pylint_output and "import abc" in pylint_output:
            raise AssertionError("Detected pylint unused-import false positive.")
        
        print("Issue not present. Exiting with success.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Success exit code
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with a code indicating failure
    finally:
        # Cleanup
        if os.path.exists(filename):
            os.remove(filename)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Enhancements and Corrections:**
1. **Pre-Check for pylint:** It checks if pylint is available in the PATH before attempting to run pylint commands. This preemptively addresses environments where pylint isn't installed or accessible.
2. **Exit Codes:** System exit codes have been clearly defined for different outcomes (0 for success, 1 for failure) to better integrate with scripting environments that depend on exit codes for flow control.
3. **Cleanup Handling:** The script cleans up the temporary file in a "finally" block, ensuring cleanup happens regardless of the execution path taken. This change improves the script's robustness and prevents leftover files in case of errors.
4. **Error Reporting:** Enhanced to handle a scenario where pylint is not installed, guiding towards resolution steps (installing pylint) and ensuring the script does not proceed without the necessary dependencies.
