Below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py`, designed to trigger the reported pylint issue and verify its presence. When run, it will raise an `AssertionError` if the pylint issue is detected, showcasing the described bug concerning an `unused-import` false positive. If the issue is fixed, the script will exit with code 0, indicating the absence of the pylint error.

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def write_temp_python_file():
    code = """\"\"\"Docstring.\"\"\"

import abc
from abc import ABC

X = ...  # type: abc.ABC
Y = ...  # type: ABC
"""
    with open("temp_pyfile.py", "w") as file:
        file.write(code)

def pylint_check():
    result = subprocess.run(["pylint", "temp_pyfile.py"], capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result.stdout + '\n' + result.stderr

def main():
    try:
        write_temp_python_file()
        pylint_output = pylint_check()
        
        # Check for specific pylint unused-import issue
        if "unused-import" in pylint_output and "import abc" in pylint_output:
            raise AssertionError("Detected pylint unused-import false positive.")
        
        print("No pylint issue detected.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise
    
    finally:
        # Cleanup
        try:
            subprocess.run(["rm", "temp_pyfile.py"])
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Cleanup failed: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script performs the following steps:
1. It generates a temporary Python file named `temp_pyfile.py` containing the code snippet that's expected to produce the false positive `unused-import` warning by pylint.
2. Then, it uses `subprocess` to run pylint on the generated file, capturing its output.
3. It checks pylint's output for the specific issue (the `unused-import` warning related to `abc`). If found, it raises an `AssertionError`, indicating the bug's presence.
4. The `print_stacktrace` function is used to detail the exception raised if the issue is present.
5. Whether the issue is detected or not, the temp file is cleaned up before the script exits.
6. If no issue is detected, the script prints a confirmation message and exits with code 0.

Ensure pylint is installed and available in your environment to use this script.
