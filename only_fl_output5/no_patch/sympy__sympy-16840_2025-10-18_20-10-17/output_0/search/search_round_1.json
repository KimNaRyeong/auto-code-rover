The issue might be related to a custom implementation that handles arithmetic operations or symbolically represents numbers, and the division operation is not handling specific cases correctly, such as division by \"S.Half\".\n\nThe intended behavior, as per the issue description, should parallel Python's handling of floating-point division when using the floor division operator `//`, where `2//0.5` equals `4`. This suggests there might be a custom numeric type or a utility module that handles these operations.\n\nTo get more context, I need to attempt a broader search that might clue us into how \"S\" is defined or used and how division operations are generally handled in the project. If \"S\" is part of a larger module or class that deals with symbolic mathematics or custom arithmetic operations, discovering where these are defined or used could be key.\n\nTherefore, I will make the following search API calls:\n\n1. search_code(\"class S\")\n2. search_method(\"div\")  # Assuming \"div\" might be part of a method name handling division.\n\nThese searches aim to find the definition of \"S\" and any division-related methods that might give insight into how division operations, especially ones resulting in errors like `ZeroDivisionError`, are implemented or overridden."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.
