I understand there was an issue with the execution of the previous submission. Below is an updated approach. If there is an issue in loading specific modules due to the environment or setup configuration, please ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed and correctly set up. This updated script assumes that the scikit-learn library is correctly installed and accessible within the environment in which the script is run.

```python
import time

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
        from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
        from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

        X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)

        rs = GridSearchCV(
            estimator=RandomForestClassifier(),
            param_grid={'n_estimators': [2, 3, 4, 5]},
            return_train_score=True
        )

        start_time = time.time()
        rs.fit(X, y)
        end_time = time.time()
        
        refit_time = end_time - start_time - sum(rs.cv_results_['mean_fit_time']) - sum(rs.cv_results_['mean_score_time'])

        # Since the 'refit_time_' attribute doesn't exist, we simulate the assertion to reflect the issue.
        assert hasattr(rs, 'refit_time_'), "GridSearchCV does not track the refit time for the best estimator."
        
        # If the above assertion passes (which in current state it won't), we still simulate fetching this nonexistent attribute.
        simulated_refit_time = rs.refit_time_  # This should raise an AttributeError if executed

        print(f"Refit time available: {simulated_refit_time} seconds")

    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to suggest assertion failed and thus the issue exists.
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to suggest some other unexpected errors occurred.

    exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating the issue has been fixed and no exceptions were raised.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script is designed to demonstrate the lack of a `refit_time_` attribute in the `GridSearchCV` object by asserting its existence right after fitting the model. The assertion is expected to fail because, as of my last update, scikit-learn does not provide this attribute directly. The approach calculates refit time indirectly before checking for the attribute, simulating the process of refitting and then trying to access a hypothetical `refit_time_` attribute to invoke the assertion intentionally.
