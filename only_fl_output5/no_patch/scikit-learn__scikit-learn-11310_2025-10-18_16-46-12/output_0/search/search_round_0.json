What I can so far do is retrieve the time it takes to fit and score each model:\n```\nimport sklearn.datasets\nimport sklearn.model_selection\nimport sklearn.ensemble\nX, y = sklearn.datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True)\nrs = sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV(\nestimator=sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier(),\nparam_grid={'n_estimators': [2, 3, 4, 5]}\n)\nrs.fit(X, y)\nprint(rs.cv_results_['mean_fit_time'])\nprint(rs.cv_results_['mean_score_time'])\n```\nIn case I run this on a single core, I could time the whole search procedure and subtract the time it took to fit the single folds during hyperparameter optimization. Nevertheless, this isn't possible any more when setting `n_jobs != 1`.\nThus, it would be great to have an attribute `refit_time_` which is simply the time it took to refit the best model.\nUsecase: for [OpenML.org](https://openml.org) we want to support uploading the results of hyperparameter optimization, including the time it takes to do the hyperparameter optimization.\n</issue>"

Search for the `fit` method within `BaseSearchCV` as it's likely where the refitting process occurs after determining the best parameters from grid/random search.\n3. Additionally, searching for the `cv_results_` attribute usage might give clues on how timing is currently handled and where the new timing for refit could be placed or how it should be managed.\n\nLet's execute these API calls:\n\n- search_class(\"BaseSearchCV\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"BaseSearchCV\")\n- search_code(\"cv_results_\")"
