Search for the `sensitive_variables` to understand how it's currently implemented and affecting the signature of decorated functions.\n2. Locate the `authenticate` method within a class likely named something akin to `AuthenticationBackend`, to see how it is defined and how `sensitive_variables` is applied to it.\n3. Investigate how `inspect.getcallargs` interacts with functions decorated by `sensitive_variables`, as the issue suggests a problem in this interaction.\n\nLet's start with these API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"sensitive_variables\")` to find the definition or use of `sensitive_variables`.\n2. `search_class(\"AuthenticationBackend\")` to find the `AuthenticationBackend` class in the codebase.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"authenticate\", \"AuthenticationBackend\")` to locate the `authenticate` method within the `AuthenticationBackend` class.\n4. `search_code(\"inspect.getcallargs\")` to review how and where `inspect.getcallargs` is used, focusing on its interaction with decorated functions."
