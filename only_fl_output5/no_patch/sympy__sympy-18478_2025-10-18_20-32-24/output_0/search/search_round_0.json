        "content": "To address the issue mentioned, we need to gather context about how symbolic substitution is implemented for mathematical expressions in the project, specifically when evaluating expressions involving infinity (`oo`) and functions like `exp` and `cos`. The core functionality for these operations likely resides in methods related to substitution (`subs`) and possibly in the handling of specific functions like `exp` and `cos` when evaluating their limits or behavior at infinity.\n\nFirst, let's identify where the `subs` functionality is implemented, which might give us insights into how different terms in expressions are evaluated when substituted:\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"subs\")\n```\n\nSince the issue mentions behavior that involves mathematical functions `exp` and `cos`, and the handling of infinity (`oo`), it's also useful to see how these specific functions are implemented or handled:\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"exp\", \"Function\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"cos\", \"Function\")\n```\n\nGiven that the issue contrasts two different behaviors based on the expression terms, understanding how `oo` (infinity) is treated in the codebase might provide clues to why the expression evaluations differ:\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"oo\")\n```\n\nThese search API calls should provide a good starting point to understanding the bug in question by revealing how substitutions are handled, how mathematical functions are evaluated at infinity, and any special handling for infinity inside the codebase."
