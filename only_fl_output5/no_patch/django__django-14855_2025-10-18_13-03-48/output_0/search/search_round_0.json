(See django.contrib.admin.options.ModelAdmin response_add as just one example)\nI have been able to correct this specific issue by replacing the above line with:\nurl = reverse(\nurl_name,\nargs=[quote(remote_obj.pk)],\ncurrent_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name\n)\nHowever, I don't know if there are any side effects and I have not yet run the full suite of tests on this. Mostly looking for feedback whether I'm on the right track.\n</issue>"

Here's a plan for using the search APIs:\n\n1. **Search for the `get_admin_url` method**: Since the change is proposed in the `get_admin_url` function, it's essential to find where this function is defined and used in the Django code base to understand its usage and any possible implications of the proposed change.\n\n2. **Search for custom Admin Site setup**: To understand how custom admin sites are typically configured and identified within the Django admin codebase, which would give context on the usage of `current_app` for admin site names.\n\n3. **Search for example usage of `current_app` in Admin views**: Since the issue mentions `current_app` is used elsewhere in the admin for similar purposes, finding other examples would help validate the proposed approach and provide context on how this pattern is applied.\n\nGiven this plan, the corresponding API calls are:\n\n- `search_method(\"get_admin_url\")`\n- `search_code(\"admin_site.name\")` to find configurations or usages of custom admin site names, potentially related to custom Admin Site setup.\n- `search_code(\"current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name\")` to find if the suggested fix or similar patterns are already in use elsewhere in the admin.\n\nThis should provide a well-rounded understanding of the implications and the current implementation pattern in the Django admin codebase."
