        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. `get_admin_url` Methods in the Codebase\n\nThe `get_admin_url` method was found in two files within the Django admin framework - `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py` and `django/contrib/admin/models.py`. This method is likely responsible for generating URLs to different objects within the admin interface. Given the issue description, at least one of these occurrences in `helpers.py` is relevant because the issue is specifically related to generating URLs for readonly fields with a foreign key in a custom Admin Site. This location in `helpers.py` is where the fix was proposed.\n\n**Intended Behavior**: The `get_admin_url` method should correctly generate URLs for objects within the context of a custom Admin Site, which means using the admin site's base URL instead of the default `/admin/...`.\n\n#### 2. Snippets Containing `admin_site.name`\n\nThese snippets, spread across several files (`widgets.py`, `actions.py`, `utils.py`, `options.py`, `views/main.py`, and `auth/admin.py`), indicate various places where the admin site's name is used, potentially for similar reasons such as customizing behavior or URLs based on the admin site. This usage pattern might affirm the practice of considering the custom Admin Site's name in different parts of the admin application for customized behavior.\n\n**Intended Behavior**: The usage of `admin_site.name` should ensure that the admin's functionality and URLs reflect the context or namespace of the current Admin Site, thereby allowing a consistent and isolated experience for users of custom admin sites.\n\n#### 3. Usage of `current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name`\n\nThe found snippet in `django/contrib/admin/views/main.py` within the `ChangeList` class's `url_for_result` function shows a direct precedent for using `current_app` with `self.model_admin.admin_site.name` to generate a URL that respects the admin site's name. \n\nThis piece of code specifically generates URLs for the change page of a model instance within the correct admin site context. This usage directly correlates with the issue, suggesting that the pattern proposed in the issue description (using `current_app` with the admin site's name when reversing URLs) is already in practice and considered valid within certain parts of the Django admin framework.\n\n**Intended Behavior**: The `url_for_result` function's behavior, leveraging `current_app` to ensure URLs point to the correct admin site, aligns with what the issue aims to achieve for generating URLs for readonly ForeignKey fields in a custom Admin Site context.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The analysis of `get_admin_url` points towards where the modification is needed.\n- The widespread usage of `admin_site.name` across admin functionalities suggests a standard approach to accommodating custom Admin Site contexts.\n- The found example of `current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name` usage validates the proposed fix's approach, showing its applicability and consistency with existing Django admin practices.\n\nThe next steps towards addressing the issue would involve ensuring that the change in `get_admin_url` does not introduce unintended side effects, especially in places where `get_admin_url` might be used without considering a custom Admin Site context. This would likely involve reviewing these methods and their usages further, as well as any related unit tests or system tests that could be affected by the change."

This entails utilizing the `current_app` parameter in the `reverse` function to ensure that the generated URL reflects the custom Admin Site's base path instead of defaulting to `/admin/...`. This behavior needs to preserve the default functionality when the Admin Site context is not custom or specified, thereby maintaining backward compatibility and existing functionalities for standard Django admin use cases. This adjustment would directly address the inconsistency this issue highlights, ensuring URLs for readonly ForeignKey fields in custom Admin Sites are correctly formed.\n\nGiven the analysis and the information provided, there appears to be no need for additional context at this moment, as the issue's resolution focuses on modifying the behavior of `get_admin_url` to correctly handle custom Admin Site contexts by incorporating the `current_app` parameter. This fix aligns with existing Django admin practices for URL generation in custom Admin Site contexts, as evidenced by its use in other areas of the Django admin framework."
