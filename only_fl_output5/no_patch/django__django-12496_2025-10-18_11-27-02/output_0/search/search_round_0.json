        "content": "<issue>Child model updates parent model with empty fields making an extra query in multi-inheritance when parent model has custom PK\nDescription\nWhile creating a new model object (using multi-inheritance model => Child(Parent)), Django does an extra update query setting parent model fields to empty values. This situation occurs *only* if we define a custom primary key in a parent model (eg. as an UUID field).\nAn example *without* custom primary key (correct behavior):\nclass Parent(models.Model):\ntitle = models.TextField()\nclass Child(Parent):\nbody = models.TextField()\n>> Child.objects.create()\n1. INSERT INTO \"app_parent\" (\"title\") VALUES ('') RETURNING \"app_parent\".\"id\"\n2. INSERT INTO \"app_child\" (\"parent_ptr_id\", \"body\") VALUES (1, '')\nAn example *with* custom primary key (incorrect behavior):\nclass Parent(models.Model):\nid = models.UUIDField(\nprimary_key=True,\ndefault=uuid.uuid4,\neditable=False\n)\ntitle = models.TextField()\nclass Child(Parent):\nbody = models.TextField()\n>> Child.objects.create()\n1. UPDATE \"app_parent\" SET \"title\" = '' WHERE \"app_parent\".\"id\" = 'd750cfdd-ae7b-48a6-a2e0-d49e70e28686'::uuid\n2. INSERT INTO \"app_parent\" (\"id\", \"title\") VALUES ('d750cfdd-ae7b-48a6-a2e0-d49e70e28686'::uuid, '')\n3. INSERT INTO \"app_child\" (\"parent_ptr_id\", \"body\") VALUES ('d750cfdd-ae7b-48a6-a2e0-d49e70e28686'::uuid, '')\nPython 3.6, PostgreSQL 9.6\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue described, we need to look into the Django models involved, specifically how the `Child` model inherits from the `Parent` model and how Django handles database queries in this multi-inheritance scenario with custom primary keys. Given the details in the issue, it seems imperative to understand how Django's ORM is constructing the SQL queries for model inheritance when a custom primary key is used.\n\nHere are the API calls that would be necessary:\n\n1. Search for the `Parent` class across the codebase to understand if there's specific logic that might contribute to this behavior.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"Parent\")\n   ```\n\n2. Similarly, search for the `Child` class to inspect any overridden methods or additional configurations that may influence the query generation process.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"Child\")\n   ```\n\n3. Given that the issue describes an unexpected database operation, look for usage of `.create()` method in the `Child` model which is likely where the problem originates. This step will help us understand if the `.create()` method is overridden or customized in any way.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"create\", \"Child\")\n   ```\n\n4. Lastly, since the problem arises with the handling of custom primary keys, specifically the UUID field in Django models, searching for how `UUIDField` is declared and used in the `Parent` class could provide insight into potential mismatches or misconfigurations leading to the issue.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"UUIDField\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls will help gather the necessary code context around the issue, focusing on the inheritance structure, the models' configuration, and specifically how the custom primary key is handled, which seems to be at the core of the problem."
