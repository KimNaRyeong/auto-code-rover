This situation occurs *only* if we define a custom primary key in a parent model (eg. as an UUID field).\nAn example *without* custom primary key (correct behavior):\nclass Parent(models.Model):\ntitle = models.TextField()\nclass Child(Parent):\nbody = models.TextField()\n>> Child.objects.create()\n1. INSERT INTO \"app_parent\" (\"title\") VALUES ('') RETURNING \"app_parent\".\"id\"\n2. INSERT INTO \"app_child\" (\"parent_ptr_id\", \"body\") VALUES (1, '')\nAn example *with* custom primary key (incorrect behavior):\nclass Parent(models.Model):\nid = models.UUIDField(\nprimary_key=True,\ndefault=uuid.uuid4,\neditable=False\n)\ntitle = models.TextField()\nclass Child(Parent):\nbody = models.TextField()\n>> Child.objects.create()\n1. UPDATE \"app_parent\" SET \"title\" = '' WHERE \"app_parent\".\"id\" = 'd750cfdd-ae7b-48a6-a2e0-d49e70e28686'::uuid\n2.

The inability to find classes or methods directly named `Child` or `Parent`, or the `create` method within `Child`, suggests that these might be example or pseudo-code names representing the issue rather than actual implementation details. This means we need to think more broadly about where the issue might reside, focusing more on the mechanisms and interactions within Django's ORM that handle model inheritance, custom primary keys, and object creation.\n\n### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### UUIDField Usage Across the Django Codebase\n\nThe search for `UUIDField` yielded multiple instances across various Django components, including forms, database backends, and models. The widespread use of `UUIDField` indicates it is a well-integrated feature within Django, supported across different database backends (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL). Notably, the presence in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` and `django/db/models/base.py` points towards the core model field definition and the base class for Django models, respectively.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   \n   The `UUIDField` code snippets likely define the field's behavior, including how it's declared in models, how it's handled by different database backends, and how it interacts with forms and admin interfaces. This could include serialization/deserialization, validation, and database column mapping.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   The issue description implicates `UUIDField` as a pivotal factor in the bug's manifestation. Specifically, the problem appears when `UUIDField` is used as a custom primary key in a parent model partaking in multi-table inheritance. The bug results in an unnecessary update query that resets parent model fields. Understanding how Django handles `UUIDField` as a primary key, especially in inheritance scenarios, is crucial to identifying the bug's root cause.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   Ideally, when a `Child` model instance is created, Django should insert a new record into the parent model's table (`Parent`) without issuing a subsequent update to reset fields. If `UUIDField` is involved as a primary key, it should facilitate this process by correctly linking child and parent records without necessitating redundant updates. Django's ORM should optimally manage the primary key fields, regardless of whether they are auto-increment integers or UUIDs.\n\n### Adjusted Strategy for Further Investigation\n\nConsidering the analysis, the next steps involve deep-diving into how Django's ORM handles model inheritance and `UUIDField` primary keys, particularly:\n\n1. **Investigate how Django handles object creation with custom primary keys in model inheritance scenarios:**\n   \n   - Search for the object creation logic in `django/db/models/base.py`. This could shed light on how Django constructs database queries during model instantiation and save operations, especially in inheritance structures.\n   \n     ```python\n     search_code_in_file(\"object creation\", \"django/db/models/base.py\")\n     ```\n   \n2. **Examine `UUIDField` handling in model inheritance:**\n\n   - Search within `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` to understand how `UUIDField` is defined and any specific logic that might influence its behavior within multi-table inheritance.\n   \n     ```python\n     search_code_in_file(\"UUIDField\", \"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\")\n     ```\n\nBy pursuing these angles, we should be able to gather more context on how Django's ORM architecture might be leading to the issue described and potentially how to rectify it."

Nevertheless, we can hypothesize areas of the code that are likely relevant to the issue based on the description of the problem and general knowledge of Django's ORM system.\n\n1. **do we need more context:** \n\nBased on the provided scenario and the limitations of direct code examination, an accurate pinpointing of bug locations isn't feasible without additional context or the ability to inspect Django's internal handling of model inheritance and `UUIDField` customization more closely.\n\n2. **where are bug locations:**\n\nWhile we cannot specify exact file paths and line numbers due to the constraints, we can theorize about the potential locations and the intended behavior needed to resolve the issue:\n\n- **Buggy File:** `django/db/models/base.py`\n  - **Class:** Could involve the model `Meta` class or methods related to model initialization and saving within Django's model base class. \n  - **Method:** The method handling model instantiation and save operations, where multi-table inheritance is processed, possibly `Model.save_base` or a related function.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The method should be enhanced to detect when a model instance is being saved with multi-table inheritance where a custom primary key is defined. It should ensure that the parent table is correctly populated without issuing a redundant update that overrides fields with empty values. The fix should ensure the efficient creation of parent and child model instances in a single operation where possible, or at least eliminate unnecessary updates to the parent model when creating a child model instance.\n\n- **Buggy File:** `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`\n  - **Class:** Pertains to the `UUIDField` class or possibly the handling of `Field` classes more broadly within model inheritance contexts.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Ensure proper handling and generation of `UUIDField` as a primary key in inheritance scenarios, maintaining the linkage and integrity between parent and child records without unnecessary updates. This might involve adjusting how the `UUIDField` value is set and ensuring it's correctly utilized in both parent and child table creation processes.\n\nThese are theorized based on the understanding of the problem and could serve as a starting point for a more in-depth investigation by a developer with access to the Django ORM's internals. The resolution should aim to maintain Django's ORM flexibility and efficiency, especially in handling complex inheritance schemes with custom primary keys like UUIDs, without introducing performance regressions or breaking changes."
