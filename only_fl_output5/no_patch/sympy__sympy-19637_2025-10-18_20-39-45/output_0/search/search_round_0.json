The error message suggests there might be a mistake in the scope or declaration of a variable named `kern` within the `kernS` function or method.\n\nLet's execute a series of API calls to gather this information:\n\n1. Search for the definition or mention of `kernS` across the entire codebase to understand its intended use and implementation details.\n2. Given that the issue references a specific file related to `sympy.core.sympify`, it would be useful to check if `kernS` is defined within this file or how it is imported or used there.\n\nHere are the specific API calls:\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"kernS\")\nsearch_code_in_file(\"from sympy.core.sympify import kernS\", \"sympy/core/sympify.py\")\n```\n\nThese calls aim to locate the definition of `kernS` and any related usage in the `sympify` module that might be causing the UnboundLocalError."
