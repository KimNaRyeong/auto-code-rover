Query.get_aggregation method drops INNER JOIN required to select the title field. Specifically, this code drops it:\nif not inner_query.distinct:\n# If the inner query uses default select and it has some\n# aggregate annotations, then we must make sure the inner\n# query is grouped by the main model's primary key. However,\n# clearing the select clause can alter results if distinct is\n# used.\nif inner_query.default_cols and has_existing_annotations:\ninner_query.group_by = [self.model._meta.pk.get_col(inner_query.get_initial_alias())]\ninner_query.default_cols = False\nCode is taken from Django 1.8 but 1.11 looks the same.\ndefault_cols is set to False and the INNER JOIN is dropped. Quick fix is to add a condition for setting default_cols to False:\nif not inner_query.distinct:\n# If the inner query uses default select and it has some\n# aggregate annotations, then we must make sure the inner\n# query is grouped by the main model's primary key. However,\n# clearing the select clause can alter results if distinct is\n# used.\nif inner_query.default_cols and has_existing_annotations:\ninner_query.group_by = [self.model._meta.pk.get_col(inner_query.get_initial_alias())]\nif not has_existing_annotations:\ninner_query.default_cols = False\nI don't know if it could be done in a nicer way. I was able to reproduce this in 1.8.18 and 1.11.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue, we need to locate the method `Query.get_aggregation` within the Django codebase, as well as understanding how annotations, particularly `RawSQL`, interact with the QuerySet of a model and its inherited fields. The issue description suggests that the problem lies within the implementation of this specific method, especially how it handles `default_cols` and `inner_query`.\n\nHere are the API calls that would be helpful:\n\n1. **Search for the `Query` class**: We need the `Query` class because the method `get_aggregation` is mentioned to be inside it.\n   - `search_class(\"Query\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `RawSQL` annotation**: Since the issue is related to how `RawSQL` annotations are being handled, it's useful to understand how `RawSQL` is implemented.\n   - `search_class(\"RawSQL\")`\n\n3. **Search for `get_aggregation` method in the `Query` class**: To get the implementation details of the `get_aggregation` method, as it seems to be directly linked to the bug.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"get_aggregation\", \"Query\")`\n\n4. **Search for code snippet related to `inner_query.default_cols`**: Since the issue description points out a specific handling of `default_cols` as part of the problem, finding the code that manipulates this attribute could provide valuable insights.\n   - `search_code(\"inner_query.default_cols\")`\n\nThese API calls are crafted to directly address the components involved in the issue: understanding how `Query.get_aggregation` works, especially in relation to `RawSQL` annotations and the handling of `default_cols`, which appears to be central to the problem.\n"
