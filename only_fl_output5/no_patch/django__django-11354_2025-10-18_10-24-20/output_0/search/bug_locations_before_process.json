        "intended_behavior": "The `get_aggregation` method should be updated to ensure it correctly maintains the necessary INNER JOINs when handling queries that involve fields from parent models due to model inheritance. This involves refining the logic that determines when to set `inner_query.default_cols` to `False` and how `inner_query.group_by` is adjusted. Particularly, the modification should:\n\n- Add a condition to check if the annotation involves fields from an inherited model. If so, the method should preserve the `default_cols` as `True` or ensure the necessary JOINs are explicitly included in the `group_by`.\n- Ensure that INNER JOINs necessary for accessing inherited model fields are not dropped even when `default_cols` is set to `False`. This may involve more nuanced handling or additional checks around the conditions that currently lead to setting `inner_query.default_cols` to `False`.\n\nThe objective is to preserve all existing functionalities while ensuring that count operations on annotated querysets referencing inherited model fields do not result in errors due to missing columns. This might require a more sophisticated analysis of the queryset's structure to understand when JOINs are necessary for correct count aggregation."
