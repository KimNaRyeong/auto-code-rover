However, some third-party tools wrap the value in double quotation marks when wrapping HTTP requests (such as the filename of the file uploaded by PostmanCanary). This results in double quotes for the filename at the end of Django parsing.\nPostman request body:\n----------------------------677822685948106391633425\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"\u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\"; filename*=\"UTF-8''%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95.txt\"\nContent-Type: text/plain\ntest\n----------------------------677822685948106391633425--\ndjango got filename is \u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\" not \u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\nThis is not a bug of Django. But I suggest Django do some compatibility processing.\nCPython is also compatible with this situation.\n\u200bhttps://hg.python.org/cpython/file/default/Lib/test/test_email/test_headerregistry.py\n\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/12485\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we will need to gather context about how Django's `MultiPartParser` currently handles filenames in multipart form data, particularly how it parses and assigns the filename to uploaded files. The issue suggests that the current implementation does not strip double quotes from filenames extracted from the `Content-Disposition` header, which is inconsistent with behaviors observed in other tools or even expected by some RFC interpretations. To start, we should:\n\n1. Find the class definition of `MultiPartParser` to understand its structure and the methods involved in parsing.\n2. Search for the method that handles parsing of the `Content-Disposition` header or otherwise assigns filenames to uploaded files, as this is likely where the issue resides.\n3. Examine the code that deals with extracting and processing filenames to see if and how it currently handles double quotes.\n\nBased on this approach, here are the API calls we need to make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"MultiPartParser\")` - To find the file or files where `MultiPartParser` is defined.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"parse\", \"MultiPartParser\")` - Assuming \"parse\" is a relevant method in `MultiPartParser` that could be involved in processing the form data.\n3. `search_code(\"Content-Disposition\")` - To find snippets where the `Content-Disposition` header is being handled, as this could give us direct pointers to where filenames are parsed and potentially mishandled."
