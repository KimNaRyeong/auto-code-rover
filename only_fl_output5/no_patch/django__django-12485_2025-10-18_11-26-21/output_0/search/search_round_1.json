However, some third-party tools wrap the value in double quotation marks when wrapping HTTP requests (such as the filename of the file uploaded by PostmanCanary). This results in double quotes for the filename at the end of Django parsing.\nPostman request body:\n----------------------------677822685948106391633425\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"\u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\"; filename*=\"UTF-8''%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95.txt\"\nContent-Type: text/plain\ntest\n----------------------------677822685948106391633425--\ndjango got filename is \u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\" not \u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\nThis is not a bug of Django.

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we will need to gather context about how Django's `MultiPartParser` currently handles filenames in multipart form data, particularly how it parses and assigns the filename to uploaded files. The issue suggests that the current implementation does not strip double quotes from filenames extracted from the `Content-Disposition` header, which is inconsistent with behaviors observed in other tools or even expected by some RFC interpretations. To start, we should:\n\n1. Find the class definition of `MultiPartParser` to understand its structure and the methods involved in parsing.\n2. Search for the method that handles parsing of the `Content-Disposition` header or otherwise assigns filenames to uploaded files, as this is likely where the issue resides.\n3. Examine the code that deals with extracting and processing filenames to see if and how it currently handles double quotes.\n\nBased on this approach, here are the API calls we need to make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"MultiPartParser\")` - To find the file or files where `MultiPartParser` is defined.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"parse\", \"MultiPartParser\")` - Assuming \"parse\" is a relevant method in `MultiPartParser` that could be involved in processing the form data.\n3. `search_code(\"Content-Disposition\")` - To find snippets where the `Content-Disposition` header is being handled, as this could give us direct pointers to where filenames are parsed and potentially mishandled."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Analyzing the collected context on the issue of handling double quotes in filenames within `MultiPartParser` in Django, let's break down the information retrieved from the API calls:\n\n### 1. django/http/multipartparser.py (MultiPartParser Class)\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `MultiPartParser` class in `django/http/multipartparser.py` is designed to parse the POST data from a multipart form submission, separating the submission into files (accessible via a `FILES` MultiValueDict) and other data (`POST` MultiValueDict). Specifically, the `parse` function processes the raw multipart form data, identifies each part as either a file or a form field, handles file uploads by working with upload handlers, and collects form fields into a dictionary.\n\n#### Relationship to the Bug\nThe parsing method does handle file names during the parsing of multipart/form-data contents. Notably, when extracting file information, it sanitizes the file name through `IE_sanitize` and unescapes HTML entities (e.g., converts `&amp;` back into `&`). However, from the retrieved context, there is no direct reference to stripping or specially handling double quotes around the filename, which ties directly to the reported issue. The problem arises when filenames include double quotes, as specified by the `filename` content disposition in multipart data, potentially leading to filenames being stored with trailing double quotes.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nThe intended behavior, given the issue description, would be to adjust the parsing logic to ensure that double quotes around file names are properly handled\u2014either stripped away upon recognition or managed in a manner that prevents their inclusion as part of the filename itself within Django's parsed data structures. This change would aim to enhance compatibility with clients that include double quotes around filename values in the `Content-Disposition` header of multipart data.\n\n### 2. django/http/response.py and django/core/mail/message.py (References to \"Content-Disposition\")\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nWhile these parts were not explicitly retrieved and analyzed in the context provided, references to \"Content-Disposition\" in `django/http/response.py` and `django/core/mail/message.py` likely pertain to handling HTTP response headers and email message construction, respectively. They define how the \"Content-Disposition\" header is used either in HTTP responses or in defining attachments or inline content in emails.\n\n#### Relationship to the Bug\nThese references indicate awareness and potential handling of \"Content-Disposition\" headers within different parts of Django but are not directly related to the multipart form data parsing issue described. Their handling of \"Content-Disposition\" does not impact the parsing of POST data from forms, which is where the bug occurs.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nWhile these sections of the code are not where the bug fix needs to occur, a consistent handling strategy for \"Content-Disposition\" across Django that includes sanitizing or processing header values (like filenames) could provide insight or a pattern for addressing the issue within `MultiPartParser`. For example, any logic used to parse or manipulate \"Content-Disposition\" headers for response or email construction could inspire similar logic for safely handling filenames in multipart data, albeit applied in a different context.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\nThe immediate focus should be on enhancing the `MultiPartParser`'s handling of filenames within the `parse` method or associated methods called during parsing. Specifically, looking at how filenames are extracted and sanitized, and implementing logic to strip surrounding double quotes from the filename values while ensuring compatibility with various client implementations. A potential next step could include more directly inspecting or modifying the `parse`, `IE_sanitize`, or other relevant methods of `MultiPartParser` to address the double quote handling explicitly."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

To resolve the issue of filenames ending up with trailing double quotes when parsed from the `Content-Disposition` header, the intended behavior should include a step to validate and clean the `filename` before using it. This adjustment could take place immediately after the filename is extracted from the disposition and before it is passed on to any further processing or handling. Specifically, the implementation should check for the presence of leading and trailing double quotes around the extracted filename and remove them if found. This should be done in a manner that does not affect the rest of the file handling logic, preserving the existing functionality for file uploads while ensuring filenames are correctly parsed without any surrounding double quotes.\n\nThe logic for stripping double quotes may resemble the following pseudocode:\n```python\nif file_name.startswith('\"') and file_name.endswith('\"'):\n    file_name = file_name[1:-1]\n```\nThis adjustment would directly address the reported issue by ensuring that filenames reported by clients like PostmanCanary, which include double quotes, are handled in a manner compatible with expected server-side processing, thus enhancing Django's resilience to variations in client-side multipart form data construction."
