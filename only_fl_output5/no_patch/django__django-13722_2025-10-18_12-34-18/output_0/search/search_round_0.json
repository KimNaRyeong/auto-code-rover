Here's how we can use the provided search APIs for gathering the required code context:\n\n1. **Find where `InlineModelAdmin` is defined**: To add a method to `InlineModelAdmin`, we first need to find which file it's defined in and get an overview of its current methods.\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"InlineModelAdmin\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Check how formsets are currently handled within `InlineModelAdmin`**: Understanding the current handling of formsets in the `InlineModelAdmin` class is crucial to implementing the new feature seamlessly.\n    ```python\n    search_method_in_class(\"get_formset\", \"InlineModelAdmin\")\n    ```\n\n3. **Look for `get_changeform_initial_data` implementation**: Since the issue description mentions `get_changeform_initial_data` as a reference point for implementing a similar method for inline formsets, understanding its current implementation might provide insights.\n    ```python\n    search_method(\"get_changeform_initial_data\")\n    ```\n\nThese searches will provide us with a solid foundation to understand where and how to implement the new method for customizing the admin's formset parameters with initial data."
