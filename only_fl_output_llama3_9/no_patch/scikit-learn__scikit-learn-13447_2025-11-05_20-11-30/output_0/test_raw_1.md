The issue is not with the script itself, but rather with the installation of scikit-learn. The error message indicates that scikit-learn has not been built correctly.

To reproduce the issue, you can try installing scikit-learn from source and then running the reproducer script. Here's an example of how to do this:

1. Clone the scikit-learn repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git
```
2. Change into the cloned directory:
```
cd scikit-learn
```
3. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Build and install scikit-learn:
```
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
```
5. Create a new file called `reproducer.py` with the following contents:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import label_ranking_average_precision_score

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    truth = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=np.bool)
    scores = np.array([[0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]])
    try:
        result = label_ranking_average_precision_score(truth, scores, sample_weight=[1.0, 1.0, 0.0])
        assert result == 0.625
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

6. Run the reproducer script:
```
python3 reproducer.py
```

This should raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace of the issue.

Note that this is just one possible way to reproduce the issue, and you may need to modify the script or the installation process depending on your specific environment and setup.
