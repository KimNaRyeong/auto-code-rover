        "intended_behavior": "The `frac_field` method should ensure that when creating a fraction field, elements that are algebraically derived from the symbols (like `1/x`) are properly recognized and included within the field. To resolve the issue, the implementation may need to include additional logic to handle and recognize inverse elements or more complex algebraic expressions as belonging to the field. This may involve adjusting how elements are checked for membership or extending the method's capability to interpret and incorporate such elements into the fraction field construct. The existing functionality, which facilitates the construction of fraction fields with specified symbols and order, must be preserved while enhancing the method to recognize elements like `1/x` as being part of `K(X)`."
