        "intended_behavior": "When the fit method is executed with fit_intercept=False, it should ensure the shape of coef_ is consistently maintained as if fit_intercept=True, especially when training models with a single target variable. This means making sure that the dimensionality of coef_ does not change based on the fit_intercept parameter. The logic within the method that initializes and adjusts coef_ based on the presence of an intercept should be revisited to ensure that coef_'s shape is correct for both single and multiple target scenarios. The adjustment made to coef_ (lines 731-738) should account for the fit_intercept=False setting without altering the expected shape of coef_."

        "intended_behavior": "In the enet_path function, any logic that involves the handling of fit_intercept=False should be examined to ensure it does not inadvertently affect the computation or shape of coefficients in a way that diverges from the expected outcome when fit_intercept=True. This includes pre-fitting processing and the generation of the alpha grid. The function should maintain consistent handling of fit_intercept, ensuring that the exclusion of an intercept does not affect the structure or integrity of the coef_ vector, particularly ensuring that single-dimensional output is preserved when appropriate.These adjustments should preserve the existing functionality and performance characteristics of the Lasso and ElasticNet models while ensuring the correct shape of coef_ is produced, regardless of the fit_intercept parameter setting."
