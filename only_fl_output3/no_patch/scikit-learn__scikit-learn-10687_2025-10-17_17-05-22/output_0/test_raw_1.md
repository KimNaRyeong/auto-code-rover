It appears there was a misunderstanding in the execution of the provided Python script due to a potential misconfiguration or installation issue with scikit-learn on your system. The error message you received indicates a problem with scikit-learn's build process rather than with the script itself. Before attempting to re-execute the script, please ensure that scikit-learn is correctly installed and built in your environment. This might involve reinstalling scikit-learn using pip (`pip install scikit-learn --upgrade`) or conda (`conda install scikit-learn`), or rebuilding it from the source if you are working from a development version.

The script provided was designed to execute without errors under a correctly installed scikit-learn environment. It aims to reproduce a specific issue related to the `Lasso` linear model when `fit_intercept` is set to `False`. Given the nature of the error you encountered, the script did not reach execution stages relevant to reproducing the reported issue due to the preliminary ImportError.

Please make sure your scikit-learn installation is functional before running the script again. Here is the content of the script for reference, assuming your scikit-learn environment is correctly set up:

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_lasso_coef_shape_with_intercept():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn import linear_model

    est_intercept = linear_model.Lasso(fit_intercept=True)
    est_intercept.fit(np.c_[np.ones(3)], np.ones(3))
    assert est_intercept.coef_.shape == (1,), "Unexpected coef_ shape with intercept"

def test_lasso_coef_shape_without_intercept():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn import linear_model

    est_no_intercept = linear_model.Lasso(fit_intercept=False)
    est_no_intercept.fit(np.c_[np.ones(3)], np.ones(3))
    assert est_no_intercept.coef_.shape == (1,), "Unexpected coef_ shape without intercept"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_lasso_coef_shape_with_intercept()
        test_lasso_coef_shape_without_intercept()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
```

This script should be put in the root directory of the project and executed with `python3 reproducer.py`. Please fix your scikit-learn installation issue and then proceed with running this script to validate the existence of the reported issue.
