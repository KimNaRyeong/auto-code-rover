Considering the requirements and function provided for printing the stack trace clearly, here is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue with `linear_model.Lasso` when `fit_intercept=False` and raise an `AssertionError` if the shape of `coef_` is incorrect. This script will check both scenarios (with and without intercept) and print the stack trace on error.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn import linear_model

    # Test with intercept
    est_intercept = linear_model.Lasso(fit_intercept=True)
    est_intercept.fit(np.c_[np.ones(3)], np.ones(3))
    try:
        assert est_intercept.coef_.shape == (1,), "With intercept: Unexpected coef_ shape"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Error with intercept test:", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)

    # Test without intercept
    est_no_intercept = linear_model.Lasso(fit_intercept=False)
    est_no_intercept.fit(np.c_[np.ones(3)], np.ones(3))
    try:
        assert est_no_intercept.coef_.shape == (1,), "Without intercept: Unexpected coef_ shape"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Error without intercept test:", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Place this script in the root directory of your project and execute it with:

```bash
python3 reproducer.py
```

This script aims to systematically test the shape of the `coef_` attribute for the `Lasso` regression model in scikit-learn, specifically checking whether setting `fit_intercept=False` affects the shape incorrectly. It will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace if the expected shape is not found, indicating an issue. Conversely, it should exit with code 0 indicating no exceptions were raised, which means the issue does not exist or has been fixed.
