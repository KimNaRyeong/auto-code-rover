This script attempts to dynamically configure a minimal Django environment and reproduce the issue as described. It defines a Django app configuration (`TestAppConfig`) that raises a custom exception within its `ready` method. The `main` function attempts to trigger this by calling Django's `check` command, which is used to check for any project configuration errors but here serves to initialise the app and thus run its `ready` method.

The custom `print_stacktrace` function is used to provide detailed traceback information when exceptions occur, helping to diagnose whether the script has accurately reproduced the issue as described. The script exits with code `0` if the issue is present (caught by the assertion), and with code `1` for any unexpected exceptions.
