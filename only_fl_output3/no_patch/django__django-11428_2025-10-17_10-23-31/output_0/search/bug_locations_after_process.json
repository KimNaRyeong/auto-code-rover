        "intended_behavior": "The method `raise_last_exception` needs to be fixed to properly re-raise custom exceptions that may have custom signatures (i.e., multiple arguments in their `__init__`). The intended behavior should essentially preserve its role in re-raising the last exception but should be enhanced to: Check if the exception to be re-raised requires more than one argument and if so, provide all the necessary arguments stored in `_exception`. Alternatively, instead of attempting to reconstruct the exception object by calling its constructor, the method could simply re-raise the exception object that was initially caught. This would involve changing the mechanism by which the `_exception` global variable captures exceptions\u2014storing the entire exception object instead of breaking it down into its class, message, and traceback. This approach would preserve the complete state of the original exception, including its custom arguments, and would not require changing its constructor invocation logic."
