The consequence is that you just get a TypeError exception about __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'other_thing' and it completely masks the original exception.\nNote that this behavior was changed in c8720e7696ca41f3262d5369365cc1bd72a216ca, it used to just re-raise the exception value. I don't know why it was changed.\nI noticed this issue as a result of \u200bhttps://gitlab.com/alantrick/django-vox/issues/9\n"

        "content": "Given the prior attempt failed because Django couldn't resolve the app configuration due to the script attempting to define it inline, a more suitable approach will involve simulating the app structure Django expects without relying on the script's `__main__` context. Let's create a more complete example that programmatically creates the necessary Django app structure and settings to avoid the `ModuleNotFoundError`.\n\nThis solution will dynamically create a minimal Django project setup within the script and then simulate running the Django development server (which utilizes the autoreloader) to trigger the custom exception in the app's `ready` method. Note that this approach may still not perfectly mimic every aspect of running a full Django project, but it aims to more accurately reproduce the conditions under which the reported issue occurs.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\nimport os\nimport sys\n\ndef setup_django_environment(app_name='testapp'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Sets up a Django environment programmatically with minimal settings.\n    \"\"\"\n    from django.conf import settings\n    from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line\n\n    settings.configure(\n        SECRET_KEY='a-very-secret-key',\n        DEBUG=True,\n        ROOT_URLCONF=f'{app_name}.urls',\n        INSTALLED_APPS=[app_name],\n        DATABASES={\n            'default': {\n                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',\n                'NAME': 'mydatabase',\n            }\n        },\n    )\n    \n    # Configure URLs minimally\n    from django.http import HttpResponse\n    from django.urls import path\n\n    def dummy_view(request):\n        return HttpResponse(\"Hello, world!\")\n\n    urlpatterns = [path('', dummy_view, name='home')]\n\n    # Dynamically create a module for the app and its URLs\n    import types\n    module = types.ModuleType(app_name)\n    sys.modules[f\"{app_name}\"] = module\n    module.__dict__['urlpatterns'] = urlpatterns\n    urls_module = types.ModuleType(f\"{app_name}.urls\")\n    sys.modules[f\"{app_name}.urls\"] = urls_module\n    urls_module.__dict__['urlpatterns'] = urlpatterns\n\n    return app_name\n\ndef simulate_django_startup(app_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Attempts to start up Django to trigger AppConfig.ready, which should\n    in turn raise the intended exception.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Before importing Django internals, setup the environment\n    setup_django_environment(app_name)\n    \n    # Define the custom exception and AppConfig as per the issue description\n    class MyException(Exception):\n        def __init__(self, value: str, other_thing: str):\n            super().__init__(value)\n            self.ot = other_thing\n\n    from django.apps import AppConfig\n\n    class MyAppConfig(AppConfig):\n        name = app_name\n        verbose_name = \"My App\"\n\n        def ready(self):\n            raise MyException(\"foo\", \"bar\")\n\n    # Mock the app config registration process\n    from django.apps import apps\n    apps.populate([f'{app_name}.MyAppConfig'])\n\n    # Attempt to trigger the autoreload via a management command\n    # This is where we expect the initial exception and its handling to occur\n    from django.core.management import call_command\n    try:\n        call_command('check')\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    try:\n        simulate_django_startup('myapp')\n        print(\"Done without exception.\")\n    except AssertionError:\n        sys.exit(0)  # Exit code 0 to indicate the issue is present\n    except Exception as e:\n        sys.exit(1)  # Exit code 1 for unexpected exceptions\n```\n\nThis script tries to dynamically create a minimal Django application environment that can then be used to provoke the autoreloader mechanism in a more controlled manner. Please note, however, that due to its unusual setup, this script might not directly translate to a production scenario or might require adjustments based on your specific Django version or project structure."
