To resolve the issue, the condition if obj.extra_tags: could be adjusted to explicitly check if obj.extra_tags is not None: ensuring that extra_tags with empty strings are correctly serialized. This change should preserve the method\u2019s existing functionality of serializing Message objects while correcting the behavior for extra_tags serialization."
