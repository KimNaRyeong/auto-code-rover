This is because MessageEncoder checks for the truthyness of extra_tags rather than checking it is not None.\nTo replicate this bug\n>>> from django.conf import settings\n>>> settings.configure() # Just to allow the following import\n>>> from django.contrib.messages.storage.base import Message\n>>> from django.contrib.messages.storage.cookie import MessageEncoder, MessageDecoder\n>>> original_message = Message(10, \"Here is a message\", extra_tags=\"\")\n>>> encoded_message = MessageEncoder().encode(original_message)\n>>> decoded_message = MessageDecoder().decode(encoded_message)\n>>> original_message.extra_tags == \"\"\nTrue\n>>> decoded_message.extra_tags is None\nTrue\nEffect of the bug in application behaviour\nThis error occurred in the wild with a template tag similar to the following:\n{% if x not in message.extra_tags %}\nWhen the message was displayed as part of a redirect, it had been serialised and deserialized which meant that extra_tags was None instead of the empty string. This caused an error.\nIt's important to note that this bug affects all of the standard API (messages.debug, messages.info etc. all have a default value of extra_tags equal to \"\").\n</issue>"

Specifically, we should explore the `MessageEncoder` and `MessageDecoder` classes used in the `django.contrib.messages.storage.cookie` module, as well as the `Message` class within `django.contrib.messages.storage.base`. Here are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"MessageEncoder\")`\n2. `search_class(\"MessageDecoder\")`\n3. `search_class(\"Message\")`\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"encode\", \"MessageEncoder\")`\n5. `search_method_in_class(\"decode\", \"MessageDecoder\")`"
