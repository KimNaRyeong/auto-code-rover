This is because MessageEncoder checks for the truthyness of extra_tags rather than checking it is not None.\nTo replicate this bug\n>>> from django.conf import settings\n>>> settings.configure() # Just to allow the following import\n>>> from django.contrib.messages.storage.base import Message\n>>> from django.contrib.messages.storage.cookie import MessageEncoder, MessageDecoder\n>>> original_message = Message(10, \"Here is a message\", extra_tags=\"\")\n>>> encoded_message = MessageEncoder().encode(original_message)\n>>> decoded_message = MessageDecoder().decode(encoded_message)\n>>> original_message.extra_tags == \"\"\nTrue\n>>> decoded_message.extra_tags is None\nTrue\nEffect of the bug in application behaviour\nThis error occurred in the wild with a template tag similar to the following:\n{% if x not in message.extra_tags %}\nWhen the message was displayed as part of a redirect, it had been serialised and deserialized which meant that extra_tags was None instead of the empty string. This caused an error.\nIt's important to note that this bug affects all of the standard API (messages.debug, messages.info etc. all have a default value of extra_tags equal to \"\").\n</issue>"

To address the missing information, additional API calls should aim to uncover:\n\n1. The `default` method's implementation in `MessageEncoder` to understand serialization logic.\n2. A more detailed look at the `process_messages` method in `MessageDecoder` could reveal how deserialized data is handled and why `extra_tags` might become `None`.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nTo fill in the gaps, here are the next API call suggestions:\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"default\", \"MessageEncoder\")`: To uncover how the `MessageEncoder` class handles serialization, particularly of `extra_tags`.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"process_messages\", \"MessageDecoder\")`: To see how deserialized messages are processed and why `extra_tags` might be mistakenly set to `None`."

        "content": "Analyzing the recently collected context from the `MessageEncoder` and `MessageDecoder` classes within the Django Messages framework, we can derive insights into the serialization and deserialization process for messages, and specifically, how the `extra_tags` attribute is handled, which is central to the issue at hand.\n\n### 1. **`MessageEncoder.default` Method**\n\n- **What it does:** This method is responsible for custom serialization logic of `Message` objects. If an object is an instance of `Message`, it serializes it into a list that includes a flag for `SafeData`, the message's level, and the message itself. Importantly, `extra_tags` are appended to this list only if they evaluate to `True`.\n- **Relationship with the bug:** The check `if obj.extra_tags:` means that an empty string (`\"\"`) for `extra_tags` will not be serialized since an empty string is falsy in Python. This behavior is causing `extra_tags` to be lost (or effectively converted to `None`) during serialization and deserialization, as empty strings are not being preserved.\n- **Intended behavior:** The serialization logic should be modified so that `extra_tags` are explicitly checked for `None` instead of truthiness. This ensures that an empty string is recognized as a valid value and is included in the serialization, preserving the distinction between `None` and `\"\"`.\n\n### 2. **`MessageDecoder.process_messages` Method**\n\n- **What it does:** Upon deserialization, this method processes the decoded JSON, checking if an object matches the structure of a serialized `Message` object. It then reconstructs the `Message` object, including marking certain content as `SafeData` if indicated. This method ensures nested messages are also processed correctly.\n- **Relationship with the bug:** The issue description doesn't directly indicate a fault in this method for the loss of `extra_tags` as empty strings, but the reconstruction of `Message` objects here depends on how they're serialized. The method assumes that any additional information after the message content in the serialized list pertains to `extra_tags`, but it doesn't directly cause `\"\"` to transform to `None`.\n- **Intended behavior:** Although `process_messages` correctly reconstructs `Message` objects based on the serialized data, ensuring that `extra_tags` is correctly handled starts with its accurate serialization by `MessageEncoder.default`. Any adjustments would be to ensure it correctly interprets serialized data where `extra_tags` was an empty string, although this part seems to work as intended given the serialization format. But, reinforcing accurate deserialization might involve conditionally handling the `extra_tags` presence in the data list, ensuring compatibility with the tweaked serialization logic.\n\n### Summary and Next Steps\n\nThe analysis points toward the bug primarily residing in the serialization logic within the `MessageEncoder.default` method. The solution involves adjusting its implementation to ensure `extra_tags` are serialized accurately as empty strings where applicable. While `MessageDecoder.process_messages` does not directly contribute to the bug, ensuring it remains compatible with any new serialization approach is crucial. The next steps would involve drafting a patch to `MessageEncoder.default` to adjust its handling of `extra_tags`, verifying its compatibility with `MessageDecoder.process_messages`, and ensuring this adjustment does not inadvertently affect other parts of the messages framework."
