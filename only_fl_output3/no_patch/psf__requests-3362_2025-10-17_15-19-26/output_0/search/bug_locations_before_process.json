        "intended_behavior": "The `iter_content` method's intended behavior when `decode_unicode=True` is to yield Unicode strings (not bytes) to the caller. This method needs to ensure that every chunk decoded from bytes to strings is done so accurately and consistently for every call. The decoding process should leverage the response's content encoding to convert the bytes to a Unicode string effectively. If the encoding cannot be determined, it should fall back to a default encoding (e.g., utf-8) or use the `chardet` library to guess the encoding, much like how the `.text` property operates. This behavior ensures that users receive a consistent and predictable output whether they are accessing the response content in bulk via `.text` or in chunks via `iter_content(decode_unicode=True)`."
