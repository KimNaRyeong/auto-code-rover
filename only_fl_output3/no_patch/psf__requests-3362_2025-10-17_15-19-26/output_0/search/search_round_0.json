My understanding was that both should return a unicode object. In essence, I thought \"iter_content\" was equivalent to \"iter_text\" when decode_unicode was True. Have I misunderstood something? I can provide an example if needed.\nFor reference, I'm using python 3.5.1 and requests 2.10.0.\nThanks!\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more information about the usage and implementation of the `iter_content` method and how it relates to handling Unicode and bytes. Since the user is specifically comparing the behavior of `iter_content(decode_unicode=True)` to accessing `.text` on a response object and expecting both to return Unicode, we should focus on those areas within the `requests` library. Therefore, we should:\n\n1. Locate where the `iter_content` method is defined within the `Response` class or related classes in the `requests` library.\n2. Examine the implementation of the `.text` property in the `Response` class to understand how it returns Unicode.\n3. Since `python 3.5.1` and `requests 2.10.0` are mentioned, we aim to understand the behavior in that specific context, though the codebase may have evolved.\n\nGiven these points, here are the API calls I believe should provide us with sufficient context:\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"iter_content\", \"Response\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"text\", \"Response\")`\n\nThese calls should give us insight into how both `iter_content` and `text` are implemented and help us understand if there's a discrepancy in handling Unicode between these two methods or if there's a misuse/misunderstanding in how `iter_content(decode_unicode=True)` is supposed to work."
