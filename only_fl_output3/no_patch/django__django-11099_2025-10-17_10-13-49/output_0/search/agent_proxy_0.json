Search for the `UnicodeUsernameValidator` class for the same reasons as above, to understand its implementation and to identify where the regex is utilized:\n   - `search_class(\"UnicodeUsernameValidator\")`\n\n3. Since the issue description mentions that the change should be made in `contrib.auth.validators`, searching for code snippets using the old regex in this specific location might be useful.
