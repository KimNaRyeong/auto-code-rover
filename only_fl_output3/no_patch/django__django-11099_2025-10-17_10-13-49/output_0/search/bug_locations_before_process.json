        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior is to modify the `regex` attribute of the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` class to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`. This change ensures that the validator only accepts usernames that start and end with alphanumeric characters or special characters (., @, +, -, _), disallowing trailing newlines which were previously accepted due to the `$` behavior in regex. This preserves the intended validation functionality while correcting the oversight related to trailing newlines."

        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior is similar to that of the `ASCIIUsernameValidator`. Here, the `regex` attribute should be updated to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`. This adjustment makes sure that the validator accurately accepts a wide range of alphanumeric characters and specific symbols from various scripts without permitting trailing newlines. This change ensures the software behaves as expected in multi-linguistic contexts, maintaining its existing validation capabilities while adhering to the requirement that usernames must not end with a newline character."
