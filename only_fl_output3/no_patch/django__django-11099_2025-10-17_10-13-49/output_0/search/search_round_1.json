However, a little known quirk of Python regexes is that $ will also match a trailing newline. Therefore, the user name validators will accept usernames which end with a newline. You can avoid this behavior by instead using \\A and \\Z to terminate regexes. For example, the validator regex could be changed to\nr'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\nin order to reject usernames that end with a newline.\nI am not sure how to officially post a patch, but the required change is trivial - using the regex above in the two validators in contrib.auth.validators.\n</issue>"

It dictates the characters allowed in a username, including English letters, numbers, and certain symbols (@, ., +, -, _).\n   - **Relation to the bug**: The regex pattern used allows usernames to end with a newline due to the behavior of `$` in Python regex, which contradicts the intended validation behavior.\n   - **Intended behavior**: This validator should ensure usernames consist only of the specified characters, without allowing a trailing newline. Changing the regex to use `\\A` and `\\Z` instead of `^` and `$` would align the behavior with the intent, ensuring that the entire string (from start to end, without a newline at the end) matches the pattern.\n\n2. **UnicodeUsernameValidator in django/contrib/auth/validators.py**:\n   - Similar to `ASCIIUsernameValidator` but without the ASCII flag, allowing for a broader range of characters in usernames, including characters from various languages and scripts.\n   - **Relation to the bug**: It shares the same regex issue as `ASCIIUsernameValidator`, accepting trailing newlines in usernames.\n   - **Intended behavior**: The change to `\\A` and `\\Z` would also apply here, ensuring usernames can consist of diverse characters but still excluding trailing newlines.\n\n3. **Search for the code using the erroneous regex**:\n   - The search for the specific regex pattern did not yield results, likely due to a search or typographical issue. However, from the information gathered through class searches, we know exactly where the regex is applied and its current inadequate pattern.\n\nNext Steps:\nSince the files and exact locations within those files where changes need to be applied have been identified (`django/contrib/auth/validators.py` for both `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`), the next action would involve replacing the regex pattern in both validators as described in the issue. The desired pattern change is from `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`, ensuring validation does not accept trailing newlines. Given this analysis, there might not be a need for further API calls unless we want to verify no other parts of the codebase use the problematic pattern in a similar context."

Bug locations and intended behaviors:\n\n**Location 1:**\n- File: django/contrib/auth/validators.py\n- Class: ASCIIUsernameValidator\n- The intended behavior is to modify the `regex` attribute of the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` class to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`. This change ensures that the validator only accepts usernames that start and end with alphanumeric characters or special characters (., @, +, -, _), disallowing trailing newlines which were previously accepted due to the `$` behavior in regex. This preserves the intended validation functionality while correcting the oversight related to trailing newlines.\n\n**Location 2:**\n- File: django/contrib/auth/validators.py\n- Class: UnicodeUsernameValidator\n- The intended behavior is similar to that of the `ASCIIUsernameValidator`. Here, the `regex` attribute should be updated to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`. This adjustment makes sure that the validator accurately accepts a wide range of alphanumeric characters and specific symbols from various scripts without permitting trailing newlines. This change ensures the software behaves as expected in multi-linguistic contexts, maintaining its existing validation capabilities while adhering to the requirement that usernames must not end with a newline character."
