        "intended_behavior": "The `check_thread` method should be modified to dynamically include HTTP headers based on user configuration. Instead of having the `Accept` header hardcoded as it currently stands, the method should check if there are any user-defined HTTP headers specified in the Sphinx configuration (possibly in a new configuration option such as `linkcheck_http_headers`). This new logic should ideally: Preserve the default `Accept` header if no custom headers are specified by the user. Override or extend the default `Accept` header with the values provided by the user if custom headers are configured. This allows for flexibility and addresses the issue where certain servers respond unfavorably to the hardcoded `Accept` header value. Ensure that the existing functionality of `linkcheck` is not affected for users who do not specify custom headers, maintaining backward compatibility."
