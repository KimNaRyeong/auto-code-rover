Please describe.**\nCurrently, `Accept` HTTP header is hardcoded: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/dbefc9865d8c2c4006ed52475d1bff865358cd00/sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py#L111. And when I hit servers that require custom headers, the only option is to add those URLs to the ignore list which is what I'd like to avoid.\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nMake HTTP headers configurable.\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nAdding the affected URL to `linkcheck_ignore`\n**Additional context**\nWe have a GitHub Actions badge in README which then gets embedded into Sphinx docs. Running `linkcheck` used to work but now it doesn't. After some debugging I discovered that if the HTTP query doesn't have `Accept:` HTTP header, it works. But the header that Sphinx injects causes GitHub's server to respond with `HTTP/1.1 406 Not Acceptable`.\nInterestingly, if you open this URL in a browser, it works: https://github.com/cherrypy/cheroot/workflows/Test%20suite/badge.svg. Google Chrome sends the following header: `Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9`.\n```console\n$ curl --head -H 'User-Agent: Sphinx/2.4.3 requests/2.23.0 python/3.7.4' https://github.com/cherrypy/cheroot/workflows/Test%20suite/badge.svg\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\ndate: Tue, 03 Mar 2020 18:53:13 GMT\ncontent-type: image/svg+xml; charset=utf-8\nserver: GitHub.com\nstatus: 200 OK\nvary: X-PJAX, Accept-Encoding, Accept, X-Requested-With\ncache-control: max-age=300, private\netag: W/\"6e6be7ee648f0c6c3c74f436c281da7e\"\nstrict-transport-security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains; preload\nx-frame-options: deny\nx-content-type-options: nosniff\nx-xss-protection: 1; mode=block\nexpect-ct: max-age=2592000, report-uri=\"https://api.github.com/_private/browser/errors\"\ncontent-security-policy: default-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; block-all-mixed-content; connect-src 'self' uploads.github.com www.githubstatus.com collector.githubapp.com api.github.com www.google-analytics.com github-cloud.s3.amazonaws.com github-production-repository-file-5c1aeb.s3.amazonaws.com github-production-upload-manifest-file-7fdce7.s3.amazonaws.com github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com wss://live.github.com; font-src github.githubassets.com; form-action 'self' github.com gist.github.com; frame-ancestors 'none'; frame-src render.githubusercontent.com; img-src 'self' data: github.githubassets.com identicons.github.com collector.githubapp.com github-cloud.s3.amazonaws.com *.githubusercontent.com; manifest-src 'self'; media-src 'none'; script-src github.githubassets.com; style-src 'unsafe-inline' github.githubassets.com\nAge: 0\nSet-Cookie: _gh_sess=p238CMtx5HWH1dro34Ug5297UE6yfWFIdIXjOC%2Fz6c0KFat8kP6FKO%2BpnLDFOrOop4N%2FjA%2FnKLDavWjC6VVQYoPNNbqh%2B4N41map9mUfvFhhx8HMW19Du1h5fn9g2Tv4TZcNSJfwfFV465Xzxq9t213ud1LEQEukuzbcIFn1hNy%2FBbmJ%2BF0MjS6eZk%2BPVQ2kLNdrtaBz%2BJ6RFTwhyu7nrxXLbgh08T2mBKLI8BREu3%2Fh1f7S%2FJ%2BIaQFq5mFItrQ140%2BSDmMgWF7tGKuZqDnHYw%3D%3D--YFLr0%2B3yKMbqGo%2Ff--P2WJDemx1goxFvxleo%2FnsQ%3D%3D; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure\nSet-Cookie: _octo=GH1.1.1438747173.1583261593; Path=/; Domain=github.com; Expires=Wed, 03 Mar 2021 18:53:13 GMT; Secure\nSet-Cookie: logged_in=no; Path=/; Domain=github.com; Expires=Wed, 03 Mar 2021 18:53:13 GMT; HttpOnly; Secure\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nContent-Length: 2211\nX-GitHub-Request-Id: 1C24:16DCA:5FBDEC6:880AF26:5E5EA799\n```\n```console\n$ curl --head -H 'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8' -H 'User-Agent: Sphinx/2.4.3 requests/2.23.0 python/3.7.4' https://github.com/cherrypy/cheroot/workflows/Test%20suite/badge.svg\nHTTP/1.1 406 Not Acceptable\ndate: Tue, 03 Mar 2020 18:53:49 GMT\ncontent-type: text/html\nserver: GitHub.com\nstatus: 406 Not Acceptable\nvary: X-PJAX, Accept-Encoding, Accept, X-Requested-With\ncache-control: no-cache\nstrict-transport-security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains; preload\nx-frame-options: deny\nx-content-type-options: nosniff\nx-xss-protection: 1; mode=block\nexpect-ct: max-age=2592000, report-uri=\"https://api.github.com/_private/browser/errors\"\ncontent-security-policy: default-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; block-all-mixed-content; connect-src 'self' uploads.github.com www.githubstatus.com collector.githubapp.com api.github.com www.google-analytics.com github-cloud.s3.amazonaws.com github-production-repository-file-5c1aeb.s3.amazonaws.com github-production-upload-manifest-file-7fdce7.s3.amazonaws.com github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com wss://live.github.com; font-src github.githubassets.com; form-action 'self' github.com gist.github.com; frame-ancestors 'none'; frame-src render.githubusercontent.com; img-src 'self' data: github.githubassets.com identicons.github.com collector.githubapp.com github-cloud.s3.amazonaws.com *.githubusercontent.com; manifest-src 'self'; media-src 'none'; script-src github.githubassets.com; style-src 'unsafe-inline' github.githubassets.com\nAge: 0\nSet-Cookie: _gh_sess=cq2fhZutOVFanPybUxb%2F5FN5FRD9j%2FKOq2N5WN83m30t6Xnu8y1Zgcc4kBIw0MiYid9VOJTComfgw5O4jAWg91GLK0peYu9XfNKn2bPmd7GDmjYwak2QE%2FvElg%2BVs8yuL8lMOdtZSxAfQdObkQHyPM9KCs%2FXj7qofetrUASScJ2v%2BBdIw%2BUDANHDp%2FoH0ckbWIY4ouHQD%2BAy1KG00IMLjyRJ%2Fgr0V57JhemCUNk0pqscP7vFagUR%2BicETzEd2%2B%2Fy45pkpTTiwqds%2BFyoPoxn1g%3D%3D--Po2%2Boh3TsKnH2dDk--uLvCvDG7SDRtQP9jQ5%2B3Pw%3D%3D; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure\nSet-Cookie: _octo=GH1.1.1102872677.1583261629; Path=/; Domain=github.com; Expires=Wed, 03 Mar 2021 18:53:49 GMT; Secure\nSet-Cookie: logged_in=no; Path=/; Domain=github.com; Expires=Wed, 03 Mar 2021 18:53:49 GMT; HttpOnly; Secure\nContent-Length: 0\nX-GitHub-Request-Id: 1E08:1FAA7:4596C76:6318A3E:5E5EA7BD\n```\n</issue>"

It defines several methods related to the lifecycle of checking links, such as initialization, processing results, and finalization.\n   - Within the context of the feature request, this class would be a likely place to add or modify logic to support custom HTTP headers, seeing as it orchestrates the link checking process.\n\n2. **Absence of `queue_request` method:**\n   - The method `queue_request` was not found, indicating either a misunderstanding of the underlying implementation or that the relevant HTTP request functionality is named differently or handled in a method we've yet to identify. Given this absence, we should turn our attention to methods directly involved in making HTTP requests or preparing request parameters.\n\n3. **Hardcoded `Accept` HTTP header in `check_thread` method:**\n   - The code snippet around line 111 from the `check_thread` method shows exactly where the hardcoded `Accept` HTTP header is defined. This section of the code is preparing HTTP request parameters, including headers, for sending requests as part of the link checking process.\n   - This direct modification of the headers in the dictionary indicates where we can introduce customizability for headers. To address the issue and implement the requested feature, this part of the code would be the ideal place to modify in order to allow users to specify their own headers, instead of being limited to the hardcoded `Accept` header value.\n   - The intended behavior after modifying this part of the code would be to either extend or entirely replace the default header based on user configuration, thus granting the flexibility needed to work around issues like the one described in the feature request (e.g., the `406 Not Acceptable` response from GitHub Actions badges).\n\nGiven the analysis, the next steps for implementing the feature would involve:\n- Extending the `CheckExternalLinksBuilder` class's configuration handling to include user-defined HTTP headers.\n- Modifying the `check_thread` method or its surrounding logic to incorporate these user-defined headers into the outgoing HTTP requests for link checking.\n\nFurther context might be required for understanding how Sphinx handles configuration (e.g., whether there's a specific methodology for introducing new configuration options and passing them to the relevant builder classes). Therefore, it might be helpful to search for methods that handle configuration loading or processing within the `CheckExternalLinksBuilder` class or its parent classes."

Instead of having the `Accept` header hardcoded as it currently stands, the method should check if there are any user-defined HTTP headers specified in the Sphinx configuration (possibly in a new configuration option such as `linkcheck_http_headers`). This new logic should ideally:\n       - Preserve the default `Accept` header if no custom headers are specified by the user.\n       - Override or extend the default `Accept` header with the values provided by the user if custom headers are configured. This allows for flexibility and addresses the issue where certain servers respond unfavorably to the hardcoded `Accept` header value.\n       - Ensure that the existing functionality of `linkcheck` is not affected for users who do not specify custom headers, maintaining backward compatibility."
