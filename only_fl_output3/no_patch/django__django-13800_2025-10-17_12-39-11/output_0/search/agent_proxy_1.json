Specifically, it should avoid the use of escape characters not allowed by RFC 6265 and ensure that the entire cookie, including its name and value, conforms to the allowed characters specified by the RFC. The existing functionality of serializing message data for storage in a cookie should be preserved, but the method used for escaping or encoding the data should be adapted to adhere strictly to RFC 6265, avoiding characters like backslash (\\\\) unless they're explicitly allowed by the RFC in cookie values.\n\n**Bug Location 2:**\n   - **File:** `django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py`\n   - **Class:** `CookieStorage`\n   - **Method:** `_update_cookie`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** The method should update the cookie with encoded message data in a way that ensures the cookie's entire structure is compliant with RFC 6265. If the `_update_cookie` method plays any role in how the value is set or formatted (e.g., adding escape characters or handling serialized data), it must do so in compliance with RFC specifications. The intended adjustment would be to ensure any manipulation of the cookie value during update operations (such as adding or concatenating serialized message strings) strictly follows RFC 6265 guidelines, thus preserving the functionality of updating cookie with messages while making it secure and compliant."
