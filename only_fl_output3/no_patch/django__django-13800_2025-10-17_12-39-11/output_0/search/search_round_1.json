        "content": "To address the issue related to RFC 6265 compliance of cookies in Django's contrib.messages, we need to locate where cookies are managed and specifically how they are being set or modified in the `contrib.messages` framework. The description indicates that there's an issue with how Django escapes characters in cookie values, which could likely be happening either at the cookie serialization or deserialization phase.\n\nBased on the described problem, we should target a few specific areas in the Django `contrib.messages` framework:\n\n1. **Look for how cookies are handled in `contrib.messages`**: Since cookies are a central part of HTTP response and request handling, this logic could be encapsulated within a method or class responsible for setting, getting, or processing cookies. Because `contrib.messages` utilizes cookies to store messages, finding the relevant class or method that handles these cookies is crucial.\n\n2. **Examine cookie handling utility functions or methods**: There could be utility functions or methods specifically designed for processing or escaping cookie values. These functions might be where the non-RFC-compliant character escaping is occurring.\n\nGiven the described issue, the following API calls will provide us with the necessary context:\n\n1. **Searching for cookie management in `contrib.messages`**: Since the issue relates directly to how cookies are managed within Django's `contrib.messages`, look for classes related to message storage or message middleware which may interact with cookies.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"MessageStorage\")\nsearch_class(\"CookieStorage\")\n```\n\n2. **Looking into how Django serializes cookie values**: To find code where the cookie values might be escaped in a way that violates RFC 6265, we should look for methods that might serialize or encode cookie values. Common terms for such operations might include \"serialize\", \"encode\", or \"escape\".\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"serialize\")\nsearch_method(\"encode\")\nsearch_method(\"escape\")\n```\n\nThese searches will help locate the sections of code related to the issue, providing a solid foundation for understanding how `contrib.messages` handles cookies and where the non-compliant escaping might occur."

        "content": "Analyzing the context collected from the API calls, let's examine each piece of information to understand its relevance to the bug related to RFC 6265 compliance of cookies in `contrib.messages`.\n\n### 1. `CookieStorage` class in `django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py`\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n- The `CookieStorage` class manages the storage of messages in cookies. It contains methods for initializing the cookie storage, getting messages from the storage, updating the cookie with new messages, storing messages, and encoding/decoding messages to and from the cookie format.\n\n**What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n- This class is directly related to the bug as it handles the encoding (and potentially escaping) of messages into cookie values. Given that the issue is about Django trying to use an escape-character in cookie values not supported in RFC 6265, methods `_encode`, `_decode`, `_update_cookie`, and possibly `_store` are of particular interest.\n\n**Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n- The intended behavior would be to conform to RFC 6265 when encoding and storing messages in cookies, ensuring no unsupported escape characters are used. This would likely require changes to the `_encode` method to ensure it serializes cookie values in a compliant manner.\n\n### 2. `serialize` method occurrences\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n- The `serialize` methods are found across various modules in Django and are generally used to convert complex data types into formats that can be easily stored or transmitted.\n\n**What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n- Given the widespread appearance of `serialize` methods across different contexts, it's not immediately clear which, if any, directly impact the serialization of messages into cookie values in a way that relates to the issue. Without specific information tying a `serialize` method to cookie handling in `contrib.messages`, it's hard to assess their relevance.\n\n**Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n- If any `serialize` methods are used in the process of encoding messages for cookies, their intended behavior would be to ensure serialized data conforms to RFC 6265. However, without evidence of their involvement in cookie handling within `contrib.messages`, focusing on them might not be productive.\n\n### 3. `encode` method occurrences\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n- These methods are concerned with encoding data across different parts of Django. They could be encoding data for storage in sessions, hashing passwords, or other purposes.\n\n**What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n- Unless specifically tied to cookie handling within `contrib.messages`, these `encode` methods might not be directly related to the issue at hand. However, if any of these methods are called as part of the process to encode messages into cookies, they could potentially play a part in introducing non-RFC-compliant characters.\n\n**Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n- Any method involved in encoding cookie values should ensure the output is RFC 6265 compliant.\n\n### 4. `escape` method in `django/utils/html.py`\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n- The `escape` method encodes text for safe use in HTML by escaping ampersands, quotes, and angle brackets.\n\n**What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n- While this method deals with escaping characters for HTML, not cookies, it suggests a pattern of how Django handles the escaping of potentially unsafe characters. If a similar approach is incorrectly applied to cookies, it could lead to the issue described.\n\n**Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n- The issue doesn't directly relate to HTML escaping but to cookies. Therefore, the intended behavior is an effective method that escapes cookie values in compliance with RFC 6265, potentially suggesting a need for a separate, correctly implemented escaping method for cookies.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the analysis, focusing on the `CookieStorage` class, and specifically the `_encode` method within it, appears most promising. It is likely that the solution to the issue lies in adjusting how cookie values are encoded to ensure compliance with RFC 6265, avoiding any escape characters not supported by the specification. Further inspection of the `_encode` and potentially the `_update_cookie` methods is needed to identify and correct the non-compliant behavior."

Specifically, it should avoid the use of escape characters not allowed by RFC 6265 and ensure that the entire cookie, including its name and value, conforms to the allowed characters specified by the RFC. The existing functionality of serializing message data for storage in a cookie should be preserved, but the method used for escaping or encoding the data should be adapted to adhere strictly to RFC 6265, avoiding characters like backslash (\\\\) unless they're explicitly allowed by the RFC in cookie values.\n\n**Bug Location 2:**\n   - **File:** `django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py`\n   - **Class:** `CookieStorage`\n   - **Method:** `_update_cookie`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** The method should update the cookie with encoded message data in a way that ensures the cookie's entire structure is compliant with RFC 6265. If the `_update_cookie` method plays any role in how the value is set or formatted (e.g., adding escape characters or handling serialized data), it must do so in compliance with RFC specifications. The intended adjustment would be to ensure any manipulation of the cookie value during update operations (such as adding or concatenating serialized message strings) strictly follows RFC 6265 guidelines, thus preserving the functionality of updating cookie with messages while making it secure and compliant."
