        "content": "To address the issue related to RFC 6265 compliance of cookies in Django's contrib.messages, we need to locate where cookies are managed and specifically how they are being set or modified in the `contrib.messages` framework. The description indicates that there's an issue with how Django escapes characters in cookie values, which could likely be happening either at the cookie serialization or deserialization phase.\n\nBased on the described problem, we should target a few specific areas in the Django `contrib.messages` framework:\n\n1. **Look for how cookies are handled in `contrib.messages`**: Since cookies are a central part of HTTP response and request handling, this logic could be encapsulated within a method or class responsible for setting, getting, or processing cookies. Because `contrib.messages` utilizes cookies to store messages, finding the relevant class or method that handles these cookies is crucial.\n\n2. **Examine cookie handling utility functions or methods**: There could be utility functions or methods specifically designed for processing or escaping cookie values. These functions might be where the non-RFC-compliant character escaping is occurring.\n\nGiven the described issue, the following API calls will provide us with the necessary context:\n\n1. **Searching for cookie management in `contrib.messages`**: Since the issue relates directly to how cookies are managed within Django's `contrib.messages`, look for classes related to message storage or message middleware which may interact with cookies.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"MessageStorage\")\nsearch_class(\"CookieStorage\")\n```\n\n2. **Looking into how Django serializes cookie values**: To find code where the cookie values might be escaped in a way that violates RFC 6265, we should look for methods that might serialize or encode cookie values. Common terms for such operations might include \"serialize\", \"encode\", or \"escape\".\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"serialize\")\nsearch_method(\"encode\")\nsearch_method(\"escape\")\n```\n\nThese searches will help locate the sections of code related to the issue, providing a solid foundation for understanding how `contrib.messages` handles cookies and where the non-compliant escaping might occur."
