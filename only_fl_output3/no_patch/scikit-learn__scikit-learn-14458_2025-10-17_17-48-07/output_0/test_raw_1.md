Given your request to attempt the task again and the issues you've encountered, I'll restructure the `reproducer.py` file with the correct error handling to ensure it works as expected. Remember, this script is specifically crafted to trigger the `ValueError: ndarray is not C-contiguous` associated with the original problem. It will intentionally try to reproduce this error, capturing and asserting the occurrence of the issue.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
    from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge

    # Ensuring all dependencies are correctly installed and imported
    census = fetch_openml(data_id=534, as_frame=True)
    X, y = census.data, census.target
    numerical_cols = ['AGE', 'EDUCATION', 'EXPERIENCE']

    # Attempting the operation that was reported to fail
    model = Ridge(solver='sag').fit(X[numerical_cols], y)

except ValueError as e:
    # Catching the specific error to assert its occurrence
    if "ndarray is not C-contiguous" in str(e):
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.") from e
    else:
        print("Unexpected ValueError encountered:", str(e))
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise
except Exception as e:
    # Catching unexpected errors that indicate other issues
    print("An unexpected exception occurred:", str(e))
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise
else:
    # If no error occurs, this means the issue has been fixed
    print("The issue has been fixed. No error raised.")
    exit(0)
```

This script is designed to clearly identify the presence of the specific issue. If executed in an environment where the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError` as expected and print a detailed stack trace pointing directly to the source of the error within the code. On the other hand, if the issue is absent (meaning the error is no longer triggered by the same operation), the script will acknowledge the fix and exit gracefully with code 0.
