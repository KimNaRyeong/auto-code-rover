        "intended_behavior": "The `make_dataset` function needs an adjustment to ensure the numpy arrays (`X` in this context) passed to `ArrayData` are C-contiguous. This could be achieved by incorporating a call to `check_array` with appropriate parameters to enforce C-contiguity. The call to `check_array` should occur before the dense data path decision, specifically before or at line 94 where the dataset is assigned for non-sparse inputs. This change ensures that when the data reaches the `ArrayData` creation step, it already meets the necessary C-contiguity requirements, thus preventing the `ValueError: ndarray is not C-contiguous`. Moreover, this addition must preserve the existing behavior for handling both sparse and dense data sets without altering their intended handling elsewhere in the code."
