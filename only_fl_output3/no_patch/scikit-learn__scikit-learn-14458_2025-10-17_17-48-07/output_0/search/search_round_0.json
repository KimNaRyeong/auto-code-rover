        "content": "To address the issue reported, we need to gather more context around the error and the proposed solution involving `check_array` and `ArrayData`. We should look into the class where the error originates (`ArrayDataset64` or `ArrayData`), the use of `check_array` in similar contexts, and the method `make_dataset` where the error traceback points to. Hence, the API calls should target these areas:\n\n- Investigate the `make_dataset` method within the file mentioned (`base.py`) to understand its current implementation and how it handles the input data.\n- Look into the `ArrayDataset64` or similar (`ArrayData`) class to understand its expectations for input data format.\n- Research how `check_array` is typically used in the project to see if integrating it as suggested could be consistent with other parts of the codebase.\n- Since the `Ridge` class is part of the scenario, exploring its initialization, especially with the `solver='sag'` parameter, might provide additional insights into the data requirements.\n\nHere are the API calls that will help gather this context:\n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"make_dataset\", \"sklearn/linear_model/base.py\")`\n2. `search_class(\"ArrayDataset64\")` - Assuming `ArrayData` refers to `ArrayDataset64` or similar.\n3. `search_code(\"check_array\")` - This will help us understand how `check_array` is used throughout the project.\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"Ridge\")` - To understand how the `Ridge` model's `fit` method processes its input data when using the SAG solver."
