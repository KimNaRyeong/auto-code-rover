Certainly! Below is a standalone Python file, `reproducer.py`, that is designed to reproduce the issue described. This script incorporates robust error handling and stack trace printing functionality as requested:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
    from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge

    census = fetch_openml(data_id=534, as_frame=True)
    X, y = census.data, census.target
    numerical_cols = ['AGE', 'EDUCATION', 'EXPERIENCE']

    # This line is expected to raise a ValueError due to the C-contiguity issue.
    model = Ridge(solver='sag').fit(X[numerical_cols], y)

except ValueError as e:
    if "ndarray is not C-contiguous" in str(e):
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue ('ndarray is not C-contiguous') is present.") from e
    else:
        print("Unexpected ValueError encountered:", str(e))
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise
except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected error occurred:", str(e))
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise
else:
    print("No ValueError raised, the issue might have been fixed.")
    exit(0)
```

Please note:

- This script aims to directly tackle the scenario where the Sklearn `Ridge` model, initialized with the `sag` solver, is fitted to a dataset that potentially has non-C-contiguous arrays. If the issue is present, as defined by the occurrence of the "ndarray is not C-contiguous" `ValueError`, it will be caught, and a stack trace will be printed to STDERR, followed by raising an `AssertionError`.
- In any other case of an unexpected error, the script will print that error's stack trace as well but will raise the original exception to avoid masking the underlying issue.
- If the script executes without raising the aforementioned `ValueError`, it implies that the issue might have been resolved in the environment it was run in, and the script will exit with code 0, indicating success.
