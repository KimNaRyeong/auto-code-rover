        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the decode method within the CFScaleOffsetCoder class should be updated to correctly handle scale_factor and add_offset when these are provided as length-1 lists, in addition to the currently supported types (numpy arrays and scalars). This can be achieved by first checking if the scale_factor or add_offset is a list, and if so, whether it is a length-1 list. If it meets these conditions, the single element within the list should be extracted similarly to how the .item() call extracts a single value from a numpy array. This adjustment will allow the method to flexibly handle these attributes in various forms, ensuring that datasets with scale_factor and add_offset encoded as length-1 lists are processed correctly without raising an error. The modification must preserve the existing functionality for non-list types, ensuring backward compatibility with the current handling of scalars and numpy arrays."
