        "content": "<issue>Decode_cf fails when scale_factor is a length-1 list\nSome datasets I work with have `scale_factor` and `add_offset` encoded as length-1 lists. The following code worked as of Xarray 0.16.1\n```python\nimport xarray as xr\nds = xr.DataArray([0, 1, 2], name='foo',\nattrs={'scale_factor': [0.01],\n'add_offset': [1.0]}).to_dataset()\nxr.decode_cf(ds)\n```\nIn 0.16.2 (just released) and current master, it fails with this error\n```\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-2-a0b01d6a314b> in <module>\n2                   attrs={'scale_factor': [0.01],\n3                          'add_offset': [1.0]}).to_dataset()\n----> 4 xr.decode_cf(ds)\n~/Code/xarray/xarray/conventions.py in decode_cf(obj, concat_characters, mask_and_scale, decode_times, decode_coords, drop_variables, use_cftime, decode_timedelta)\n587         raise TypeError(\"can only decode Dataset or DataStore objects\")\n588\n--> 589     vars, attrs, coord_names = decode_cf_variables(\n590         vars,\n591         attrs,\n~/Code/xarray/xarray/conventions.py in decode_cf_variables(variables, attributes, concat_characters, mask_and_scale, decode_times, decode_coords, drop_variables, use_cftime, decode_timedelta)\n490             and stackable(v.dims[-1])\n491         )\n--> 492         new_vars[k] = decode_cf_variable(\n493             k,\n494             v,\n~/Code/xarray/xarray/conventions.py in decode_cf_variable(name, var, concat_characters, mask_and_scale, decode_times, decode_endianness, stack_char_dim, use_cftime, decode_timedelta)\n333             variables.CFScaleOffsetCoder(),\n334         ]:\n--> 335             var = coder.decode(var, name=name)\n336\n337     if decode_timedelta:\n~/Code/xarray/xarray/coding/variables.py in decode(self, variable, name)\n271             dtype = _choose_float_dtype(data.dtype, \"add_offset\" in attrs)\n272             if np.ndim(scale_factor) > 0:\n--> 273                 scale_factor = scale_factor.item()\n274             if np.ndim(add_offset) > 0:\n275                 add_offset = add_offset.item()\nAttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'item'\n```\nI'm very confused, because this feels quite similar to #4471, and I thought it was resolved #4485.\nHowever, the behavior is different with `'scale_factor': np.array([0.01])`. That works fine--no error.\nHow might I end up with a dataset with `scale_factor` as a python list? It happens when I open a netcdf file using the `h5netcdf` engine (documented by @gerritholl in https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/4471#issuecomment-702018925) and then write it to zarr. The numpy array gets encoded as a list in the zarr json metadata. \ud83d\ude43\nThis problem would go away if we could resolve the discrepancies between the two engines' treatment of scalar attributes.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context to resolve the issue, we should focus on the parts of the Xarray codebase that are mentioned in the stack trace and the issue description. Specifically, we need to look into how the `decode_cf` function operates, especially when dealing with the `scale_factor` and `add_offset` attributes. Here are the relevant API calls based on the descriptions and code snippets provided in the issue:\n\n1. **`decode_cf` in `conventions.py`** - The error originates from this function, so let's examine its implementation and its call to `decode_cf_variables`.\n\n2. **`decode_cf_variables` in `conventions.py`** - This function is directly called by `decode_cf` and seems central to the issue, particularly in how variables are decoded.\n\n3. **`decode_cf_variable` in `conventions.py`** - Mentioned in the stack trace as well, this function handles the decoding of individual variables and seems to be where the error ultimately occurs regarding `scale_factor`.\n\n4. **`CFScaleOffsetCoder.decode` in `variables.py`** - The stack trace indicates that the error message `\"list object has no attribute 'item'\"` is thrown here, so we need to look into the logic for handling `scale_factor` and `add_offset`. \n\n5. **Code snippets exactly causing the error** - Since the error mentions `\"list object has no attribute 'item'\"`, let's search for the code trying to call `.item()` on what's expected to be a numpy array but is instead a list in this context.\n\nGiven these requirements, the following API calls will gather the necessary context:\n\n- `search_method(\"decode_cf\")`\n- `search_method(\"decode_cf_variables\")`\n- `search_method(\"decode_cf_variable\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"decode\", \"CFScaleOffsetCoder\")`\n- `search_code(\"scale_factor = scale_factor.item()\")`\n- `search_code(\"add_offset = add_offset.item()\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how `decode_cf` and related functions work, focusing particularly on their handling of `scale_factor` and `add_offset`, which are central to the reported issue."
