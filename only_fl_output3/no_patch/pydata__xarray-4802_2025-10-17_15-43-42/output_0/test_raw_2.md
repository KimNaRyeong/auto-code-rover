Based on your request, here is a revised standalone Python file `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue of `decode_cf` failing when `scale_factor` is a length-1 list. This script checks for the specific problem and provides clear output based on whether the issue persists or is resolved. Ensure you have the appropriate version of `xarray` that matches the context of the issue.

```python
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        ds = xr.DataArray([0, 1, 2], name='foo',
                          attrs={'scale_factor': [0.01],
                                 'add_offset': [1.0]}).to_dataset()
        xr.decode_cf(ds)
        print("Success: The issue has been fixed.")
    except AttributeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate the presence of the issue.
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 for any other errors that might have occurred.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Save this code into a file named `reproducer.py` and execute it in an environment where the `xarray` library is installed. Please adjust the environment to match the version where the issue is present:

- The script will try to reproduce the issue by decoding a dataset that has `scale_factor` and `add_offset` stored as length-1 lists.
- If the issue (an `AttributeError` related to the handling of these attributes) is encountered, the script will print the stack trace detailing the error and exit with code 1.
- If the dataset decodes without raising an `AttributeError`, it prints a success message, indicating the issue has been resolved in this environment.
