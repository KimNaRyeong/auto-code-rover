Given the specific requirements and focusing on the initial instructions to reproduce the encountered issue within a Django environment, the goal is to showcase how to dynamically create a test environment, simulate the data load operation for two linked models (`Author` and `Book`), and eventually run a check to highlight any discrepancies when attempting to load data into a non-default database. This dedicated attempt further encapsulates the need to accurately simulate the outlined issue, underlining the necessity of a script that can innovatively tackle the intricacies tied to Django's models, serialization, and database operations.

Here is an adapted standalone script version that should be more aligned with the requirements for reproducing the issue, specifically tailored to provoke the described failure scenario under a non-default Django database setting.

```python
# reproducer.py

def setup_django_environment():
    """
    Dynamically sets up the Django environment to allow models and Django commands to be used outside of
    the standard Django project structure.
    """
    import os
    import django
    from django.conf import settings

    BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

    settings.configure(
        BASE_DIR=BASE_DIR,
        DEBUG=True,
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
            },
            'other': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'other.sqlite3'),
            },
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=[
            'testbug',
        ],
        USE_TZ=True,
    )

    django.setup()

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys

    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    from django.core.management import call_command
    from testbug.models import Author, Book
    from django.db import connections

    # Ensure 'other' database is migrated
    call_command('migrate', database='other')

    # Attempt to load fixture into 'other' database
    try:
        call_command('loaddata', 'books.json', database='other')
        # Validate loaded data
        assert Author.objects.using('other').exists(), "No Author loaded!"
        assert Book.objects.using('other').exists(), "No Book loaded!"
        print("Data successfully loaded into 'other' database. Issue not reproduced.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Failed to load data into 'other' database.") from e

def main():
    setup_django_environment()
    reproduce_issue()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Adjustments made:
- The Django environment is programmatically configured via `setup_django_environment`, ensuring correct settings context.
- An improved documentation has been provided inline with the script's code to enhance clarity on the procedure and intended actions.
- The `reproduce_issue` function attempts to migrate and then load data into a non-default ('other') database. It asserts the existence of the loaded data, aimed to highlight the reported issue upon failure.
- Usage of the previously provided `print_stacktrace` function remains intact, ensuring uniform error reporting.

Please note:
- This script presumes the presence of a `books.json` fixture file in the root directory of your project alongside this script.
- The `testbug` app must be correctly set up in your Django project with `Author` and `Book` models as described.
- Before running this script, ensure Django and the app are correctly configured to avoid ModuleNotFoundError or ImproperlyConfigured errors.
- Adjust model import paths and settings as necessary to match the actual configuration of your Django project.

Given the dynamic nature of Django environments and database configurations, slight modifications might be required to match the exact project setup you are working with.
