        "intended_behavior": "The `handle` method should ensure that when loading data, it respects the database alias specified by the `--database` flag for all operations, including when resolving natural keys involving foreign key dependencies. This might involve enhancing the data loading process to explicitly pass the database alias to the model's manager methods responsible for fetching related instances via natural keys, ensuring that related objects are looked up in the correct database context."

        "method": "loaddata",
        "intended_behavior": "Within the `loaddata` method, when fixtures are being loaded, and it encounters a model that uses natural keys that includes foreign key relations, the method should check that the database used for fetching related models via natural keys is consistent with the database specified for the `loaddata` command. If necessary, this might require changes to ensure that all database operations within this method, and possibly deeper in the call chain, are aware of and respect the designated database alias."
