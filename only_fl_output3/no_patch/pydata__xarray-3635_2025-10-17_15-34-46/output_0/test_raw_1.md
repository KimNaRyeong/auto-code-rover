Given the initial misunderstanding, let's correct the approach based on the problem specifics and the expected behavior of xarray's quantile method.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_test():
    import xarray as xr

    da = xr.DataArray([0, 1, 2])

    try:
        # Using a value in the range [0, 1] as xarray's quantile expects the q value to be in decimal form for percentage
        da.quantile(q=0.5)  # Proper use: quantile fraction should be between 0 and 1 for xarray, not 0 and 100.
        print("Test passed: No Error Raised")
    except ValueError as e:
        if "Percentiles must be in the range [0, 100]" in str(e):
            assert False, "Issue detected: The error message has not been corrected to reflect the required range [0, 1]."
        else:
            # If a different ValueError is caught, recheck for correctness.
            assert "Quantiles must be in the range [0, 1]" in str(e), "Unexpected error message"
    except Exception as ex:
        print_stacktrace(ex)
        assert False, "An unexpected error occurred."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        run_test()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as ex:
        print_stacktrace(ex)
```

This version of `reproducer.py` aims to check for the specific issue of handling quantile calculations with xarray, where quantiles must be specified as decimals (fractions) instead of percentages. If xarray correctly processes quantiles in the range [0,1] without raising an exception, the test will pass. If it mistakenly raises a `ValueError` with an incorrect message indicating that "Percentiles must be in the range [0, 100]", the script will highlight this as an issue that needs to be fixed.
