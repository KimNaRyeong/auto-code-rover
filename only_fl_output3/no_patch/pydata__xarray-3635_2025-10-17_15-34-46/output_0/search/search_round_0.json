Given the information, the following actions seem appropriate:\n\n1. **Search for the `DataArray` class**: This will provide an overview of where the `quantile` method might be implemented or overridden.\n2. **Search for the `quantile` method within the `DataArray` class**: Since the issue specifically mentions an error with the quantile method in a DataArray, finding its implementation is crucial.\n3. **Search for the code invoking `np.nanpercentile`**: This is relevant since the issue mentions that xarray wraps `np.nanpercentile` and the error originates from there, indicating an incorrect quantile range is being passed.\n\nBased on these considerations, the following search API calls will be made to get the necessary context:\n\n- `search_class(\"DataArray\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"quantile\", \"DataArray\")`\n- `search_code(\"np.nanpercentile\")`"
