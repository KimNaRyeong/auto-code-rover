To reproduce the specific issue provided, we'll create a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py`. This script will focus on attempting to invoke the `quantile` method on an `xarray.DataArray` object with a percentile value mistakenly passed as within the range [0, 100] instead of the correct [0, 1]. The script is meant to demonstrate the presence of the issue when the error message does not match the expected output, i.e., when xarray signals an error pertaining to percentile ranges inappropriately associated with NumPy's expectations rather than xarray's.

Given that the error message is expected to guide the user correctly but fails to do so here's how the script addresses this:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_quantile_error_message():
    import xarray as xr
    try:
        da = xr.DataArray([0, 1, 2])
        # Intentionally incorrect to trigger error. Correct usage would be q=0.5 for the 50th percentile.
        da.quantile(q=50)
    except ValueError as e:
        if str(e) != "Quantiles must be in the range [0, 1]":
            print_stacktrace(e)
            assert False, "Error message not corrected yet."
        else:
            # Error message corrected; thus, the expected outcome realized.
            return
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "An unexpected error type was raised."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_quantile_error_message()
        print("The test has completed successfully.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as ex:
        print_stacktrace(ex)
```

This script attempts to execute a snippet of code that should lead to a `ValueError` due to a misuse of the `quantile` method's expected percentile range. The script checks specifically for the error message that arises from this mistake. If the error message matches "Quantiles must be in the range [0, 1]", it's presumed the library behaves as expected, and the issue is considered not present, allowing the script to complete successfully. If any other message or exception type is caught, it prints a detailed stack trace for diagnostic purposes.
