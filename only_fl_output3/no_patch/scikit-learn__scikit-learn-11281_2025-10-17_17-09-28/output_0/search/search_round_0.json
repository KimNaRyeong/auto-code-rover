They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers. But they are unlike clusterers in API:\n* they have an `n_components` parameter, with identical purpose to `n_clusters`\n* they do not store the `labels_` of the training data\n* they do not have a `fit_predict` method\nAnd they are almost entirely documented separately.\nShould we make the MMs more like clusterers?\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue presented, I will first search for mixture model classes to understand how they are currently implemented and contrast their interface with that of clusterers. Given the points mentioned in the issue, I will also look for clusterer implementations to compare parameters, stored attributes, and methods. Specifically, I aim to find occurrences of `n_components` and `n_clusters`, see if mixture models indeed lack `labels_` attribute and a `fit_predict` method, and get some context on how these models are documented. Here are the API calls I will make:\n\n1. `search_code(\"n_components\")`: This will help us understand how `n_components` is used across the codebase, and in which classes it is a parameter.\n2. `search_code(\"n_clusters\")`: To see how and where `n_clusters` is used, giving us insight into clusterer implementations.\n3. `search_code(\"labels_\")`: To check if mixture models really don't store `labels_` and how clusterers do.\n4. `search_method(\"fit_predict\")`: To find out which classes have a `fit_predict` method and see if mixture models are indeed lacking this method."
