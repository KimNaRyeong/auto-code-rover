        "intended_behavior": "To align mixture models more closely with clusterer interfaces, the `BaseMixture` class should explicitly include or ensure access to the `labels_` attribute after fitting. This attribute should store the cluster assignments for each sample in the training data, based on the highest posterior probability akin to how `predict` determines the closest component. This would require storing `labels_` as an attribute following the fitting process, enhancing interpretability and utility for inductive learning."

        "method": "",
        "intended_behavior": "Add a `fit_predict` method that performs both fitting to the data and returning the cluster labels (or component assignments for mixture models). This method should fit the model on the data and then return the labels for each sample in the fitting data, calculated as per the current `predict` method's logic. This addition will enhance the workflow efficiency, allowing users to fit the model and obtain cluster assignments in one step, aligning with the conventional clusterer interface."

        "intended_behavior": "Evaluate and consider renaming the `n_components` parameter to `n_clusters` across all mixture model implementations to improve API consistency with clusterers. This change should be carefully communicated and documented to ensure backward compatibility, for instance, through deprecation warnings or dual-parameter handling during a transition phase. The underlying functionality and model fitting process would remain unchanged, preserving existing capabilities while improving the API's intuitive nature and alignment with clustering terminology."
