Below is a corrected version of the `reproducer.py` script designed to raise an exception if the pretty printing format issue for the `Product` class in SymPy is present, adhering to your original requirements. This version directly addresses checking for potentially problematic formatting without comparing to a specific expected string, but rather focusing on structural issues as mentioned in the problem description.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import Product, symbols, oo, pprint
    import io
    import sys

    # Capture the output of pprint
    old_stdout = sys.stdout
    sys.stdout = io.StringIO()

    n = symbols('n')
    product_examples = [
        Product(1, (n, 1, oo)),
        Product(1/n, (n, 1, oo)),
        Product(1/n**2, (n, 1, oo))
    ]

    issue_detected = False

    try:
        for prod in product_examples:
            sys.stdout.seek(0) # Reset StringIO object to capture new output
            pprint(prod, use_unicode=True) # Or use_unicode=False based on requirements
            output = sys.stdout.getvalue()
            
            # Check if the issue described is present in the captured output
            if "┬" in output and "─" in output: # Checking for fat ∏ and extended top bar as mentioned
                # Verify if the bottom is asymmetric due to an extra empty line at the bottom of ∏
                if output.endswith('\n\n'): # Two newlines would indicate an extra empty line
                    issue_detected = True
                    break
    finally:
        # Restore the original stdout
        sys.stdout = old_stdout

    if issue_detected:
        raise AssertionError("Pretty print could be improved: Issue detected with Product pretty print format.")
    else:
        print("No formatting issue detected with Product pretty print.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Exiting with code 0 when the issue is present as per requirements
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # In case of unexpected errors
    else:
        # Exiting with code 1 when no issue is detected, implying the issue has been fixed or the test failed to catch it
        sys.exit(1)
```

This script attempts to capture the pretty-printed output of `Product` expressions and checks for specific formatting issues. If the script detects characteristics of the poorly formatted output (as described in the issue about fat ∏, extended top bar, or asymmetric bottom), it will raise an `AssertionError`. The script uses Python's `io.StringIO` to capture standard output temporarily, allowing inspection of `pprint`'s output.

The script ensures clean-up to restore standard output whether an issue is detected or not. Exceptions, including the AssertionError for the designated issue, result in printing a detailed stack trace and exiting with status `0` when the problem is detected, adhering to the specific requirement for indicating the presence of the issue.
