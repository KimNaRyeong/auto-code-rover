The `expected` string within `reproduce_issue()` should ideally reflect the fixed state of pretty printing, where the symbol is not too wide and doesn't include unnecessary blank lines. However, since actual comparison with the hard-coded `expected` variable could vary based on what the correct format is considered to be, this script instead checks for the count of newline characters as a proxy for detecting the described issues (excessive lines or width).\n\nThe script is designed to alert to the specific problem as described by printing a stack trace when the assertion fails, thereby indicating the presence of the issue accurately. Note that the successful detection (assertion failure) leads to an exit with code 0, aligning with the instructions for indicating when an issue is detected under these peculiar conditions."
