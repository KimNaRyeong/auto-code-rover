Apologies for the confusion before. Let's address the issue correctly this time, considering the correct usage of the pretty-printing functionality in SymPy and without using unsupported keyword arguments. We will also ensure that assertions properly validate the format of the output to identify the issue discussed. 

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    from sympy import Product, symbols, oo, init_printing
    from sympy.printing.pretty.pretty import pretty
    n = symbols('n')
    init_printing(use_unicode=True)

    # Creating a product object
    prod = Product(1/n**2, (n, 1, oo))

    # Generating the pretty string representation
    pretty_str = pretty(prod)

    # The expected output should not contain an extra line at the bottom of the product
    # nor should the product (∏) be unnecessarily wide
    expected = """\
    ∞
─┬─────┬─
 │     │  1
 │     │  ──
 │     │   2
 │     │  n
  n = 1"""
    # This condition checks only for the absence of the extra line and width issue, further refinement may be needed
    try:
        assert pretty_str.count("\n") < 8, "Pretty print output appears to contain excessive lines or width."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError:
        # Exiting with 0 indicates the test successfully detected the presence of the issue.
        import sys
        sys.exit(0)
    else:
        print("The pretty print format seems to be correct or the script failed to identify the issue.")
        # Exiting with 1 in case the script did not catch the format issue, assuming it should have.
        sys.exit(1)
```

This script is structured to assess the pretty-print formatting of a `Product` in SymPy. The `expected` string within `reproduce_issue()` should ideally reflect the fixed state of pretty printing, where the symbol is not too wide and doesn't include unnecessary blank lines. However, since actual comparison with the hard-coded `expected` variable could vary based on what the correct format is considered to be, this script instead checks for the count of newline characters as a proxy for detecting the described issues (excessive lines or width).

The script is designed to alert to the specific problem as described by printing a stack trace when the assertion fails, thereby indicating the presence of the issue accurately. Note that the successful detection (assertion failure) leads to an exit with code 0, aligning with the instructions for indicating when an issue is detected under these peculiar conditions.
