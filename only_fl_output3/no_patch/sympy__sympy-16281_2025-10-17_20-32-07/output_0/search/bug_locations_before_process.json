        "intended_behavior": "The code within this file responsible for the pretty printing of `Product` instances needs to be modified or enhanced. This could involve adjusting the method(s) that generate the textual representation of mathematical products. Specifically, the modifications should aim to: - Remove the unnecessary empty line at the bottom of the product notation to make the presentation more compact and aligned with mathematical standards. - Adjust the width of the product notation to ensure it does not appear excessively broad ('too fat'), making it more in line with the visual aesthetics of related symbols and expressions. - Optionally extend the top bar of the product notation if such a change does not adversely affect the clarity or consistency of the representation, potentially making the notation more visually appealing and understandable. These adjustments should be carefully implemented to preserve the existing functionality of the pretty printing code, ensuring that all other expressions and symbols continue to be rendered correctly and without unintended modifications."
