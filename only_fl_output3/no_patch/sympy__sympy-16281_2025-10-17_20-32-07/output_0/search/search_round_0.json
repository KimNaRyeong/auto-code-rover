Keeping everything below the horizontal line is good, but the bottom looks asymmetric, and it makes the \u220f bigger than it needs to be.\n- The \u220f is too fat IMO.\n- It might look better if we extended the top bar. I'm unsure about this.\nCompare this\n```\n\u221e\n\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\n\u2502     \u2502  1\n\u2502     \u2502  \u2500\u2500\n\u2502     \u2502   2\n\u2502     \u2502  n\nn = 1\n```\nThat's still almost twice as wide as the equivalent Sum, but if you make it much skinnier it starts to look bad.\n```\n\u221e\n____\n\u2572\n\u2572   1\n\u2572  \u2500\u2500\n\u2571   2\n\u2571   n\n\u2571\n\u203e\u203e\u203e\u203e\nn = 1\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather context on how the pretty printing for `Product` is currently implemented and identify where potential changes can be made. The issue revolves around the appearance of the output, specifically for the `Product` class when using the `pprint` method or functionality. The concerns include the format and aesthetics, like the unwanted space at the bottom, the width of the structure, and the possibility of extending the top bar for a better look.\n\nGiven these points, we'll need to find out:\n1. How the `Product` class is implemented and where it is located in the codebase.\n2. How the `pprint` functionality is implemented for `Product`.\n3. If the `pprint` functionality is directly part of the `Product` class or if it's implemented via overriding in a utility class or function.\n\nTo accomplish this, the following API calls are helpful:\n\n- `search_class(\"Product\")`: To locate the `Product` class in the codebase.\n- `search_method(\"pprint\")`: To find implementations of the `pprint` method/function across the codebase, which could help in identifying where the formatting for printing `Product` instances is defined.\n\nThese calls should provide a good starting point for understanding how `Product`'s pretty printing is currently implemented and where changes might be needed to improve its appearance."
