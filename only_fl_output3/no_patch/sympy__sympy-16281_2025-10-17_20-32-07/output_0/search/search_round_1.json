Keeping everything below the horizontal line is good, but the bottom looks asymmetric, and it makes the \u220f bigger than it needs to be.\n- The \u220f is too fat IMO.\n- It might look better if we extended the top bar. I'm unsure about this.\nCompare this\n```\n\u221e\n\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\n\u2502     \u2502  1\n\u2502     \u2502  \u2500\u2500\n\u2502     \u2502   2\n\u2502     \u2502  n\nn = 1\n```\nThat's still almost twice as wide as the equivalent Sum, but if you make it much skinnier it starts to look bad.\n```\n\u221e\n____\n\u2572\n\u2572   1\n\u2572  \u2500\u2500\n\u2571   2\n\u2571   n\n\u2571\n\u203e\u203e\u203e\u203e\nn = 1\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "From the results obtained from the search API calls, we have the following context:\n\n### 1. Product Class Context\n- The `Product` class is found in `sympy/concrete/products.py`.\n- It inherits from `ExprWithIntLimits`, suggesting it represents mathematical expressions involving products with specified limits.\n- The class has several methods, including special mathematical computations, rewriting as sums, basic properties, and checks for convergence.\n- Notably, methods like `doit`, which might be responsible for evaluating the product, and `_eval_product`, which directly deals with product evaluation, are present.\n\n### Analysis of Relationship to the Bug\nThe issue revolves around improving the pretty printing of the `Product` class instances, which impacts how these instances are visually represented when using a pretty printer, presumably like the one provided by `sympy` (since `pprint` could not be directly found in the codebase).\n\nGiven that the `Product` class primarily deals with mathematical product functionality rather than presentation, the pretty printing functionality might not be a direct part of this class but rather implemented elsewhere, perhaps in a utility function or class that handles the general pretty printing of expressions.\n\n### Intended Behavior and Further Actions\n- The intended behavior is to modify the pretty printing of `Product` instances so they don't have an unnecessary empty line at the bottom, have a thinner appearance, and possibly have an extended top bar to match the example provided in the issue description.\n- Since `pprint` method was not found directly in relation to the `Product` class or elsewhere in the codebase from the initial search, it suggests that pretty printing might be handled by a separate module or function that deals with rendering expressions into their pretty-printed forms.\n\nTo move forward in resolving the issue, considering the above analysis and the fact that `pprint` couldn't be found directly, it would be insightful to explore the following areas:\n\n1. **Look for a Pretty Printing Utility or Module:**\n   Since `pprint` was not found as a method, it might be part of a module or utility function specific for pretty printing within `sympy`. It's common for libraries like `sympy` to have a dedicated pretty printing module that deals with such functionality.\n\n2. **Search for `Product` References in Pretty Printing Code:**\n   Given the structured nature of `sympy`, pretty printing functionality might rely on visiting different types of nodes (such as instances of `Product`) and rendering them accordingly. Hence, understanding how `Product` instances are specifically handled during pretty printing is key.\n\nTherefore, useful next steps would include:\n- Searching for a pretty printing module or utility in the codebase of `sympy`, perhaps named something like \"pretty.py\", \"pretty_print.py\", or similar variations.\n- Investigating how this pretty printing module interacts with expressions like those of the `Product` class to find the specific code responsible for rendering `Product` instances."
