It does not work within the context of the module.  What I mean by that is I have to key out the entire module path and the class for the type instead of importing the type into the module and only having to type in the type class name.\n### How to Reproduce\nsay I have the following in the module \"my_library.module1\"\n``` python\n\"\"\"\n.. py:data:: mol\n:type: Unit\n:value: 'mol'\nmole\n\"\"\"\nfrom .module2 import Unit\nmol = Unit('mol')\n```\nThe output I get when building the docs is this.\n```\nmol: Unit = 'mol'\nmole\n```\nand \"Unit\" is not a clickable link.\nHowever if I have the following in the module \"my_library.module1\"\n``` python\n\"\"\"\n.. py:data:: mol\n:type: my_library.module2.Unit\n:value: 'mol'\nmole\n\"\"\"\nfrom .module2 import Unit\nmol = Unit('mol')\n```\nI get this for an output\n```\nmol: my_library.module2.Unit = 'mol'\nmole\n```\nand \"my_library.module2.Unit\" is a clickable link that brings up the documentation for the Unit class\n### Expected behavior\nto be able to do the following\n``` python\n\"\"\"\n.. py:data:: mol\n:type: Unit\n:value: 'mol'\nmole\n\"\"\"\nfrom .module2 import Unit\nmol = Unit('mol')\n```\nand have the output be\n```\nmol: Unit = 'mol'\nmole\n```\nand \"Unit\" be a clickable link that leads to the class that is specified in :type:\n### Your project\nhttps://github.com/kdschlosser/python-utils/tree/unit_conversion\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nWindows\n### Python version\n3.8\n### Sphinx version\n4.2\n### Sphinx extensions\nsphinx.ext.autodoc\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

        "content": "To effectively gather the context necessary for resolving the issue regarding the `.. py:data::` directive and its `:type:` option not correctly linking to the supplied type in Sphinx documentation, we need to look into the implementation of the `Unit` class, its usage within the code base, especially in the context of `.. py:data::` directive usage, and how `Unit` is imported and referenced in the documentation. Here are the necessary API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the `Unit` Class**: To understand how `Unit` is implemented and potentially find clues on how it should be referenced in the Sphinx documentation.\n    - `search_class(\"Unit\")`\n\n2. **Search for Code Snippet Where `Unit` is Imported**: Since the issue describes an import statement `from .module2 import Unit`, it's crucial to locate where such patterns occur to see how `Unit` is typically used within the module that houses the issue.\n    - `search_code(\"from .module2 import Unit\")`\n\n3. **Search for Usage of `.. py:data::` with `Unit`**: By finding how the `.. py:data::` directive is utilized alongside the `Unit` class across the project, we might identify patterns or discrepancies in the directive's usage that could illuminate the cause of the issue.\n    - `search_code(\".. py:data:: mol\\n:type: Unit\")`\n\n4. **Search in Specific Module for Context**: Given the specific problem occurs in \"my_library.module1\", it would help to look into this module directly for any peculiarities or missed configurations that might relate to how Sphinx processes types for links.\n    - `search_code_in_file(\".. py:data::\", \"my_library/module1.py\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to piece together a comprehensive understanding of how the `Unit` class is declared, imported, and referenced within the project, especially in relation to Sphinx documentation and the `.. py:data::` directive. With this information, we can better diagnose the issue and work towards a solution."
