Specifically, for polynomials like the one given in the issue `(x**2 + 1) * (x - 1)**2 * (x - 2)**3 * (x - 3)**3`, where factors have varying multiplicities, the `sqf_list` output must accurately reflect these multiplicities \u2013 each factor should be listed with its correct repetition count. The issue points to a misrepresentation of multiplicities, so the method's logic needs to ensure that factorization calculations are correctly carried out and that the result is formatted according to the expected structure (i.e., including the correct multiplicity for each factor)."

        "intended_behavior": "Although a specific method within `sqfreetools.py` wasn't pinpointed, given its frequent references to `sqf_list`, it is plausible that utility functions within this file play a critical role in determining factor multiplicities or interacting with the `sqf_list` output. The intended behavior here involves ensuring that any utility functions or underlying algorithms that aid in computing square-free factorization accurately determine and convey the multiplicities of polynomial factors. This may include: Checking the methodology for detecting and representing square-free components, evaluating how these components' multiplicities are tracked and incremented during factorization, ensuring compatibility of these mechanisms with the main `sqf_list` method's expectations and data formats."
