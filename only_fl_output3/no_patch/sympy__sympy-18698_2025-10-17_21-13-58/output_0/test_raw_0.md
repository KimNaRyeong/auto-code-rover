Below is the `reproducer.py` Python script that you requested. This script tries to reproduce the inconsistency issue with the `sqf` and `sqf_list` outputs. Make sure you have an appropriate environment where `sympy` is installed, as that's implied to be the library in use for polynomial operations.

```python
from sympy import symbols, sympify
from sympy.polys.agca.extensions import FiniteExtension
import sympy

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    x = symbols('x')
    issue_1_expected = [(x**2 + 1, 1), (x - 1, 2), (x - 2, 3), (x - 3, 3)]
    issue_2_expected = [(x - 2, 1), (x**2 - 1, 2)]

    try:
        # Test case 1
        issue_1_expression = (x**2 + 1) * (x - 1)**2 * (x - 2)**3 * (x - 3)**3
        issue_1_result = sympy.sqf_list(issue_1_expression)
        assert issue_1_result[1] == issue_1_expected, "Issue 1: sqf_list output is not as expected."
        
        # Test case 2
        issue_2_expression = x**5 - 2*x**4 - 2*x**3 + 4*x**2 + x - 2
        issue_2_result = sympy.sqf_list(issue_2_expression)
        assert issue_2_result[1] == issue_2_expected, "Issue 2: sqf_list output is not as expected."
        
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code to indicate failure

    print("All tests passed successfully.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script will check if the outputs from the `sqf_list` function are as expected. If they are not, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print the stack trace showing where the issue occurred. It assumes that the `sympy` library is used for symbolic mathematics in Python, which is a common choice for operations like square-free factorization. 

Ensure that `sympy` is installed in your environment before running the script, which can be done via pip:

```
pip install sympy
```

The script explicitly checks for the described inconsistency and will only show an error if the inconsistency exists, otherwise, it exits with code 0 indicating success if the issue has been fixed.
