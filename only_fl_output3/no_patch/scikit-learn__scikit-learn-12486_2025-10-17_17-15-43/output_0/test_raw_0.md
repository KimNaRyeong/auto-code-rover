Here's a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue as per your instructions. This script relies on the modern import paths (`sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture` instead of `sklearn.mixture.GMM` since `GMM` is deprecated and removed in later versions) and uses `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV` instead of `sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV` as per the latest versions of scikit-learn.

Please note, since the issue described occurs in an older version of scikit-learn running under Python 2.7, this script is updated to reflect the compatibility with Python 3 and the newest scikit-learn API.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
    from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture  # Updated to use GaussianMixture
    from sklearn.exceptions import NotFittedError

    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_features=10, n_classes=2)
    gmm_model = GaussianMixture()  # Updated class name

    param_grid = {'n_components': [1, 2, 3, 4],
                  'covariance_type': ['tied', 'full', 'spherical']}

    grid_search = GridSearchCV(gmm_model, param_grid, scoring='roc_auc')

    try:
        grid_search.fit(X, y)
    except IndexError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("IndexError exception occurred") from e

    print("No IndexError exception occurred; the issue seems to be fixed.")

except AssertionError as e:
    import sys
    sys.exit(1)  # To ensure that the process exits with code other than 0 if the issue is present.
```

This script attempts to reproduce the issue where an `IndexError` is raised due to an incompatibility between `GaussianMixture` (previously `GMM`) and the `roc_auc` scoring method used in `GridSearchCV`. The script will exit with code 1 when the issue is present, and if the issue is fixed, it will complete without raising an `AssertionError`.
