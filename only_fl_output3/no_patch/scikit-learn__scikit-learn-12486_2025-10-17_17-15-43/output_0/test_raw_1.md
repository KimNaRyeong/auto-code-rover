Certainly! Based on the updated request and focusing on correctly reproducing the issue while following the specified format for the `reproducer.py` file, here's a revised edition tailored to capture the specific problem with `GridSearchCV`, `GaussianMixture` (the successor of `GMM` in more recent sklearn versions), and the 'roc_auc' scoring parameter. This script ensures it follows modern Python 3 standards, as well as the latest scikit-learn library conventions.

```
```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
    from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture  # Note GMM is deprecated
    from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer, roc_auc_score

    # Adjust to catch the issue by handcrafting a scorer for binary classification
    def roc_auc_scorer(gmm, X, y):
        from sklearn.exceptions import NotFittedError
        try:
            # GMM does not have a decision_function or predict_proba, catching common error
            if hasattr(gmm, 'predict_proba'):
                probs = gmm.predict_proba(X)[:, 1]
            else:
                raise ValueError("Model does not support predict_proba")
            return roc_auc_score(y, probs)
        except NotFittedError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit("Model not fitted properly.")

    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, n_classes=2)
    gmm_model = GaussianMixture()

    param_grid = {'n_components': [1, 2], 'covariance_type': ['tied', 'full']}
    scorer = make_scorer(roc_auc_scorer, needs_proba=True)

    try:
        grid_search = GridSearchCV(gmm_model, param_grid, scoring=scorer)
        grid_search.fit(X, y)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The designed test caught an issue") from e

    print("The issue appears to be resolved, no AssertionError was raised.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        sys.exit(1)  # Ensure exit with code 1 when AssertionError is caught to indicate test failure
    else:
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 when the script completes successfully indicating issue is fixed
```
```

This updated script includes a custom scorer that wraps around the logic to handle GMM's absence of a conventional `predict_proba` or `decision_function` method which is commonly expected by many scikit-learn scorers. The script exits with a non-zero exit code if an issue is captured, specifically designed to handle the scenario you described, and exits with 0 when everything works as expected (indicative of the issue being resolved).

Remember to adjust the use of `GaussianMixture` and its parameters according to your specific test environment or requirements.
