        "content": "To gather sufficient context from the codebase to address the reported issue, we need to investigate a few key components mentioned in the issue description. The issue primarily revolves around how the `GridSearchCV` class interacts with a custom scorer (in this case, `roc_auc`) and how it handles predictions made by the `GMM` model from `sklearn.mixture`. Given this, we will need to:\n\n1. Investigate how `GridSearchCV` handles the scoring parameter, especially with custom scorers like `roc_auc`.\n2. Understand the implementation of the `GMM` class, particularly how its predictions are formatted since the index error suggests an issue with expected dimensions of the `y_pred` array.\n3. Look into the scorer file, especially around the section where the error occurs, to understand how it processes the `y_pred` from models to compute scores.\n\nTo achieve this, the following API calls will be necessary:\n\n1. Search for the GridSearchCV class to understand the high-level mechanics relevant to this issue:\n    - `search_class(\"GridSearchCV\")`\n\n2. Look into the GMM class implementation to figure out how prediction outputs are structured:\n    - `search_class(\"GMM\")`\n\n3. Since the issue occurs in the scorer file, specifically at a line attempting to index `y_pred`, we need the exact implementation details of this logic. Since the scorer file is likely `scorer.py` based on the traceback, searching for the line of code causing the issue (assuming `y_pred = y_pred[:, 1]` is unique enough within this context) and nearby code will be highly relevant:\n    - `search_code_in_file(\"y_pred = y_pred[:, 1]\", \"scorer.py\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a thorough understanding of the components involved in the issue, setting the stage for a solution to be formulated."
