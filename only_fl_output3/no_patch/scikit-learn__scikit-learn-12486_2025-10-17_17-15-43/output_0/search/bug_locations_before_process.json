        "intended_behavior": "This method should include additional validation or adaptive handling of prediction outputs to accommodate scenarios where a model like GaussianMixture does not return the conventional two-column output for binary classification tasks. Specifically, before indexing y_pred[:, 1], there should be a check to ensure y_pred has the expected shape. If the output does not meet this criterion, the method should either handle this gracefully by adjusting to the available output format or raise a more informative error indicating the scoring compatibility issue with the model's prediction format."

        "method": "__call__",
        "intended_behavior": "Similar to _ProbaScorer, this method must ensure that the y_pred array's dimensionality is correctly checked and handled. If a model's prediction output is not in the expected format (e.g., a single column for binary outcomes), the scorer should either adapt to this format by interpreting the model's output accurately for scoring purposes or provide specific feedback to the user about the incompatibility. This ensures that the scoring process is robust against a wider variety of model output formats and clarifies expectations for model compatibility with specific scoring metrics."
