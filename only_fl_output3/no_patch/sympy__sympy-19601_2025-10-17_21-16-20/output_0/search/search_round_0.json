[We're unfortunately stuck with 1.5.1](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/blob/master/requirements.txt#L3), but the patches we've submitted have already been merged into SymPy master, and we're looking forward to jump to 1.6. Thanks!\n</issue>"

        "content": "The issue mentions a specific version of SymPy (1.6.1) and relates to their dependency on it, as detailed by their requirement file located in the Devito project. The issue creator also references patches that were merged into the SymPy master, indicating changes or fixes they contributed and are now waiting to have included in a new release of SymPy so they can update their project dependencies accordingly. To gather sufficient context for resolving this issue, we should consider the following steps:\n\n1. Investigate the `requirements.txt` file mentioned to understand the exact dependency statement for SymPy 1.5.1.\n2. Identify the patches submitted by the issue creator to the SymPy project, given this might require understanding which commits or pull requests were made by contributors associated with the Devito project to the SymPy repository. However, without specific references to these patches or direct access to repository history through the API, we may not be able to target these directly with the provided API capabilities.\n\nBased on the above information and focusing on the accessible context, we can begin by examining the `requirements.txt` file mentioned to see the exact dependency declaration:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_code_in_file(\"sympy\", \"requirements.txt\")\n```\n\nThis call aims to locate the precise line in the `requirements.txt` file stating the dependency on SymPy 1.5.1. However, the utility of this call may be limited without direct reference to the specific repository's file structure, assuming a generic approach given the available APIs. Further steps could be theorized to check for recent changes or the presence of SymPy-related patches or dependencies in the project codebase, but without direct indicators of file paths, class names, or method names related to the patches mentioned, we cannot execute more targeted API calls."
