To do so, I've needed to switch to `importlib` for the `import-mode` and re-organize the tests to avoid import errors on the tests.\nYet even after working around these issues, the tests are failing when the effect of `core.initialize()` doesn't seem to have had any effect.\nInvestigating deeper, I see that initializer is executed and performs its actions (setting a class variable `pmxbot.logging.Logger.store`), but when that happens, there are two different versions of `pmxbot.logging` present, one in `sys.modules` and another found in `tests.unit.test_commands.logging`:\n```\n=========================================================================== test session starts ===========================================================================\nplatform darwin -- Python 3.11.1, pytest-7.2.0, pluggy-1.0.0\ncachedir: .tox/python/.pytest_cache\nrootdir: /Users/jaraco/code/pmxbot/pmxbot, configfile: pytest.ini\nplugins: black-0.3.12, mypy-0.10.3, jaraco.test-5.3.0, checkdocs-2.9.0, flake8-1.1.1, enabler-2.0.0, jaraco.mongodb-11.2.1, pmxbot-1122.14.3.dev13+g7f189ad\ncollected 421 items / 180 deselected / 241 selected\nrun-last-failure: rerun previous 240 failures (skipped 14 files)\ntests/unit/test_commands.py E\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> traceback >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\ncls = <class 'tests.unit.test_commands.TestCommands'>\n@classmethod\ndef setup_class(cls):\npath = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\nconfigfile = os.path.join(path, 'testconf.yaml')\nconfig = pmxbot.dictlib.ConfigDict.from_yaml(configfile)\ncls.bot = core.initialize(config)\n>       logging.Logger.store.message(\"logged\", \"testrunner\", \"some text\")\nE       AttributeError: type object 'Logger' has no attribute 'store'\ntests/unit/test_commands.py:37: AttributeError\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> entering PDB >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> PDB post_mortem (IO-capturing turned off) >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n> /Users/jaraco/code/pmxbot/pmxbot/tests/unit/test_commands.py(37)setup_class()\n-> logging.Logger.store.message(\"logged\", \"testrunner\", \"some text\")\n(Pdb) logging.Logger\n<class 'pmxbot.logging.Logger'>\n(Pdb) logging\n<module 'pmxbot.logging' from '/Users/jaraco/code/pmxbot/pmxbot/pmxbot/logging.py'>\n(Pdb) import sys\n(Pdb) sys.modules['pmxbot.logging']\n<module 'pmxbot.logging' from '/Users/jaraco/code/pmxbot/pmxbot/pmxbot/logging.py'>\n(Pdb) sys.modules['pmxbot.logging'] is logging\nFalse\n```\nI haven't yet made a minimal reproducer, but I wanted to first capture this condition.\n</issue>"

Search for the `Logger` class within the `pmxbot.logging` module to understand its structure and initialization, particularly looking for the `store` attribute.\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"Logger\", \"pmxbot/logging.py\")`\n\n2.

Hence, looking for `ConfigDict.from_yaml` usage in the test setup could be beneficial.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"ConfigDict.from_yaml\", \"tests/unit/test_commands.py\")`\n\nThese searches will provide insight into the initialization process of the logging system, the setup of the test environment, and how the `Logger` class is supposed to interact with these components, which should help in diagnosing the double import issue."

Additionally, the initial approach presumed the presence and structure of these files without verifying their existence.\n\nGiven these outcomes, a broader strategy is required to understand how the project is structured regarding the logging system and its initialization. Here are further steps I can take to gather necessary information:\n\n1. Widen the search for the `Logger` class and `initialize` method without specifying file names, which will help identify where they are actually defined or if their names differ from what was initially assumed.\n\n2. Expand the search to understand how the project utilizes `importlib` or manages its namespace packages since the issue seems to relate to changes in import mechanics. \n\nAccordingly, I will make the following API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"Logger\")`\n- `search_method(\"initialize\")`\n- `search_code(\"importlib\")`\n\nThese searches aim to uncover where the `Logger` class is defined and how initialization is handled within the project. Additionally, understanding the use of `importlib` could shed light on potential causes for the double import anomaly described in the issue."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).
