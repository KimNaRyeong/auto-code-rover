This class contains methods for basic cache operations such as `get`, `set`, `add`, `delete`, `clear`, among others, which interact with a database to store and retrieve cached data. These operations would likely involve constructing and executing SQL queries against the database backend.\n\n### Relationship between this part and the bug\n\nThe issue at hand pertains to the manner in which fields (or columns) are quoted in the SQL queries constructed within the `DatabaseCache` backend. Given that Snowflake requires all fields to be quoted to interpret them correctly (especially respecting case sensitivity), any method within this class that constructs SQL queries without properly quoting fields is directly related to the bug.\n\n### Intended behavior in light of the issue\n\nGiven the issue's description, the intended behavior would be for all methods that construct SQL queries to ensure that field names are correctly quoted to accommodate databases that necessitate this, such as Snowflake. This means looking into methods responsible for SQL query construction (`set`, `get`, `delete`, etc.) and ensuring they adapt their output to meet Snowflake's requirements.\n\nTo further dissect how the `DatabaseCache` interacts with the database and constructs queries, we should focus on the methods responsible for the direct interaction with the database, such as:\n\n- `_base_set` for setting cache entries, since it likely constructs INSERT or UPDATE queries.\n- `delete` and `delete_many`, which would involve DELETE queries.\n- Possibly the constructor or any initialization methods to see how database connections are established and if any SQL dialect specifics are set there.\n\nFor the next steps, diving into the query construction and execution mechanisms within these methods is crucial. This can help identify exactly where and how the field quoting should be incorporated or fixed. Let's look at `_base_set` and any of its SQL query construction logic to ascertain how fields are currently handled:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_method_in_class(\"_base_set\", \"DatabaseCache\")\n```\n\nAdditionally, examining methods like `get` or `set` could shed light on any custom SQL being used that needs adjustment:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_method_in_class(\"set\", \"DatabaseCache\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"get\", \"DatabaseCache\")\n```\n\nThese calls will help understand the current implementation of SQL queries within the class and how it might be altered to ensure compliance with Snowflake's requirements for field quoting."

This means adapting the SQL construction logic within this method to automatically quote field names, ideally in a manner that's agnostic to the specific database backend being used, preserving existing functionality for other supported database systems while accommodating Snowflake.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/core/cache/backends/db.py`\n  - **Class:** `DatabaseCache`\n  - **Method:** `set`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** While the `set` method likely utilizes the `_base_set` for its operations, ensuring the entire call path respects field quoting for Snowflake is critical. If `set` constructs or manipulates SQL or parameters directly, it should be reviewed to ensure all identifiers are correctly quoted. This safeguard ensures the method remains functional across all database backends, including those requiring quoted identifiers.\n\n- **Location 3:**\n  - **File:** `django/core/cache/backends/db.py`\n  - **Class:** `DatabaseCache`\n  - **Method:** `get`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The `get` method retrieves entries from the database cache and must ensure any SQL used for querying the data quotes field names appropriately. This will likely involve adjusting how the method constructs its queries to ensure compatibility with Snowflake, again ensuring the logic is universally applicable to all backend databases, particularly those requiring field quoting, without disturbing the method's overall functionality."
