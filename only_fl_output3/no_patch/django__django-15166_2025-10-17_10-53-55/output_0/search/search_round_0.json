        "content": "To adequately address the issue described, we need to gather specific context about how the fields are currently being handled in queries within the Django project, specifically focusing on the `DatabaseCache` backend and how it interfaces with databases, considering the unique requirements of Snowflake for field quoting. The steps will likely involve identifying the relevant parts of the code where fields are generated or manipulated for database queries and ensuring that they're appropriately quoted as per Snowflake's requirements.\n\nThus, we need to:\n\n1. Locate the `DatabaseCache` class to understand its structure and the methods it uses to interact with the database.\n2. Identify critical methods where queries are constructed or executed, looking specifically for spots where fields might not be quoted.\n3. Examine any relevant patches provided or mentioned for context about the proposed fixes.\n\nBased on this, I would start with the following API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the `DatabaseCache` class to find its definition and implementations.\n2. Once the file containing `DatabaseCache` is located, search within that file for methods that likely involve query construction or execution.\n3. Furthermore, understanding the interaction with Snowflake might require looking into how the backend constructs SQL queries and whether there's a mechanism in place to ensure compatibility with databases that have specific casing or quoting requirements.\n\nLet's execute the initial search to locate the `DatabaseCache`:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class(\"DatabaseCache\")\n```"
