        "intended_behavior": "The `is_ajax` method should be deprecated. In place of removing it immediately, Django's usual deprecation path involves adding a warning that this method will be removed in a future release. This warning should inform users that they should not rely on `is_ajax` for detecting AJAX requests due to its dependence on a non-standard, framework-specific HTTP header (`X-Requested-With`). Instead, the warning can guide users towards examining the `Accept` header directly or using other more reliable mechanisms to determine the request's nature. The method continues to return `self.META.get('HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH') == 'XMLHttpRequest'` for the deprecation period to preserve functionality for legacy systems relying on it until removed."
