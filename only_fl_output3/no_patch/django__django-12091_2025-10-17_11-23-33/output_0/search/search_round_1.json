However jQuery's popularity, especially for making requests, is decreasing thanks to changes such as the new fetch() JS API.\nAlso in the cases this property is used to determine the kind of content to send to a client, it'd be better to inspect the HTTP standard Accept header.\nFor these reasons Flask has deprecated its similar property is_xhr.\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### `HttpRequest` class and `is_ajax` method\n- **Location and Definition**: The `HttpRequest` class is located in `django/http/request.py`. The `is_ajax` method within this class checks if the `HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH` header equals `'XMLHttpRequest'`.\n- **Current Behavior**: `is_ajax()` method simply determines if a request is an AJAX request by inspecting the `X-Requested-With` header for the `XMLHttpRequest` value.\n- **Relationship to Issue**: The issue describes the need to deprecate `is_ajax` because it's based on a non-standard header largely used by jQuery, which is becoming less relevant with modern JavaScript APIs like `fetch()`. The method's current behavior directly relates to the described problem.\n- **Intended Behavior Post-Deprecation**: The issue suggests that, instead of relying on a non-standard header, examining the HTTP standard `Accept` header could be a more robust solution. This hints that future development might require utilities or patterns to identify AJAX requests through possibly more standard means, or at least be explicit about the expected content type without assuming an AJAX request based on jQuery conventions.\n\n#### Searching for `X-Requested-With`\n- **Result**: The search did not find any code snippets containing `X-Requested-With`, which is surprising given its mention in relation to `is_ajax`.\n- **Analysis**: It's likely that direct references to `X-Requested-With` might be minimal or encapsulated within utilities like `is_ajax`. This could imply either a low direct dependency on this header in the Django codebase outside of `is_ajax` or limitations in the search scope.\n\n#### Usage of `Accept` Header in the Codebase\n- **Locations**: The `Accept` header is referenced in multiple files (`gzip.py`, `locale.py`, `request.py`, etc.), which indicates its use across different middleware and utilities within Django.\n- **Possible Relationship**: Although `Accept` is used in various contexts for content negotiation and localization, its mention in the context of this issue suggests that examining how Django already utilizes `Accept` could offer insights into enhancing or replacing `is_ajax` functionality in a more standards-compliant manner.\n- **Intended Behavior**: Given the issue's guidance, Django's current treatment of the `Accept` header in different contexts could potentially serve as a model or foundation for whatever replaces `is_ajax`. The exact mechanism isn't detailed in the issue, but it implies a shift towards a more standardized way of handling requests that can serve AJAX and non-AJAX content flexibly.\n\n### Additional Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven the context gathered, the next steps in deprecating `is_ajax` would involve drafting a deprecation path that warns users of its impending removal, offering guidance on alternative approaches (potentially involving `Accept` header inspection), and modifying the documentation accordingly. However, it's also important to consider:\n\n1. **Further Exploration for `X-Requested-With` Usage**: Given the unexpected zero results, it might be beneficial to double-check or explore other ways it might be referenced or used, perhaps indirectly or documented in Django's guides rather than the codebase directly.\n2. **Study Existing `Accept` Header Handling**: More detailed examination of how `Accept` header is currently utilized within Django could inspire how to suggest users migrate away from `is_ajax`. This could include enhancing existing utilities or introducing new patterns for request inspection that align with HTTP standards.\n\nBy addressing these aspects, the approach towards the deprecation can be comprehensive, providing a clear path for developers to adapt to the change without breaking existing functionalities."

In place of removing it immediately, Django's usual deprecation path involves adding a warning that this method will be removed in a future release. This warning should inform users that they should not rely on `is_ajax` for detecting AJAX requests due to its dependence on a non-standard, framework-specific HTTP header (`X-Requested-With`). Instead, the warning can guide users towards examining the `Accept` header directly or using other more reliable mechanisms to determine the request's nature. The method continues to return `self.META.get('HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH') == 'XMLHttpRequest'` for the deprecation period to preserve functionality for legacy systems relying on it until removed."
