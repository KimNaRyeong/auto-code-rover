However jQuery's popularity, especially for making requests, is decreasing thanks to changes such as the new fetch() JS API.\nAlso in the cases this property is used to determine the kind of content to send to a client, it'd be better to inspect the HTTP standard Accept header.\nFor these reasons Flask has deprecated its similar property is_xhr.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue, we need to gather context about where and how the `HttpRequest.is_ajax` method is used and implemented within the Django codebase. Let's proceed with the following API calls to gather the required information:\n\n1. Search for the `HttpRequest` class to understand its structure and to confirm the file it's defined in, because we'll need to locate the `is_ajax` method within it.\n   - `search_class(\"HttpRequest\")`\n\n2. Once we have the file name where the `HttpRequest` class is located, we'll need to search for the `is_ajax` method within that class to understand its current implementation and how it can be deprecated.\n   - Since we don't have the file name yet, a placeholder call would be: `search_method_in_class(\"is_ajax\", \"HttpRequest\")`\n\n3. Additionally, because the issue description mentions the `X-Requested-With` header and the discussion around it, searching for this string in the codebase could provide insights into direct and indirect usages of `is_ajax`.\n   - `search_code(\"X-Requested-With\")`\n\n4. The issue also discusses a possible alternative practice involving inspecting the `Accept` header. To assess the feasibility and current usage of this alternative within the codebase, searching for `Accept` header occurrences might be beneficial.\n   - `search_code(\"Accept\")`\n\nThese API calls are aimed to gather comprehensive context on `HttpRequest.is_ajax`'s current implementation, usages, and potential refactoring strategy towards using HTTP standard headers like `Accept`."
