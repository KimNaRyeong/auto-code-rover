Given the clarified request, let's revise the Python script to accurately reproduce the issue as described, following the guidelines provided. We'll ensure the script raises an `AssertionError` if the problematic behavior is encountered (i.e., when `convert_to` does not behave as expected with units conversion), and also utilize the provided function to print the stack trace for precise error reporting. 

```python
from sympy import symbols
from sympy.physics.units import convert_to, joule, s, kg, m

# Function to print stack trace for exceptions
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # The issue as described involves an incorrect result when using convert_to
        # Let's reproduce the specific case mentioned:
        J = joule  # Joules
        expected_result = J*s  # Expected Joule * second
        
        # Attempt the conversion that is suspected to be incorrect
        result = convert_to(J*s, J)
        
        # Check if the result matches the incorrect output as per the issue description
        # The assertion is adjusted to ensure it triggers when the issue is reproduced
        assert result != J**(7/9), "Conversion did not produce the expected error."

        # Alternatively, if expecting the issue to be fixed in this context, 
        # you could assert the correct behavior instead; for example:
        # assert result == expected_result, "Conversion did not produce the expected result."
        
        print("The issue was not reproduced; the conversion produced the correct or unexpected result.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script directly targets the peculiarity highlighted in the issue description by attempting the conversion `convert_to(J*s, J)` and assessing whether the outcome is as unexpected as reported (`J**(7/9)`). If so, it indicates the problem persists and the assertion will trigger printing the stack trace. Otherwise, if the issue is no longer present (i.e., because the script exits with code 0), it means the conversion behaves correctly, or at least not in the erroneous way initially reported.
