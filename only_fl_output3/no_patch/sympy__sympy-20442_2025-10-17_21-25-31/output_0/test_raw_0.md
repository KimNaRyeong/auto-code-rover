Below is the code for `reproducer.py`, structured to trigger an `AssertionError` when the described issue arises and to exit normally otherwise. Additionally, this script will print a detailed stack trace should the assertion fail, aiding in diagnosing and understanding the encountered issue.

```python
from sympy import symbols, convert_to
from sympy.physics.units import joule, second, kg, m, s

# Function to print stack trace for exceptions
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_issue():
    # Defining units and expressions
    J = kg*m**2/s**2
    J_s = J * second
    
    # Test cases based on the issue description
    try:
        assert convert_to(joule*second, joule) == joule*second, "Unexpected conversion outcome for joule*second -> joule."
        # Additional verification to strengthen the test suite
        assert convert_to(J_s, kg*m**2/s) == kg*m**2/s, "Conversion does not match expected base units."
        assert convert_to(J_s, joule*second) == joule*second, "Conversion does not retain the original expression appropriately."
        
        # If no assertion is raised, the issue is presumed fixed
        print("Issue is presumed fixed. All tests passed successfully.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_issue()
    except Exception as e:
        exit(1)
```

This script aims to capture the specific problem related to the `convert_to` function where it unexpectedly converts compound units in a manner that is not straightforward or expected, as in converting joules per second to an unexpected power of joules. It verifies correct behavior with alternative, sensible conversions and raises errors if the issues depicted occur, providing valuable debugging information through a detailed stack trace.
