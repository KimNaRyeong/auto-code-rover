To appropriately address the previous oversight, let's write a corrected version of `reproducer.py` that properly imports the necessary elements from SymPy's units and quantities management to test the conversion behavior described in the issue. Given the ImportError previously noted, it seems there was a mistake in the import statement. The correct approach involves using SymPy's physics.units module to access unit conversion functions.

```python
from sympy.physics.units import convert_to, joule, s, kg, m
from sympy.physics.units.quantities import Quantity

# Function to print stack trace for exceptions
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Define custom units and quantities if needed
    J = joule
    J_s = J*s  # Joule second

    try:
        # Perform the unit conversion that's causing the issue
        result = convert_to(J_s, J)
        # Assert the unexpected outcome as described. Expecting J*s not to change to joule**(7/9)
        assert result != J**(7/9), "The unit conversion resulted in an unexpected outcome."

        # Assertions to check for expected logical outcomes based on the issue description
        assert convert_to(J_s, J*s) == J*s, "Conversion of J*s to J*s did not match."
        assert convert_to(J_s, kg*m**2/s) == kg*m**2/s, "Conversion of J*s to kg*m**2/s did not match."

        print("No issue found with unit conversion. All tests passed successfully.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script ensures the correct use of SymPy's unit conversion capabilities and addresses the specific problem of an unexpected conversion result. It should now appropriately raise an `AssertionError` if the issue persists or pass silently if the behavior has been corrected. Note that it directly tests the erroneous conversion and contrasts it with logically expected outcomes for clarity and thoroughness.
