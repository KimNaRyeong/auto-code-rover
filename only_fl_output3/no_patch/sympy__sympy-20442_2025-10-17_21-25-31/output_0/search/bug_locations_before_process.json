        "intended_behavior": "The `convert_to` method should accurately handle conversions between units, even when dealing with complex or composite units like `joule*second`. It should either allow for direct conversion where applicable, fall back to base units if the conversion between composite units doesn't directly map to the target, or raise an informative error when the conversion cannot logically proceed. To resolve the issue, the method's logic should be extended or adjusted to specifically account for cases where the target unit and the unit expression involve orthogonal dimensions or non-directly convertible units. This enhancement should not alter the method's ability to perform more straightforward conversions."

        "intended_behavior": "If `convert_to` functionally appears within this context, it is essential to ensure consistency with the intended enhancements or fixes applied in `util.py`. Specifically, if there's significant logic duplication or if this method interacts closely with the unit conversion process, it should be reviewed to ensure it supports the same sensible handling of complex unit expressions. The method should cooperate with any updated logic in `util.py` to facilitate accurate and expected unit conversions, preserving the functionality for simpler conversions while accurately handling more complex scenarios described in the issue."
