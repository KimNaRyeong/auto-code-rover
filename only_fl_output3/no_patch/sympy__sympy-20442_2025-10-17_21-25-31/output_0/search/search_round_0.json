Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\n```\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\njoule**(7/9)\n```\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\n```\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\njoule*second\n```\n```\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\nkg*m**2/s\n```\n```\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\nJ*mins/60\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to investigate how the `convert_to` function is implemented and how it interprets and converts units, especially in complex cases like the one reported. Let's start by gathering information about where and how this function is defined and used within the project. The mentioned behavior suggests that there might be specific logic in `convert_to` that deals with unit conversions differently based on certain conditions or inputs.\n\n1. Search for the `convert_to` function to understand its implementation details and potential limitations or bugs in its logic that could lead to the described behavior.\n   \n2. Since the issue also involves specific units (`joule`, `second`, `kg`, `m`, `s`, and `mins`), it would be useful to explore how these units are defined or handled in the codebase. This can provide insights into how `convert_to` interacts with these units and if the issue stems from the units' definitions or from the conversion logic itself.\n\nTherefore, the necessary API calls are:\n- search_method(\"convert_to\")\n- search_code(\"joule\")\n- search_code(\"second\")\n- search_code(\"kg\")\n- search_code(\"m\")\n- search_code(\"s\")\n- search_code(\"mins\")"
