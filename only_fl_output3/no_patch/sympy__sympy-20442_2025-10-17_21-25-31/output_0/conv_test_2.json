Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)\r\n    joule**(7/9)\r\n```\r\nI would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.\r\n\r\nNote that the following three related examples give sensible results:\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)\r\n    joule*second\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)\r\n    kg*m**2/s\r\n```\r\n```\r\n>>>convert_to(J*s,mins)\r\n    J*mins/60\r\n```\n"

        "content": "To appropriately address the previous oversight, let's write a corrected version of `reproducer.py` that properly imports the necessary elements from SymPy's units and quantities management to test the conversion behavior described in the issue. Given the ImportError previously noted, it seems there was a mistake in the import statement. The correct approach involves using SymPy's physics.units module to access unit conversion functions.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.physics.units import convert_to, joule, s, kg, m\nfrom sympy.physics.units.quantities import Quantity\n\n# Function to print stack trace for exceptions\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef main():\n    # Define custom units and quantities if needed\n    J = joule\n    J_s = J*s  # Joule second\n\n    try:\n        # Perform the unit conversion that's causing the issue\n        result = convert_to(J_s, J)\n        # Assert the unexpected outcome as described. Expecting J*s not to change to joule**(7/9)\n        assert result != J**(7/9), \"The unit conversion resulted in an unexpected outcome.\"\n\n        # Assertions to check for expected logical outcomes based on the issue description\n        assert convert_to(J_s, J*s) == J*s, \"Conversion of J*s to J*s did not match.\"\n        assert convert_to(J_s, kg*m**2/s) == kg*m**2/s, \"Conversion of J*s to kg*m**2/s did not match.\"\n\n        print(\"No issue found with unit conversion. All tests passed successfully.\")\n\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nThis script ensures the correct use of SymPy's unit conversion capabilities and addresses the specific problem of an unexpected conversion result. It should now appropriately raise an `AssertionError` if the issue persists or pass silently if the behavior has been corrected. Note that it directly tests the erroneous conversion and contrasts it with logically expected outcomes for clarity and thoroughness."
