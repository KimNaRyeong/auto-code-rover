This suggests a need to broaden our search parameters to find relevant sections of the code that could be involved in the issue.\n\nTo progress, let's consider alternative angles:\n\n1. **Index Generation and Handling**: The issue lies in how the index is generated and how entries, especially those starting with symbols, are categorized. We need to look more generally for how the index is created or manipulated.\n\n2. **HTML Anchor Tags and Navigation**: The duplication of the \"Symbols\" section and its anchoring might be managed by a more general section of the code responsible for creating HTML elements or navigating within the HTML output.\n\n3. **Symbol Handling in the Codebase**: Given that specific symbols weren't found, it might be that symbols are handled through a more general mechanism or encoded/represented differently in the code.\n\nConsidering these alternate angles, let's perform a new set of API calls:\n\n1. **Broaden search for index generation or manipulation**:  \n   - `search_method(\"createIndex\")`\n   - `search_method(\"generateIndex\")`\n\n2. **Look for methods that handle HTML output or anchors beyond specifically named methods**:  \n   - `search_method(\"createHtml\")`\n   - `search_method(\"generateAnchor\")`\n\n3. **Try to find how symbols or special characters are generally processed in the project**:  \n   - `search_code(\"special character processing\")`\n   - `search_code(\"symbol handling\")`\n\nThese broader search queries aim to uncover related code that could be impacting the issue with symbol entries in the index, especially focusing on mechanisms of index creation, HTML output generation, and symbol/special character handling."
