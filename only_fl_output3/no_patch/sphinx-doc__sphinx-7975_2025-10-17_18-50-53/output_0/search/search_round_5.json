It appears we may still need more context but have reached the limit of what can be obtained through the provided API calls with the given arguments.\n\n### Revised Strategy\nGiven the limitations expressed and the necessity for a more guided inquiry without further specific API call results to analyze:\n\n1. **Manual Inspection**: As recommended, a manual inspection of the project structure focusing on documentation generation, HTML templates, or any utilities related to sorting or categorizing entries might be necessary.\n\n2. **Consultation with Team Members**: Engaging with the development team or contributors who have worked on the documentation generation or the HTML rendering parts of the project could provide insights.\n\n3. **Diving into Documentation**: Often, projects include developer notes or documentation that might outline how certain features are implemented or should be approached, which could shine a light on this issue.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWithout specific API calls yielding actionable results, we are back to the drawing board with the understanding that to move forward effectively, leveraging human insights and manual exploration of the project is essential at this juncture. This underscores the value of clear documentation within the project and thorough communication within the development team to address such issues.\n\nI acknowledge the need for more contextual understanding but am presently unable to construct further API calls that would directly address this need given the framework of our interaction.
