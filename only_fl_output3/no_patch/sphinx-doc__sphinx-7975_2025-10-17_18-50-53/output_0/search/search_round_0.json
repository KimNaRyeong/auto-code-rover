Specifically, I need to look into how leading characters like _@_, _\u00a3_, and _\u2190_ are handled and why they might cause entries to be split into two separate _Symbols_ sections.\n\nTherefore, I would perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. **Search for a method or class that handles the generation of the HTML output for index entries.** This might involve methods that specifically handle parsing or categorizing index entries, especially symbols.\n   - `search_method(\"generateHtmlOutput\")`\n   - `search_method(\"parseIndexEntries\")`\n\n2. **Search for code snippets that deal with character handling for index entries, especially the mentioned symbols _@_, _\u00a3_, and _\u2190_.** This could help identify how these symbols are treated differently from other characters or symbols.\n   - `search_code(\"_@_\")`\n   - `search_code(\"_\u00a3_\")`\n   - `search_code(\"_\u2190_\")`\n\n3. **Since the issue mentions problems with anchor links for the _Symbols_ sections, it's relevant to look for how these sections are named or anchored in the HTML.**\n   - `search_code(\"Symbols section anchor\")`\n\nThese searches are targeted to gather context about how index entries are parsed and categorized into sections, particularly symbol entries, and how the HTML output, including section anchors, is generated and structured."
