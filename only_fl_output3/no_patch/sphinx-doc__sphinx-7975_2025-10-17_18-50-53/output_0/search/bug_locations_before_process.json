If the logic for identifying or categorizing symbols is spread out or inconsistently applied, it should be unified or corrected to consistently recognize symbol-led entries as such, irrespective of the specific symbols used. This correction will ensure all symbol-leading entries are sorted into one 'Symbols' section, addressing the current splitting issue."

The intended behavior here would include updating the logic to generate unique and correctly functioning HTML anchors for sections, particularly for the 'Symbols' section to prevent any navigation issues caused by duplicate anchors. This might involve ensuring that the anchors are dynamically generated in a manner that accounts for multiple sections with similar titles but differentiates them in the context of their content or position within the documentation."
