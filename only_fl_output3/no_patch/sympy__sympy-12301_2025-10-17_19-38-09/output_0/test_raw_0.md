Below is a Python script `reproducer.py` that attempts to reproduce the specified issue. This script is meant to be executed in the root directory of the SymPy project. It dynamically injects the necessary environment variable, runs the specified test, and catches any `AssertionError` to print a detailed stack trace. It aims to maintain compatibility with Python 3.5 and later versions.

```python
import os
import sys

# Function to print the stack trace of an exception
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Setting the required environment variable
    os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = '736538842'

    try:
        # Attempt to reproduce the specified issue
        import sympy

        # Dynamically import the module and function to perform the test
        test_module_name = "sympy.simplify.tests.test_cse"
        test_function_name = "test_issue_11230"
        test_module = __import__(test_module_name, fromlist=[test_function_name])
        test_function = getattr(test_module, test_function_name)

        # Running the test function to reproduce the issue
        test_function()

        print("Test passed, issue not reproduced.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exiting with non-zero status to indicate the failure
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        sys.exit(2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script sets up the environment variable as specified, runs the test contained within the SymPy library that is related to the issue, and handles exceptions appropriately:

- It catches `AssertionError` to print a detailed stack trace, aiding in diagnosing the issue.
- It exits with a non-zero status code (1) when the issue is reproduced, following the request.
- If any other exception occurs, it prints a generic error message and exits with status code 2 to indicate an unexpected error.

Place this script in the root directory of the SymPy project and run it using Python 3. Make sure you have the correct environment activated (as specified in the reproduction steps) before running the script.
