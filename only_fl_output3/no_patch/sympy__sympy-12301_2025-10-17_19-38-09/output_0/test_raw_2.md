To achieve the desired functionality of reproducing the issue within a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py`, and considering the specifics of the previously described error within the `sympy` module tests, the content of the script must be aimed at invoking the failing test directly or an equivalent scenario that triggers the same `AssertionError`. Let's incorporate your provided function to handle the error reporting with clarity:

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import traceback
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = '736538842'

    # Adjusted import statement to import sympy at runtime
    import sympy
    # Accessing the test function may require adjustment depending on how sympy organizes its tests
    from sympy.simplify.tests.test_cse import test_issue_11230

    try:
        test_issue_11230()
        print("The test passed. The issue seems to have been resolved.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("The test failed with an AssertionError as expected. Printing stack trace:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred. Printing stack trace:")
        print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Place this script in the root of your project directory, ensure you have the correct `sympy` version that includes the `test_issue_11230` function, and execute it with Python 3:

```bash
python3 reproducer.py
```

The script sets the `PYTHONHASHSEED` as described, imports needed modules, and directly calls `test_issue_11230` from the `sympy.simplify.tests.test_cse` module, attempting to exactly replicate the environment under which the failure occurs.

If the specific test function `test_issue_11230` passes (indicating the issue might have been resolved or does not occur under this direct test scenario), the script will output a success message. If the exception is caught as an `AssertionError`, it means the issue was reproduced, and the script will print the stack trace for debugging purposes. Any other exceptions encountered will also be caught and their stack traces printed, assuming these might be related or offer insights into resolving the test failure.
