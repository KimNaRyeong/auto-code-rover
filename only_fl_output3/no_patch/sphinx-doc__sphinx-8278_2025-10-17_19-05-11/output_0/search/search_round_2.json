The same for example goes for e.g. specifying access rights for files (`chmod`)\n**Screenshots**\n![Screenshot 2020-09-30 at 14 32 21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55204/94685496-c777ed00-0329-11eb-9ce1-d6f452d790ad.png)\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Mac OS X 10.14.6\n- Python version: 3.8.5\n- Sphinx version: 3.2.1\n- Sphinx extensions:  None\n- Extra tools: None\n</issue>"

Thus, we can infer that methods responsible for parsing and rendering documentation from docstrings, especially related to function signatures, would be crucial to investigate.\n\nHere are the API calls that would be beneficial based on the provided information:\n\n1.

Given that Sphinx extensions can also affect the rendering process, and the bug could be related to how extensions parse or modify function signatures, searching for any Sphinx extension APIs or methods that relate to function signature manipulation can also be helpful. However, since the issue doesn't mention a specific extension causing the problem, a broader search in the base Sphinx system is more pertinent here.\n\n4. Lastly, specific to the Sphinx version mentioned (3.2.1), it might be valuable to search for any known issues or patches related to this problem in the latest Sphinx documentation or the issue tracker. However, this action falls outside the direct use of the provided search APIs.\n\nBy starting with these API calls, we can get a closer look at the relevant portions of the Sphinx codebase to understand where the issue may originate and decide on further investigations or patches needed."

Since I could not execute the refined API calls due to the constraints of this scenario, pinpointing the exact bug locations and providing the intended behavior to resolve the issue might not be feasible without additional context or search results. However, based on the nature of the issue and typical Sphinx documentation generation workflow, we can hypothesize potential locations and describe the intended behavior abstractly:\n\n**Hypothetical Bug Location 1:**\n- **File:** Likely in a file related to docstring parsing or directive processing for functions and methods.\n- **Class:** A class responsible for parsing docstrings or reStructuredText directives, particularly those handling function or method directives.\n- **Method:** A method that handles parsing and extracting default values from function signatures within docstrings.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\nThis method or function should be able to recognize and preserve the format (hexadecimal, decimal, etc.) of default values specified in function signatures within docstrings. When encountering numeric default values, the parsing logic should detect if the value is expressed in a format other than decimal (e.g., prefixed with `0x` for hexadecimal) and preserve this formatting when generating documentation output. This would require either adjusting the current parsing logic to include format preservation as part of the default value extraction process or implementing a new logic path that ensures format awareness during documentation generation.\n\n**Hypothetical Bug Location 2:**\n- **File:** Could be in a file responsible for the rendering of parsed docstrings into HTML.\n- **Class:** A class that translates the internal representation of docstrings and their components, including function signatures with default values, into HTML documentation.\n- **Method:** A method directly involved in rendering the HTML representation of function signatures, particularly focusing on how default values are displayed.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\nIn this location, it's essential that the method responsible for rendering the HTML documentation recognizes and respects the original numerical formatting of default values as specified in the source docstrings. If a numerical default value is intended to be displayed in hexadecimal format, the rendering logic should ensure that this formatting is not altered to decimal or any other format. This may involve extending the rendering logic to check for numerical formatting metadata attached to default values during the parsing stage and applying this formatting in the final HTML output.\n\n**Note:** These are hypothetical analyses based on common points in documentation generation systems like Sphinx where such an issue could manifest. Actual bug locations and intended behaviors would require a detailed examination of Sphinx's source code and possibly debugging to identify the exact points of intervention."

Further search API calls are needed to gather concrete code insights.\n\n1. **Search for Docstring Processing Mechanism in Sphinx**\n   Since the problem involves how default values defined in hexadecimal are being rendered in documentation, focusing on the components of Sphinx that parse and process docstrings might help uncover the related code.\n   - `search_method(\"parse_docstrings\")`\n   - `search_code(\"docstring processing\")`\n\n2. **Investigate Sphinx's Code Rendering Pathway**\n   Identifying the code responsible for rendering or formatting output for documentation can provide insight into where the numerical conversion might be happening. This involves looking into methods that handle the final stages of documentation rendering.\n   - `search_method(\"format_docstring\")`\n   - `search_code(\"render output\")`\n\n3. **Exploring Configuration Related to Number Formatting**\n   Sphinx might have configuration options or internal rules that dictate how numbers are formatted in the documentation. Understanding how these configurations are applied could lead to finding the code section responsible for the issue.\n   - `search_code(\"number formatting\")`\n\n4. **Digging into Sphinx Extensions or Plugins Code**\n   If the base functionality of Sphinx doesn\u2019t directly reveal the cause, extensions or plugins might affect number formatting. Although the issue doesn't mention specific extensions, investigating the default behavior and overrides provided by Sphinx extensions could be beneficial.\n   - `search_code(\"extensions number format\")`\n\nWith the results from these refined searches, we aim to locate the specific file(s), class(es), and method(s) where the numerical format conversion issue originates.
