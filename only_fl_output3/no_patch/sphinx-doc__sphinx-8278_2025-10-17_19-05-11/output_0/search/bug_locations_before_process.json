        "intended_behavior": "The code within `docstrings.py` responsible for parsing default values from docstrings should be modified to preserve the numeral system (e.g., hexadecimal) as it is specified in the docstring. This means adding or refining a mechanism to detect when a default value is written in hexadecimal format (or potentially other formats) and ensuring this formatting is retained in the documentation output. Specifically, this could involve enhancing the parsing utility to tag numeric values with their detected format during the parsing phase and then using this format tag during the rendering phase to maintain format consistency in the generated documentation. This change aims not to alter the existing functionality that correctly processes and displays default values in the documentation, but to extend it to handle numeric formats more accurately. This extension should be made in a way that does not disrupt other parts of Sphinx that rely on `docstrings.py` for docstring handling, ensuring backward compatibility and preserving current functionalities outside of numeric value presentation."
