The same for example goes for e.g. specifying access rights for files (`chmod`)\n**Screenshots**\n![Screenshot 2020-09-30 at 14 32 21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55204/94685496-c777ed00-0329-11eb-9ce1-d6f452d790ad.png)\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Mac OS X 10.14.6\n- Python version: 3.8.5\n- Sphinx version: 3.2.1\n- Sphinx extensions:  None\n- Extra tools: None\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue of Sphinx changing the number system from hexadecimal to decimal for function default arguments in the documentation, we need to gather sufficient context around how Sphinx processes function documentation, especially focusing on how it handles default argument values and transforms them into the documentation output.\n\nGiven the nature of the bug and the information provided, the most relevant areas to investigate would likely be within the Sphinx codebase where function documentation is generated or where default values for arguments are processed and converted into the output format for documentation. Thus, we can infer that methods responsible for parsing and rendering documentation from docstrings, especially related to function signatures, would be crucial to investigate.\n\nHere are the API calls that would be beneficial based on the provided information:\n\n1. Search for the method or function in Sphinx's codebase responsible for rendering function signatures in the documentation. This would likely involve finding the part of the code that is tasked with parsing the function definition and its default values.\n   \n   `search_method(\"render_function_signature\")`\n\n2. Since the issue specifically mentions the transformation of hexadecimal default values to decimal in the output, we should also look for code that handles or manipulates default argument values during the documentation rendering process.\n\n   `search_code(\"default argument values\")`\n\n3. Given that Sphinx extensions can also affect the rendering process, and the bug could be related to how extensions parse or modify function signatures, searching for any Sphinx extension APIs or methods that relate to function signature manipulation can also be helpful. However, since the issue doesn't mention a specific extension causing the problem, a broader search in the base Sphinx system is more pertinent here.\n\n4. Lastly, specific to the Sphinx version mentioned (3.2.1), it might be valuable to search for any known issues or patches related to this problem in the latest Sphinx documentation or the issue tracker. However, this action falls outside the direct use of the provided search APIs.\n\nBy starting with these API calls, we can get a closer look at the relevant portions of the Sphinx codebase to understand where the issue may originate and decide on further investigations or patches needed."
