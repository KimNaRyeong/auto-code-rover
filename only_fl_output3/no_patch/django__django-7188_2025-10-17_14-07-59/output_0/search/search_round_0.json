        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather context on how `django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware` and `django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth` are implemented and used within Django projects. Additionally, understanding how other parts of the auth system interact with `INSTALLED_APPS` is crucial.\n\nHere are the API calls I would make to gather the required context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"AuthenticationMiddleware\")` - This will help find the file and class definition for `AuthenticationMiddleware`, which is part of the authentication middleware mentioned in the issue.\n\n2. `search_class(\"auth\")` - Since \"auth\" is likely not a class but rather a module or a context processor, this is a heuristic search to identify relevant files or classes related to the context processor mentioned.\n\n3. `search_code(\"INSTALLED_APPS\")` - This will help find snippets where `INSTALLED_APPS` is checked or modified, which could lead us to the mechanism that enables or disables the use of the auth system.\n\n4. `search_method(\"middleware\")` - Middleware in Django can often be closely tied to app configurations, and searching for this can help identify customization or extension points within the authentication system.\n\n5. `search_method(\"context_processors\")` - Similar rationale as above, aiming to find how context processors are tied to the `INSTALLED_APPS` or how they operate independently of the app being installed."
