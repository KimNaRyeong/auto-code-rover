        "intended_behavior": "The `AuthenticationMiddleware` should be refactored or augmented with a mechanism that allows it to function independently of the `django.contrib.auth` app being listed in `INSTALLED_APPS`. This could involve implementing conditional checks or fallbacks that enable key authentication features (like attaching the user to the request) without relying on the full app being installed. Importantly, this change must preserve the existing functionality for projects that do include `django.contrib.auth` in `INSTALLED_APPS`."
