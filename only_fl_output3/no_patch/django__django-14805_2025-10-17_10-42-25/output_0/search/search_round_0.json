It would be nice for scripting purposes if there could be some kind of output. When writing a script that helps manage migrations, it would be nice to be able to detect that the migrations needed input from the developer so that the script can fail gracefully and inform the developer that manual intervention is required. Right now the options seem to be to not use the --noinput options and have the prompt interrupt the script, or to use the option and have no idea when migrations failed because they required input.\nI'm not very picky as far as how this functionality should be implemented goes. I would think that a little warning like\n\"No migrations run because input was required but --noinput option was specified.\"\nwould be sufficient. This could be output to stdout or stderr, either all the time or perhaps only if an additional option was set.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to locate the parts of the code where the `makemigrations` and `migrate` commands are implemented. These commands would be foundational to Django or a similar web framework, assuming the context of the database migrations. Based on the typical architecture of these frameworks, the commands could be implemented in classes that define command-line actions, possibly inheriting from a base command class.\n\nGiven these assumptions, let's start with a few search queries to find where these commands are defined and how they are implemented:\n\n1. To find where the `makemigrations` command is defined, we can search for a class or method across the codebase named or related to \"makemigrations\". Since it's likely a management command, it might be encapsulated in a class.\n   \n2. Similarly, we'll look for the `migrate` command in the same manner, as it's another management command that is crucial for applying database migrations.\n\n3. Since the issue mentions the `--noinput` option, we need to find where this option is parsed and how it affects the execution flow of these commands. It might be part of the command's options or argument parsing logic.\n\nHence, the necessary API calls might include:\n- `search_class(\"makemigrations\")` to see if a class representing this command directly exists.\n- `search_class(\"migrate\")` to locate the class definition for the migrate command.\n- `search_method(\"add_arguments\")` or even `search_code(\"add_arguments\")` to identify where the `--noinput` option might be defined or parsed for these commands since argument parsing in Django commands often happens in an `add_arguments` method of the command class.\n\nThese calls will help us understand the structure of these commands and where the `--noinput` logic is applied, so we can then decide on the best way to implement the requested output feature without disturbing the existing flow."
