        "intended_behavior": "The code at this location should be modified to check if the `--noinput` option is used and whether the command would normally prompt for user input. If so, it should output a warning or informational message, e.g., \"No migrations run because input was required but --noinput option was specified.\" This ensures that the functionality for non-interactive use (scripting) is improved by providing feedback on the operation's status without breaking the existing workflow (keeping the non-interactive property of the `--noinput` option)."

        "method": "`handle` method where the command's execution logic resides and potentially in `add_arguments` for any new option handling",
        "intended_behavior": "When the `--noinput` option is active, and the command encounters a scenario where user input is typically required (e.g., conflict resolution, missing migrations, etc.), it should emit a clear message indicating the limitation or action taken due to the `--noinput` parameter. The behavior should ensure that the system's status or required actions are transparent to the operator, even in non-interactive modes, without compromising on the command's functionality when run interactively."
