Given the previous attempt didn't reproduce the issue as expected, let's adjust the code to better target the problem described. We'll explicitly check for the manifestation of the `ValueError` and make sure any deviation from expected behavior (including an error-free run) is properly flagged as an indication that the issue has been resolved. Hereâ€™s how you might rewrite `reproducer.py`:

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import sys
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models.functions import Chr
from django.db.models import Value

def setup_django_environment():
    settings.configure(
        DEBUG=True,
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': ':memory:',
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=(
            '__main__',
        ),
        USE_TZ=True,
    )
    django.setup()

def create_models():
    class Author(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    return Author

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    setup_django_environment()
    Author = create_models()

    try:
        # This should raise ValueError if the issue is present, as reported.
        query = Author.objects.annotate(first_letter=Chr(Value(77)))

        # Evaluating the query to force the error to be raised if it's going to happen.
        list(query)  
        
        # If no error has occurred at this point, we assume the issue has been resolved.
        print("Issue appears to be resolved.")
        os._exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate no issue detected.

    except Exception as e:  # Catch any exception that might be raised.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # We specifically check for the reported ValueError.
        if isinstance(e, ValueError) and 'invalid literal for int()' in str(e):
            raise AssertionError("The issue is present.") from e
        else:
            print("An unexpected error occurred, which might indicate a different problem.")
            os._exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 as the issue might be varied.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print("AssertionError caught. Exiting with code 1.")
        os._exit(1)  # Ensure we exit with a non-zero code if the specific issue is present.
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected exception occurred. Exiting with code 1.")
        os._exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 for any other exceptions.
```

This script properly checks for the scenario described and takes into account both the occurrence of the specific error and any deviations from it. It ensures that the script exits with the appropriate code based on whether the issue is detected, resolved, or an unexpected error occurs.
