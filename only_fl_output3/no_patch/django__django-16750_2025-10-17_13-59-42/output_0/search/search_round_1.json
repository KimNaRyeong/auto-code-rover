        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we should gather more context on where and how the `Chr` function is defined and used within the Django codebase. Specifically, we need to understand its implementation to see how it currently interprets inputs and how it might be modified to handle string values directly or set its output field appropriately. Let's perform the following API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the `Chr` function implementation**: Since `Chr` is likely to be a class or method within Django's ORM or expressions framework, we'll first try to locate its definition. `search_method(\"Chr\")` can help us identify where this method or function is defined.\n\n2. **Inspect the `Value` class or function**: The issue involves the `Value` function or class as well, which seems to be used in conjunction with `Chr`. It's relevant to understand how `Value` is implemented and how it interacts with `Chr`. Therefore, we'll also look for `Value`'s definition using `search_method(\"Value\")`.\n\n3. **Find the context of the error**: The error message points to a specific line in a `ValueError` within the `expressions.py` file. Although we don't have the exact line number, we can search for the lambda function related to this error in `expressions.py`. This could be achieved with a general search within that file for the `int` conversion which seems to be at the core of the issue. However, without the exact line number or a snippet of this lambda function, it might be challenging to directly pinpoint this through an API call. Nevertheless, understanding how `Chr` and `Value` are designed to work could provide enough insight to propose a solution without this.\n\nGiven the constraints and the direction we need to head, let's make the specific API calls mentioned in steps 1 and 2:\n\n- `search_method(\"Chr\")`\n- `search_method(\"Value\")`"

        "content": "Given that the search for methods `Chr` and `Value` returned no results, it's possible these are part of Django's higher-level abstractions that aren't directly exposed as standalone methods easily searchable through the provided API search capabilities. Since `Chr` and `Value` are referenced in the context of Django's ORM or query expression system, it might be more effective to search for classes or functionality within those systems.\n\nTo adjust our approach:\n\n1. **Search Within Expression Framework**: Since the traceback involves `django/db/models/expressions.py`, and the `Chr` function is used in an expression context (`annotate()` method), it's likely that `Chr` is an expression itself or closely related to Django's expression framework. We can try a different approach by searching for classes related to expressions in Django, specifically within the mentioned `expressions.py` file.\n\n2. **Check for `Chr` as a Class**: Given that direct method search was unsuccessful and considering Django's design patterns, `Chr` might be implemented as a class that represents a database function or expression. We should search for a `Chr` class specifically.\n\n3. **Re-evaluate the `Value` Reference**: Since `Value` was also not found as a method, it could be part of the expressions framework as well, possibly as a class designed to wrap literal values in queries. This aligns with Django's pattern of using classes for query expressions.\n\nConsidering these insights, let's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"Chr\")`: This will help locate the `Chr` expression or class within the Django framework, providing insights into its implementation and usage.\n\n- `search_class(\"Value\")`: To understand how values are wrapped or represented within Django expressions and queries, finding the `Value` class can provide context on how it interacts with other expressions like `Chr`.\n\nThese calls should give us a clearer picture of the underlying architecture and lead us towards understanding the issue more deeply, especially since the error suggests a type mismatch or conversion issue within the expressions' implementation."

Since the direct search for `Chr` and `Value` yielded no results and we can't proceed without identifying their implementations, we must make assumptions based on Django's typical patterns and the description of the issue.\n\nHowever, given the limitations and based on the typical structure of Django and the description of the problem, the bug locations can be hypothesized as follows:\n\n### Bug Location 1:\n- **File**: Likely within `django/db/models/functions.py` or a similar file that houses classes for database functions and expressions.\n- **Class**: `Chr` (Assumed but not directly located).\n- **Method**: The constructor (`__init__`) or possibly a method that is responsible for preparing values (if customization beyond the constructor is involved).\n\n### Intended Behavior:\n- The `Chr` class, which represents a database function for converting integers to their character representation (or used in a broader sense here), should be capable of handling character input directly or ensuring it correctly interprets and converts provided values into the appropriate database expression.\n- To resolve the issue, the class needs to be either adjusted or extended to set its `output_field` explicitly to `CharField()` when initialized or when preparing the value. This change would enable it to handle string literals without attempting to convert them to integers, thus preserving its functionality while preventing the `ValueError`.\n  \n  ```python\n  class Chr(...):\n      def __init__(self, expression, **extra):\n          ...\n          self.output_field = CharField()\n          ...\n  ```\n\n- Or, in a method responsible for the value conversion or handling within the Chr class, ensure that when dealing with string values, they are not forced into an integer conversion path.\n\n### Since no exact files, classes, or methods were confirmed through the provided search results, the above description represents an educated guess based on the nature of the issue and standard Django ORM patterns. It's assumed the `Chr` class would logically fit into Django's expression framework, which is typically extended for custom database expressions or functions.\n\nWithout direct search results confirming the location and implementation of `Chr` and `Value`, it's difficult to specify more accurate bug locations and intended behaviors. Further investigation and clarification through codebase exploration are necessary to refine these suggestions."
