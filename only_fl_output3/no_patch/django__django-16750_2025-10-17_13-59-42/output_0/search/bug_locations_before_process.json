        "intended_behavior": "The `Chr` class should be capable of handling character input directly or ensuring it correctly interprets and converts provided values into the appropriate database expression. To resolve the issue, the class needs to be either adjusted or extended to set its `output_field` explicitly to `CharField()` when initialized or when preparing the value. This change would enable it to handle string literals without attempting to convert them to integers, thus preserving its functionality while preventing the `ValueError`."
