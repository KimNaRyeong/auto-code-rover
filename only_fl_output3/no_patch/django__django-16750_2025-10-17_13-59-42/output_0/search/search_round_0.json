        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we should gather more context on where and how the `Chr` function is defined and used within the Django codebase. Specifically, we need to understand its implementation to see how it currently interprets inputs and how it might be modified to handle string values directly or set its output field appropriately. Let's perform the following API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the `Chr` function implementation**: Since `Chr` is likely to be a class or method within Django's ORM or expressions framework, we'll first try to locate its definition. `search_method(\"Chr\")` can help us identify where this method or function is defined.\n\n2. **Inspect the `Value` class or function**: The issue involves the `Value` function or class as well, which seems to be used in conjunction with `Chr`. It's relevant to understand how `Value` is implemented and how it interacts with `Chr`. Therefore, we'll also look for `Value`'s definition using `search_method(\"Value\")`.\n\n3. **Find the context of the error**: The error message points to a specific line in a `ValueError` within the `expressions.py` file. Although we don't have the exact line number, we can search for the lambda function related to this error in `expressions.py`. This could be achieved with a general search within that file for the `int` conversion which seems to be at the core of the issue. However, without the exact line number or a snippet of this lambda function, it might be challenging to directly pinpoint this through an API call. Nevertheless, understanding how `Chr` and `Value` are designed to work could provide enough insight to propose a solution without this.\n\nGiven the constraints and the direction we need to head, let's make the specific API calls mentioned in steps 1 and 2:\n\n- `search_method(\"Chr\")`\n- `search_method(\"Value\")`"
