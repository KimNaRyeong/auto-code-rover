        "intended_behavior": "In the method `_huber_loss_and_gradient`, when constructing the gradient specifically for non-outliers, the code attempts to negate a boolean mask using the `-` operator, which leads to a `TypeError`. The intended behavior is to properly invert the boolean mask to correctly slice the `X` array for further computation. This can be achieved by replacing the `-` operator with `~` in front of the boolean mask or using `numpy.logical_not` to achieve the correct negation of the mask. This change ensures compatibility with boolean array inputs by handling them correctly during the fitting process. This fix should preserve all existing functionalities, ensuring that the method can handle boolean arrays as inputs efficiently and without errors. This adjustment directly addresses the TypeError encountered when fitting `HuberRegressor` with boolean predictors, where the root cause is the inappropriate handling of boolean negation during slicing operations inside the gradient calculation."
