Given the feedback that the previous script execution led to an import error related to scikit-learn build issues rather than the specific `TypeError` with `HuberRegressor` that was intended to be tested, let's ensure that the scikit-learn library is correctly installed and try again. Please ensure scikit-learn is properly installed in your environment by running:

```bash
pip install -U scikit-learn
```

or 

```bash
conda install scikit-learn
```

if you are using Conda. After confirming that scikit-learn is correctly installed, you can attempt to run the following Python script again. This script is intended to reproduce the initial issue of `TypeError` when supplying a boolean array to the `fit` method of `HuberRegressor`. 

Here's a revised version of the `reproducer.py` script, including the function to print stack traces for debugging purposes:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
    from sklearn.linear_model import HuberRegressor

    # Generate random data
    X, y, coef = make_regression(n_samples=200, n_features=2, noise=4.0, coef=True, random_state=0)
    # Create a boolean array
    X_bool = X > 0
    
    try:
        # Attempt to fit HuberRegressor with a boolean array
        huber = HuberRegressor().fit(X_bool, y)
        print("No error occurred, the issue seems to be fixed.")
        exit(0)
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is still present.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(1)
```

Please save this script as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project and execute it with Python 3. This script is written to clearly indicate whether the issue has been resolved or if the specific `TypeError` persists, ensuring a straightforward testing process.
