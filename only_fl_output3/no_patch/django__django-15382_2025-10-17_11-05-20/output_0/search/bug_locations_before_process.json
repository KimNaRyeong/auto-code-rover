Special handling may need to be added to recognize when an `Exists` subquery will produce no results and to ensure that the resulting SQL properly reflects a negation or presence check without discarding the WHERE clause entirely. This preservation should occur even when the queryset is explicitly empty, as in the case of `MyModel.objects.none()`, ensuring that the logical negation (`~`) or presence indicated by `Exists` in Django ORM queries is correctly translated to SQL."

When `Exists` is constructed with an empty queryset, especially when negated, this method should generate SQL that properly captures the 'not exists' condition without resulting in the omission of crucial parts of the SQL statement. This might involve adjusting the SQL generation logic to explicitly handle empty querysets in a way that still allows for meaningful WHERE conditions to be generated, rather than leading to an `EmptyResultSet` scenario that removes the WHERE block. This adjustment should ensure that the SQL output remains logical and functional even when faced with negated empty `Exists` subqueries."
