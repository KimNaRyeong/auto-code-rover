To directly address the issue and avoid the complication due to the `EmptyResultSet`, I'll adjust the script to remove the automatic exit that occurred previously due to the uncaught `EmptyResultSet` exception. Instead, we will manually check the generated SQL for the presence of a WHERE block or the manifestation of an `EmptyResultSet`. This version will rely on Django's internal behavior, attempt to mitigate the direct raise of `EmptyResultSet`, and instead use a workaround to inspect the query generation process to determine if the WHERE block is absent as described in the issue.

```python
# reproducer.py

import os
import sys
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Exists


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

    # Create the tables
    execute_from_command_line(['manage.py', 'migrate'])

    # Attempt to reproduce the issue. Wrap in a try-except to manually handle the EmptyResultSet exception
    try:
        qs = MyModel.objects.filter(~Exists(MyModel.objects.none()), name='test')
        query_str = str(qs.query)
    except Exception as e:
        # Expect an EmptyResultSet, check if we can catch and inspect the generated query otherwise.
        # If control reaches here, meaning we could not generate a proper QS, indicate the issue persists
        raise AssertionError("Unable to inspect the generated SQL query due to EmptyResultSet.") from e

    # Intended to check if WHERE clause is present. As direct inspection failed, we are assuming here that if we reach this point without raising,
    # an EmptyResultSet implies the WHERE clause's absence.
    if 'WHERE' in query_str.upper():
        print("Issue seems to be fixed. The WHERE block is present.")
        sys.exit(0)
    else:
        # If 'WHERE' is missing from the query generation phase (not directly captured due to previous exception handling),
        # it suggests WHERE clause handling might still be problematic.
        raise AssertionError("The WHERE block appears to be improperly handled or missing.")

except AssertionError as assert_error:
    print_stacktrace(assert_error)
    sys.exit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
```

This script includes modifications to more accurately target the issue's core, implementing a workaround to assess if the WHERE clause is being handled as expected, given the constraints specified in the initial problem description.
