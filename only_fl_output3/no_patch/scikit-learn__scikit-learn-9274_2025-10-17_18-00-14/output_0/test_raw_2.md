To create a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that specifically reproduces the described issue and adheres to your requirements, see the following Python 3-compatible implementation:

```python
# reproducerer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor

    # Assuming data.npy is available in the current working directory
    try:
        train = np.load("data.npy", allow_pickle=True).tolist()
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print("data.npy file not found. Ensure the file is present and try again.")
        raise e

    max_iter = 18000
    clf = MLPRegressor(max_iter=max_iter, activation='relu', solver='lbfgs', verbose=True)
    
    try:
        clf.fit(train["train_x"], train["train_y"])

        actual_iters = clf.n_iter_
        print(f"Training iterations: {actual_iters}")

        # Check if the training iterations are less than expected due to the issue
        if actual_iters < max_iter:
            raise AssertionError(f"Expected training for {max_iter} iterations, but completed only {actual_iters}.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with non-zero to indicate failure/problem

    print("Issue not found or already fixed: training ran for the expected number of iterations.")
    exit(0)  # Exit with zero to indicate success/no-issue

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script specifically targets to reproduce the limitation on the number of iterations when fitting an MLP using the L-BFGS solver in scikit-learn. Ensure the `data.npy` file generated from the gist previously mentioned is placed in the same directory as this script before execution.

To execute the script, use:
```
python3 reproducer.py
```

This script will raise an `AssertionError` during the execution if the issue is present, displaying the trace for the assertion failure explicitly with line numbers thanks to the custom `print_stacktrace` function. When the issue is resolved (i.e., when the training is allowed to run for more than 15000 iterations), the script should exit gracefully with a code of 0 without any exceptions.
