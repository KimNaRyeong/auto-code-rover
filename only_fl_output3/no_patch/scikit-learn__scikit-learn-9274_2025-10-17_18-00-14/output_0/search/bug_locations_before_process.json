If true, it should correctly map the max_iter parameter from the class' initialization to the maxiter parameter for the LBFGS solver API call (e.g., in scipy.optimize.minimize). This ensures that when the LBFGS solver is used, the number of iterations it runs for is explicitly controlled by the max_iter parameter specified by the user, without being implicitly capped by any default maxiter or maxfun values of the LBFGS implementation. This fix should maintain the functionality for other solvers where max_iter directly or indirectly controls the iterations without unintended limitations."

        "intended_behavior": "In cases where the initialization process (_initialize) involves setting up solver-specific parameters, ensure that for the LBFGS solver, the initialization respects the max_iter parameter by setting up an appropriately configured solver object or passing parameters in a way that allows max_iter to control the number of iterations. This might not be directly about modifying _initialize but ensuring wherever the solver setup occurs recognizes and applies max_iter correctly for LBFGS."
