Given the specifics of your request and the error information provided previously, it's clear that the issue encountered was about the scikit-learn installation rather than the script itself. Ensure that scikit-learn is correctly installed and built in your environment before running the script.

Below, I've made a minor amendment to the script, ensuring it adheres to your requirements and might help in diagnosing the problem more clearly if ran in a correctly set up environment.

Please verify that scikit-learn is properly installed by running `pip install scikit-learn` or `conda install scikit-learn` if you are using Conda. This problem often arises when there is a mismatch between the Python environment expected by the installed scikit-learn binary and the actual Python environment being used, or if scikit-learn was partially or incorrectly installed.

Here's the revised `reproducer.py`:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor

    # Generate synthetic data for reproducible results
    X, y = np.random.rand(100, 10), np.random.rand(100)

    max_iter = 18000
    clf = MLPRegressor(max_iter=max_iter, activation='relu', solver='lbfgs', verbose=True)

    try:
        clf.fit(X, y)
        if clf.n_iter_ < max_iter:
            raise AssertionError(f"Training stopped early at {clf.n_iter_} iterations, was expected to run for {max_iter} iterations.")
        else:
            print(f"Training completed for {clf.n_iter_} / {max_iter} iterations as expected.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script will try to detect the issue described by attempting to train an MLPRegressor with more iterations than the default limit. If an error occurs or the assertion fails (i.e., the number of iterations does not reach the expected `max_iter`), it will print a stack trace. If everything works as expected, indicating the issue is resolved, it will exit with code 0. Before running this script, ensure your environment is correctly set up and that scikit-learn is properly installed.
