Ensure that scikit-learn is correctly installed and built in your environment before running the script.\n\nBelow, I've made a minor amendment to the script, ensuring it adheres to your requirements and might help in diagnosing the problem more clearly if ran in a correctly set up environment.\n\nPlease verify that scikit-learn is properly installed by running `pip install scikit-learn` or `conda install scikit-learn` if you are using Conda. This problem often arises when there is a mismatch between the Python environment expected by the installed scikit-learn binary and the actual Python environment being used, or if scikit-learn was partially or incorrectly installed.\n\nHere's the revised `reproducer.py`:\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef main():\n    import numpy as np\n    from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor\n\n    # Generate synthetic data for reproducible results\n    X, y = np.random.rand(100, 10), np.random.rand(100)\n\n    max_iter = 18000\n    clf = MLPRegressor(max_iter=max_iter, activation='relu', solver='lbfgs', verbose=True)\n\n    try:\n        clf.fit(X, y)\n        if clf.n_iter_ < max_iter:\n            raise AssertionError(f\"Training stopped early at {clf.n_iter_} iterations, was expected to run for {max_iter} iterations.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"Training completed for {clf.n_iter_} / {max_iter} iterations as expected.\")\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis script will try to detect the issue described by attempting to train an MLPRegressor with more iterations than the default limit. If an error occurs or the assertion fails (i.e., the number of iterations does not reach the expected `max_iter`), it will print a stack trace. If everything works as expected, indicating the issue is resolved, it will exit with code 0. Before running this script, ensure your environment is correctly set up and that scikit-learn is properly installed."
