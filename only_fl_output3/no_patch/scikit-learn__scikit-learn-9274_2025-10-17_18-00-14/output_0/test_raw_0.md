This script is designed to reproduce the issue mentioned. It tries to fit an `MLPRegressor` with a requested number of iterations significantly higher than the default maximum iteration limit for the L-BFGS solver. This script directly generates synthetic data using `make_regression` from scikit-learn to avoid dependencies on external datasets.

In case the issue is present, the script will assert an error due to the mismatch between the requested and actual number of iterations (the condition where the `n_iter_` attribute of the fitted model does not match `max_iter`), then print the stack trace showing exactly where the issue occurs.

When the problem is fixed, and the actual number of iterations matches the requested `max_iter`, the assertion will pass, and the script will complete successfully, exiting with code 0.

Please note, the use of `os._exit(1)` ensures that the script exits immediately with a status of 1 when the issue is present. This abrupt exit method is chosen to clearly indicate failure without performing any further cleanup operations, which might not be ideal in all scenarios but serves the purpose for this reproduction script.
