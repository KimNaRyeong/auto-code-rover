Based on your instructions, let's refine the script to include a clear detection mechanism for whether the issue is present or not. This version will attempt to forcefully reproduce the error and will check for an exception that matches the described behavior. If the exact issue appears (i.e., `ValueError: Invalid vmin or vmax`), it will catch this specific error to confirm the bug's presence.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_issue():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib.colors import LogNorm
    import numpy as np

    try:
        # create some random data to fill a 2d plot
        rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
        img = rng.uniform(1, 5, (25, 25))

        # plot it
        fig, ax = plt.subplots(layout="constrained")
        plot = ax.pcolormesh(img)
        cbar = fig.colorbar(plot, ax=ax)

        vmin = 1
        vmax = 5

        plot.norm = LogNorm(vmin, vmax)
        plot.autoscale()

        # Force a redraw to provoke the error
        plt.draw()

    except ValueError as e:
        if "Invalid vmin or vmax" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("Issue is present with changing norm after adding colorbar.") from e
        else:
            raise

    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred, not related to the known issue:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_issue()
    print("Issue not present. Test completed successfully.")

```

This version:
- Directly catches `ValueError` exceptions to specifically look for the "Invalid vmin or vmax" message.
- Removes the interactive plotting instructions (`plt.ion()`, `fig.show()`, `plt.pause(...)`) to avoid potential issues related to interactive mode that are not relevant to reproducibility of the specific bug.
- Uses `plt.draw()` to force a redraw of the figure, and this action should provoke the ValueError if the issue is present.
- Adds a conditional check to distinguish the expected ValueError from other possible ValueErrors.
- Raises an `AssertionError` specifically when the caught exception confirms the bugâ€™s presence.
- Provides informative messages for any unexpected exceptions, aiding in debugging or revealing other issues.
