Given the need for precision in addressing your requirements, here is a refined script designed to fulfill the task as specified. If the issue described is present, this script will raise an `AssertionError`, capturing and presenting the stack trace of the encountered issue using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. Conversely, if matplotlib behavior has been corrected and no longer exhibits the problematic behavior, the script will complete and exit with code 0, indicating success without any exceptions.

Please note, the reproducer assumes matplotlib 3.6.3 or any other context as specified in the bug report is in use within the environment where this script is executed.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_matplotlib_norm_with_colorbar():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib.colors import LogNorm
    import numpy as np

    # Setup a plotting scenario that should lead to the issue if present.
    try:
        # Generate synthetic data
        rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
        data = rng.uniform(1, 5, (25, 25))

        # Initial plot setup
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        mesh = ax.pcolormesh(data)

        # Create a colorbar for the mesh
        fig.colorbar(mesh, ax=ax)

        # Set vmin and vmax for LogNorm
        vmin, vmax = 1, 5

        # Here is where the issue has been reported
        mesh.norm = LogNorm(vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax)
        mesh.autoscale()

        # Attempt to draw the figure which could trigger the error
        fig.canvas.draw()

    except ValueError as e:
        if str(e) == "Invalid vmin or vmax":
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("The issue with setting norm after creating colorbar is present.") from e

        else:
            raise

    except Exception as e:
        print("A different unexpected error occurred:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_matplotlib_norm_with_colorbar()
    print("Issue seems resolved. No problems detected.")
```

This script aims to capture the specific circumstances under which the error arises, as detailed in the initial bug report. Running this reproducer in environments with different matplotlib versions or configurations than those described may yield varying outcomes. If executed within the conditions akin to those noted (matplotlib version 3.6.3 with the respective setup), an `AssertionError` should signal the presence of the bug when encountered. Conversely, an exit code of 0, accompanied by a success message, will indicate the absence of this issue, suggesting that the underlying problem may have been addressed in the used matplotlib environment or that the specific conditions to trigger the bug were not met.
