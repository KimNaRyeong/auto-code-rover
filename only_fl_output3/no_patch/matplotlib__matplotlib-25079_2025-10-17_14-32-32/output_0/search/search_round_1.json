The components involved are primarily related to `matplotlib.colors.LogNorm`, `matplotlib.axes._base`, `matplotlib.collections`, and the setting and updating mechanisms for norms and colorbars.

Explore the `LogNorm` class to understand how it is expected to work and any changes in the recent version:\n   - `search_class(\"LogNorm\")`\n\n2. Investigate how color normalization (`norm`) is applied and updated in mappable objects, particularly in the context of `pcolormesh`, which is part of the `collections` module:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"update_scalarmappable\", \"Collection\")`\n\n3.

Given that the reported error appears upon attempting to change the norm of an existing plot, it might be helpful to look into how `autoscale` interacts with changed norms, as it's called right after updating the norm in the provided reproduction script:\n   - `search_method(\"autoscale\")`\n\nThese API calls will provide a broad understanding of how norms are managed, how changes to norms should be propagated through to associated colorbars and plot elements, and any potential pitfalls in the code paths that lead to the handling of `vmin` and `vmax`.

Let's go through each part to answer the questions posed:\n\n1. **`update_scalarmappable` in `Collection`:**\n   - *What does this part of the code do?* This method updates the colors used in a collection based on its scalar mappable data. If the collection's `_A` attribute (data array) is set, it assigns colors to the face and edge of the collection elements based on this data and any specified alpha values. This is crucial for visualizations like `pcolormesh` where data values are mapped to colors.\n   - *Relationship to the bug:* The traceback leading to the bug goes through this method, specifically citing an issue when it tries to map the data array to colors using the current normalization (`norm`). The method attempts to handle arrays and their corresponding alpha values, eventually leading to an error related to `vmin` or `vmax`.\n   - *Intended behavior:* Given the issue, when changing the normalization to `LogNorm`, this method should successfully map the new normalized values to colors without throwing an error about `vmin` or `vmax`. This indicates that the handling of normalization and color mapping should be robust to changes in normalization parameters.\n\n2. **`__call__` in `Norm`:**\n   - *What does this part of the code do?* This method normalizes data values to the `[0, 1]` interval based on `vmin` and `vmax`. It processes the given values and scales them accordingly, also handling cases where `vmin` or `vmax` are not set or are invalid (e.g., `vmin` > `vmax`).\n   - *Relationship to the bug:* The error `Invalid vmin or vmax` originates from this method when `LogNorm` is applied to the plot, suggesting that during the normalization process, either the conditions for valid `vmin` and `vmax` are not met or the transformation itself results in invalid values.\n   - *Intended behavior:* When `LogNorm` is set with valid `vmin` and `vmax` parameters, this method should normalize the data values without errors, implying that the check for validity and the normalization process itself should be compatible with logarithmic scaling.\n\n3. **`autoscale` methods:**\n   - *What does this part of the code do?* These methods adjust the view limits of the plot based on the data limits. They can be defined in different contexts (e.g., axes, colors) to automatically adjust scales and limits to best fit the data presented.\n   - *Relationship to the bug:* The call to `autoscale` after setting the new normalization might play a role in triggering the error, potentially due to how the new limits are calculated or applied in the context of a `LogNorm`.\n   - *Intended behavior:* After changing normalization, calling `autoscale` should recalculate and adjust plot limits according to the new normalization criteria without causing errors related to `vmin` or `vmax`. This behavior should ensure that the plot updates correctly to reflect the new scaling.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTo address the bug, we need to ensure that:\n- The process of updating scalar mappable colors (`update_scalarmappable`) correctly handles changes in normalization, particularly non-linear ones like `LogNorm`.\n- The `__call__` method within the normalization classes (such as `LogNorm`, if it had been found in the codebase) validates `vmin` and `vmax` correctly and performs the transformation in a manner consistent with the expectations for logarithmic scaling.\n- The `autoscale` functionality smoothly integrates with changes in normalization, recalculating plot limits appropriately.\n\nConsidering the issue description and the code inspected, it appears that the error might stem from a specific interaction between the `LogNorm` normalization process and how data limits are determined or applied, both during normalization and autoscaling. Further investigation into the normalization and autoscaling process, especially focusing on changes introduced in matplotlib 3.6.3, would be necessary to devise an appropriate fix."

The process should account for the characteristics of logarithmic scales, such as not allowing `vmin` to be <= 0. The validation and transformation process of data values should be ensured to handle the logarithmic scale correctly without throwing `Invalid vmin or vmax` errors for valid log scale ranges.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `lib/matplotlib/collections.py`\n  - **Class:** `Collection`\n  - **Method:** `update_scalarmappable`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** When the norm is changed (for example, to `LogNorm`), the `update_scalarmappable` should incorporate the new normalization correctly when updating the color mapping of the collection, ensuring that it recalculates colors based on the new normalization without error. This might involve better handling of norm changes to ensure that data array (`_A`) mapping to colors is recalculated accurately according to the new norm's `vmin` and `vmax` and that any assumptions about linear scaling are re-evaluated for non-linear norms.\n\nGiven the analysis, these locations are central to the issue due to their involvement in normalization and color mapping which are crucial for correctly updating the plot to reflect changes in scaling, especially when switching to a `LogNorm`. The intended behaviors aim to correct the identified issue while maintaining existing functionality for user code that relies on dynamic updates to plot norm settings."
