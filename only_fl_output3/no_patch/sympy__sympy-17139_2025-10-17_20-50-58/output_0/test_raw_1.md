```python
def simplify_expression():
    from sympy import Symbol, cos, simplify, I

    x = Symbol('x')
    # Attempt the expression that should trigger the issue.
    result = simplify(cos(x)**I)
    return result

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys

    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        result = simplify_expression()
        # If the above line does not raise an exception, it means the issue has potentially been fixed.
        # Raise an AssertionError to indicate no issue was found.
        raise AssertionError("No exception was raised. The issue with 'simplify(cos(x)**I)' may have been fixed.")
    except Exception as e:
        if e.__class__.__name__ == "TypeError":
            # Assuming the TypeError is what we expect to find when the issue is present.
            print("The issue is present:")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(0)  # Exit code 0 to indicate the script executed as expected, reproducing the known issue.
        else:
            # If a different exception is thrown, it's an unexpected scenario.
            print("An unexpected exception occurred:", file=sys.stderr)
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate an unexpected error condition occurred.
```

This corrected script now includes the import of `I` which was missing in the initial attempt, leading to a `NameError`. The script checks for the expected `TypeError` and prints a stack trace if the issue is reproduced. If the issue is fixed, or a different unexpected exception is raised, it handles these cases distinctly, exiting with code 0 when the issue is reproduced as expected, and with code 1 for unexpected outcomes.
