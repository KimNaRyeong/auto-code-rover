This script attempts to reproduce the specified issue by simplifying an expression involving a complex exponent. It catches any exceptions that occur and prints detailed stack traces to help debug the problem. If the issue is successfully reproduced (i.e., an exception is caught), the script will raise an `AssertionError` to explicitly state that the issue exists. If the operation completes successfully, suggesting the issue might have been fixed, it prints a corresponding message and exits normally.
