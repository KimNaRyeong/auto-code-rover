        "intended_behavior": "The TR6 method should be modified to better handle cases where the exponent is a complex number. Specifically, it should check whether the exponent is complex and, if so, either apply a suitable simplification rule that is mathematically valid for complex exponents or skip the transformation if no such rule is appropriate. This would preserve the function's role in simplifying trigonometric expressions while preventing errors caused by invalid comparisons of complex numbers."

        "intended_behavior": "While the `__lt__` method itself correctly raises a TypeError on invalid comparisons involving complex numbers (as comparing complex numbers using less than/greater than is not mathematically valid), the context of its use indicates that there might be a need for upstream validation or handling before comparisons reach this point. Consequently, this suggests that upstream methods (like those involved in expression simplification or transformation, potentially `simplify` or `trigsimp`) may need enhancement to ensure they do not perform illegitimate comparisons on complex numbers. However, `__lt__` should remain unchanged as its behavior is correct; the change should rather be in how comparisons are formulated or performed in the simplification procedures, specifically ensuring that complex expressions are handled in a way to avoid direct comparison using `<` or `>` operations."
