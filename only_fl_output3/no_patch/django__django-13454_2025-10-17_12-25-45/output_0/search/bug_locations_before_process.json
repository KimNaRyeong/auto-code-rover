This involves detecting when the `field` argument corresponds to a `GenericForeignKey` and adjusting the filtering logic accordingly. Since `GenericForeignKey` does not have an `empty_strings_allowed` attribute, this filter should instead focus on the presence or absence of a related object. Logic should be added to specifically handle these types of relations, possibly by inspecting if the `object_id` field corresponding to the `GenericForeignKey` is null/blank."

        "intended_behavior": "Consideration should be given to either extending `GenericForeignKey` to include compatibility features for admin interface filters or providing clear documentation on how to achieve such functionality. As a more direct approach may involve altering `GenericForeignKey` is less desirable due to the potential for widespread impacts on existing codebases, no direct changes are proposed here. However, enhancing its compatibility with Django's admin filtering capabilities, possibly via a proxy method or attribute that simulates `empty_strings_allowed`, might be worth considering if it can be done without compromising existing functionality."
