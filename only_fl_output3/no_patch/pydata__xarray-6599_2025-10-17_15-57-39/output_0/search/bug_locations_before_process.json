        "intended_behavior": "The `polyval` method should handle `timedelta64` coordinates correctly, ensuring that its behavior remains consistent with previous versions of the software, especially version `2022.3.0`. The intended behavior involves appropriately managing `timedelta64` types during polynomial evaluation to prevent the generation of incorrect output. Any operation on `timedelta64` coordinates should be carefully managed to reflect the same logical operations as on other numeric types, allowing for accurate polynomial calculations. This may involve ensuring any type conversions, operations, or handling of `timedelta64` within `polyval` maintains or restores the coordinate's context, enabling it to produce results identical to those in the correct outputs provided in the bug report."
