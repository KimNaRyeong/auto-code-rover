This means the method's return value should conditionally include `\"violation_error_message\": self.violation_error_message` in its dictionary if `self.violation_error_message` differs from the class's default value. This addition ensures that the `deconstruct` method accurately represents the state of the `BaseConstraint` object, including any changes to the error message."

        "intended_behavior": "A new `__eq__` method needs to be implemented that takes into consideration the `violation_error_message` attribute along with any other significant attributes currently being compared. The method should return `True` only if all the compared attributes between two `BaseConstraint` instances match, including the `violation_error_message`. This will ensure proper comparison logic is used when Django internally checks constraint equality, which can affect migrations, model validation, and other Django internals which rely on an accurate sense of constraint uniqueness and identity."
