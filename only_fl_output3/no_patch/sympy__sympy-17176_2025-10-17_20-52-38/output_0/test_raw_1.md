Based on the feedback that the previous script did not correctly reproduce the issue as intended and considering the instructions provided, let's revise the script. This time, we'll ensure the script raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, otherwise, it completes successfully. Note that the original intent was to detect issues, but there was a misunderstanding in how the conditions were supposed to be checked. Let's adjust the logic accordingly:

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import symbols, Xor, bool_map
    from sympy.logic.boolalg import _finger
    from collections import defaultdict
    A1, A2, A3 = symbols('A1 A2 A3')
    f1 = Xor(A1, A2, A3)
    f2 = ~(Xor(A1, A2, A3))
    
    # Adjusting the logic to correctly raise an error if the issue is detected
    try:
        result = bool_map(f1, f2)
        # If finding an equivalent mapping is considered a failure (an issue), then assert the opposite
        correct_result = (None, {A1: A1, A3: A3, A2: A2}) # Assume this is what a correct output should look like
        assert result == correct_result, "bool_map incorrectly found an equivalent mapping which indicates an issue."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e  # To ensure the script raises an error if an issue is detected
    
    # Checking the fingerprint routine
    try:
        a = _finger((A1 & A2 & A3) | (~A1 & ~A2 & A3) | (A1 & ~A2 & ~A3) | (~A1 & A2 & ~A3))
        b = _finger((A1 & A2 & ~A3) | (~A1 & ~A2 & ~A3) | (A1 & ~A2 & A3) | (~A1 & A2 & A3))
        # Expect different fingerprints for a and b to assert success; identical indicates a flaw.
        assert a != b, "Fingerprints are identical, which indicates an issue."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e  # To ensure the script exits indicating an issue was found
    
    print("Finished executing reproducer.py without detecting any issues.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised approach ensures that:
- If the script identifies an issue, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints the stack trace, highlighting exactly where the problem was detected.
- If the issues described (incorrect `bool_map` result or identical fingerprints for different expressions) are not found, the script completes successfully, printing the message that no issues were detected. 
- The script exits with code 0 when it successfully completes without detecting any issues, following the provided instructions. If an issue is detected, it properly raises an error to signal that.
