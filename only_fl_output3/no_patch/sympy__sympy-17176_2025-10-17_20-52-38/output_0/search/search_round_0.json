        "content": "To address the reported issue, it seems that both the behavior of `bool_map` on specific expressions and the correctness of `_finger` function are questioned. The `_finger` function's purpose appears to be creating a fingerprint for boolean expressions, but it is not distinguishing between certain expressions as expected. Given the nature of the problem, gathering context around the implementation of `bool_map`, `Xor`, and `_finger` within the SymPy library would be pertinent.\n\nTo this end, the appropriate API calls could include:\n\n1. **Search for the `bool_map` method**: This method is directly mentioned in the issue and seems to be behaving unexpectedly. Understanding its implementation could reveal how it interacts with the expressions and the fingerprinting process.\n   \n2. **Search for the `Xor` class or method**: Given that `Xor` is at the core of the expressions used in the issue, understanding its implementation might provide insights into how it's supposed to work with functions like `bool_map` and how it might be related to the fingerprinting issue.\n\n3. **Search for the `_finger` function**: Since the issue highlights an apparent flaw in the `_finger` function related to the fingerprinting of boolean expressions, it's crucial to look into its implementation details. \n\n4. **General search for `Xor` related code snippet**: This could help in identifying how `Xor` is typically used in relation to `bool_map` and `_finger`, and if there are any nuances in its behavior that need to be accounted for.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the recommended API calls are:\n\n1. `search_method(\"bool_map\")`\n2. `search_class(\"Xor\")` or `search_method(\"Xor\")` to capture both possibilities, in case `Xor` is implemented as a method rather than a class, or vice versa.\n3. `search_method(\"_finger\")`\n\nThese calls will help in collecting the necessary code context to address the issue mentioned."
