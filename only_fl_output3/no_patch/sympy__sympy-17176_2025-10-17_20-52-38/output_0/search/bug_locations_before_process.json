This might involve adding more sophisticated logic in the fingerprint generation process to better capture the unique characteristics of `Xor` operations and their interactions within expressions. The existing functionality for simpler expressions and other boolean operations should be preserved while improving the handling of complex cases like those highlighted by the issue."

This will likely involve using the enhanced fingerprints generated by `_finger` for better comparison and mapping of variables. The improvement needs to ensure that `bool_map` remains robust across a wide range of boolean expressions, correctly identifying equivalences and non-equivalences even in complex cases. The correction should ensure that expressions involving `Xor` and its negation (and potentially other complex boolean constructs) are handled in a way that their logical behavior is accurately represented and mapped."
