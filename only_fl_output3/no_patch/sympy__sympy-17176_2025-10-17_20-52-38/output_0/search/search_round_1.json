        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results provides insights into the functions and class relevant to the reported issue.\n\n### `bool_map` Function (sympy/logic/boolalg.py)\n\n1. **Functionality:** The `bool_map` function attempts to simplify one boolean expression compared to another and returns the simplified version of the first expression along with a mapping of variables that makes the two expressions represent the same logical behavior. If no such mapping exists, it returns `False`. This involves a process where it tries to figure out if there's a way to interpret the variables in one boolean expression to make it equivalent to the other. The documentation and examples highlight its ability to handle various logical constructs to find equivalence between two potentially complex boolean expressions.\n   \n2. **Relation to Bug:** The issue reports a problem with `bool_map` producing unexpected results when used with `Xor` and its negation, suggesting that the problem might lie in how `bool_map` or the underlying helpers (`_finger` and `match`) process these specific cases.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior:** `bool_map` should correctly identify when two boolean expressions are equivalent under some variable mapping, including cases involving `Xor`. For the issue mentioned, it should ideally recognize that `f1` and `f2` (`f1 = Xor(A1,A2,A3)` and `f2 = ~(Xor(A1,A2,A3))`) are not equivalent through any simple variable mapping since they represent opposite logic states.\n\n### `Xor` Class (sympy/logic/boolalg.py)\n\n1. **Functionality:** `Xor` is a class representing the exclusive or logical operation as a boolean function. It likely overrides methods from `BooleanFunction` to implement `Xor` specific logic, including simplification rules (`_eval_simplify`), normal form conversions (`to_nnf`), and possibly rewrite rules to represent the expression in terms of other logical operations.\n\n2. **Relation to Bug:** Directly related to the issue since `Xor` is the operation being questioned regarding its handling in `bool_map` and fingerprinting. The implementation details, such as how it simplifies or interacts with other boolean expressions, could be crucial in understanding why `bool_map` is showing unexpected behavior.\n\n### `_finger` Function (sympy/logic/boolalg.py)\n\n1. **Functionality:** This function generates a fingerprint for each symbol in an equation, based on how the symbol appears in the equation. The fingerprint consists of several metrics, like the number of times a symbol appears, how it appears within `And` or `Or` contexts, and its appearances as a negated symbol. This process supports identifying unique characteristics of symbols within expressions, aiding in tasks like finding variable mappings that make two expressions equivalent.\n\n2. **Relation to Bug:** The issue implies `_finger` produces identical fingerprints for boolean expressions that should logically be distinguishable. This could point to a lack of nuance in how fingerprints are generated, especially in capturing the essence of `Xor` operations and their interactions with negations or other boolean constructs.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior:** For the `Xor` related expressions provided in the issue, `_finger` should generate distinct fingerprints reflecting their unique logical structures. The current identical fingerprints suggest a gap in handling the complexity of `Xor` and its negation within boolean expressions, failing to capture the difference in their logical implications sufficiently.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nThe insights suggest that the handling of `Xor` operations (and possibly other boolean operations) by `_finger` and subsequently by `bool_map` might not be robust enough to distinguish between certain logically differing expressions. A deeper dive into how `_finger` generates and uses fingerprints, especially in the context of complex boolean operations like `Xor`, seems necessary. Additionally, reviewing the logic within the `bool_map` that uses these fingerprints for variable mapping could help identify where the logic fails for expressions involving `Xor` and its negation. The intended behavior suggests a need for enhanced specificity in recognizing logical equivalencies or differences, especially in nuanced cases as highlighted by the issue."

This might involve adding more sophisticated logic in the fingerprint generation process to better capture the unique characteristics of `Xor` operations and their interactions within expressions.

This will likely involve using the enhanced fingerprints generated by `_finger` for better comparison and mapping of variables. The improvement needs to ensure that `bool_map` remains robust across a wide range of boolean expressions, correctly identifying equivalences and non-equivalences even in complex cases. The correction should ensure that expressions involving `Xor` and its negation (and potentially other complex boolean constructs) are handled in a way that their logical behavior is accurately represented and mapped."
