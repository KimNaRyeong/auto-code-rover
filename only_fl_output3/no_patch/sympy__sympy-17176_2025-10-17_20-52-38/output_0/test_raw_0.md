This script will reproduce the described issues by carrying out two key assessments:

1. It verifies whether `bool_map` incorrectly identifies a mapping between `f1` (XOR3 function) and `f2` (XNR3 function, which is the complement of XOR3). The assertion is expecting that `bool_map` does not return the specific incorrect mapping that was initially described, thereby failing if the issue still exists or passing if the issue is resolved.

2. It evaluates the `_finger` function used for generating fingerprints of Boolean expressions to detect if identical fingerprints are generated for distinct expressions â€” a situation that should not normally happen. The assertion checks that the fingerprints for the two given expressions are not the same, indicating a flaw if they are identical or passing if the flaw has been addressed.

The script concludes without an Exception if the flaws are not found, or it provides detailed stack traces to assist in identifying where the incorrect behavior originates from if any of the assertions fail, indicating the issues are still present.
