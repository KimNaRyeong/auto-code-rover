Based on your request, here is a standalone `reproducer.py` Python script designed to reproduce the mentioned issue of `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing` overflowing when fitting on a large `float16` numpy array. This script is complete with detailed exception handling and a function to print the stack trace as per your specification:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    Line {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Attempt to use StandardScaler on a large float16 array
    try:
        sample = np.full([10_000_000, 1], 10.0, dtype=np.float16)
        scaler = StandardScaler()
        transformed_sample = scaler.fit_transform(sample)
        
        # Check if the transformation has resulted in NaNs, indicating overflow
        if np.isnan(transformed_sample).any():
            raise AssertionError("Overflow encountered during fit_transform, resulting in NaN values.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero exit code to indicate failure
        
    print("Issue not encountered - fit_transform executed successfully.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script will:

1. Attempt to fit and transform a large array with `float16` data type using `StandardScaler`.
2. Check for `NaN` values in the transformed output, which indicates that an overflow occurred during the operation.
3. If an overflow is detected, an `AssertionError` is raised, and a detailed stack trace is printed to standard error using the `print_stacktrace` function.
4. The script exits with a code `0` if the issue is not encountered (i.e., if everything works as expected without overflow), or with a code `1` if an exception is raised, indicating that the issue persists.

Note: To run this script, ensure that you have the required packages (`numpy` and `scikit-learn`) installed in your Python environment.
