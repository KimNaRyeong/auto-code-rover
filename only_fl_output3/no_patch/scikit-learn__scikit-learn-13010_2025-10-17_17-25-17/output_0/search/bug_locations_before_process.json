        "intended_behavior": "Within the `fit` method, when calculating the mean and standard deviation of the data (`X`), ensure that the dtype is temporarily promoted to a higher precision (e.g., `float32` or `float64`) before performing calculations. This change aims to prevent overflow problems when handling `float16` datasets. The internal logic should check the dtype of the input `X`, and if it's `float16`, perform the mean and std calculations with a promoted dtype. After these calculations, it can either retain the higher precision for further computations within the scaler or cast back to `float16` if feasible and beneficial for memory usage without risking further overflow issues. This adjustment would preserve the existing functionality for non-`float16` data types, ensuring backward compatibility."
