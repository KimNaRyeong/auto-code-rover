I can convert the array to a larger precision but when working with a larger dataset the memory saved by using float16 on smaller numbers kind of matter. The error is mostly on numpy. Adding the dtype on the mean/std calculation does it but I'm not sure if that how people here would like to do it.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nsample = np.full([10_000_000, 1], 10.0, dtype=np.float16)\nStandardScaler().fit_transform(sample)\n```\n#### Expected Results\nThe normalized array\n#### Actual Results\n```\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/_methods.py:36: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in reduce\nreturn umr_sum(a, axis, dtype, out, keepdims, initial)\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/fromnumeric.py:86: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in reduce\nreturn ufunc.reduce(obj, axis, dtype, out, **passkwargs)\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/_methods.py:36: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in reduce\nreturn umr_sum(a, axis, dtype, out, keepdims, initial)\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/preprocessing/data.py:765: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in true_divide\nX /= self.scale_\narray([[nan],\n[nan],\n[nan],\n...,\n[nan],\n[nan],\n[nan]], dtype=float16)\n```\n#### Versions\n```\nSystem:\npython: 3.6.6 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Oct  9 2018, 12:34:16)  [GCC 7.3.0]\nexecutable: /opt/conda/bin/python\nmachine: Linux-4.9.0-5-amd64-x86_64-with-debian-9.4\nBLAS:\nmacros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\nlib_dirs: /opt/conda/lib\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\nPython deps:\npip: 18.1\nsetuptools: 39.1.0\nsklearn: 0.20.2\nnumpy: 1.16.0\nscipy: 1.1.0\nCython: 0.29.2\npandas: 0.23.4\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue mentioned, let's perform a series of search API calls to gather the necessary context for resolving the overflow problem encountered when `StandardScaler` is used on large `float16` numpy arrays. The aim is to find where the `mean` and `std` calculations are performed and to understand how we might adjust them to handle `float16` data without overflow. Based on the issue description, relevant search actions would include:\n\n1. Identifying the implementation details of `StandardScaler`, which involves looking into the class and its methods where the calculations happen.\n2. Looking into how numpy's mean and std functions are used within the `StandardScaler` since those are likely spots for the overflow issue.\n\nBased on this, let's execute the following API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"StandardScaler\")`: To find the file and class definition of `StandardScaler`.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"StandardScaler\")`: Since the overflow occurs during a fit operation, we need to understand how the `fit` method works in the context of `StandardScaler`.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"fit_transform\", \"StandardScaler\")`: Understanding `fit_transform` could also provide insights, as that is the method directly called in the issue's reproduce steps.\n- `search_code(\"np.mean\")`: This will help us find how numpy's mean function is used across the project, which could point us to the specific implementation that needs adjustment for `float16` data types.\n- `search_code(\"np.std\")`: Similar to the mean function, identifying the usage of numpy's std function would be helpful to understand where the overflow might be happening."
