Given the misunderstanding in my previous response and the setup issue you're facing, let's revise the script considering your requirement. This revised script attempts to directly reproduce the issue mentioned (StandardScaler overflow with float16 data) and will correctly handle errors to display a stack trace.

Make sure your environment has the necessary packages (numpy, sklearn) correctly installed and built to avoid the ImportError you encountered.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    Line {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    sample = np.full([10_000_000, 1], 10.0, dtype=np.float16)
    scaler = StandardScaler()

    try:
        transformed_sample = scaler.fit_transform(sample)
        if np.any(np.isnan(transformed_sample)):
            raise AssertionError("Normalization resulted in NaN values, indicating overflow.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
        print("No issue detected - script executed successfully.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Success
    except AssertionError as error:
        print_stacktrace(error)
        sys.exit(1)  # Signal an error specific to the assertion
    except Exception as error:
        print_stacktrace(error)
        sys.exit(2)  # Signal a general error
```

This script checks for the specific issue and uses `print_stacktrace` to clearly show where and why the error occurred if it does, ensuring detailed feedback on any overflow or related errors. It also distinguishes between the assertion error (specific overflow issue detected) and other potential exceptions for better clarity on the script's outcome.
