Given the feedback and the previously shared script, if your test execution did not reproduce the issue as expected and exited with an error not directly related to the issue at hand (e.g. import errors or issues with the testing environment setup), it indicates a problem outside the scope of the actual issue described (like environment setup or unsupported package versions).

However, focusing on the original task to provide a script that should reproduce the issue and exit accordingly, below is a slightly revised version of the `reproducer.py` script. This update doesn't include changes for environmental errors (like the one related to `np.unicode_`), assuming that the testing environment will be correctly setup to match the conditions where the issue occurs. Please ensure that your environment matches the necessary requirements to avoid such unrelated errors:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import xarray as xr

    try:
        coeffs = xr.DataArray([1, 2, 3], dims="degree")
        # Case 1: Coord without name
        coord = xr.DataArray([0, 1, 2], dims="x")
        # This is expected to raise KeyError due to missing name attribute
        xr.polyval(coord, coeffs)
        # If no error is raised, it means the issue is fixed
        print("Issue fixed.")
        exit(0)
    except KeyError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Raising AssertionError to indicate the issue is present
        raise AssertionError("Expected KeyError was not raised due to issue")

    # This part should not be reached if KeyError is raised as expected
    try:
        # Case 2: Coord with name, matching the dimension
        coord_with_name = xr.DataArray([0, 1, 2], dims="x", name="x")
        # This should work without errors
        xr.polyval(coord_with_name, coeffs)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Unexpected error occurred")
    else:
        print("No issues detected with coord having a proper name.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please ensure the testing environment has the correct versions of libraries installed as per the provided environment details in the issue description and that no external factors (unrelated to xarray and its dependencies) might cause the script to fail.
