This preserves the method's functionality of evaluating polynomials over coordinates while making it more robust to user inputs."

        "intended_behavior": "Modify the method to handle the case when `coord.name` is `None` gracefully. This could mean implementing a check at the beginning of the method to infer or assign a temporary name based on the provided dimension or improving the error handling to guide the user explicitly about the name requirement. This change ensures that polynomial evaluations can be done without specifying a name for manually created coordinate arrays, supporting a wider range of user workflows."
