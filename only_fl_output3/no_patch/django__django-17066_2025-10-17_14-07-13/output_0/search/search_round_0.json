However, migrations serializer doesn't have any special facilities for ensuring stable output for sets and this is what causes annoying diffs for us all the time.\nI suggest to add a trivial serializer specifically for unordered sequences which ensures stable output no matter the iteration order. Stability can be achieved by sorting elements in the set by their string representation. This only affects the writer output, and doesn't interfere with the rest of Django in any way, so this change only improves developer experience, but has no effect on the performance and/or reliability.\nI hope that even though it's apparently not a major problem for most users you would still accept the fix to ensure stable migration writer output for the rest of us.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we should initially look for classes and methods involved in serializing migrations, particularly those handling `unique_together` and `index_together` constraints serialization. The issue description mentions that these constraints are normalized to sets inside the `ModelState`, and the serialization does not currently ensure a stable output due to the unordered nature of Python sets. Our goal is to find where this serialization takes place and propose a solution to sort the elements before generating the output. Let's start by:\n\n1. Searching for the class responsible for migration serialization. This might be named something like `MigrationSerializer`, `ModelState`, or similar. We need to confirm the exact class name involved in this process.\n\n2. Once we have the class, we should look for specific methods that handle the serialization of `unique_together` and `index_together` constraints. The method names might not be straightforward, so we could look for methods involved in serializing model constraints or the overall migration file.\n\n3. In addition, searching for a snippet where `unique_together` is handled might directly point us to the function or method responsible for the ordering issue.\n\nConsidering the information provided in the issue, let's structure our API calls as follows:\n\n- `search_code(\"unique_together\")`: This will help us identify where in the codebase `unique_together` constraints are being handled.\n- `search_code(\"index_together\")`: Similarly, this helps us pinpoint where `index_together` constraints are processed.\n- `search_class(\"MigrationSerializer\")`: Although the class name might not be exactly this, searching for a serializer class involved in migrations is a good starting point.\n- `search_method(\"serialize\")`: Since we're dealing with serialization issues, methods named `serialize` or related to serialization could be involved in this issue.\n\nThese searches will provide a broad starting point to narrow down the specific areas of the codebase we need to modify."
