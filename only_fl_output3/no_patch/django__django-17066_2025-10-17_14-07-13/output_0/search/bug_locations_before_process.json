This ensures that the output order of elements such as unique_together and index_together constraints remains consistent across different runs. The modification should not alter the logical representation of the sets within the migrations; it should only affect their string output to ensure deterministic ordering. The existing functionality for serializing other types of fields or constraints should remain unaffected."

The change should specifically target serialization output consistency without impacting the functional aspects of migration application or rollback."
