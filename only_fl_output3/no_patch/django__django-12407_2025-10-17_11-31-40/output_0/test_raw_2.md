Based on your request to retry and focus on reproducing the specific issue about using `{% include %}` with `select_template` instead of `get_template`, let's adjust the script accordingly. This time, we also need to make sure the Django environment is properly set up, including a workaround for `ROOT_URLCONF`, given the error encountered in your last execution.

```python
# reproducer.py
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.template import Template, Context, TemplateDoesNotExist

def setup_django_environment():
    settings.configure(
        INSTALLED_APPS=[
            'django.contrib.admin',
            'django.contrib.auth',
            'django.contrib.contenttypes',
            'django.contrib.sessions',
            # Add any other apps that your project depends on
        ],
        TEMPLATES=[{
            'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
            'DIRS': [],  # Specify your template dirs if needed
            'APP_DIRS': True,
        }],
        # Setting up a dummy ROOT_URLCONF to avoid errors related to URL resolving
        ROOT_URLCONF = '__main__',
    )
    django.setup()

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    setup_django_environment()

    template_code = '{% include var %}'
    tmpl = Template(template_code)
    ctx = Context({'var': ['admin/base_site.html', 'admin/fail.html']})  # 'admin/base_site.html' should exist within Django's admin app if it's in INSTALLED_APPS

    try:
        output = tmpl.render(ctx)
        # The actual issue requires checking if the exception is raised or not; assuming an exception should be raised if the issue exists.
        print("No error raised when rendering a list of templates with {% include %}.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit code 0 when the issue is fixed (i.e., no exception means select_template works as expected)
    except TemplateDoesNotExist as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("TemplateDoesNotExist raised - Issue present. {% include %} failed to use select_template for fallback templates.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print(ae)
        sys.exit(1)  # An assertion error means the issue is present
```

This script is designed to:
- Set up a minimal Django environment, avoiding the `ROOT_URLCONF` related error by providing a dummy setting.
- Attempt to render a template that includes another template by a list of names, simulating the described issue of `{% include %}` not gracefully dealing with fallback templates.
- Utilize the `print_stacktrace` function to output the stack trace clearly for diagnosing issues when an exception is raised due to the inability to find the template(s).

Running this script in the root directory of a Django project by executing `python3 reproducer.py` will attempt to reproduce the issue. If the issue exists (i.e., Django raises a `TemplateDoesNotExist` error because it doesn't fallback to a second template), it will print a stack trace and exit with code 1, indicating that the issue is present. If the script does not hit the exception and exits gracefully, it suggests the issue might have been fixed, and it exits with code 0, indicating an expected behavior where no error is raised.
