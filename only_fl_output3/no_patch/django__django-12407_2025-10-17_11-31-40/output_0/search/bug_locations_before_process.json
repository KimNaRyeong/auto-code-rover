        "intended_behavior": "The `render` method should be modified to use `select_template()` instead of `get_template()` when resolving the template to be included. This change will allow for a list of templates to be specified in the `var` context variable, from which the first available template will be selected and used. This implementation should check if the `template` variable is a list and if so, use `select_template` to select the appropriate template. If it's not a list, the behavior should default back to the current implementation to maintain backwards compatibility. This modification will enable the `{% include %}` tag to support fallback templates, improving its flexibility without altering its existing functionality for single-template use cases."
