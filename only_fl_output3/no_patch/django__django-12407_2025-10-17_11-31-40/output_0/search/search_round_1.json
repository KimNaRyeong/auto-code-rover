        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. The `IncludeNode` Class in `django/template/loader_tags.py`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThe `IncludeNode` class is responsible for handling the `{% include %}` template tag in Django. Its `render` method is designed to render a specified template, passed as a variable, within another template. The method resolves the template to be included, checks if it's cacheable or needs to be fetched anew using `get_template()`, and then renders it with the current or a new context based on whether the tag is set to use an isolated context.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\nThe issue report specifically mentions the use of `get_template(template_name)` when a `select_template` function would be more appropriate for selecting the first available template from a list of potential templates. The code snippet starting at line 176 shows the call to `get_template` which does not allow for fallbacks or selecting between multiple templates, leading to the bug where if a non-existent template is referenced, it results in a `TemplateDoesNotExist` error instead of trying a fallback option.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\nThe intended behavior, based on the issue description, is to modify the `IncludeNode` render method to use `select_template` instead of `get_template`. This would allow for specifying a list of template names (`['admin/base.html', 'admin/fail.html']`) and have Django select the first one that exists. This change requires handling a list of templates as well as individual template names, making the template selection process more flexible and robust, especially in scenarios where fallback templates are desirable.\n\n#### 2. The Usage of `get_template(template_name)` in Various Files\n\nGiven the issue's focus and the search results, the most critical occurrence is the one in `django/template/loader_tags.py`. The occurrences in other files (`django/template/loader.py`, `engine.py`, `backends/jinja2.py`, etc.) suggest that `get_template` is a commonly used utility across the Django template rendering system. While altering its behavior in `loader_tags.py` directly addresses the issue, these other occurrences underscore the widespread reliance on a system that currently does not support template fallbacks at the level of an `{% include %}` tag implementation.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nTo craft a patch, we need to ensure that replacing `get_template` with `select_template` in `IncludeNode`:\n\n1. Does not adversely affect the expected behavior of single templates (ensuring backwards compatibility).\n2. Correctly iterates over the list of templates and selects the first valid one without throwing a `TemplateDoesNotExist` exception for list inputs.\n3. Ensures that any changes maintain or improve the performance of template rendering, especially in loops where the `{% include %}` tag might be used multiple times.\n\nThe analysis of the context provided by the search results informs the necessary adjustments to be made in `loader_tags.py`, enhancing the functionality and flexibility of the `{% include %}` tag in Django templates."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This change will allow for a list of templates to be specified in the `var` context variable, from which the first available template will be selected and used. This implementation should check if the `template` variable is a list and if so, use `select_template` to select the appropriate template. If it's not a list, the behavior should default back to the current implementation to maintain backwards compatibility. This modification will enable the `{% include %}` tag to support fallback templates, improving its flexibility without altering its existing functionality for single-template use cases."
