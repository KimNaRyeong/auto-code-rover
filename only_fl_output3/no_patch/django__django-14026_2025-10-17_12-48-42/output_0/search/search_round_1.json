Understanding how the Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) handles these cases will be crucial. Here are the search API calls needed to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the class that implements the `Sum` function. This is essential to understand how it currently operates and where modifications can be made to support a default value.\n    - `search_class(\"Sum\")`\n\n2. Given that the issue mentions using COALESCE to implement default values for NULL, we should look for how the queryset annotations are applied, which could likely involve methods related to constructing queries or applying functions like `Sum`.\n    - `search_method(\"annotate\")`\n\n3. The `COALESCE` SQL function is mentioned as a workaround in the issue description, suggesting that we might need to find its usage or a method that would allow us to introduce it to the aggregation functionality.\n    - `search_code(\"COALESCE\")`\n\n4. Since this functionality could potentially affect or be part of a broader scope of aggregation functions (beyond just `Sum`), we should also investigate the parent class or a related module where these aggregations are defined.\n    - `search_class(\"Aggregate\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point by giving us insight into how `Sum` and potentially other aggregation functions are implemented, how annotations are managed within queries, and where we could possibly introduce a change to handle default values."

        "content": "### Analyzing the Collected Context\n\n#### 1. `Sum` Class in `aggregates.py`\n\n- **What it does:** The `Sum` class is a subclass of `Aggregate`, which represents the `SUM` aggregation function in SQL. It sets up the basic properties for the aggregation, like the SQL function name (`'SUM'`) and flags for distinct values.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** This class is directly related to the issue since it defines the aggregation function that currently returns `NULL` when there are no rows to aggregate. Adjusting its behavior or the way it processes results could address the requested feature for default values.\n- **Intended behavior:** To support a default value (e.g., 0 instead of `NULL`), there might need to be a mechanism either within this class or in its interaction with the database to apply the `COALESCE` SQL function, ensuring that the default value is used when no rows are present.\n\n#### 2. `annotate` Methods in `query.py`\n\n- **What it does:** These methods realize the functionality of annotating objects in a QuerySet with extra data or aggregations. This is where aggregations like `Sum` get applied to a set of records.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** Since the issue involves the default behavior when using `Sum` in an `annotate` call, alterations here could introduce the capability to specify or handle default values for aggregations.\n- **Intended behavior:** The method might need to include somehow the logic for applying default values using `COALESCE` when annotations are computed, particularly for aggregations that return `NULL`.\n\n#### 3. `Coalesce` Function in `comparison.py`\n\n- **What it does:** This class represents the `COALESCE` SQL function in Django, which returns the first non-null expression among its arguments. \n- **Relationship to the bug:** This function is key to solving the issue, as it is exactly what's needed to substitute `NULL` values with a specified default.\n- **Intended behavior:** Integrating `Coalesce` with `Sum` (and possibly other aggregate functions) would allow the desired behavior of using a default value in place of `NULL` results.\n\n#### 4. `Aggregate` Class in `aggregates.py`\n\n- **What it does:** Serves as the base class for all aggregate functions, defining common properties and methods used by specific functions like `Sum`.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** Since `Sum` is a subclass of `Aggregate`, any mechanism for handling default values at a more general level could potentially be defined here, affecting not just `Sum` but all aggregate functions.\n- **Intended behavior:** Adding a generic mechanism to handle default values for aggregation results in this class could provide a flexible solution applicable to all types of aggregations, aligning with the idea that other functions beyond `Sum` might benefit from this capability.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the issue description and the analyzed context, the path toward a solution involves potentially modifying the `Sum` class to support specifying a default value, possibly by integrating the `Coalesce` function into its output. Additionally, there might be a need to modify how `annotate` processes aggregations to accommodate these default values. Implementing a solution might thus involve altering both the `Sum` class to allow specifying a default value and ensuring `annotate` (or the underlying mechanism in `Aggregate`) supports this enhancement properly."

This could involve overriding the method that generates the SQL for the aggregation to incorporate the `COALESCE` function, using a default value when none is provided by the aggregation. The behavior should ensure that this change does not affect other functionalities of the `Sum` class or its interactions with other parts of the Django ORM.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/db/models/aggregates.py`\n  - **Class:** `Aggregate`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Consider adding a mechanism to the `Aggregate` class that allows all subclasses to specify how to handle `NULL` results, possibly through a default value. This change should be designed in a way that it's optional and backward compatible, ensuring that current implementations of `Aggregate` subclasses (like `Sum`, `Avg`, etc.) work as before without specifying a default. This could involve adjustments or extensions to methods responsible for composing the SQL query parts for aggregation to seamlessly integrate the `COALESCE` function or a similar mechanism.\n\nThese changes aim to extend the functionality of the aggregation functions within the Django ORM, allowing for more flexibility in handling `NULL` values as results of aggregations, enhancing usability for developers, and preserving existing functionalities and integrations."
