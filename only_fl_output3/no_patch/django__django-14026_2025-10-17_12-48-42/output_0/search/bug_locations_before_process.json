This change should be designed in a way that it's optional and backward compatible, ensuring that current implementations of Aggregate subclasses (like Sum, Avg, etc.) work as before without specifying a default. This could involve adjustments or extensions to methods responsible for composing the SQL query parts for aggregation to seamlessly integrate the COALESCE function or a similar mechanism."
