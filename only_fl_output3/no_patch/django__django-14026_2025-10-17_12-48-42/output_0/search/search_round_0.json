        "content": "To address the issue regarding the default value for Sum (and possibly other aggregation functions) and how they return NULL when no values are present, we will likely need to look at the implementation of the aggregation functions, particularly `Sum`, and how annotations are applied in queries. Understanding how the Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) handles these cases will be crucial. Here are the search API calls needed to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the class that implements the `Sum` function. This is essential to understand how it currently operates and where modifications can be made to support a default value.\n    - `search_class(\"Sum\")`\n\n2. Given that the issue mentions using COALESCE to implement default values for NULL, we should look for how the queryset annotations are applied, which could likely involve methods related to constructing queries or applying functions like `Sum`.\n    - `search_method(\"annotate\")`\n\n3. The `COALESCE` SQL function is mentioned as a workaround in the issue description, suggesting that we might need to find its usage or a method that would allow us to introduce it to the aggregation functionality.\n    - `search_code(\"COALESCE\")`\n\n4. Since this functionality could potentially affect or be part of a broader scope of aggregation functions (beyond just `Sum`), we should also investigate the parent class or a related module where these aggregations are defined.\n    - `search_class(\"Aggregate\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point by giving us insight into how `Sum` and potentially other aggregation functions are implemented, how annotations are managed within queries, and where we could possibly introduce a change to handle default values."
