The intended behavior here is to ensure that any scalar-mappable object (e.g., AxesImage) that utilizes a specific instance of Normalize for its normalization receives a notification when changes occur. This could involve implementing an observer pattern where scalar-mappable objects can subscribe to changes in the Normalize instance and refresh their state accordingly, thereby ensuring that changes in normalization limits immediately reflect across all using components."

        "intended_behavior": "AxesImage might require modifications to properly respond to notifications from its associated Normalize instance. Even though the specific method to fix isn't singled out (pending the implementation detail of the notification system in Normalize), the intention is that AxesImage should react to these notifications by updating its displayed image to reflect the new normalization state. This implies an enhancement where AxesImage listens for and handles Normalize state changes, possibly through a new method or extending an existing one to re-render the image based on new vmin or vmax values provided by Normalize."
