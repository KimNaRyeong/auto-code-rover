To resolve the issue while preserving the existing functionality, `_make_subclass` should: - Correctly identify and handle `TypeVar` instances as part of type annotations on classes. This might involve checking for `TypeVar` instances specifically and ensuring they are treated in a manner consistent with their use in generic types, rather than as generic objects. - Implement robust type checking or type-safe operations when manipulating class names or annotations to avoid `TypeError`. This could involve ensuring that any string operations involving class names or types are only performed on actual strings or appropriately converted representations, not directly on `TypeVar` or other complex types. - Ensure that when creating mock subclasses of generically-typed classes, the mock functionality preserves type annotations so that the Autodoc extension can generate documentation that accurately reflects these types without error. This adjustment should allow Sphinx's Autodoc extension to process documentation for generically-typed classes without running into type errors, thereby enabling documentation generation to proceed smoothly when generics are involved."
