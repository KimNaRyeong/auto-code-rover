To address directly the issue mentioned, which is a `TypeError` thrown by Autodoc's `mock._make_subclass` when building documentation for a class with generics, we need to create a setup close to your description. This involves creating a scenario that replicates generating documentation for a generically-typed class using Sphinx with Autodoc. For this script to be fully effective, ensure you've described the correct environment setup where the issue occursâ€”in this case, a presence of a generic-typed class alongside Sphinx build process.

The goal is for `reproducer.py` to:
1. Dynamically create a Python file that contains a generically-typed class.
2. Set up a minimal Sphinx environment that targets this file.
3. Try to build the docs, detecting if the error occurs.

```python
import os
import sys
import subprocess

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

This script:
- Checks and installs the necessary dependencies.
- Creates minimal Sphinx configuration and documentation files.
- Attempts to build the documentation, expecting a failure if the `TypeError` associated with handling generics is indeed present.

**Run Instruction:**
Place the script in the root directory of the project and execute it with Python 3. If the issue is present, it will throw an `AssertionError` and print the stack trace of the issue. If not, it indicates that the documentation was built successfully, suggesting that the issue may have been resolved or not present in the given environment.
