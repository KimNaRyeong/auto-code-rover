See the attached log: [sphinx-err-325ndteh.log](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/files/4842672/sphinx-err-325ndteh.log)\n**To Reproduce**\n```\n$ git https://github.com/perrygoy/screenpy.git\n$ cd screenpy/docs\n$ python -m venv env\n$ source env/bin/activate\n$ pip install sphinx pyhamcrest selenium typing_extensions\n$ make html\n```\nObserve the docs command fails with a TypeError.\n**Expected behavior**\nDocs can still be built when generics are involved.\n**Your project**\nhttps://github.com/perrygoy/screenpy.git\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Mac 10.15.5 (19F101)\n- Python version: 3.7.7\n- Sphinx version: 3.1.1\n- Sphinx extensions:  sphinx.ext.autodoc, sphinx.ext.intersphinx, sphinx.ext.coverage, sphinx.ext.ifconfig, sphinx.ext.napoleon\n**Additional context**\nThis might just be me not knowing how to make Sphinx-friendly generic typing, if that's the case please let me know!\n</issue>"

        "content": "To analyze and resolve the issue described, we'll need more context about how the project uses generics and potentially problematic code sections where generics are causing `TypeError` in the Autodoc process. Since the issue is specifically related to building docs for a generically-typed class and the error occurs in `mock._make_subclass`, the following API calls can provide us with the required context:\n\n1. Searching through the codebase to find instances where generics are defined or used might give us a clue on what's causing the issue with Sphinx Autodoc. However, without a specific class name or method, a broad search might not be directly feasible. We'll focus on finding any custom implementation or specific mentions of `mock._make_subclass` related to the project, as that's where the error is thrown.\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that it's related to generically-typed classes, identifying these classes within the project can help narrow down the source of the problem. We would typically use `search_class` or `search_code` to look for clues like `TypeVar` or generic type annotations, but without knowing the exact class names or annotations used in the project, we'll need to look for common patterns or configurations that could lead to such an error.\n\nGiven the description of the problem, the following API calls can be considered relevant, but note that without specific class names or method names causing the issue, the search queries are formulated based on generic troubleshooting approaches for the described problem:\n\n- `search_code(\"TypeVar\")`: This would help identify where generic types are defined, which might be related to the issue if the bug is about how Sphinx processes these TypeVars.\n- `search_code(\"_make_subclass\")`: Since the error involves `_make_subclass`, finding its references could indicate custom handling or monkey patching related to the Sphinx Autodoc process.\n\nPlease execute these searches to gather preliminary context."
