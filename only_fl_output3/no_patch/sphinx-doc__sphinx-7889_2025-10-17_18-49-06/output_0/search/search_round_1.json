Since the issue is specifically related to building docs for a generically-typed class and the error occurs in `mock._make_subclass`, the following API calls can provide us with the required context:\n\n1. Searching through the codebase to find instances where generics are defined or used might give us a clue on what's causing the issue with Sphinx Autodoc. However, without a specific class name or method, a broad search might not be directly feasible. We'll focus on finding any custom implementation or specific mentions of `mock._make_subclass` related to the project, as that's where the error is thrown.\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that it's related to generically-typed classes, identifying these classes within the project can help narrow down the source of the problem. We would typically use `search_class` or `search_code` to look for clues like `TypeVar` or generic type annotations, but without knowing the exact class names or annotations used in the project, we'll need to look for common patterns or configurations that could lead to such an error.\n\nGiven the description of the problem, the following API calls can be considered relevant, but note that without specific class names or method names causing the issue, the search queries are formulated based on generic troubleshooting approaches for the described problem:\n\n- `search_code(\"TypeVar\")`: This would help identify where generic types are defined, which might be related to the issue if the bug is about how Sphinx processes these TypeVars.\n- `search_code(\"_make_subclass\")`: Since the error involves `_make_subclass`, finding its references could indicate custom handling or monkey patching related to the Sphinx Autodoc process.\n\nPlease execute these searches to gather preliminary context."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the two search results, we can start forming an understanding of the situation and how it might relate to the reported issue:\n\n### Analysis of `TypeVar` Search Results\n\nThe search for `TypeVar` returned 20 snippets scattered across five files in the Sphinx codebase, notably in:\n\n- `sphinx/transforms/i18n.py`\n- `sphinx/environment/collectors/toctree.py`\n- `sphinx/domains/cpp.py`\n- `sphinx/util/typing.py`\n- `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`\n\n#### Insights:\n\n1. **What do these parts of the code do?** These files likely involve Sphinx's internal handling of documentation structure (`toctree.py`), internationalization (`i18n.py`), C++ domain specifics (`cpp.py`), utility functions for typing (`typing.py`), and the autodoc extension's initialization and configuration (`__init__.py`). The presence of `TypeVar` in these files implies that Sphinx is utilizing Python's type annotations for generic typing, which could be related to how it processes types for documentation generation.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:** Since the issue occurs when Autodoc processes generically-typed classes and involves a `TypeError` with `TypeVar`, it's possible that the bug is related to how `TypeVar`s are handled or misrepresented in the documentation generation process, particularly in how autodoc interacts with these types.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior:** Ideally, Sphinx's Autodoc should correctly handle generically-typed classes, recognizing `TypeVar` definitions and correctly generating documentation without throwing a `TypeError`. This includes the ability to mock or subclass generic classes for documentation purposes without type conflicts.\n\n### Analysis of `_make_subclass` Search Results\n\nThe search for `_make_subclass` pointed directly to `sphinx/ext/autodoc/mock.py`, with five matches.\n\n#### Insights:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?** The `mock.py` module within the autodoc extension likely includes utilities for creating mock classes or objects during the documentation building process. `_make_subclass` specifically might be a function intended to dynamically create subclasses from given classes, including handling of generically-typed classes for documentation purposes.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:** The direct involvement of `_make_subclass` in the error message provided in the issue indicates that the function may not be correctly handling generically-typed classes, potentially misunderstanding `TypeVar` instances as something that can be concatenated with strings. This misunderstanding leads to the `TypeError`.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior:** The `_make_subclass` function is expected to correctly handle generic classes, including those with `TypeVar` annotations, allowing them to be mocked up or subclassed dynamically for the purpose of documentation generation. The function should detect and correctly manage the generic types without attempting invalid operations like concatenating `TypeVar` objects with strings.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the insights from the analysis, the next step would involve directly inspecting the implementation of `_make_subclass` in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/mock.py` to understand how it attempts to handle generically-typed classes and where it fails to do so correctly. A deeper dive into this method might reveal a misinterpretation or mishandling of `TypeVar` objects or reveal a missing check that leads to the observed `TypeError`.\n\nWe could also explore how generically-typed classes are represented or passed to `_make_subclass`, potentially in the files mentioned in the `TypeVar` search results, to see if there's a common pattern or anomaly in those interactions that could be contributing to the issue.\n\nTo move forward, examining the code around `_make_subclass` within `mock.py` would be a logical next step."

Since the issue arises from a `TypeError` when generically-typed classes are processed, the intended behavior here is to ensure that `_make_subclass` can correctly handle `TypeVar` objects without attempting operations that are not type-safe, such as concatenating `TypeVar` with strings.\n\nTo resolve the issue while preserving the existing functionality, `_make_subclass` should:\n\n- Correctly identify and handle `TypeVar` instances as part of type annotations on classes. This might involve checking for `TypeVar` instances specifically and ensuring they are treated in a manner consistent with their use in generic types, rather than as generic objects.\n- Implement robust type checking or type-safe operations when manipulating class names or annotations to avoid `TypeError`. This could involve ensuring that any string operations involving class names or types are only performed on actual strings or appropriately converted representations, not directly on `TypeVar` or other complex types.\n- Ensure that when creating mock subclasses of generically-typed classes, the mock functionality preserves type annotations so that the Autodoc extension can generate documentation that accurately reflects these types without error.\n\nThis adjustment should allow Sphinx's Autodoc extension to process documentation for generically-typed classes without running into type errors, thereby enabling documentation generation to proceed smoothly when generics are involved."
