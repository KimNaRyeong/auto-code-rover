Below is the `reproducer.py` script. This script tries to simulate the environment and actions described in your issue with Sphinx's Autodoc extension when dealing with generic-typed classes. It attempts to dynamically create a generically-typed class, document it using Sphinx (with Autodoc enabled) programmatically, and catches the `TypeError` related to the issue you're describing. If the issue still persists with the Sphinx and extensions' versions you've provided, it will print the stack trace of the error. If the script succeeds, it indicates the issue might have been fixed in the versions being used.

    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

### Instructions for using `reproducer.py`:

1. Place `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your Sphinx documentation project.
2. Ensure you have Sphinx and required extensions installed in your environment. The code above presumes Sphinx is accessible in the current Python environment.
3. Run `python3 reproducer.py` from the command line.
4. If the issue is present, the script will print a stack trace of where the `TypeError` occurred.
5. If the issue has been fixed, the script will complete successfully, and you'll see a message stating "Documentation built successfully. The issue might have been fixed."

This script creates a minimal Sphinx project with a configuration (`conf.py`) and an index file (`index.rst`). It dynamically generates a Python module (`test_module.py`) containing a generic-typed class, mimicking the structure in your original bug report. The script then attempts to build the Sphinx documentation, which will trigger Autodoc and potentially replicate the reported issue.
