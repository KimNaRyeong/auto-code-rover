        "intended_behavior": "The `filter` method needs to be enhanced to support expressions within its calls. This enhancement involves interpreting expressions passed to `filter`, such as those created with the `F` object and operation expressions (e.g., `F('some_field').lower() == 'anssi'`). This will likely require parsing these expressions to generate the corresponding SQL code. The key is to do so while preserving the existing functionality for simple key-value pair filtering. The method must remain compatible with previous use cases where no expressions are used."

        "intended_behavior": "The `F` class and related expression classes might need to be modified or extended to better support complex expression parsing and compilation, particularly for cases where method calls or operations (like `.lower()`) are involved. While `resolve_expression` exists, there may need to be enhancements or additional methods to handle the new types of expressions described in the issue. Specifically, the `F` class should provide a clear way to compile or resolve expressions into a format that the `filter` method can understand and convert into SQL. This might involve introducing a method or enhancing existing ones to cater to this expanded functionality."
