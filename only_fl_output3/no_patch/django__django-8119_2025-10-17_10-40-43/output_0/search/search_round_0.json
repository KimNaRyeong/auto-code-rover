        "content": "To address the issue of allowing expressions in `.filter()` calls, it's necessary to understand how the `.filter()` method is implemented and where it resides in the codebase. Typically, for an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system (which this seems to be about, given the reference to a `.filter()` method and ORM experience), `.filter()` methods are part of query builder interfaces or classes that construct database queries from object-oriented syntax. Here are the steps I would take using the search APIs to gather the needed context:\n\n1. **Find where `.filter()` is defined:** Since `.filter()` is a common method name in ORM classes for filtering query results, I would start by searching for the method definition in the entire codebase. This can help identify which class or module we need to focus on.\n   \n   - `search_method(\"filter\")`\n\n2. **Search for query expression classes:** The issue mentions allowing expressions such as `F('some_field').lower() == 'anssi'` within `.filter()` calls. This implies there are likely classes that represent these query expressions (like `F`). Understanding these classes will be crucial for implementing the enhancement.\n   \n   - `search_class(\"F\")`\n   \n3. **Examine how expressions are currently handled:** To extend the functionality of `.filter()` to support expressions, it\u2019s important to see how expressions are currently processed. If there's an existing method that evaluates or compiles expressions to SQL or a query language, that's a good starting point.\n   \n   - `search_method_in_class(\"compile_expression\", \"F\")` (assuming `F` is a class responsible for field expressions).\n\nBased on the issue description, these API calls should provide a solid foundation for understanding the current implementation of `.filter()` and expression handling within the ORM. With this information, we can then start planning how to extend `.filter()` to support more complex expressions."
