(See django.contrib.admin.options.ModelAdmin response_add as just one example)\nI have been able to correct this specific issue by replacing the above line with:\nurl = reverse(\nurl_name,\nargs=[quote(remote_obj.pk)],\ncurrent_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name\n)\nHowever, I don't know if there are any side effects and I have not yet run the full suite of tests on this.

Given the information in the issue, the following API calls will be necessary:\n\n1. Search for the `get_admin_url` method to understand where and how it is implemented:\n   - `search_method(\"get_admin_url\")`\n\n2. Since the issue involves modifying the implementation of `get_admin_url` to include a `current_app` parameter based on the admin site name, we should also understand where `get_admin_url` is called and how the `model_admin.admin_site.name` is set and used throughout the codebase:\n   - `search_code(\"model_admin.admin_site.name\")`\n\n3. Given that the fix involves Django's URL reverse mechanism and it's crucial to ensure there are no side effects of the modification, getting context on `reverse` within the admin system could be useful:\n   - `search_method(\"reverse\")`\n\n4. Furthermore, understanding how `ModelAdmin.response_add` uses `current_app` could provide insights on correctly applying a similar strategy to `get_admin_url`:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"response_add\", \"ModelAdmin\")`\n\n5. It might also be valuable to see if there are any direct references to `/admin/` in the code, which should instead dynamically use the admin site's root path:\n   - `search_code(\"/admin/\")`\n\nThese API calls will help piece together how `get_admin_url` works within the context of custom admin sites, how `current_app` is utilized across the admin system, and confirm if the proposed modification aligns with existing patterns and practices in Django's admin framework."

It includes dynamic URL generation with consideration for the admin site (`current_app=self.admin_site.name`).\n  - **Relation to the bug:** Provides a clear example of the intended pattern for using `current_app` to ensure URLs are correct for custom admin site instances.\n  - **Intended behavior:** `get_admin_url` should follow this pattern, ensuring that links on readonly ForeignKey fields in custom admin sites point to the correct URLs.\n\n### 5. `/admin/` path snippets\n- **Found in:** Various files, including widgets and tests.\n- **Analysis:**\n  - Hardcoded mentions of the `/admin/` path might indicate areas of the Django admin not adequately adjusting for custom admin site paths or demonstrating the default behavior.\n  - **Relation to the bug:** While not directly related to the `get_admin_url` function, these occurrences emphasize the necessity of dynamic path handling within the admin site framework.\n  - **Intended behavior:** Although not all instances may be relevant to fixing the bug, the general intention across Django admin should be to avoid hardcoded paths in favor of dynamically generated URLs that respect the current admin site context.\n\n---\nGiven this analysis, the next steps towards resolving the issue would involve ensuring `get_admin_url` incorporates a dynamic way to generate URLs that respect the current admin site context, similar to other parts of Django admin that correctly use the `current_app` parameter. This aligns with the suggested fix in the issue description but requires comprehensive testing to avoid side effects."
