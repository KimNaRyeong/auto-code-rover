(See django.contrib.admin.options.ModelAdmin response_add as just one example)\nI have been able to correct this specific issue by replacing the above line with:\nurl = reverse(\nurl_name,\nargs=[quote(remote_obj.pk)],\ncurrent_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name\n)\nHowever, I don't know if there are any side effects and I have not yet run the full suite of tests on this. Mostly looking for feedback whether I'm on the right track.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To get sufficient context for resolving the issue reported, it's important to understand how `get_admin_url` is used and implemented within Django's admin system, as well as gather information on how the admin site name is determined and used throughout. Given the information in the issue, the following API calls will be necessary:\n\n1. Search for the `get_admin_url` method to understand where and how it is implemented:\n   - `search_method(\"get_admin_url\")`\n\n2. Since the issue involves modifying the implementation of `get_admin_url` to include a `current_app` parameter based on the admin site name, we should also understand where `get_admin_url` is called and how the `model_admin.admin_site.name` is set and used throughout the codebase:\n   - `search_code(\"model_admin.admin_site.name\")`\n\n3. Given that the fix involves Django's URL reverse mechanism and it's crucial to ensure there are no side effects of the modification, getting context on `reverse` within the admin system could be useful:\n   - `search_method(\"reverse\")`\n\n4. Furthermore, understanding how `ModelAdmin.response_add` uses `current_app` could provide insights on correctly applying a similar strategy to `get_admin_url`:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"response_add\", \"ModelAdmin\")`\n\n5. It might also be valuable to see if there are any direct references to `/admin/` in the code, which should instead dynamically use the admin site's root path:\n   - `search_code(\"/admin/\")`\n\nThese API calls will help piece together how `get_admin_url` works within the context of custom admin sites, how `current_app` is utilized across the admin system, and confirm if the proposed modification aligns with existing patterns and practices in Django's admin framework."
