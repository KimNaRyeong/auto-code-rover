Verify if a migration listed in the django_migrations table still exists as a file or is part of a squashed migration (considering the replaces attribute). This could involve leveraging existing attributes or methods related to migration discovery and including a check against the django_migrations table to ensure only migrations that physically exist or are logically valid (replaced by a squashed migration) are applied. 2. Ensure that if a migration is deemed nonexistent but recorded as applied, it should be either flagged for further action (like manual removal or notification to the user) or automatically handled in a manner that maintains database integrity and avoids the previously described 'name collision' issue."

        "intended_behavior": "Enhance this method to: 1. Before recording a new migration as applied, check if its name potentially conflicts with any previously applied but now-nonexistent (file-deleted) migrations. This isn't purely about string matching but should consider the semantic naming conflicts that could arise from Django's migration naming conventions. 2. If a conflict is detected, the method should either prevent the recording of the new migration (throwing an error or warning) or, more sophisticated, handle the cleanup of outdated migration records under specific, safe conditions."

Iterate through the django_migrations table records and compare them against the existing migration files and the replaces attribute in any squashed migrations. 2. Identify and handle discrepancies where a record exists for a migration that has no corresponding file or is not accounted for in a replaces attribute, doing so in a way that preserves the integrity of the migration history and the state of the database schema. 3. This method could be called at strategic points within the migration application process (perhaps as part of the initial checks in migrate or apply_migration) to ensure the accuracy of the django_migrations table before proceeding with applying new migrations."
