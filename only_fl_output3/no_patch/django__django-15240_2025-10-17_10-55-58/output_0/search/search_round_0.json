        "content": "<issue>Delete nonexistent migrations from django_migrations table\nDescription\nDjango adds a django_migrations table to the database which list all of the migrations that have been applied (and when).\nWith the introduction of squashmigrations, it is possible for this table to contain a lot of old migrations that no longer exist. This can be problematic if naming duplication occurs:\nExample:\nI have an app with:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial.py\n0002_blah.py\n0003_blah.py\nI squash and delete replaced migrations:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial_squashed_0003_blah.py\nI create a new migration and use poor naming:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial_squashed_0003_blah.py\n0002_blah.py\nMy new migration never runs because the django_migrations table thinks it has already been applied.\nI propose truncation of the django_migrations table so that it includes only migrations that actually exist in the django project. This could be done automatically (when executor runs, or inside the migrate mcommand). Or have its own mcommand that requires it be run manually. I prefer the automatic approach though.\nPros:\nCleans up old data that just bloats the database.\nProtects users from the trap mentioned above where a new migration is created with the same name as one that was applied in the past.\nCons:\nA loss of historical information.\nNote:\nNeed to be careful with implementation to avoid a possible new trap if a user squashes migrations and then proceeds to delete the replaced migrations before running the squashed migrations on their database -> django will think squashed migrations haven't been applied and will attempt to reapply them. This can be remedied simply by not removing migrations mentioned in replaces lists of other migrations from django_migrations (ie. we'd consider replaced migrations as still existing, even if their actual files have already been removed).\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to find and modify the parts of the Django codebase that deal with migration handling, especially where migrations are recorded and how they are detected for application.\n\n1. **Migrations Table Handling**: We need to understand how Django interacts with the `django_migrations` table during migration operations. The best place to start is likely in the migration executor or the command that runs migrations.\n\n2. **Squash Migrations**: Understanding how squashed migrations are handled will be key, especially how they interact with the `django_migrations` table. We need to find where squashed migrations are recorded and how Django determines whether a migration has been applied or not.\n\n3. **Migration Application Detection**: Lastly, how Django detects whether a migration needs to be applied, given the existence of a corresponding entry in the `django_migrations` table, is crucial.\n\nLet's make specific API calls to get more context around these areas:\n\n- `search_class(\"MigrationExecutor\")`: The `MigrationExecutor` class likely handles the application of migrations and may interact with the `django_migrations` table.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"apply_migration\", \"MigrationExecutor\")`: To understand how individual migration applications are processed and recorded.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"record_unapplied_migrations\", \"MigrationExecutor\")`: This method name is speculative but searching for something similar could help find how migrations not applied yet are handled.\n- `search_class(\"Migration\")`: To get more details on how migration files are represented within Django and if there's specific handling for squashed migrations.\n- `search_method(\"detect_soft_applied\")`: This method, if it exists, might be responsible for determining if a migration has been effectively applied, which could be relevant in the context of squashed migrations.\n- `search_code(\"replaces =\")`: As squashed migrations use the \"replaces\" attribute to reference the migrations they replace, understanding how this attribute is used could be key.\n\nThese API calls are aimed at gathering sufficient context around how migrations are applied, tracked, and how squashed migrations interact with the `django_migrations` table."
