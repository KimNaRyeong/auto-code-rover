        "content": "<issue>Delete nonexistent migrations from django_migrations table\nDescription\nDjango adds a django_migrations table to the database which list all of the migrations that have been applied (and when).\nWith the introduction of squashmigrations, it is possible for this table to contain a lot of old migrations that no longer exist. This can be problematic if naming duplication occurs:\nExample:\nI have an app with:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial.py\n0002_blah.py\n0003_blah.py\nI squash and delete replaced migrations:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial_squashed_0003_blah.py\nI create a new migration and use poor naming:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial_squashed_0003_blah.py\n0002_blah.py\nMy new migration never runs because the django_migrations table thinks it has already been applied.\nI propose truncation of the django_migrations table so that it includes only migrations that actually exist in the django project. This could be done automatically (when executor runs, or inside the migrate mcommand). Or have its own mcommand that requires it be run manually. I prefer the automatic approach though.\nPros:\nCleans up old data that just bloats the database.\nProtects users from the trap mentioned above where a new migration is created with the same name as one that was applied in the past.\nCons:\nA loss of historical information.\nNote:\nNeed to be careful with implementation to avoid a possible new trap if a user squashes migrations and then proceeds to delete the replaced migrations before running the squashed migrations on their database -> django will think squashed migrations haven't been applied and will attempt to reapply them. This can be remedied simply by not removing migrations mentioned in replaces lists of other migrations from django_migrations (ie. we'd consider replaced migrations as still existing, even if their actual files have already been removed).\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to find and modify the parts of the Django codebase that deal with migration handling, especially where migrations are recorded and how they are detected for application.\n\n1. **Migrations Table Handling**: We need to understand how Django interacts with the `django_migrations` table during migration operations. The best place to start is likely in the migration executor or the command that runs migrations.\n\n2. **Squash Migrations**: Understanding how squashed migrations are handled will be key, especially how they interact with the `django_migrations` table. We need to find where squashed migrations are recorded and how Django determines whether a migration has been applied or not.\n\n3. **Migration Application Detection**: Lastly, how Django detects whether a migration needs to be applied, given the existence of a corresponding entry in the `django_migrations` table, is crucial.\n\nLet's make specific API calls to get more context around these areas:\n\n- `search_class(\"MigrationExecutor\")`: The `MigrationExecutor` class likely handles the application of migrations and may interact with the `django_migrations` table.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"apply_migration\", \"MigrationExecutor\")`: To understand how individual migration applications are processed and recorded.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"record_unapplied_migrations\", \"MigrationExecutor\")`: This method name is speculative but searching for something similar could help find how migrations not applied yet are handled.\n- `search_class(\"Migration\")`: To get more details on how migration files are represented within Django and if there's specific handling for squashed migrations.\n- `search_method(\"detect_soft_applied\")`: This method, if it exists, might be responsible for determining if a migration has been effectively applied, which could be relevant in the context of squashed migrations.\n- `search_code(\"replaces =\")`: As squashed migrations use the \"replaces\" attribute to reference the migrations they replace, understanding how this attribute is used could be key.\n\nThese API calls are aimed at gathering sufficient context around how migrations are applied, tracked, and how squashed migrations interact with the `django_migrations` table."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context in relation to the posed issue of deleting nonexistent migrations from the `django_migrations` table, let's break down the findings:\n\n### 1. `MigrationExecutor` and its Methods\n\n- **What it does**: The `MigrationExecutor` class in Django is central to managing and applying migrations. It includes methods for applying migrations (`apply_migration`), recording their application (`record_migration`), and detecting if a migration has been \"soft applied\" (`detect_soft_applied`), among others. These functions interact directly with the database schema and the `django_migrations` table.\n\n- **Relation to the bug**: The issue arises because the `django_migrations` table can contain records of migrations that no longer exist as files in the project after squashing. This can prevent new migrations with conflicting names from being applied. The `MigrationExecutor` methods, especially `apply_migration` and `detect_soft_applied`, are directly involved in checking migration status and applying migrations, which is where logic could potentially be introduced to verify the existence of migration files before considering them as applied.\n\n- **Intended behavior**: Ideally, `MigrationExecutor` should have a way to validate that migrations listed as applied in the `django_migrations` table have corresponding migration files in the project. If a migration file doesn't exist (and isn't accounted for by a squashed migration's `replaces` attribute), it might be deemed as unapplied or removed from the table, depending on the safest approach to take.\n\n### 2. `Migration` Class and `detect_soft_applied` Method\n\n- **What it does**: The `Migration` class represents a migration within Django. The `detect_soft_applied` method checks if the changes a migration would make already exist in the database, indicating the migration doesn't need to be applied. This method mainly looks for table creations (`CreateModel`) or field additions (`AddField`).\n\n- **Relation to the bug**: The bug's relation to `detect_soft_applied` is indirect. This method's logic highlights how Django can infer whether a migration has been applied based on database state rather than just the presence of a record in `django_migrations`. Enhancements here might not directly solve the issue but understanding its logic helps to consider how Django determines a migration's application state.\n\n- **Intended behavior**: The method's approach to determining if a migration has been applied could be a part of the solution. Extending this logic to consider the actual existence of migration files or leveraging the `replaces` attribute in squashed migrations might be necessary. The goal would be to ensure that the database's state and the project's migration files are in sync regarding what has been applied.\n\n### 3. Usage of `replaces =`\n\n- **What it does**: The `replaces` attribute in migration files is used by squashed migrations to list the migrations they encompass. This allows Django to understand which migrations are replaced by a squashed migration.\n\n- **Relation to the bug**: Directly related. The issue of old, replaced migrations still being considered as applied by Django because they're listed in `django_migrations` can lead to conflicts. Understanding how `replaces` is used helps in devising a way to ensure the database reflects only those migrations that are current.\n\n- **Intended behavior**: When dealing with squashed migrations, Django should consider the `replaces` attribute to effectively ignore (or remove) replaced migrations from `django_migrations`, assuming the squashed migration is successfully applied. This would prevent the problem of \"migration name collision\" and the subsequent failure of new migrations that share names with old, replaced ones.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nThe analysis points to a need for enhancing the way Django's migration system handles squashed migrations and the records in the `django_migrations` table. A mechanism could be introduced in `MigrationExecutor` or a related component that cross-references migration records with actual migration files, taking into account the `replaces` attribute of squashed migrations. This would address the issue of name conflicts preventing the application of new migrations.\n\nGiven this context, next steps might involve:\n1. Proposing or implementing logic in `MigrationExecutor.migrate` or `apply_migration` to verify migration file existence against the `django_migrations` table records before applying a migration.\n2. Adjusting the logic used by `detect_soft_applied` or a similar method to consider the `replaces` attribute of squashed migrations, ensuring only relevant migrations are marked as applied.\n3. Ensuring that any removal of records from `django_migrations` is safe and doesn't inadvertently suggest that unapplied migrations have been applied, especially considering the nuances of squashed migrations."

Verify if a migration listed in the `django_migrations` table still exists as a file or is part of a squashed migration (considering the `replaces` attribute). This could involve leveraging existing attributes or methods related to migration discovery and including a check against the `django_migrations` table to ensure only migrations that physically exist or are logically valid (replaced by a squashed migration) are applied.\n  2. Ensure that if a migration is deemed nonexistent but recorded as applied, it should be either flagged for further action (like manual removal or notification to the user) or automatically handled in a manner that maintains database integrity and avoids the previously described \"name collision\" issue.\n\n#### Location 2:\n- **File**: `django/db/migrations/executor.py`\n- **Class**: `MigrationExecutor`\n- **Method**: `record_migration`\n\n- **Intended Behavior**: Enhance this method to:\n  1. Before recording a new migration as applied, check if its name potentially conflicts with any previously applied but now-nonexistent (file-deleted) migrations. This isn't purely about string matching but should consider the semantic naming conflicts that could arise from Django's migration naming conventions.\n  2. If a conflict is detected, the method should either prevent the recording of the new migration (throwing an error or warning) or, more sophisticated, handle the cleanup of outdated migration records under specific, safe conditions.\n\n#### New Method Suggestion:\n\nInstead of directly modifying the existing methods for a hotfix, it might be prudent to introduce a new method within the `MigrationExecutor` class that is specifically tasked with validating migration records against the filesystem and squashed migrations metadata. This allows for a modular approach that can be invoked by `apply_migration`, `record_migration`, or other methods as needed without conflating their primary responsibilities.\n\n- **File**: `django/db/migrations/executor.py`\n- **Class**: `MigrationExecutor`\n\n- **Intended Behavior**: A new method, potentially named `validate_migration_records`, should:\n  1. Iterate through the `django_migrations` table records and compare them against the existing migration files and the `replaces` attribute in any squashed migrations.\n  2. Identify and handle discrepancies where a record exists for a migration that has no corresponding file or is not accounted for in a `replaces` attribute, doing so in a way that preserves the integrity of the migration history and the state of the database schema.\n  3. This method could be called at strategic points within the migration application process (perhaps as part of the initial checks in `migrate` or `apply_migration`) to ensure the accuracy of the `django_migrations` table before proceeding with applying new migrations."
