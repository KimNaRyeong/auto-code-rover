        "intended_behavior": "The main class documentation and the `__init__` documentation should include details on how `QuantileTransformer` implements quantile transformation. It should explain that for both dense and sparse matrices, `QuantileTransformer` computes empirical quantiles based on the input data. For dense matrices, this might involve subsampling for efficiency. For sparse matrices, the implementation carefully considers non-zero elements to compute quantiles efficiently while handling implicit zeros based on the `ignore_implicit_zeros` parameter. The documentation should also clarify how these quantiles are then used to map the data to the desired distribution (uniform or normal) by applying a transformation that closely aligns with calculating the empirical CDF or its inverse."

        "intended_behavior": "Detailed documentation within these methods should explain: The role of `fit` in computing the necessary quantiles for transformation, including how quantiles are derived from the data. How `_dense_fit` operates on dense matrices and the importance of subsampling and computing nanpercentiles. The adaptation of `_sparse_fit` for sparse matrices, highlighting how it deals with non-zero elements and efficiency considerations. The functionality of `_transform` in applying the computed quantiles to transform data to the desired distribution, detailing both forward and inverse transformations. This should tie back to the theoretical grounding of the transformation process, emphasizing its practical application in data preprocessing."
