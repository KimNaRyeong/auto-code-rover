The `parser.add_argument` function should be used to add a new option `--skip-checks` with `action='store_true'` to indicate that system checks can be optionally skipped. This preserves the existing functionality of the command by adding an optional argument."

        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `handle` method to bypass the system checks if the `--skip-checks` option is provided by the user. This involves conditionally checking for the presence of this option and, if set, skipping the part of the logic where system checks are performed. The existing functionality for starting the server must remain unaffected; only the preliminary system checks should be conditionally bypassed based on the argument's presence. This ensures the fast reloads for development as requested in the issue, without altering the command's behavior when the option is not used."
