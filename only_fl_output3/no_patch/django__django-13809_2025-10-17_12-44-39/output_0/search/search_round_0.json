        "content": "To address the issue of adding a `--skip-checks` option to the `runserver` command in a Django project, we need to first find where the `runserver` command is implemented in the Django codebase. The `runserver` command is a management command, and its behavior is defined in a command class that extends Django's base command class. Therefore, we need to find the class responsible for the `runserver` command and any methods that are likely to be involved in processing command-line options or executing the server with or without checks.\n\nTo start, let's use these API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Command\")` - Since Django's management commands are classes that extend from a base class, often named `Command`, this search might help us find where management command classes are defined or used.\n2. `search_method(\"add_arguments\")` - This method is commonly overridden in Django management command classes to add additional arguments to the command. Finding its occurrences may lead us to the `runserver` command's implementation.\n3. `search_method(\"handle\")` - This is another method often implemented by Django management command classes, where the command's logic is executed. Finding `handle` methods can also help find where the `runserver` logic is implemented.\n4. `search_code(\"--skip-checks\")` - Since this feature does not yet exist, this search won't find existing uses but is performed to ensure there is no similar implementation or argument already in the codebase that we might conflict with or could reuse.\n\nThese searches should give us a good starting point by locating the relevant files, classes, and methods related to the `runserver` command and how command-line arguments are handled in Django."
