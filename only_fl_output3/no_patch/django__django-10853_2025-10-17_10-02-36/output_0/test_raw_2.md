To address your request correctly, the `reproducer.py` script will be designed to explicitly check the SQLite version at runtime and attempt to execute a window function query. If the SQLite version is below 3.25.0, the window function will not be supported, and we should expect to catch an `sqlite3.OperationalError`. The script will use an assertion to distinguish between an environment where the issue is present (SQLite version < 3.25.0 without window functions support) and an environment where the issue should no longer exist (SQLite version ≥ 3.25.0 with window functions support). Here’s how you can design `reproducer.py`:

```python
# reproducer.py
import sqlite3
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_sqlite_version():
    conn = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("select sqlite_version();")
    version = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    conn.close()
    major, minor, _ = map(int, version.split('.'))
    return (major, minor)

def run_test():
    major, minor = check_sqlite_version()
    assert major > 3 or (major == 3 and minor >= 25), "SQLite version must be at least 3.25.0 to support window functions."

    # Continuing to execute window functions since the version check passed
    conn = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
    try:
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE t0(x INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, y TEXT)")
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (1, 'aaa'), (2, 'ccc'), (3, 'bbb')")
        cursor.execute("SELECT x, y, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY y) AS row_number FROM t0 ORDER BY x")
    except sqlite3.OperationalError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("SQLite version supports window functions, but the query failed.") from e
    finally:
        conn.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        run_test()
        print("Test passed: SQLite version supports window functions, and query executed successfully.")
    except AssertionError:
        # Handling failed test execution, where AssertionError indicates the presence of the issue.
        # Printing stack trace is handled within the `run_test` function
        sys.exit(0)  # Exiting with code 0 to align with requirements.
```

This script first checks the SQLite version installed with the Python `sqlite3` module. If the version is lower than 3.25.0, an `AssertionError` is raised immediately, identifying the environment as one where the issue (lack of window functions support) is present. If the assertion passes, it proceeds to execute the window function query. Catching an `OperationalError` at this stage and raising an `AssertionError` takes into account unexpected errors related to window functions support in environments that theoretically should support such queries (SQLite ≥ 3.25.0).

This approach uses the assertion mechanism to differentiate environments, handling both the reproduction of the issue and the validation of the fix based on the SQLite version. Exiting with code 0 after catching an `AssertionError` ensures the script meets the requirement for how it should behave when the issue is detected.
