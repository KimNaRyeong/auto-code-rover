        "content": "Here is an issue:\n\nSQLite (pre 3.25.0) does not support window functions, raises OperationalError\nDescription\n\t\nWindow functions are supported in SQLite 3.25.0 and newer, but Python 3.6.7 and 3.7.1 only ships with SQLite 3.21.0. Window function syntax is invalid for older versions.\nAs per the title, window functions therefore aren't supported, but Django doesn't check the SQLite version or availability of window functions. Instead, when the generated SQL is executed, the sqlite3 Python library raises the SQLite syntax error as sqlite3.OperationalError, which in turn is reraised as django.db.utils.OperationalError.\nI believe this is not intended behaviour, as it is incredibly confusing, and not documented. Typically, if a database feature is not supported, Django will explicitly raise an error when attempting it, rather than allowing the SQL execution to fail. It is also normally documented.\nThe following code raises an exception (it should work for any model):\nfrom django.db.models import F, Window\nfrom django.db.models.functions.window import RowNumber\n# import the model\nMyModel.objects.annotate(rn=Window(expression=RowNumber(), order_by=[F('pk')]))\nBasic Python code that will also raise sqlite3.OperationalError:\nimport sqlite3\nconn = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")\nc = conn.cursor()\nc.execute(\"CREATE TABLE t0(x INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, y TEXT)\")\nc.execute(\"INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (1, 'aaa'), (2, 'ccc'), (3, 'bbb')\")\nc.execute(\"SELECT x, y, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY y) AS row_number FROM t0 ORDER BY x\")\nTested on master branch (commit c5568340a525ab9c6898ed02c257394cc47285d7) with Python 3.6.6 64-bit (Windows 10 x64). This likely also affects 2.0 and 2.1 branches.\n"

Below is an updated version of `reproducer.py` designed to explicitly check for the presence of the issue and react accordingly. This script attempts to execute a window function using SQLite. If SQLite's version is below 3.25.0, it will indeed lead to an `sqlite3.OperationalError` due to lack of support for window functions. We handle this case to ensure we reproduce the issue accurately.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\nimport sqlite3\nimport sys\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef run_test():\n    conn = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")\n    try:\n        cursor = conn.cursor()\n        cursor.execute(\"CREATE TABLE t0(x INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, y TEXT)\")\n        cursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (1, 'aaa'), (2, 'ccc'), (3, 'bbb')\")\n        # Attempt to use window function which is not supported in SQLite versions before 3.25.0\n        cursor.execute(\"SELECT x, y, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY y) AS row_number FROM t0 ORDER BY x\")\n    except sqlite3.OperationalError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        return False  # Indicate that the test failed due to an operational error (expected behavior for SQLite < 3.25.0)\n    finally:\n        conn.close()\n    return True  # Indicate that the test passed and the issue is fixed if no exception was thrown\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    if run_test():\n        print(\"Test passed: Your SQLite version supports window functions.\")\n        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate that the issue is fixed\n    else:\n        # Exit with code 0 even when the issue is present, as per user request,\n        # but the presence of the issue is indicated by not passing the test.\n        sys.exit(0)\n```\n\nThis script focuses on directly executing a SQL query that uses window functions and handling any potential `sqlite3.OperationalError` exceptions. The use of the window function will raise an exception in SQLite versions below 3.25.0, which is caught and handled to print a detailed stack trace. Exiting with code 0 regardless of the result aligns with the updated requirement."
