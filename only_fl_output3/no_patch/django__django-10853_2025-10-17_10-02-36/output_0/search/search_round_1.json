        "content": "<issue>SQLite (pre 3.25.0) does not support window functions, raises OperationalError\nDescription\nWindow functions are supported in SQLite 3.25.0 and newer, but Python 3.6.7 and 3.7.1 only ships with SQLite 3.21.0. Window function syntax is invalid for older versions.\nAs per the title, window functions therefore aren't supported, but Django doesn't check the SQLite version or availability of window functions. Instead, when the generated SQL is executed, the sqlite3 Python library raises the SQLite syntax error as sqlite3.OperationalError, which in turn is reraised as django.db.utils.OperationalError.\nI believe this is not intended behaviour, as it is incredibly confusing, and not documented. Typically, if a database feature is not supported, Django will explicitly raise an error when attempting it, rather than allowing the SQL execution to fail. It is also normally documented.\nThe following code raises an exception (it should work for any model):\nfrom django.db.models import F, Window\nfrom django.db.models.functions.window import RowNumber\n# import the model\nMyModel.objects.annotate(rn=Window(expression=RowNumber(), order_by=[F('pk')]))\nBasic Python code that will also raise sqlite3.OperationalError:\nimport sqlite3\nconn = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")\nc = conn.cursor()\nc.execute(\"CREATE TABLE t0(x INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, y TEXT)\")\nc.execute(\"INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (1, 'aaa'), (2, 'ccc'), (3, 'bbb')\")\nc.execute(\"SELECT x, y, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY y) AS row_number FROM t0 ORDER BY x\")\nTested on master branch (commit c5568340a525ab9c6898ed02c257394cc47285d7) with Python 3.6.6 64-bit (Windows 10 x64). This likely also affects 2.0 and 2.1 branches.\n</issue>"

The part of Django that handles database operations, specifically for SQLite.\n2. The error handling mechanism for when an unsupported SQL operation is attempted.\n3. The mechanism Django uses to decide what database features are supported.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls would be beneficial to get the necessary code context:\n\n- We need to find out where Django checks SQLite version or feature support. This might not be in a straightforward method related to version checking but rather in the initial setup or configuration for a SQLite database connection. Hence, it'd be useful to search for SQLite-related setup or configuration code:\n  - `search_code(\"sqlite3.connect\")`\n  - `search_code(\"SQLite version\")`\n\n- Since the issue points out a problem with window functions and how Django interacts with SQLite, it's pertinent to look into how Django processes and executes queries, especially those involving window functions:\n  - `search_class(\"DatabaseWrapper\")`\n  - `search_method(\"create_connection\")`\n  - `search_method_in_class(\"execute\", \"DatabaseWrapper\")`\n\n- Given that Django should ideally throw an error when an unsupported database feature is attempted, we might need to understand how errors are being handled or raised within the codebase:\n  - `search_code(\"raise django.db.utils.OperationalError\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for understanding the issue at hand and developing a fix."

        "content": "From the information collected, we have identified a few key points and next steps for further investigation:\n\n1. The lack of direct hits on `sqlite3.connect` and `SQLite version` within the codebase suggests that Django may not explicitly check the SQLite version at the point of establishing a connection. This could imply that there's no direct handling or inspection of SQLite features (like window functions) based on the version within Django's initialization or setup code for SQLite connections.\n\n2. The result for `DatabaseWrapper` classes across different backends including SQLite suggests that Django employs a uniform interface (`DatabaseWrapper`) for interacting with different database backends. The `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py` file is the most relevant to our issue and is likely where the connection setup and query execution are abstracted for SQLite. Given the uniform interface across database backends, it's plausible that specific feature support (like window functions) is handled in a generic manner rather than explicitly checked against each database's version. This could lead to the observed issue when unsupported SQL syntax for a database version is used without prior detection.\n\n3. The failure to find specific methods such as `create_connection` or `execute` within the `DatabaseWrapper` class or exceptions related to `raise django.db.utils.OperationalError` in the codebase indicates that these operations may be abstracted differently or managed under different method names or paths. This highlights a potential gap in understanding exactly how connections are managed and how errors are propagated within Django's database backend framework, particularly for the SQLite backend.\n\n4. Given the issue description and the current findings, the intended behavior would involve Django:\n   - Identifying the capabilities of the SQLite version in use, especially regarding support for window functions.\n   - Proactively preventing the usage of unsupported features through early detection, or at least providing clearer, more informative errors when such attempts are made.\n\nIn light of these findings and conclusions, the following steps are suggested for a deeper investigation:\n\n- Explore the initialization and configuration of the SQLite backend in Django to understand where and how the database connection is established:\n  - `search_method_in_file(\"get_new_connection\", \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py\")`\n\n- Investigate how feature support checks are implemented (or not) for SQLite within Django. It's also possible these checks occur in a more indirect manner, such as through feature flags or exceptions upon usage rather than upfront checks:\n  - `search_code_in_file(\"features\", \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py\")`\n\n- Understand how Django raises and handles exceptions specifically for the SQLite backend, which might give clues on how to insert a version check or feature support check before executing queries that could lead to an `OperationalError`:\n  - `search_method_in_file(\"check_constraints\", \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py\")`\n  - `search_code_in_file(\"OperationalError\", \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py\")`\n\nBy examining these areas within the codebase, we can gather more context on how Django interacts with SQLite, potentially uncovering where and how to implement a fix for the reported issue."

Based on the version check, Django should map the availability of window functions to a feature flag within the SQLite backend's `features` attribute. If an attempt is made to use window functions and the SQLite version is identified to be less than 3.25.0, Django should raise a clear, user-friendly error before attempting to execute the SQL. This preserves existing functionalities for database features that are supported across different SQLite versions while preventing confusing `OperationalError` messages for unsupported features.\n\nBy implementing these intended behaviors, Django would not only prevent the execution of incompatible SQL on versions of SQLite that do not support window functions but also align with Django's practice of providing clear, actionable errors for unsupported database features."
