        "content": "<issue>SQLite (pre 3.25.0) does not support window functions, raises OperationalError\nDescription\nWindow functions are supported in SQLite 3.25.0 and newer, but Python 3.6.7 and 3.7.1 only ships with SQLite 3.21.0. Window function syntax is invalid for older versions.\nAs per the title, window functions therefore aren't supported, but Django doesn't check the SQLite version or availability of window functions. Instead, when the generated SQL is executed, the sqlite3 Python library raises the SQLite syntax error as sqlite3.OperationalError, which in turn is reraised as django.db.utils.OperationalError.\nI believe this is not intended behaviour, as it is incredibly confusing, and not documented. Typically, if a database feature is not supported, Django will explicitly raise an error when attempting it, rather than allowing the SQL execution to fail. It is also normally documented.\nThe following code raises an exception (it should work for any model):\nfrom django.db.models import F, Window\nfrom django.db.models.functions.window import RowNumber\n# import the model\nMyModel.objects.annotate(rn=Window(expression=RowNumber(), order_by=[F('pk')]))\nBasic Python code that will also raise sqlite3.OperationalError:\nimport sqlite3\nconn = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")\nc = conn.cursor()\nc.execute(\"CREATE TABLE t0(x INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, y TEXT)\")\nc.execute(\"INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (1, 'aaa'), (2, 'ccc'), (3, 'bbb')\")\nc.execute(\"SELECT x, y, row_number() OVER (ORDER BY y) AS row_number FROM t0 ORDER BY x\")\nTested on master branch (commit c5568340a525ab9c6898ed02c257394cc47285d7) with Python 3.6.6 64-bit (Windows 10 x64). This likely also affects 2.0 and 2.1 branches.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the reported issue regarding SQLite window functions not being supported in versions prior to 3.25.0 and Django not raising a clear error, we need to gather code context related to several key components:\n\n1. The part of Django that handles database operations, specifically for SQLite.\n2. The error handling mechanism for when an unsupported SQL operation is attempted.\n3. The mechanism Django uses to decide what database features are supported.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls would be beneficial to get the necessary code context:\n\n- We need to find out where Django checks SQLite version or feature support. This might not be in a straightforward method related to version checking but rather in the initial setup or configuration for a SQLite database connection. Hence, it'd be useful to search for SQLite-related setup or configuration code:\n  - `search_code(\"sqlite3.connect\")`\n  - `search_code(\"SQLite version\")`\n\n- Since the issue points out a problem with window functions and how Django interacts with SQLite, it's pertinent to look into how Django processes and executes queries, especially those involving window functions:\n  - `search_class(\"DatabaseWrapper\")`\n  - `search_method(\"create_connection\")`\n  - `search_method_in_class(\"execute\", \"DatabaseWrapper\")`\n\n- Given that Django should ideally throw an error when an unsupported database feature is attempted, we might need to understand how errors are being handled or raised within the codebase:\n  - `search_code(\"raise django.db.utils.OperationalError\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for understanding the issue at hand and developing a fix."
