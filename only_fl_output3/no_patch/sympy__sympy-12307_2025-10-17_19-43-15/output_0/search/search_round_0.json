I'm not sure how to get the same behavior than Sympy for `x=0`, but at least it would be compilable.\n</issue>"

Specifically, we should look into the functions or methods used for generating Fortran code from Sympy expressions. Given the details from the issue, we should perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `fcode` function to understand how it generates Fortran code, as it is directly mentioned in the issue.\n2. Look into `sympy.utilities.codegen` as mentioned in the issue, since it's related to the code generation process. We need to find the specific classes or methods in `codegen` that are responsible for generating the Fortran code.\n\nHere are the specific API calls to make:\n\n- search_method(\"fcode\")\n- search_code(\"sympy.utilities.codegen\")"
