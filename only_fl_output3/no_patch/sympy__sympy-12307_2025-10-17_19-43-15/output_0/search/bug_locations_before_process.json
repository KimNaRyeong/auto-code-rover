        "intended_behavior": "The class should have a method that can specifically identify and correctly print the Fortran code for the `sign` function. This might involve creating a new method, such as `_print_Sign`, which checks if the function to be printed is the `sign` function and, if so, generates the correct Fortran syntax (`sign(1, x)` or `sign(1d0, x)` depending on the context). If such a method is not feasible or in line with the design of `FCodePrinter`, the existing method that handles generic function printing (`_print_Function`) should be modified to include a special case for the `sign` function. This will ensure that when `fcode` is called with an expression involving `sign`, the output is a valid Fortran statement that compiles successfully."
