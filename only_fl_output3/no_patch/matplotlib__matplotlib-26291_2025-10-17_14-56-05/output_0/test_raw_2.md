Below is a revision of the `reproducer.py` script based on your instructions. This version ensures an `AssertionError` is raised if the issue is detected and handles the expected outcome more accurately:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.inset_locator import inset_axes

    fig, (ax, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=[5.5, 2.8])

    try:
        # Attempt to create an inset axes
        axins = inset_axes(ax, width="30%", height="30%", loc='upper right')
        # Assuming success if no exception is triggered
        print("Inset axes creation did not raise any exceptions. Issue might be fixed.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Failed to create inset axes due to an error.") from e

    plt.close(fig)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        # Exists with code 1 if AssertionError is raised, indicating issue presence.
        exit(1)
    # Exits with code 0 to indicate the issue did not occur, which means either it's resolved or not reproducible.
    exit(0)
```

This script is aligned with your requirements more closely by using `assert` to ensure it exits with code 1 when the issue exists (i.e., any exception is caught when attempting to create inset axes), demonstrating the problem is present. Contrarily, it exits with code 0 when no exception occurs, hinting at the issue being potentially resolved or the specific scenario not reproducing the error under current environment/setup conditions.
