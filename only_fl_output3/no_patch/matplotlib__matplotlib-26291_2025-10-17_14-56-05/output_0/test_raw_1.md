Given the request for a script that exits with code 0 only when the issue is fixed, and raises an `AssertionError` including a stack trace when the issue is present, we'll still target the original issue related to creating inset axes in a Matplotlib plot. This time, ensuring any encountered exception is properly caught and traced, leading to a non-zero exit code if the exception indicates the issue persists.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.inset_locator import inset_axes

    fig, (ax, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=[5.5, 2.8])

    try:
        # Attempt to create an inset axes
        axins = inset_axes(ax, width=1.3, height=0.9)
        # If no error occurs, we don't explicitly verify the presence as plotting can be visually inspected.
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Failed to create inset axes due to an error.") from e

    plt.close(fig)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
        print("Inset axes creation did not raise any exceptions. Issue might be fixed.")
    except AssertionError:
        # Ensure the script exits with code 1 to indicate failure only when AssertionError is raised,
        # demonstrating the issue persists.
        exit(1)
    # Exit with code 0 to indicate success, implying either no issue was encountered or it has been resolved.
    exit(0)
```

This script is designed to directly address the original reported issue by using the problematic code snippet within a function that it attempts to execute. If the specific error related to creating inset axes manifests, the exception is caught, a stack trace is printed to provide detailed feedback on the error origin, and the script exits with status 1 indicating an unresolved issue. Conversely, if the operation succeeds without exception, it indicates the absence of the reported issue, thus exiting with status 0.
