        "intended_behavior": "The `_remake_table` method should correctly handle quoted table names to avoid syntax errors in SQL statements. Specifically:\n- When creating the new table (`new__app_model`), renaming it, or copying data between the old and the new table, the method should ensure that quotes in `db_table` names are correctly handled so that the resulting SQL queries are valid. This might involve checking for quotes around `db_table` names and ensuring they are included in the SQL statements in a way that SQLite expects.\n- Ensure that operations that require table name manipulation, such as renaming or quoting, account for the possibility of names already being quoted, to prevent double quoting.\n- The method might need to introduce additional logic to parse and correctly format quoted names during SQL query construction, ensuring that quotes are preserved where necessary and not doubled up."
