```

This script has been updated to correctly address the instructions. It now correctly imports `sys`, ensuring that `sys.exit(0)` is effective when the issue is fixed, and it exits with `sys.exit(1)` when an unexpected error occurs or when the script encounters an issue in the environment setup (e.g., matplotlib not being installed).

The error handling logic has been improved to be less specific about the error message from `libpng` and more focused on the act of saving a zero-dimensioned figure, as caught by the generic exception catcher. This should allow for a broader range of potential `libpng` and related errors to trigger the correct pathway in the script. Additionally, the explicit check for a `ValueError` or any message related to figure size in the caught exception's message caters to the possibility of variations in error messaging between matplotlib versions or configurations.
