        "intended_behavior": "The savefig method should include a pre-save validation step to check if the figure dimensions (width and height) are greater than zero. If not, the method should either adjust the dimensions to a minimum non-zero size that libpng can handle or raise a ValueError indicating that zero-width or zero-height figures cannot be saved as PNG files. This validation step would preserve the existing functionality by allowing valid figures to be saved as before while preventing the crash with more informative feedback for the user in cases of invalid dimensions."

        "intended_behavior": "In the subplots method, introduce a check early in the method to ensure that the figsize argument (if explicitly specified) does not contain a zero width or height. If such a case is detected, the method could either adjust the dimension to a safe minimal value or raise an informative error, suggesting that the specified dimensions are not valid. This approach prevents the creation of a figure that would later cause issues when saved, addressing the issue closer to its source rather than at the point of failure. This behavior keeps intact the functionality for creating subplots with valid dimensions while improving error handling and user feedback for invalid dimensions."
