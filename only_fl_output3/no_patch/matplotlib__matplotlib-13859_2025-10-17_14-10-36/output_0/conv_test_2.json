The script checks for the specific `libpng signaled error` runtime error when attempting to save a zero-width figure as a PNG file. Differences from the initial attempt include a clearer path to isolate the intended `RuntimeError` caused by `libpng` and a more nuanced approach to handling and interpreting exceptions in relation to the original issue description."
