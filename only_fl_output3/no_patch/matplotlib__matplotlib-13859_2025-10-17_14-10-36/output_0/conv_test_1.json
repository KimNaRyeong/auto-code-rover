The `test_zero_width_figure_saving` function encapsulates the test case. It attempts to create and save a figure with these conditions and expects an exception to be raised. If the expected `libpng signaled error` is encountered, it prints a stack trace with clear line numbers using the provided `print_stacktrace` function and exits with code `1` to signal that the issue is present.\n\nIf the function finishes without exceptions or with an unexpected exception, it handles these cases by either signaling that the issue is potentially fixed (exiting with code `0` on an unexpected `AssertionError`) or re-raising unexpected exceptions for further diagnosis.\n\nBefore using this script in a production environment, it's important to adapt and test it thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected across various environments and setups."
