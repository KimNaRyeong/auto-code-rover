To address the requested scenario properly, here's an updated version of the Python script `reproducer.py`. This script is specifically designed to reproduce the issue as described:
- REGRESSION: `copy(deep=True)` casts unicode indices to object dtype in an `xarray.Dataset` or `xarray.DataArray`.

Please make sure you have the `xarray` package installed in your environment to run this script successfully.

```python
import xarray

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    # Create a simple xarray Dataset with unicode indices
    ds = xarray.Dataset(
        coords={'x': ['foo'], 'y': ('x', ['bar'])},
        data_vars={'z': ('x', ['baz'])})

    # Perform a shallow copy to observe if there's any change
    shallow_copy = ds.copy(deep=False)
    # Perform a deep copy to observe if there's any unexpected dtype change
    deep_copy = ds.copy(deep=True)

    # Assert the unicode type '<U3' remains unchanged after a shallow copy
    assert ds.x.dtype == shallow_copy.x.dtype, "Shallow copy altered the dtype."

    # Assert the dtype remains unchanged for a deep copy, checking for regression
    try:
        assert ds.x.dtype == deep_copy.x.dtype, (
            f"Deep copy changed dtype from {ds.x.dtype} to {deep_copy.x.dtype}. "
            "Unicode indices cast to object dtype is a regression.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        # If the assertion fails, print the stack trace and re-raise the error
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

    # The script should reach this point only if no dtype changes are observed
    print("No regression detected. The dtype of unicode indices remains unchanged after deep copy.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError:
        exit(1)
    else:
        exit(0)
```

This script directly addresses the specific issue by:
- Creating an xarray `Dataset` with unicode indices.
- Making both shallow (`deep=False`) and deep (`deep=True`) copies of the dataset.
- Asserting that the data type of indices ('x' in this case) remains the same before and after both types of copy to detect if the reported regression occurs.
- Utilizing the provided function to print a detailed stack trace if the assertion fails because of an unexpected data type change, which would indicate the presence of the regression.

If the deep copy causes a change in the data type of the indices from Unicode to object (`<U*` to `object`), the assertion will fail, triggering the stack trace printout. If the issue is not present, the script will exit normally, indicating no regression was detected.
