Given the previous instructions and the necessity for accuracy in reproducing the issue detailed in the user's description, here's a corrected Python script, `reproducer.py`, that checks for the specific regression issue with xarray:

```python
import xarray

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    ds = xarray.Dataset(
        coords={'x': ['foo'], 'y': ('x', ['bar'])},
        data_vars={'z': ('x', ['baz'])})

    # Checking dtype of 'x' before and after deep copy
    dtype_before = ds['x'].dtype
    dtype_after = ds.copy(deep=True)['x'].dtype

    assert dtype_before == dtype_after, (
        f"copy(deep=True) changed dtype of 'x' from {dtype_before} to {dtype_after}, "
        "which is a regression.")

    # Performing a similar check for DataArray
    da_dtype_before = ds['z'].dtype
    da_dtype_after = ds['z'].copy(deep=True).dtype

    assert da_dtype_before == da_dtype_after, (
        f"copy(deep=True) changed dtype of DataArray 'z' from {da_dtype_before} to {da_dtype_after}, "
        "which is a regression.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
        print("No regression detected.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
```

This script focuses on reproducing the scenario where calling `copy(deep=True)` on both `xarray.Dataset` and `xarray.DataArray` instances leads to an unintended dtype change from Unicode string to object. The `assert` statements are designed to validate that the dtype remains consistent before and after the operation, raising an `AssertionError` if a regression is detected. 

This approach should ensure that if the regression exists, the script will exit with code 1 and provide a detailed stack trace to help identify the source of the issue. Conversely, if the issue does not manifest—indicating the regression might have been fixed or is not present—the script will confirm the absence of the regression and exit with code 0.
