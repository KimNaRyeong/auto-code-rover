        "content": "To get sufficient context for resolving the issue described, I would start by looking at specific classes and methods likely involved in the copying process for both `Dataset` and `DataArray`. Given the regression described involves casting unicode indices to objects during deep copies, the `copy` methods for `Dataset` and `DataArray`, as well as any utility methods they depend on for copying data, would be good starting points. The bug suggests that the regression impacts index variable handling, so exploring how index variables are copied or recreated during the copy process is also crucial.\n\nLet's begin with:\n\n1. Searching for the `copy` method in both `Dataset` and `DataArray` classes to understand how they are implemented and if there are significant changes recently that could have introduced this regression.\n2. Exploring the classes `Dataset` and `DataArray` thoroughly to see if there are any auxiliary methods directly related to the copying process, especially ones that handle indices or types conversion.\n3. Since the issue also mentioned that `copy.copy()` and `copy.deepcopy()` are affected, it would be useful to see if `xarray` overrides these methods or define specific `__copy__` and `__deepcopy__` methods for custom behavior.\n\nTherefore, the search API calls would be:\n- search_class(\"Dataset\")\n- search_class(\"DataArray\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"copy\", \"Dataset\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"copy\", \"DataArray\")"
