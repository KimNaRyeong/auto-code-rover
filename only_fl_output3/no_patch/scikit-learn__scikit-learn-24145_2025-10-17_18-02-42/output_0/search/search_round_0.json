        "content": "To address the issue and gather the needed context for implementing the sparse matrix output for `SplineTransformer`, I will invoke the following search API calls:\n\n1. To understand how `SplineTransformer` is currently implemented and where it might be modified to support sparse matrices, I'll look up the class definition:\n   - `search_class(\"SplineTransformer\")`\n\n2. Given the mention of a `fit_transform` method in the issue description, it would be helpful to see this method's current implementation to understand where changes are required for the sparse matrix support:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"fit_transform\", \"SplineTransformer\")`\n\n3. Since the proposed solution involves using `design_matrix` from SciPy (which seems to be a new or updated functionality as of SciPy >= 1.8), getting context about how external libraries or functions are currently used within `SplineTransformer` might be useful. This requires finding any imports or usage of SciPy functions within the SplineTransformer class or related files. However, without specific file names, it's difficult to directly search within a file, so a broader search for `SciPy` usage might be necessary:\n   - `search_code(\"from scipy\")`"
