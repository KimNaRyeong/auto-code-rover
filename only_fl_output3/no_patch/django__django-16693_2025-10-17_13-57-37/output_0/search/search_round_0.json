It returned None instead.\nI suggest we do the same for context processors.

        "content": "To resolve this issue efficiently, we need to gather more context around the specific parts of the Django codebase mentioned in the issue. Here are the API calls that would help in understanding the problem better and progressing towards a solution:\n\n1. To understand how context processors are currently handled, we should inspect the method where context processors are applied to the template context. The error traceback points to `bind_template` method in the `context.py` file. \n   \n   - `search_method_in_file(\"bind_template\", \"django/template/context.py\")`\n\n2. To compare how errors are nicely handled elsewhere as mentioned in the issue description, specifically the view returning `None` instead of an `HttpResponse`, we need to locate where this error message is generated. This requires finding where Django handles the response from a view.\n\n   - `search_code(\"The view didn't return an HttpResponse object\")`\n\n3. Since we're considering adding a try/except around a specific code line to improve error messaging, it's crucial to identify the exact placement for this. The issue mentions the operation `updates.update(processor(self.request))` as problematic. Let's find where this operation occurs.\n\n   - `search_code(\"updates.update(processor(self.request))\")`\n\nThese API calls will retrieve the necessary code context, including how processor updates are currently handled and how similar error handling is implemented elsewhere in Django. This information will inform the approach for generating a more informative error message."
