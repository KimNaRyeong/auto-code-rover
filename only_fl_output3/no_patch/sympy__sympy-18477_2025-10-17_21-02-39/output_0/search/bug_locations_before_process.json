        "intended_behavior": "The method should be enhanced to consider 'min_fixed' and 'max_fixed' settings when formatting floats. The settings 'min_fixed' and 'max_fixed' will determine the numeric bounds within which a fixed-point notation is favored over scientific notation. The existing functionality, including 'strip_zeros', must be preserved while extending the method to include these new settings. Implementation may require conditional logic to switch between fixed-point and scientific notations based on these thresholds."

This involves formatting the float output accordingly, balancing between fixed-point and scientific notation as dictated by these new settings, while ensuring that 'strip_zeros' functionality and any other existing functionality remain unaffected."
