Here are the API calls we could make:\n\n1. Search for how the `strip_zeros` option is exposed in the codebase to understand how options are currently implemented for the mpmath printer.\n   - `search_code(\"strip_zeros\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions unifying the behavior of the Float printer across different printers, it's necessary to locate the implementations of the Float printer in the LaTeX and string printers.\n   - `search_code(\"Float printer LaTeX\")`\n   - `search_code(\"Float printer string\")`\n\n3. The issue description directly names `min_fixed` and `max_fixed` settings, which means we need to find if these are already implemented somewhere in the mpmath library or if they need to be introduced.\n   - `search_code(\"min_fixed\")`\n   - `search_code(\"max_fixed\")`\n\nThese calls should provide enough context to understand how `min_fixed` and `max_fixed` can be introduced and exposed in the various printers similarly to `strip_zeros`, and how the printers behave differently currently."
