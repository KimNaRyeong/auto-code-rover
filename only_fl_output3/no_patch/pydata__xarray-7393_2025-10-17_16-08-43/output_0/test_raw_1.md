Based on the feedback, it appears there's a need to adjust the previous `reproducer.py` file. Given that the test previously exited with code 0 without reproducing the issue (which might have been interpreted as the absence of an issue when the expectation was, in fact, to trigger an `AssertionError` if the data type changes after stacking), I'll now ensure the script is aligned with the requirements to explicitly raise an `AssertionError` should the conditions for the issue remain unmet.

Please allow me to correct the approach:

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        ds = xr.Dataset(coords={'a': np.array([0], dtype='i4')})
        # Assert comparison of dtypes directly
        assert ds['a'].values.dtype == ds.stack(b=('a',))['a'].values.dtype, "Data type of 'a' coordinate changed after stacking."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Ensuring the script indicates an error was caught by raising an exception.
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this revised script:

1. The script is explicit in asserting that the `dtype` of the `'a'` coordinate before and after stacking is the same, aiming to trigger an `AssertionError` if they differ (which would indicate the issue is present).

2. If there's an `AssertionError`, the script uses `print_stacktrace` to provide a detailed trace of where the assertion failed, enhancing debuggability.

3. The script raises the caught `AssertionError` again after printing the stack trace to ensure the exception is noted, and the script exits with a non-zero exit code, indicating failure only in the presence of the issue (as per initial requirements).

Please ensure that the environmental setup (such as the versions of `xarray`, `numpy`, and Python itself) is consistent with the one provided in the issue to successfully replicate the context in which the issue occurs.
