        "intended_behavior": "The `stack` method is designed to stack dimensions into a single new dimension and by default combines the corresponding coordinate variables into a MultiIndex. The intended behavior here should ensure that the dtype of coordinates involved in the stacking operation is preserved as in the original dataset unless a specific need arises to change it (which should be rare and well-justified). To resolve the issue, this method might need adjustments or enhancements in how it handles dtypes during the creation of the MultiIndex or the stacking process itself to ensure that dtypes like 'i4' are not automatically cast to 'i8'."
