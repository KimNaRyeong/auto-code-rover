Based on your requirements, below is a corrected version of `reproducer.py`. This script is intended to explicitly check the condition mentioned in your issue and respond accordingly. It will raise an `AssertionError` with a stack trace if the issue is present, meaning if the dtype is changed unexpectedly. If the issue has been fixed, and the assertion passes, the script will exit with code 0, implying successful execution without issues.

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_dtype_after_stacking():
    ds = xr.Dataset(coords={'a': np.array([0], dtype='i4')})
    initial_dtype_str = str(ds['a'].values.dtype)
    stacked_dtype_str = str(ds.stack(b=('a',))['a'].values.dtype)

    # Making it clear that we're checking for dtype equality explicitly
    if initial_dtype_str != stacked_dtype_str:
        raise AssertionError("Data type of 'a' coordinate changed from '{}' to '{}' after stacking.".format(initial_dtype_str, stacked_dtype_str))

try:
    check_dtype_after_stacking()
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with non-zero status to indicate failure

# Exiting with code 0 if no issues were found
sys.exit(0)
```

This script:

- Uses `check_dtype_after_stacking()` function to encapsulate the checking logic.
- Inside the function, captures the initial `dtype` as a string and the `dtype` after stacking, also as a string, and compares them.
- If they differ, an `AssertionError` is raised with a message reflecting the change.
- Catches the `AssertionError` in the main script body, prints a detailed stack trace, and exits with status code 1 to indicate the presence of the issue.
- If the assertion does not fail, the script exits with status code 0, indicating the issue is fixed or not present.

By executing this script as directed (`python3 reproducer.py`), you can easily determine whether the reported issue is reproducible under the current environment and library versions described.
