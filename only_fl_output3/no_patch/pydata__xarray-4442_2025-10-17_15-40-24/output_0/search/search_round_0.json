        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how `to_series` and `to_dataframe` methods work in the context of the `DataArray` class of the xarray library, especially when dealing with a MultiIndex. Given the error message involves handling of a MultiIndex with the pandas library, it's essential to know how these xarray methods interact with pandas' MultiIndex mechanism.\n\nFirst, I will use the search methods to delve into the implementation details of `to_series` and `to_dataframe` within the DataArray class. Next, based on the mentioned error message, it seems crucial to understand how MultiIndex is being checked or manipulated within these methods.\n\nHere are the search API calls I would like to make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"DataArray\")`: To locate the `DataArray` class in the codebase and understand its structure.\n2. `search_method(\"to_series\")`: To find implementations of the `to_series` method, presumably in the `DataArray` class or its parent classes.\n3. `search_method(\"to_dataframe\")`: Similarly, to find implementations of the `to_dataframe` method.\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how the `DataArray`'s methods work with MultiIndex and identify where the problem might lie."
