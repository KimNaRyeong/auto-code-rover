        "intended_behavior": "This method should be modified to handle `DataArray` objects that have one or more dimensions stacked into a MultiIndex, along with additional dimensions. The conversion process to `pandas.Series` needs to ensure that all dimensions, including the MultiIndex and any unstacked dimensions, are correctly represented in the resultant MultiIndex of the `pandas.Series`. Adjustment may involve better integration or handling of the `coords.to_index()` functionality to produce a comprehensive MultiIndex structure that captures the full dimensionality of the original `DataArray`, including any nuances of missing data handling for such indices."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to `to_series`, `to_dataframe` should correctly handle conversion of `DataArray` objects with mixed MultiIndex and additional dimensions to a `pandas.DataFrame`. The modification must ensure that the DataFrame accurately reflects the complex indexing structure of the original `DataArray`, preserving the relationships and hierarchy among the dimensions. This may include refining the logic that translates the `DataArray`'s dimensions into the row and column indices of the DataFrame, particularly ensuring that MultiIndex dimensions are properly accounted for and integrated into the DataFrame structure."
