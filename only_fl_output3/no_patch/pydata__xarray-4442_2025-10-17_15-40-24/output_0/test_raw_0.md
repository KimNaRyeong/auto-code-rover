This Python script is designed to reproduce a specific issue involving the conversion from a `DataArray` with a multiindex dimension to a Pandas `Series` or `DataFrame` using the `xarray` library. When the issue is present, as described, the script will catch the exception, print a detailed stack trace highlighting the problem, and exit with a status code that indicates the presence of the error. When the issue is resolved—meaning the operation completes successfully without raising an exception—the script will assert failure due to not encountering the expected error condition, aiming to clarify the difference between a resolved issue and other potential errors.
