        "intended_behavior": "The fps function should always return a FormalPowerSeries object, even when the input function f is a simple polynomial or an expression that does not require expansion. This can be achieved by modifying the handling logic to ensure that if the result of compute_fps is not a formal power series, the function still wraps the input in a FormalPowerSeries object or an equivalent wrapper that supports the formal power series interface (including indexing). This ensures that the return type is consistent across all inputs, preserving the user's expectation of interacting with a series-like object. This change must be implemented in a way that it does not interfere with the existing capabilities of handling more complex functions or expressions that naturally fit into the formal power series framework."

        "method": "",
        "intended_behavior": "Although not directly buggy in the context of this issue, ensuring that FormalPowerSeries can gracefully handle and represent even the simplest expressions like x**2 as a formal power series is crucial. It may involve ensuring that such basic expressions are wrapped in a formal power series shell that provides the expected interface without necessitating further expansion. This is not about adding a new method, but ensuring that the class itself and its instantiation logic in fps are robust enough to handle a wide variety of expressions seamlessly, thereby addressing the inconsistency reported in the issue."
