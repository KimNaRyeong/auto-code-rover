    p = fps(x ** 2)

    # but a Pow object, which does not support indexing.
    # Correct behavior should ideally return a FormalPowerSeries object for consistent
    # interface, as hinted by the SymPy documentation.
    try:

        assert type(p).__name__ == 'FormalPowerSeries', "Expected type: FormalPowerSeries, got: " + type(p).__name__

Please note that the function `print_stacktrace` contains a subtle error in the print statements regarding `line=sys.stderr`. The correct usage should be `file=sys.stderr`. Here's the corrected print statements within the `print_stacktrace` function:

```python
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
```

Do ensure that your execution environment is correctly set up with the relevant versions of SymPy where this behavior is reproducible, as library updates or changes might affect the outcome of this script.
