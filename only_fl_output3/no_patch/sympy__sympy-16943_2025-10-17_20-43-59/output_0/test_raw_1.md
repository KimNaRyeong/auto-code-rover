This script will attempt to reproduce the issue as described. It uses Sympy's `fps` function with a simple squared term to verify if the result is indeed a formal power series. If the function returns a power (`Pow` object) instead of a formal power series, it tries to index the result, expecting to catch a `TypeError` because a `Pow` object doesn't support indexing. This behavior confirms the inconsistency with the `fps` function's expected result. If an `AssertionError` is raised, it means the issue persists. The script prints detailed stack traces to help diagnose the issue further.
