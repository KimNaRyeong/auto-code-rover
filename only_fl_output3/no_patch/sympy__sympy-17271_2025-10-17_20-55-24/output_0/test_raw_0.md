This Python script, when executed in the root directory of the project as `python3 reproducer.py`, tries to reproduce the issue described: calling `frac` with `zoo` (`sympy.zoo` represents a complex infinity in SymPy) raises a `TypeError`. The script uses a custom `print_stacktrace` function to nicely format and output the traceback of the exception, if it occurs.

- If the issue is present (i.e., `frac(zoo)` raises `TypeError`), the script will catch the exception, print the stack trace using the provided function, and raise an `AssertionError`.
- If the issue is somehow fixed in a future version of SymPy (meaning `frac(zoo)` does not raise an exception), the script will run without issues assuming the assertion after calling `frac(zoo)` passes. Depending on the specific fix (which is not described in the issue), the assertion might need adjustment to check for an appropriate or expected return type other than raising an exception.
