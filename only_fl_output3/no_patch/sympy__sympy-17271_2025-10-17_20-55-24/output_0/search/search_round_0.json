        "content": "To address the issue described, let's perform a series of API calls to understand the involved components better and the context in which the error occurs. Since the issue mentions encountering a `TypeError` when calling `frac(zoo)` in Sympy and specifically refers to a problematic section of code within the `frac` function implementation, let's gather context around these areas:\n\n1. To understand how `frac` is designed to handle various inputs, including symbolic constants like `zoo` (which represents a complex infinity in Sympy), we should look at the definition of `frac`. This includes both its implementation and any special handling within its `eval` method, if present.\n\n2. Since the error traceback points to operations involving `NoneType` and `Zero` within an arithmetic operation, it might be beneficial to examine the `eval` function further to understand its expected behavior with different types of arguments.\n\nGiven this plan of action, here are the API calls that would help gather the necessary context from the project:\n\n- search_method_in_file(\"frac\", \"sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py\"): This will give us the implementation details of the `frac` function, particularly to see if and how it's designed to handle cases like `zoo`.\n\n- search_method_in_class(\"eval\", \"Function\"): Since the traceback indicates that the error occurs after an invocation of an `eval` method within the context of `Function` processing, looking at how `eval` is implemented for the `Function` class or subclasses thereof might shed light on where things are going wrong.\n\n- get_code_around_line(\"sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py\", 333, 10): This will provide a broader view of the code surrounding the traceback's line number 333, allowing us to see the logic leading up to the problematic operation.\n\nThese API calls will provide a more comprehensive view of how `frac(zoo)` is processed and where the logic fails, leading to the `TypeError`."
