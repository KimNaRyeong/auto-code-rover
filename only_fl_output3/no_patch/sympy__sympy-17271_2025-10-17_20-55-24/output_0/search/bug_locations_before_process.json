        "intended_behavior": "The `eval` method should be updated to handle the case of `zoo` (complex infinity) appropriately. Given `frac`'s purpose to compute the fractional part of a number, and considering `zoo` represents an undefined or infinite quantity for which a fractional part doesn't meaningfully exist, the method should explicitly check for `zoo` and return a well-defined result for this specific input. A logical approach might be to return `NaN` (Not a Number) for `frac(zoo)` because the operation is mathematically undefined. Alternatively, if maintaining the return of a symbolic type is important for consistency within the Sympy library, the method could return `zoo` itself, or possibly raise a specific exception indicating that the operation is not supported for `zoo`. The choice between these behaviors should be guided by how similar cases are handled throughout the Sympy codebase and the expected usage patterns of the `frac` function by users. This alteration ensures that the function's behavior with `zoo` is consistent, predictable, and in line with mathematical conventions or the design principles of Sympy."
