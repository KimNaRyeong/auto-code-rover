Since the issue mentions encountering a `TypeError` when calling `frac(zoo)` in Sympy and specifically refers to a problematic section of code within the `frac` function implementation, let's gather context around these areas:\n\n1. To understand how `frac` is designed to handle various inputs, including symbolic constants like `zoo` (which represents a complex infinity in Sympy), we should look at the definition of `frac`. This includes both its implementation and any special handling within its `eval` method, if present.\n\n2.

        "content": "Analyzing the context provided by the API calls gives us several insights into the issue and leads us to consider additional steps for investigation.\n\n### Analyzing the found code snippet\n\nThe code snippet from `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py` around line 333 highlights the `eval` function of the `frac` class. This function seems to separate the real and imaginary parts of its input arguments, computes them separately, and then attempts to combine them back together. Specifically, line 333 attempts to recombine the real part (`real`) with the imaginary part (`imag`), multiplying the latter by `S.ImaginaryUnit` (which represents the imaginary unit, \\(i\\) or \\(\\sqrt{-1}\\)), to form a complex number.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\n\nThe issue encounters a `TypeError` when `frac(zoo)` is evaluated, specifically at the operation `real + S.ImaginaryUnit*imag`. Given that the exception mentions `NoneType` and `Zero`, it's plausible that either `real` or `imag` (or both) are `None` at this point in the execution, which Python cannot add to `Zero` (or any number, for that matter). This suggests that the preceding logic fails to handle the case where `zoo` (representing a form of infinity in complex numbers) is passed, leading to either `real` or `imag` not being properly initialized before they are used.\n\n#### Intended behavior\n\nThe intended behavior for `frac(zoo)` is not explicitly stated in the issue, but given that `frac` generally represents the fractional part of a number (i.e., the part of a number after the decimal point), and considering that `zoo` represents an undefined or infinite quantity, a sensible default behavior might be to return `NaN` (Not a Number) or possibly raise a more descriptive error. The current behavior results in a `TypeError`, which is neither informative nor particularly helpful for users.\n\n### Next Steps for Investigation\n\nGiven the information and the direct search hits from the API calls, along with the failed attempts to find `frac` directly in the file or an `eval` method within `Function`, here are additional steps that could be taken:\n\n1. **Search for Implementation of `frac`**: Since the initial attempt to find `frac` directly in `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py` was unsuccessful, it's possible that `frac` is either dynamically defined or wrapped by another method that handles its invocation. A broader search in the codebase could help locate its definition or any wrappers/decorators that might influence its behavior.\n\n2. **Review Handling of Special Constants like `zoo`**: It would be useful to understand how Sympy generally intends functions to handle symbolic constants like `zoo`. This could involve searching for other instances where `zoo` is handled explicitly or searching the documentation/comments in the code for guidelines on handling such cases.\n\n3. **Test Behavior of Similar Functions with `zoo`**: Investigating how other functions in Sympy that deal with numerical operations handle `zoo` could provide insight into the expected behavior and potentially highlight a common pattern or utility function used for these cases.\n\nGiven these next steps, proceeding with the investigation would involve more specific searches and reviewing of Sympy's documentation and codebase to better understand the expected handling of symbolic constants and complex infinity within functions like `frac`."

Given `frac`'s purpose to compute the fractional part of a number, and considering `zoo` represents an undefined or infinite quantity for which a fractional part doesn't meaningfully exist, the method should explicitly check for `zoo` and return a well-defined result for this specific input. A logical approach might be to return `NaN` (Not a Number) for `frac(zoo)` because the operation is mathematically undefined. Alternatively, if maintaining the return of a symbolic type is important for consistency within the Sympy library, the method could return `zoo` itself, or possibly raise a specific exception indicating that the operation is not supported for `zoo`. The choice between these behaviors should be guided by how similar cases are handled throughout the Sympy codebase and the expected usage patterns of the `frac` function by users. This alteration ensures that the function's behavior with `zoo` is consistent, predictable, and in line with mathematical conventions or the design principles of Sympy."
