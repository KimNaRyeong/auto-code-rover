        "content": "Given the description of the issue, I will need to gather more context about the Django models and QuerySet API, specifically focusing on the `ExpressionWrapper`, `Value`, and query `annotate` method. The issue mentions a function `execQuery` which forms a core part of this bug but is likely specific to the user's codebase and not part of Django's internals. The problem seems to revolve around how Django constructs SQL queries from ORM expressions, especially when using `ExpressionWrapper` with constant values. I will commence investigation in the Django framework's source code to understand how `ExpressionWrapper` and constant values like `Value(3)` are handled within the ORM, particularly in relation to the `GROUP BY` clause.\n\n1. **Search for the `ExpressionWrapper` class**: This will help understand how expressions are wrapped and how the wrapping might affect the SQL generation, especially in combination with constant values.\n\n2. **Search for the `Value` class**: Since the issue specifically mentions a problem when `Value(3)` is used, it's vital to understand how Django treats constant values in query expressions.\n\n3. **Search for the `annotate` method in classes**: The `annotate` method is critical since the issue arises when it is used to annotate querysets with the results of expressions. Seeing how it works internally can offer clues into how group by clauses are constructed.\n\n4. **Search for how Django handles group by clauses**: This requires understanding internal mechanisms rather than looking at a specific method or class and might involve searching code snippets related to SQL generation, especially the GROUP BY clause handling.\n\nLet's execute the searches:\n\n- search_class(\"ExpressionWrapper\")\n- search_class(\"Value\")\n- search_method(\"annotate\")"
