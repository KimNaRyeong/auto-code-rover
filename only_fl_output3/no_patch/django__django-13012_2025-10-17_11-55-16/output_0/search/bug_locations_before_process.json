        "intended_behavior": "The method get_group_by_cols for ExpressionWrapper should be updated or added if it doesn\u2019t exist. It must be engineered to intelligently exclude constant expressions from being considered in the GROUP BY clause. This could involve checking if the wrapped expression is an instance of Value and, if so, not including it in the group by columns list. This adjustment would ensure that constant values don't inadvertently contribute to the GROUP BY clause in PostgreSQL, aligning with SQL standards."

        "intended_behavior": "Although not intrinsically faulty, a refined examination within the annotate method might be necessary to ensure it correctly handles the inclusion (or exclusion) of expressions wrapped by ExpressionWrapper in GROUP BY clauses. This does not suggest the annotate method itself is misbehaving, but a deeper integration or handling check with ExpressionWrapper's adjusted behavior (as proposed above) might be required to holistically resolve the issue. The annotate method should seamlessly support the refined logic of ExpressionWrapper.get_group_by_cols to exclude constant expressions from the GROUP BY clause where applicable, ensuring PostgreSQL compatibility."
