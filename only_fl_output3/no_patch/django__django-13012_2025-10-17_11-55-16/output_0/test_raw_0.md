This script defines a minimal Django setup programmatically, creates a test database model, and tries to execute a query that should raise an exception due to the GROUP BY clause issue described. If the attempt to execute the query with a constant expression wrapped in an `ExpressionWrapper` results in a `ProgrammingError` specifically complaining about aggregate functions not being allowed in the GROUP BY clause, the script prints the stack trace to give more context on the exception, then exits with status code 0, indicating the reproduction of the issue was successful. If the error occurs due to a different reason or no error occurs (implying the issue has been fixed or does not exist), an `AssertionError` is raised.
