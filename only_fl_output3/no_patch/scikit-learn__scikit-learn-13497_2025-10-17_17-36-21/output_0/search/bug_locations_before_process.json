        "intended_behavior": "The `_estimate_mi` function should accurately handle the `discrete_features` parameter in all its potential forms: as a string (specifically 'auto'), a boolean value, or an array (either an array of boolean masks or an array of indices).\n- When `discrete_features` is 'auto', the function should check if `X` is sparse to determine whether features are discrete or not.\n- If `discrete_features` is a boolean, it should directly influence the processing of features as either all discrete or all continuous.\n- Most importantly, when `discrete_features` is an array, the function needs to incorporate logic to treat specified features as discrete based on their indices (if the array is of indices) or based on their boolean mask (if the array is of booleans). This detailed handling will ensure the function's future compatibility with numpy and enhance its robustness in feature selection tasks."
