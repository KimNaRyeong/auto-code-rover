        "content": "Analyzing the obtained context from the `_estimate_mi` function within `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py`, we can understand a few key points that address the questions above:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The code snippet is part of the `_estimate_mi` function which estimates mutual information for a continuous target variable. The purpose of the snippet is to handle the `discrete_features` parameter, specifically when it is set to `'auto'`. If `discrete_features == 'auto'`, it attempts to automatically determine if features are discrete or not, which in this case, is simply checking if the input matrix `X` is sparse.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue points out a potential flaw in comparing `discrete_features`, which can be an array of booleans or indices, directly to a string (`'auto'`). This comparison would be problematic with future versions of numpy due to stricter type-checking or operation semantics changes. The current implementation assumes `discrete_features` can only either be `'auto'` or a boolean, omitting its potential array form.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior should more accurately handle different types of the `discrete_features` parameter, not just `'auto'` or boolean values. It needs to extend support explicitly for array-like inputs (both boolean masks and indices arrays), ensuring that:\n        - If `discrete_features` is `'auto'`, it should proceed to determine if features are discrete based on whether `X` is sparse or not.\n        - If `discrete_features` is a boolean, it should be used as is.\n        - If `discrete_features` is an array (either a boolean mask or indices), the code should handle these appropriately, possibly by performing additional checks or transformations to correctly identify discrete features.\n   \nGiven this analysis, it seems clear that a patch needs to be developed to make the `discrete_features` parameter handling more robust and in line with expectations for various types. The next logical steps would be to understand how `discrete_features` is utilized following its initialization and to explore the method's documentation or related functionality to ensure compatibility and correctness across its usage. Additional context might be necessary, particularly on how different value types for `discrete_features` should be processed within the `_estimate_mi` function."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This detailed handling will ensure the function's future compatibility with numpy and enhance its robustness in feature selection tasks."
