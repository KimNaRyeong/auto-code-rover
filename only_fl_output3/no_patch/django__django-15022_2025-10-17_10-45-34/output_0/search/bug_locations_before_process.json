Instead of applying a separate JOIN for each term in a related field search, it should either reuse existing JOINs or apply a more efficient strategy such as subqueries or exists conditions, depending on the Django ORM capabilities and the SQL backend. This optimization should maintain the ability to search across related fields without significantly increasing query complexity or execution time."

The intended behavior would involve preprocessing of search_fields to identify search terms that target related models and apply an optimization strategy that minimizes unnecessary JOINs. Such preprocessing could include grouping terms by target model to reduce the number of required JOINs or implementing a more efficient search pattern for related fields."
