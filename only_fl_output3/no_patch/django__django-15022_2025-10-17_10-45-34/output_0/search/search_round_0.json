        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we should start by understanding how the Django admin constructs queries based on the search input, specifically focusing on how it handles `search_fields` including relations like `clientoffice__name`. Here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. Search for the `Client` class to understand the model's structure better:\n```\nsearch_class(\"Client\")\n```\n\n2. Since `ClientOffice` is mentioned as related to `Client` and involved in the search functionality, I will also search for that class:\n```\nsearch_class(\"ClientOffice\")\n```\n\n3. The main issue seems to be with the admin's search functionality, more precisely how the search terms are resulting in multiple unnecessary joins. So, we need to look how `search_fields` are processed in the `admin.ModelAdmin` for `Client`. Since we do not have the specific name of the admin file, we search globally:\n```\nsearch_method_in_class(\"get_search_results\", \"ClientAdmin\")\n```\nIf \"get_search_results\" is not overridden in `ClientAdmin`, this call might not give us a direct result but is necessary to check for custom implementations.\n\n4. Additionally, the description hints at a general pattern in handling search queries (`qs = qs.filter(...)`) possibly leading to these unnecessary joins. We need to look into how the Django admin constructs the query based on `search_fields`, specifically for models with ForeignKey relations. This behavior might be defined in a method that processes the `search_fields` attribute, but without specific method names, we focus on a broader search:\n```\nsearch_code(\"search_fields\")\n```\n\nGiven the information provided, these API calls are aimed at gathering the necessary context surrounding the issue reported. This includes understanding the model structure, how the Django admin handles search fields, especially with foreign key relations, and any custom handling in the `ClientAdmin` class."
