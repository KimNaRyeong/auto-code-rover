Specifically, it should implement a check-and-adjust loop where, before applying the change map, it assesses if any new alias would conflict with existing ones and iteratively adjusts (increments or alters) the alias until a non-conflicting alias is found. This loop should respect the overall structure and logic of the method, only enhancing its capability to handle complex scenarios involving merging queries with OR connectors."

        "intended_behavior": "Enhance the aliasing logic within combine when merging queries using OR connectors to preemptively detect potential alias conflicts. This involves introducing a pre-process step in the combine method that analyzes the rhs (right-hand side) query's alias map against the self (left-hand side) query's alias map. Before executing the alias change operations (inherited from change_aliases), it should adjust the change_map to ensure that aliases are merged smoothly without creating conflicts that lead to an AssertionError in change_aliases. This adjustment should be done respecting the existing logic of preserving query semantics and integrity, ensuring that query results remain unchanged while avoiding alias conflicts."
