        "intended_behavior": "The file `xarray/core/dataset.py` and specifically the `Dataset` class needs to have a new method `drop_isel` added. This method would allow users to specify integer indices for dimensions from which they wish to drop labels, analogous to how `isel` works for selecting data based on integer indices. The method would preserve the existing functionality of the code, ensuring that it does not interfere with the current logic of data selection or dropping based on labels (`drop_sel`). This method should ensure that:\n      - Users can specify integer indices for any dimension, regardless of whether coordinate labels are present.\n      - The method would internally determine the labels to drop based on the provided indices and remove them from the dataset.\n      - The API should be consistent with other methods in terms of handling exceptions, maintaining the dataset's integrity, and updating dataset metadata accordingly.\n      - It provides an intuitive interface for users familiar with `isel` but need to drop data instead of selecting it.\n      - This functionality expands the toolkit of `Dataset` without changing the behavior of existing methods, ensuring backward compatibility.\n\nThis update would not only resolve the current issue but also enhance the utility and flexibility of the `Dataset` class for a wider range of data manipulation tasks, particularly benefiting workflows that deal with unlabeled data or require precise index-based operations."
