        "content": "Given the context, it seems like the previous attempt to write a standalone Python file to reproduce the issue did not actually reproduce the reported problem but instead hit an unrelated error due to compatibility issues in the testing environment, specifically with `numpy` version compatibility. \n\nLet's correct the misunderstanding and attempt to focus on reproducing the intended issue regarding `xarray.Dataset.drop_sel` functionality without coordinates, as described in your initial request. The corrected script assumes that the `drop_sel` method should, ideally, support dropping by index positions directly or offer an alternative method like `drop_isel` for this purpose, as the issue described suggests adding such a feature or finding a workaround.\n\nHere's an appropriate Python script designed to reproduce the reported issue, taking into account the outlined requirements:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport xarray as xr\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef test_drop_sel_without_coords():\n    data = np.random.randn(2, 3)\n    ds = xr.Dataset({\"A\": ([\"x\", \"y\"], data)})\n    \n    try:\n        # Attempting to drop indices in a dimension without coordinates\n        modified_ds = ds.drop_sel(y=[1])\n        assert False, \"Expected a KeyError or ValueError for dropping by label in a dimension without coordinates\"\n    except (KeyError, ValueError) as e:\n        print(\"Successfully caught expected issue:\")\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Catching unexpected exceptions and reporting them\n        print(\"An unexpected error occurred:\")\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        assert False, \"The test encountered an unexpected error.\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_drop_sel_without_coords()\n```\n\nThis script checks if `drop_sel` fails as expected when trying to drop elements by label in a dimension that does not have coordinates and catches the error, printing the stack trace for debugging purposes. It is designed to assert a failure if the method does not raise a `KeyError` or `ValueError`, which aligns with the expected behavior based on the issue description."
