Given the context, it seems like the previous attempt to write a standalone Python file to reproduce the issue did not actually reproduce the reported problem but instead hit an unrelated error due to compatibility issues in the testing environment, specifically with `numpy` version compatibility. 

Let's correct the misunderstanding and attempt to focus on reproducing the intended issue regarding `xarray.Dataset.drop_sel` functionality without coordinates, as described in your initial request. The corrected script assumes that the `drop_sel` method should, ideally, support dropping by index positions directly or offer an alternative method like `drop_isel` for this purpose, as the issue described suggests adding such a feature or finding a workaround.

Here's an appropriate Python script designed to reproduce the reported issue, taking into account the outlined requirements:

```python
import numpy as np
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_drop_sel_without_coords():
    data = np.random.randn(2, 3)
    ds = xr.Dataset({"A": (["x", "y"], data)})
    
    try:
        # Attempting to drop indices in a dimension without coordinates
        modified_ds = ds.drop_sel(y=[1])
        assert False, "Expected a KeyError or ValueError for dropping by label in a dimension without coordinates"
    except (KeyError, ValueError) as e:
        print("Successfully caught expected issue:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as e:
        # Catching unexpected exceptions and reporting them
        print("An unexpected error occurred:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "The test encountered an unexpected error."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_drop_sel_without_coords()
```

This script checks if `drop_sel` fails as expected when trying to drop elements by label in a dimension that does not have coordinates and catches the error, printing the stack trace for debugging purposes. It is designed to assert a failure if the method does not raise a `KeyError` or `ValueError`, which aligns with the expected behavior based on the issue description.
