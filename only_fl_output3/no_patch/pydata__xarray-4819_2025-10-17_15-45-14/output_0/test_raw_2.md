To reproduce the specific issue as described, involving `xarray.Dataset.drop_sel` with dimensions that don't have coordinates, a Python script that correctly attempts this operation and catches the expected failure will be outlined below. My previous response might not have dirctly addressed the actual issue as described, so below is the corrected approach:

```python
import numpy as np
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def attempt_drop_sel_without_coords():
    data = np.random.randn(2, 3)
    ds = xr.Dataset({"A": (["x", "y"], data)})
    try:
        # This line is expected to cause an issue since 'y' dimension does not have coordinate labels for selection
        ds.drop_sel(y=[1])
        # If the above line does not raise an exception, the assumption about the current behavior is incorrect
        assert False, "The method should have raised an error but did not."
    except Exception as e:
        print("Issue encountered as expected:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # If any exception is caught, we consider the issue to be reproduced successfully.
        return
    
    # If the program reaches this point without exceptions, the issue was not reproduced as expected
    print("The issue was not reproduced.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    attempt_drop_sel_without_coords()
```

This script aims to directly address the inability to use `drop_sel` in cases where dimensions lack coordinate labels, as described in your feature request. The execution of this script should produce an error under the current functionality of `xarray`, effectively illustrating the problem. If the issue is present (i.e., the exception is raised as expected due to the lack of coordinate labels), the script catches and prints the stack trace, helping to identify the point of failure. If, in future versions of `xarray`, the issue is addressed (by, for example, introducing a `drop_isel` method or allowing `drop_sel` to work without coordinate labels), this script will need to catch a different set of exceptions or no exception at all, depending on the implementation.
