Here is one of them: \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/fe074c96a343530beea50fbdd0803d3e7b739e8e/django/db/models/fields/__init__.py#L1156-L1167\nFor example, in each of them, timezone.now() is called even when the return value isn't needed / won't be used.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address this issue effectively, we need to gather context about the implementation of `_check_fix_default_value()` methods within the Django project mentioned. Specifically, we want to understand how these methods are defined, how `timezone.now()` is used within them, and if and how this usage can be optimized. This will involve looking at the method implementations, any relevant class definitions, and possibly other code snippets that interact with these methods. The following API calls will help us gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the method in the given file**: This will help us find the definition of the `_check_fix_default_value()` method and understand its current implementation.\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_file('_check_fix_default_value', 'django/db/models/fields/__init__.py')\n   ```\n\n2. **Get code around the provided line number**: This will give us a detailed view of the implementation for the `_check_fix_default_value()` method mentioned in the issue, including the unnecessary `timezone.now()` call.\n   ```python\n   get_code_around_line('django/db/models/fields/__init__.py', 1156, 6)\n   ```\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how `_check_fix_default_value()` methods are implemented and where the potential optimizations can be made, specifically regarding the use of `timezone.now()`."
