Below is an example of the output of a test session in which the exception arises.  The test file contains only the function `test_temp` shown in the output.  A necessary condition for the exception is that *pytest*'s base temporary directory already contains at least three temporary directories to cause *pytest* to try to clean up at least one directory.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insight into how *pytest* handles the creation, management, and cleanup of temporary directories, which is central to the issue at hand. Here's an overview based on the returned API call results:\n\n### 1. `cleanup_numbered_dir` Function\n- **What it does**: This function is responsible for cleaning up lock-driven numbered directories. It first identifies cleanup candidates based on a root path, prefix, and retention policy (`keep` parameter), and attempts to clean them up. Afterwards, it searches for any directories prefixed with \"garbage-\" in the root path and tries to clean those up as well.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: The issue arises during the cleanup of these temporary directories. The error occurs while trying to handle directories that have been renamed to start with \"garbage-\". The suggestion made in the issue is to reverse the order of the `for` loops in this function to handle \"garbage-\" directories first, which supposedly mitigates the permission errors under certain conditions.\n- **Intended behavior**: Ideally, this function should safely and reliably clean up old temporary directories without triggering permission errors, ensuring that the system doesn't run out of space due to leftover temporary directories and also does not encounter errors due to locked or inaccessible resources.\n\n### 2. `try_cleanup` Function\n- **What it does**: Attempts to clean up a specified path if it can be safely deleted, determined by the `ensure_deletable` function. If the directory is deemed deletable, it proceeds with its deletion.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: This function directly interacts with the filesystem to delete directories and is where the `PermissionError` can be triggered. The error likely occurs because the directory or a file within it is locked or otherwise inaccessible at the time `try_cleanup` attempts to remove it.\n- **Intended behavior**: To attempt the cleanup of directories while handling any potential issues gracefully, including locked files or delayed filesystem operations, which can be common on Windows due to file locking semantics.\n\n### 3. `TempPathFactory` Class\n- **What it does**: Manages the creation of temporary directories for tests. It provides methods to create new temporary directories (`mktemp`), ensure paths are relative to a base temporary directory, and fetch the base temporary directory path for the session.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: This class is invoked within the test context that leads to the generation of temporary directories and, by extent, their cleanup. The way temporary paths are managed and cleaned up is central to the reported issue.\n- **Intended behavior**: To provide a reliable and controlled way of managing temporary directories for test cases, ensuring directories are created, used, and cleaned up efficiently and effectively without causing errors or resource leaks.\n\n### Further Analysis Needed\n- While the information gives a good starting point, further context could improve understanding, particularly how `ensure_deletable` works, since it's a key part of the decision logic around deletion.\n- Understanding the test scenario that produces the error could provide insights into why the issue occurs intermittently and under load. Although we didn't find the specific `test_temp` function in the search, dissecting similar test setups or usages of `TempPathFactory` might offer clues.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the above, additional API calls could be focused on:\n- `search_method(\"ensure_deletable\")` to understand the criteria for determining directory deletability.\n- Since the direct lookup for `def test_temp(tmp_path_factory):` failed, exploring how `TempPathFactory` is used in tests could be beneficial. This could potentially be approached by looking for examples of `mktemp` usage in the codebase via `search_method(\"mktemp\")`.\n\nThese steps aim to fill the gaps in understanding the specific conditions leading to the `PermissionError` and to validate the proposed fix's appropriateness within the broader codebase and operational logic of *pytest*."

This change is intended to minimize the occurrence of `PermissionError` during cleanup operations, especially under conditions where directories are being accessed or modified concurrently by other processes or by the system. The modification should ensure that the cleanup process is more robust and less prone to errors, particularly in environments where file access permissions are aggressively managed or delayed by the operating system. Beyond this adjustment, the existing functionality of the method, which includes identifying and properly disposing of old temporary directories according to the `keep` policy, should remain unchanged.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: File: src/_pytest/pathlib.py, Method: try_cleanup\n  - **Intended Behavior**: While the specific implementation details of `try_cleanup` do not seem faulty based on the provided context, ensuring that this method gracefully handles situations where a directory or file becomes inaccessible or locked between the check and the attempted deletion could further reduce the risk of encountering a `PermissionError`. Enhancements could include implementing a more robust retry logic or a better handling mechanism for OS-specific quirks related to file locks. The method should continue to ensure that directories are only attempted to be deleted when it is safe to do so, based on the `ensure_deletable` logic, but with improved resilience against transient access issues.\n\nThe proposed modifications aim at addressing the direct cause of the reported issue while maintaining the general contract and functionality of the involved methods."
