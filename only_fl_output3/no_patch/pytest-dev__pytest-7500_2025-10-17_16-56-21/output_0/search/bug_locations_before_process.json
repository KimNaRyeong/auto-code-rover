        "intended_behavior": "The `cleanup_numbered_dir` method should be modified to first attempt the cleanup of old directories prefixed with \"garbage-\" before handling other cleanup candidates. This change is intended to minimize the occurrence of `PermissionError` during cleanup operations, especially under conditions where directories are being accessed or modified concurrently by other processes or by the system. The modification should ensure that the cleanup process is more robust and less prone to errors, particularly in environments where file access permissions are aggressively managed or delayed by the operating system. Beyond this adjustment, the existing functionality of the method, which includes identifying and properly disposing of old temporary directories according to the `keep` policy, should remain unchanged."

        "method": "try_cleanup",
        "intended_behavior": "While the specific implementation details of `try_cleanup` do not seem faulty based on the provided context, ensuring that this method gracefully handles situations where a directory or file becomes inaccessible or locked between the check and the attempted deletion could further reduce the risk of encountering a `PermissionError`. Enhancements could include implementing a more robust retry logic or a better handling mechanism for OS-specific quirks related to file locks. The method should continue to ensure that directories are only attempted to be deleted when it is safe to do so, based on the `ensure_deletable` logic, but with improved resilience against transient access issues."
