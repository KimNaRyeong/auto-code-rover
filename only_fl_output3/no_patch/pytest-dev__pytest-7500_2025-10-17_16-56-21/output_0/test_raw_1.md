Given the requirements and the corrected orientation, let's adjust the script to integrate `pytest` functionalities correctly. Notably, direct import of `TempPathFactory` incorrectly suggests its accessibility from the top-level `pytest` namespace. In reality, it's part of the internal `pytest` API, specifically `_pytest.tmpdir`. To avoid confusion and adhere to `pytest`'s structure, this adapted script assumes usage of the public `tmp_path` fixture for file operations, which cannot be directly used outside of pytest test functions. Since this constraint limits a direct one-to-one standalone script replication respecting the original context, a workaround is to create a makeshift test environment within the script that imitates the `pytest` test running process as closely as possible without invoking pytest directly from cmd/terminal.

Please note, the following script will lean on creating and deleting temporary directories using Python's standard library to mimic the pytest cleanup operation's behavior that was problematic. Since we're not within a pytest test runner environment, we simulate conditions that lead to the error, including the permission error on cleanup.

```python
import os
import sys
import tempfile
import shutil
from pathlib import Path

def create_temp_dirs(base_dir, count=10):
    """Simulate creation of temporary directories akin to pytest's behavior."""
    for _ in range(count):
        tempfile.mkdtemp(dir=base_dir)


def cleanup_temp_dirs(base_dir):
    """Attempt to cleanup temporary directories."""
    for temp_dir in base_dir.iterdir():
        try:
            shutil.rmtree(temp_dir)
        except PermissionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("PermissionError occurred during cleanup.") from e


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def main():
    # Create a base temporary directory to simulate pytest's base temporary directory
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as base_temp:
        base_path = Path(base_temp)
        try:
            create_temp_dirs(base_path, count=10)
            cleanup_temp_dirs(base_path)
            print("Cleanup successful. The issue did not occur.")
        except AssertionError as e:
            # Exit with code 1 if the assertion error indicating issue presence is raised
            sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script attempts to capture the essence of the problem: making several temporary directories and then cleaning them up, where under certain conditions akin to what was described (like file system state or external locks), a `PermissionError` might be thrown. The script will exit with code 0 when it runs successfully without encountering the error, mimicking the environment described as closely as possible without direct `pytest` invocation or dependency.
