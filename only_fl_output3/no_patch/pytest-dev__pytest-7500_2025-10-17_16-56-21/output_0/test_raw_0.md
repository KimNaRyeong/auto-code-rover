To create a standalone Python script to reproduce the outlined issue, you can follow the guidance below. This script specifically tries to mimic the situation described, by rapidly creating and deleting temporary directories using `pytest`'s mechanisms in a conda environment.

This reproducer simulates the stress condition under which the `PermissionError` was observed. It directly interacts with pytest's temporary directory creation and deletion functionalities to replicate the scenario. However, it's important to note that since the issue is intermittent and more likely to appear under specific system load conditions, there might not be a guaranteed reproduction on every execution. Adjustments to the `NUM_ITERATIONS` variable can increase or decrease the load, potentially affecting the reproducibility of the issue.

```python
import os
import sys
import tempfile
from pytest import TempPathFactory

NUM_ITERATIONS = 1000

def main():
    try:
        # Create a base temporary directory
        with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as base_temp:
            # Initialize TempPathFactory with the base temporary directory
            tmp_path_factory = TempPathFactory(basetemp=base_temp)
            
            for _ in range(NUM_ITERATIONS):
                # Attempt to create a temporary directory,
                # which is immediately a candidate for cleanup
                tmp_path_factory.mktemp("temp")
                # Introducing cleanup call might not be directly necessary
                # as the issue is around automatic cleanup, but could simulate load

        # If we reach this point without exceptions, assume issue is not present
        print("No issues detected.")
        
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with non-zero to indicate error for the reproducer's context

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please ensure that you have pytest installed in your environment before running this script. The script attempts to closely simulate the environment and operations described in the issue report. Additionally, it handles exceptions by printing a detailed stack trace for diagnosis. Keep in mind that due to the inherent nature of the described error—being sporadic and influenced by system load, file system state, and timing—it might not consistently trigger on every run or in every environment setup. Adjust `NUM_ITERATIONS` or the conditions under which the directories are created and removed to better mimic the load conditions of your specific scenario.
