Creating a standalone Python script to accurately reproduce the specific `PermissionError` during pytest's cleanup phase is challenging outside of a pytest execution environment. The issue is inherently tied to pytest's temporary directory management (especially under Windows), where file locks or delayed cleanup operations by the OS lead to permission errors.

To simulate the pytest behavior and induce a similar condition, we'll create a script that sets up and tears down temporary directories in a manner resembling the original problem. This script attempts to manipulate file permissions to force a `PermissionError`. However, replicating the precise timing and resource management of pytest's cleanup process is difficult, and actual success in reproducing the issue might depend on the specific Windows version, file system state, or other concurrent operations affecting file access permissions.

Given these constraints, here's a standalone Python script (`reproducer.py`) that tries to mimic the scenario. This script does **not** guarantee to reproduce the `PermissionError` exactly as described with pytest but illustrates how one might encounter permission issues during directory cleanup on Windows. 

**Note:** The `.lock` file manipulation below is a heuristic and speculative approach to induce an error similar to the pytest scenario. Your system's security settings or Python's access might prevent this script from modifying file permissions in a way that reproduces the error.

```python
import os
import tempfile
import shutil
from pathlib import Path
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def simulate_pytest_cleanup():
    # Create a base temporary directory to mimic pytest's temp directory behavior
    base_temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    temp_dirs = [Path(tempfile.mkdtemp(dir=base_temp_dir)) for _ in range(3)]

    # Attempt to mimic .lock file behavior
    for temp_dir in temp_dirs:
        lock_file = temp_dir / ".lock"
        lock_file.touch()
        os.chmod(lock_file, 0o444)  # Make the file read-only to induce a permission error
    
    # Cleanup phase
    for temp_dir in temp_dirs:
        try:
            shutil.rmtree(temp_dir)
            print(f"Successfully cleaned up {temp_dir}")
        except PermissionError as e:
            os.chmod(temp_dir / ".lock", 0o666)  # Attempt to reset permission before cleanup
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("PermissionError occurred during cleanup. Reproduced the issue.") from e
    shutil.rmtree(base_temp_dir)  # Cleanup base directory

def main():
    try:
        simulate_pytest_cleanup()
    except AssertionError as error:
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate the issue was reproduced
    else:
        print("No issues encountered during cleanup.")
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script tries to replicate the specified issue outside its natural pytest environment by explicitly creating and cleaning up directories while manipulating file permissions to force a cleanup error. Successful execution (exit code 0) means the script could clean up without encountering the permission error, while an exit code 1 indicates that the issue was reproduced according to the script's logic.
