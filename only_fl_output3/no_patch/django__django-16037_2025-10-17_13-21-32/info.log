Specifically, the `Exists` subquery pattern and the `Count` aggregation need to be formulated such that they don't inadvertently pull in more columns than required. This might involve revisiting the way `OuterRef` and `Exists` are used in conjunction with `annotate` to ensure that only relevant fields are targeted and aggregated. The modification should preserve the method's functionality of enriching the `Post` queryset with boolean flags signaling the post's status relative to the `request_user` (e.g., liked by the user, owned by the user) and the `likes` count, but it should do so in a manner that's compatible with both SQLite and PostgreSQL, avoiding the structural query issues flagged in the described exception."
