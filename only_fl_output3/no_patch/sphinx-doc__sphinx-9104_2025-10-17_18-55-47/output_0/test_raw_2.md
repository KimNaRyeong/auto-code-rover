Given the complexity of reproducing Sphinx documentation compilation issues, particularly one related to a warning about a missing reference target in a Python docstring, a Python script that directly asserts whether the bug is fixed cannot be created in a straightforward manner. Sphinx does not raise Python exceptions for such warnings that could be caught with a try-except block typically used to assert conditions and raise an `AssertionError`.

However, I can provide you with a Python script template that mimics trying to catch Sphinx warnings as errors by running the Sphinx build process programmatically. This script can be adapted to check the Sphinx build output for specific warnings and 'fail' by raising an exception if such warnings are found.

This approach does involve directly invoking the Sphinx build process from a Python script and capturing its output for analysis:

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_sphinx_build():
    # Command to build Sphinx documentation
    command = ["python", "-m", "sphinx", "-b", "html", "docs", "docs/_build"]

    # Run command and capture output
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
        print("Sphinx build completed successfully.")
    
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print("Sphinx build failed.")
        print("Standard Output:", e.stdout)
        print("Error Output:", e.stderr)
        if "WARNING: py:class reference target not found: .." in e.stdout or "WARNING: py:class reference target not found: .." in e.stderr:
            raise AssertionError("Sphinx build detected the specific warning.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        run_sphinx_build()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code 1 if the specific warning is detected
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code 1 if any other error occurs during Sphinx build
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 if the build completes without detecting the specific warning
```

**Important Note:** This script assumes that the Sphinx build process can be invoked via `python -m sphinx` and that your project documentation source and build directories are `docs` and `docs/_build`, respectively. You may need to adjust these paths according to your actual project structure. Additionally, the detection of the specific warning message related to the Sphinx warning about missing reference targets is done through simple string searching in the output, which may need adjustment based on the exact wording of the warning you're checking for.

The script exits with code `0` when the specific warning is not found, indicating the issue might be fixed. It exits with code `1` when the warning is detected or if there's any other error running the Sphinx build, thus signalling the issue persists or there are other problems.
