This means ensuring that all references within the documentation are correctly spelled, fully qualified when necessary, and that Sphinx can locate them within the project's documentation structure. If ellipses (`...`) or other Python syntax are used in a way that Sphinx misinterprets, these instances may need to be either documented differently or configured within Sphinx to be understood correctly."
