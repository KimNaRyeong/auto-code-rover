From its [docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.IterativeImputer.html):\n> **initial_strategy {\u2018mean\u2019, \u2018median\u2019, \u2018most_frequent\u2019, \u2018constant\u2019}, default=\u2019mean\u2019**\n> Which strategy to use to initialize the missing values. Same as the strategy parameter in SimpleImputer.\nI have set the initial strategy to `\"constant\"`. However, I want to define this constant myself. So, as I look at the parameters for `SimpleImputer` I find `fill_value`:\n>When strategy == \u201cconstant\u201d, fill_value is used to replace all occurrences of missing_values. If left to the default, fill_value will be 0 when imputing numerical data and \u201cmissing_value\u201d for strings or object data types.\nBased on this information, one would assume that `IterativeImputer` also has the parameter `fill_value`, but it does not.\n### Describe your proposed solution\nThe parameter `fill_value` needs to be added to `IterativeImputer` for when `initial_strategy` is set to `\"constant\"`. If this parameter is added, please also allow `np.nan` as `fill_value`, for optimal compatibility with decision tree-based estimators.\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, let's address each piece of information with the specified questions in mind:\n\n### Context from `IterativeImputer` Class\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `IterativeImputer` class constructor defines its initialization parameters, including `initial_strategy` but lacks a `fill_value` parameter. Among the methods, `_initial_imputation` suggests handling the initial imputation step, which is directly relevant to the issue. Also, the `fit` method prepares the imputer based on the provided dataset.\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Given that `IterativeImputer` lacks a `fill_value` parameter, it indirectly points to the place where modifications are likely needed. Specifically, the handling of `initial_strategy` and how initial imputation values are determined without the currently non-existent `fill_value` parameter.\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Introducing a `fill_value` parameter would require modifications within the initializer to accept this new parameter. Moreover, the logic in `_initial_imputation` or related methods likely needs adjustment to handle a custom `fill_value` when `initial_strategy` is set to \"constant\".\n\n### Context from `SimpleImputer` Class\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - `SimpleImputer` is initialized with a `fill_value` parameter, among others, and contains logic (potentially in `_dense_fit` and `_sparse_fit`) to apply this fill value based on the chosen strategy.\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The implementation of `fill_value` in `SimpleImputer` serves as a blueprint for introducing similar functionality into `IterativeImputer`. Understanding how `SimpleImputer` uses `fill_value` helps in designing a compatible feature for `IterativeImputer`.\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - For `SimpleImputer`, the intended behavior is clear and functional \u2013 when the strategy is \"constant\", use `fill_value` as the replacement for missing values. The goal is to replicate a part of this behavior in `IterativeImputer` concerning its initial imputation needs.\n\n### Context from `IterativeImputer`'s `fit` Method\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `fit` method essentially prepares the `IterativeImputer` for operation by fitting it using the provided dataset.\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - While the `fit` method itself doesn't directly deal with setting initial values for missing data, it's the entry point for the imputation process, which eventually leads to the initial imputation step where `fill_value` would be relevant.\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Although the `fit` method might not change significantly with the addition of a `fill_value` parameter, understanding its workflow is crucial since it initiates the processes where `initial_strategy` and eventual handling of a `fill_value` come into play.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps toward crafting a patch would involve detailing how and where to introduce the `fill_value` parameter within the `IterativeImputer` class, ensuring it's properly utilized when `initial_strategy=\"constant\"` is specified. This would likely involve modifications in the constructor to include `fill_value` and adjustments in methods such as `_initial_imputation` to apply it as intended."

This parameter should be used when `initial_strategy=\"constant\"` to specify the constant value used for initial imputation of missing values. The parameter should by default be `None` (or an appropriate value that is current for default behavior), allowing users to specify custom fill values, including `np.nan` for compatibility with decision tree-based estimators. The existing functionality should remain unchanged for other `initial_strategy` values, preserving backward compatibility.\n   \n   - **Location 2:**\n     - **File:** sklearn/impute/_iterative.py\n     - **Method:** `_initial_imputation`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** Modify the `_initial_imputation` method (or where initial imputation is handled if not directly in this method) to take into account the new `fill_value` parameter when `initial_strategy=\"constant\"` is set. The method should use the `fill_value` specified by the user for the initial imputation of missing values. This change should allow more flexibility in handling missing values initially, particularly useful in situations where the default mean or median strategies are not appropriate, without affecting other strategies (`\"mean\"`, `\"median\"`, `\"most_frequent\"`).\n   \nThese changes intend to enhance the `IterativeImputer` by introducing customizable initial fill values for missing data, directly addressing the issue described while ensuring that the imputer's functionality is extended in a manner consistent with users' expectations based on the behavior of `SimpleImputer`."
