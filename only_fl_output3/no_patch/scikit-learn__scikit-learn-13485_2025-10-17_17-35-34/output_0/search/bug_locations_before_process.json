        "intended_behavior": "The `fit` method in `CalibratedClassifierCV` should handle 3D inputs for scenarios that require such a data structure, like pairs of points in metric learning. To resolve the issue without removing the necessary validation checks that ensure data integrity and correctness, the call to `check_array` within this method (if directly invoked here) should be modified to allow for 3-dimensional inputs by setting `allow_nd=True`. This change must ensure that the acceptance of 3D inputs does not bypass other critical validations such as checking for finite values, proper dtype, etc. The modification should thus be constrained to permitting 3D arrays while still enforcing other validation rules, preserving the method's existing functionalities and guarantees for 2D inputs."
