        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the `Coarsen` class and its `construct` method in xarray provides insight into both the functionality and potential sources of the reported bug where non-dimensional coordinates are demoted to variables after coarsening.\n\n### What does this part of the code do?\n\n1. **`Coarsen` Class Structure:** The `Coarsen` class is defined in `xarray/core/rolling.py` and inherits from `CoarsenArithmetic`. It is designed to manage the coarsening operations on `DataArray` or `Dataset` objects in xarray, which involves reducing the resolution of data by combining multiple adjacent values into a single value according to specified windows for each dimension.\n\n2. **`construct` Method:** The `construct` method within the `Coarsen` class takes a coarsened object and reshapes or splits its dimensions into new dimensions according to the specified window dimensions. This method allows splitting a single dimension into two new dimensions after coarsening, which is often useful for interpreting the coarsened data more effectively.\n\n### Relationship between this part of the code and the bug\n\nThe issue reported is related to how non-dimensional coordinates are treated during the construction process after coarsening. Specifically, the expectation is that variables initially set as coordinates before the coarsening process should retain their coordinate status afterward. However, as users have observed, these are demoted to regular variables instead, which is not the intended behavior.\n\nLooking closer at the `construct` method code snippet, particularly lines 976 to 981, we see that the method attempts to set certain variables back as coordinates based on the intersection of window dimensions and original coordinates (`should_be_coords = set(window_dim) & set(self.obj.coords)`). This suggests that the method does have a mechanism intended to preserve coordinate status for some of the variables after coarsening, but it may not be fully achieving this aim, hence leading to the reported issue.\n\n### Intended Behavior of This Part of the Code\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior would be for the `construct` method to accurately identify and maintain the coordinate status of all applicable variables during the coarsening process. This implies that the logic for determining which variables should remain or be re-assigned as coordinates needs to be scrutinized and possibly enhanced to ensure it comprehensively covers all cases, especially for non-dimensional coordinates that seem to be affected by the current implementation.\n\nThe key to resolving the issue likely lies in how the method distinguishes between different types of coordinates (dimensional vs. non-dimensional) and how it ensures they are preserved or reinstated appropriately after the coarsening operation is performed. The current methodology for maintaining attributes and re-assigning coordinates may need to be adjusted to specifically address the preservation of non-dimensional coordinates through this process."

This can be achieved by refining the logic that decides which variables are reinstated as coordinates after coarsening. Specifically, the method needs to ensure that:\n   - All variables that were coordinates (both dimensional and non-dimensional) before the `coarsen.construct` operation retain their coordinate status afterwards.\n   - The method to set coordinates (`should_be_coords = set(window_dim) & set(self.obj.coords)`) likely needs to be adjusted to also consider non-dimensional coordinates explicitly, which may not be adequately captured by the current logic.\n   - The logic for handling and maintaining attributes (`reshaped.attrs = obj.attrs if keep_attrs else {}`) appears suitable for dimensional data but should be reviewed to ensure it fully supports non-dimensional coordinate attributes as well.\n   - The preservation of non-dimensional coordinates as coordinates post-coarsening could involve more explicit identification and handling of these cases within the `construct` method.\n\n   Resolving the issue thus involves ensuring that the `construct` method treats non-dimensional coordinates with the same considerations as dimensional coordinates during the coarsening process, ensuring they are not incorrectly demoted to variables. This requires a careful review and possible enhancement of how coordinates are identified and preserved throughout the method."
