Given the detailed issue description provided, the following steps will utilize the search APIs to gather context:\n\n1. Find the definition of the `Coarsen` class to understand its structure and relationships with other parts of the xarray codebase.\n2. Locate the `construct` method within the `Coarsen` class to examine its implementation details, which could be directly related to the reported bug.\n3. Review the usage of non-dimensional coordinates and how they are handled during the coarsening process, which might involve the interaction between the `DataArray`, `Dataset`, and possibly other components managing coordinates.\n\nWe'll begin by executing the relevant search API calls to gather the necessary information:\n\n- `search_class(\"Coarsen\")`: Retrieves locations and references of the `Coarsen` class in the xarray project.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"construct\", \"Coarsen\")`: Finds the `construct` method within the `Coarsen` class to inspect how it processes coordinates and variables."
