        "intended_behavior": "The `construct` method should ensure that it accurately maintains the coordinate status of all variables, including non-dimensional coordinates, during and after the coarsening process. This can be achieved by refining the logic that decides which variables are reinstated as coordinates after coarsening. Specifically, the method needs to ensure that: \n- All variables that were coordinates (both dimensional and non-dimensional) before the `coarsen.construct` operation retain their coordinate status afterwards. \n- The method to set coordinates (`should_be_coords = set(window_dim) & set(self.obj.coords)`) likely needs to be adjusted to also consider non-dimensional coordinates explicitly, which may not be adequately captured by the current logic. \n- The logic for handling and maintaining attributes (`reshaped.attrs = obj.attrs if keep_attrs else {}`) appears suitable for dimensional data but should be reviewed to ensure it fully supports non-dimensional coordinate attributes as well. \n- The preservation of non-dimensional coordinates as coordinates post-coarsening could involve more explicit identification and handling of these cases within the `construct` method."
