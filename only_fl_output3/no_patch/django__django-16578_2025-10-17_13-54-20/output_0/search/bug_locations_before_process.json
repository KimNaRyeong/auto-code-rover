        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `__init__` method to accept its arguments as keyword-only. This means updating the method definition from `def __init__(self, name, violation_error_message=None):` to `def __init__(self, *, name, violation_error_message=None):`. The inclusion of the asterisk (`*`) before `name` denotes that all following arguments must be specified as keyword arguments. This change enforces clearer and more explicit use of the `BaseConstraint` constructor, aligning with the discussed enhancement in code readability and maintenance, without altering the underlying functionality of the method or the class. The method's internal logic, which assigns values to `self.name` and decides the `self.violation_error_message` based on whether it is provided or defaulting to `self.default_violation_error_message`, remains unchanged. This preserves the existing functionality while adapting the method signature to a keyword-only format."
