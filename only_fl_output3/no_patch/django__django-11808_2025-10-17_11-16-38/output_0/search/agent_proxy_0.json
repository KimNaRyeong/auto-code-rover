The issue mentions the specific behavior of `Model.__eq__` and points to its location on GitHub, suggesting it's within `django/db/models/base.py`. However, since the exact line number might have changed due to subsequent code changes, we need to search for the `__eq__` method in the context of the `Model` class explicitly. Let's start with these search API calls to ensure we have the right method implementation and any related code:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Model\")` - To confirm the file location of the `Model` class in Django's codebase.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__eq__\", \"Model\")` - To get the implementation details of the `__eq__` method within the `Model` class."
