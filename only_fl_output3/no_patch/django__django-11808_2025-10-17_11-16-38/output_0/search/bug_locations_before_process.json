        "intended_behavior": "The `__eq__` method needs to be updated to conform with Python's data model guidance, specifically to handle unknown or incompatible comparison objects more gracefully. The change involves checking the type of the `other` object and returning `NotImplemented` instead of `False` when `other` is not an instance of `Model`. This modification allows Python's comparison handling to attempt the reverse comparison or default to the identity comparison, thus avoiding premature determination of inequality. This update preserves the existing functionality of comparing Django model instances while improving interoperability with Python's type comparison system, especially in cases like mock comparisons during testing. To achieve this, the following alteration is proposed: - Before returning `False` when `other` is not an instance of a `Model`, the method should return `NotImplemented`. This will allow Python to handle the comparison more appropriately according to its own data model rules. The rest of the method's logic remains unchanged, ensuring that the equality comparison between model instances behaves as intended when dealing with actual Django model objects."
