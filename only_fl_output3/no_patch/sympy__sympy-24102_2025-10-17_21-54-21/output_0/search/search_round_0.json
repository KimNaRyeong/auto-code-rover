Based on the details provided in the issue, it's clear that the focus is on comparing the behavior of the deprecated `mathematica` function with the new `parse_mathematica` function. Therefore, we will need to look into the implementation details of both functions and any supporting classes or utilities they rely on for parsing.\n\nHere are the API calls we should make to gather the necessary context:\n\n- search_method(\"mathematica\"): To get the location and context of the deprecated `mathematica` function mentioned in the issue.\n- search_method(\"parse_mathematica\"): To find the implementation details of the `parse_mathematica` function that is currently not parsing Greek characters correctly.\n- search_code(\"sympy.parsing.mathematica\"): To find any other relevant code snippets within the `sympy.parsing.mathematica` module that might be related to this issue, such as utility functions or classes used by both the deprecated and new parsing functions.\n\nThese API calls will help us to understand the changes between the deprecated and the new function, and potentially identify why Greek characters are no longer being parsed correctly."
