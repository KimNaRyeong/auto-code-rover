This script is designed to reproduce the issue described:
- It will attempt to parse a Greek character using `parse_mathematica` from the `sympy.parsing.mathematica` module.
- If the parsing fails and raises an exception, the script will catch this exception and use the `print_stacktrace` function to print the stack trace, making the line numbers and error message clear.
- An `AssertionError` is raised afterward to explicitly indicate that the issue is present.
- In the event that `parse_mathematica` no longer raises an exception (implying that the issue has been fixed), the script will print a message indicating that the issue seems to be fixed and exit with code 0.
