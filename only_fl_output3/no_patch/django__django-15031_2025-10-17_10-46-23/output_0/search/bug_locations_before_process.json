        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the `prepare_lookup_value` method needs to be modified to allow values with commas to be included without being mistakenly split. This could involve introducing a mechanism for escaping commas within values or a different approach to parsing the list of values provided for `__in` lookups. Specifically, the implementation should be updated to: - Recognize and correctly handle values containing escaped commas (for example, using a backslash `\\,` or another form of escaping) in the input string for `__in` lookup keys. - Ensure that escaped commas are not treated as delimiters, thus allowing the inclusion of values with commas. - The existing functionality of splitting the input string by commas for `__in` lookups should be preserved for cases where values do not contain intended commas. This preserves the existing functionality for standard use cases while addressing the issue of including values with commas in `__in` lookups."
