        "intended_behavior": "The `to_python` method should handle non-numeric types, such as dictionaries, gracefully by raising a `ValidationError` instead of allowing a `TypeError` to be raised. Before attempting the conversion to `Decimal`, there should be an explicit check to ensure that the provided value is of a type that can be sensibly converted to a decimal. If the value is not of an appropriate type, the method should raise a `ValidationError` with an error message indicating that the provided value is not a valid decimal number. This change aims to improve error reporting and debugging by ensuring that errors related to decimal field values are consistently represented as validation issues rather than type or value errors. This will preserve the existing functionality of correctly handling valid numeric strings and numeric types while improving the handling of invalid input types."
