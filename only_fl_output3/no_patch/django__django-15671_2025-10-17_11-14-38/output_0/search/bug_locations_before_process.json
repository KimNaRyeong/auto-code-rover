        "intended_behavior": "The functionality of `inlineformset_factory` is not inherently buggy, but to address the issue, there might need to be an enhancement or clarification in the documentation or implementation regarding how `error_messages` can be customized when creating an inline formset. This would involve ensuring that when `error_messages` are passed to `inlineformset_factory`, they are thoroughly used to override any default error messages in the FormSet, specifically messages related to \"too many forms\" or \"too few forms\". The preservation of existing functionality is critical; thus, any modifications or enhancements should not alter the current behavior for users who do not wish to customize error messages."
