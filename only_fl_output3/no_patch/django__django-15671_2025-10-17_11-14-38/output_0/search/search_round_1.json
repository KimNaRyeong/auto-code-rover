        "content": "The collected context from the API calls reveals a specific area of interest and some pathways for further investigation:\n\n1. **inlineformset_factory** revealed in `django/forms/models.py`: This method is crucial for dynamically creating inline formsets tied to a parent model. It accepts a wide range of parameters, including `error_messages`, which directly relates to the issue at hand. The existence of this parameter suggests that there's already some mechanism to override error messages at this level, which is promising for addressing the issue. Since the issue mentions a preference for overriding error messages via `inlineformset_factory` in the future, understanding how `error_messages` is currently handled here is a vital clue.\n\n    - **What does this part of the code do?**\n      The method constructs a FormSet class tailored to a specified model, considering various customizations, including error messages. It's designed to facilitate the creation of formsets that are directly linked to a specific model and a foreign key relationship, with considerable flexibility.\n    \n    - **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n      This method is closely related to the issue since it deals with error messages among many other parameters. It indicates that Django already has a provision for customizing error messages at the FormSet level, albeit through this factory method. The mention of `error_messages` in the parameters section is a direct link to the issue's suggestion of moving instance-specific error messages to something more easily overridden at instantiation, potentially including through `inlineformset_factory`.\n    \n    - **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n      Ideally, the code should allow for the easy overriding of default error messages that inform the user about the number of forms that are too few or too many in a FormSet. This would involve ensuring that the `error_messages` parameter effectively overrides default messages at both the FormSet class level and when FormSets are instantiated via `inlineformset_factory`.\n\nGiven the absence of hits for the `FormSet` class in our initial search and the missing `formset.py` file, we need to reconsider our approach. Since there's no direct hit for `FormSet`, it probably means one of two things: either the class name isn't exactly `FormSet` (it could be a subclass, for example, `BaseFormSet`, or a related variant), or our initial search term wasn't precise enough. Similarly, the absence of `formset.py` could suggest the class resides in a different module than initially guessed, or the implementation details are encapsulated in a differently named file.\n\nConsidering the new insights and remaining questions, subsequent API calls should focus on:\n\n1. Expanding the search to include base or variant classes of FormSet, like `BaseFormSet`.\n2. Searching within the broader file (`django/forms/models.py`) or similar paths for the error messages handling logic that might be related to FormSets.\n\nLet's plan the next set of API calls based on these insights:\n\n- `search_class(\"BaseFormSet\")`: To understand if there's a base class that we previously missed.\n- `search_code(\"default_error_messages\")`: To see if there's a broader context where default error messages are defined that we might leverage for the FormSets.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"error_messages\", \"django/forms/models.py\")`: Given we've found `inlineformset_factory` here, further inspection might reveal more about how error messages are managed or overridden in this context."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

This would involve ensuring that when `error_messages` are passed to `inlineformset_factory`, they are thoroughly used to override any default error messages in the FormSet, specifically messages related to \"too many forms\" or \"too few forms\". The preservation of existing functionality is critical; thus, any modifications or enhancements should not alter the current behavior for users who do not wish to customize error messages.\n\nGiven that the initial searches did not identify specific locations in the `FormSet` class or related files where the default error messages are set or handled, and considering the absence of a `FormSet` class in the search results, it suggests the need for a more nuanced approach to resolving the issue than directly modifying a method's behavior. The intention is to implement a solution that allows for greater flexibility in customizing error messages without disrupting the existing mechanisms that Django provides for form management and validation."
