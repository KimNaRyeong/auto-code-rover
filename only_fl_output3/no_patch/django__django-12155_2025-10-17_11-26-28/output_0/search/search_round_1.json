This function aims to uniformly trim leading and trailing whitespace from docstrings, following the process outlined in PEP 257 for handling docstring indentation.\n\n#### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\n- The function checks if the input `docstring` is empty or consists only of whitespace; if true, it returns an empty string.\n- It converts tabs into spaces and splits the docstring into lines.\n- It calculates the minimum indentation of all lines that contain more than just whitespace, excluding the first line as per the current implementation. This is where the bug originates.\n- The trimming process adjusts each line based on this calculated indentation, removing it from the start where applicable, thereby normalizing the docstring's indentation.\n- The first line is treated specially: it is stripped of leading spaces, but its indentation is not adjusted based on the rest of the docstring.\n- The function returns the entire docstring with uniform indentation and without leading or trailing empty lines.\n\n#### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe bug originates from how the indentation is calculated. According to the issue description, the current implementation fails when the first line of the docstring is not empty. This is because the calculation of minimum indentation does not exclude the first line which, if it follows the usual convention, would not be indented relative to the docstring block.\n\nIn the current implementation, the first line\u2019s lack of indentation mistakenly sets the `indent` variable to 0, which is incorrect for docstrings where the first line directly follows the opening triple quotes and subsequent lines are indented. This effectively breaks the docstring rendering when using documentation tools that adhere to a different docstring format than what Django expects.\n\n#### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior, according to the issue report, should allow for the first line of a docstring to contain text immediately after the opening triple-quotes without causing rendering errors. This suggests that the `trim_docstring` function should adapt to different docstring styles, including those where the first line is not empty.\n\nTo resolve the issue, `trim_docstring` needs to be modified to calculate the indentation level starting from the second line of the docstring (if there is more than one line). This change would make the function more versatile, accommodating docstrings that start with an immediately non-empty first line by not incorrectly setting the indentation level based on the first line's lack of indentation.\n\nThe solution proposed in the issue description aligns with this analysis: adjusting the calculation of `indent` to skip the first line when determining the minimum indentation will prevent the error from occurring, thereby allowing the function to handle a wider variety of docstring formats correctly."

To resolve the issue, the calculation of the `indent` variable needs modification to skip the first line when determining the minimum indentation of the remaining lines. This change should only affect how indentation is calculated and should preserve the existing functionality for docstrings that follow the current expected format (i.e., with the first line empty). The specific modification proposed to preserve existing functionality while accommodating the described issue is to change the line calculating the `indent` variable from:\n    ```python\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n    ```\n    to:\n    ```python\n    indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip()) if len(lines) > 1 else 0\n    ```\n    This ensures that if there's more than one line, the first line's indentation level is ignored during the calculation, preventing the reported error and allowing for immediate start text on the first line of a docstring."
