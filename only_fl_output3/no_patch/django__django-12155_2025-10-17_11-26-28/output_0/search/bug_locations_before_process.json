        "intended_behavior": "The `trim_docstring` method is designed to ensure uniform trimming of leading and trailing whitespaces from docstrings, adapting to different styles of docstring formats, especially those that start the text immediately on the first line. To resolve the issue, the calculation of the `indent` variable needs modification to skip the first line when determining the minimum indentation of the remaining lines. This change should only affect how indentation is calculated and should preserve the existing functionality for docstrings that follow the current expected format (i.e., with the first line empty). The specific modification proposed to preserve existing functionality while accommodating the described issue is to change the line calculating the `indent` variable from:\n```python\nindent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\n```\nto:\n```python\nindent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines[1:] if line.lstrip()) if len(lines) > 1 else 0\n```\nThis ensures that if there's more than one line, the first line's indentation level is ignored during the calculation, preventing the reported error and allowing for immediate start text on the first line of a docstring."
