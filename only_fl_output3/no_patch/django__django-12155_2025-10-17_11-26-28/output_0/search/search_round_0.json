Specifically, we are looking for where `trim_docstring` is implemented and used, as it seems to be a crucial part of understanding how docstrings are processed and how the proposed solution might be integrated.\n\n1. To find where `trim_docstring` is defined:\n   - `search_method(\"trim_docstring\")`\n   \n2. To understand the implementation detail mentioned in the issue (the current line of code that is causing the problem and the proposed solution), it's essential to see the specific code snippet and its surrounding context:\n   - `search_code(\"indent = min(len(line) - len(line.lstrip()) for line in lines if line.lstrip())\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive understanding of the current implementation and how it could be adapted to resolve the described issue."
