Below is a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the given issue. The script attempts to create objects that involve multi-table inheritance (MTI) with a somewhat intricate inheritance structure (as described in your issue). It uses Django's ORM system, so it assumes that Django is installed and is set up correctly with a database that can be used for testing. Modify the database settings in the `DATABASES` dictionary if necessary to match your environment. This script will raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present by checking for the specific error and will print a detailed stack trace using the provided function. 

If the issue does not occur (meaning the bug is fixed, and the object creation does not raise an exception), the script should exit normally with code 0.

```python
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.test.utils import setup_test_environment, teardown_test_environment
from django.core.management import call_command

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

    DEBUG=True,

        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=('__main__',),
    USE_TZ=True,
)

    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    address = models.CharField(max_length=255)

class Restaurant(Place):
    serves_pizza = models.BooleanField(default=False)

class ItalianRestaurant(Restaurant):
    serves_gnocchi = models.BooleanField(default=False)

class ItalianRestaurantManyParents(ItalianRestaurant, Place):
    pass

class Supplier(Place):
    customers = models.ManyToManyField(Restaurant, related_name="provider")


django.setup()
setup_test_environment()
call_command('migrate')

# Attempt to reproduce the issue
try:
    ItalianRestaurantManyParents.objects.create(
        name="Ristorante Miron",
        address="1234 W. Ash",
    )
    print("No issue detected.")
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise AssertionError("The issue is present.") from e
finally:
    teardown_test_environment()

```

Ensure you have Django installed in your environment (`pip install django`), and adjust the `DATABASES` setting if needed (for example, if you prefer to test against a PostgreSQL or MySQL database instead of SQLite).

You can run this script with the `python3 reproducerer.py` command. If the issue is still present in the Django version you're using, it should print a detailed stack trace as per your requirement. If the issue is fixed in a future Django release, the script should indicate that no issue was detected.
