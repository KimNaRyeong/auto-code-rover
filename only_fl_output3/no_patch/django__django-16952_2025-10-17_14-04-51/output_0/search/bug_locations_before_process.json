        "intended_behavior": "The `_save_parents` method should ensure that when saving models with complex multi-table inheritance, including scenarios with multiple parents (diamond inheritance or otherwise), it correctly handles the link fields without throwing an `AttributeError`. Specifically, the method should: Verify the presence of an `attname` attribute for all link fields (`OneToOneField` or otherwise) involved in the inheritance chain. This involves ensuring that the code gracefully handles scenarios where a link field might not exhibit the expected attributes due to the complexity of the MTI structure. Correctly assign or propagate primary key values (and potentially other necessary field values) from parent models to child models, ensuring that database integrity and referential links are maintained without error. Incorporate additional logic or checks, if necessary, to account for the intricate MTI scenarios where a standard handling of link fields and attribute assignments might not suffice. This could involve refining the condition on lines 913-914 or adding supplementary condition statements to manage edge cases more effectively. The resolution should ensure that the creation of objects through Django's ORM can handle any form or complexity of model inheritance without raising exceptions due to handling link fields. This fix should preserve the current functionality for simpler inheritance models while extending support to cover the edge cases introduced by nested, complex, or multiple inheritance paths, ensuring robust, error-free object creation across the board."
