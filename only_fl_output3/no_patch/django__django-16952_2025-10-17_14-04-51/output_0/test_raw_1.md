Given the error produced earlier, it appears there was an issue with the Django apps not being fully ready when models were defined. To ensure the app registry is ready and models are defined in a Django-compatible manner, let's adjust the handling of settings and model setup in the `reproducer.py` script. We'll make sure Django is correctly configured before defining and using models.

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import sys
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.core.management import call_command

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if not settings.configured:
    settings.configure(
        SECRET_KEY='a-very-secret-key',
        DEBUG=True,
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': ':memory:',
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=(
            '__main__',  # This app is needed to let Django know where to find the models
        ),
        USE_TZ=True,
    )

django.setup()

# Models definition (should be after django.setup())
class Place(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    address = models.CharField(max_length=255)

class Restaurant(Place):
    serves_pizza = models.BooleanField(default=False)

class ItalianRestaurant(Restaurant):
    serves_gnocchi = models.BooleanField(default=False)

class ItalianRestaurantManyParents(ItalianRestaurant, Place):
    pass

class Supplier(Place):
    customers = models.ManyToManyField(Restaurant, related_name="provider")

# Reproducing the issue after setting up models and migrations.
def reproduce():
    call_command('migrate')
    
    try:
        ItalianRestaurantManyParents.objects.create(
            name="Ristorante Miron",
            address="1234 W. Ash",
        )
        print("No issue detected.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce()
```

This revised version includes direct calls to configure Django settings and execute `django.setup()` before defining models and attempting to reproduce the issue. The script is intended to be self-contained and executable in the environment where Django is installed.

To run this script:

1. Ensure Django is installed in your environment. If Django is not installed, run `pip install django`.
2. Save the above script as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your Django project (or any place if you are testing it standalone given the SQLite in-memory setup).
3. Execute the script using `python3 reproducer.py`.

The script will attempt to reproduce the described issue by creating an object that triggers the multi-table inheritance problem. If the issue is present, it will print a stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function and raise an `AssertionError`. If the issue is fixed in your environment/Django version, the script will indicate that no issue was detected and will exit with code 0.
