        "intended_behavior": "The constructor correctly initializes the `CountVectorizer` object, handling the `input` parameter. However, to resolve the issue, within the scope of `__init__` or possibly in other subsequent methods (`fit`, `fit_transform`, etc.), logic needs to ensure that when `input='filename'` is specified, the files listed in the input iterable are correctly read and their contents passed to the custom analyzer if provided. This logic does not currently seem to handle the specific case of `input='filename'` especially in conjunction with a custom analyzer, and thus it should be updated to do so while preserving existing functionality for other `input` values."

        "method": "fit",
        "intended_behavior": "The 'fit' method should, depending on the `input` parameter and presence of a custom `analyzer`, adapt its behavior to handle file inputs specifically. If the `input` is set to 'filename', the method should ensure files are read, and their contents are passed through the custom analyzer before continuing with the rest of the fit process. This requires integrating a step to check the `input` type and process files as necessary right at the beginning of the `fit` or `fit_transform` method before the actual vectorization process starts. The intended behavior here is to accommodate file inputs seamlessly, just as it does for raw text inputs, thereby extending the versatility of the `CountVectorizer` to users providing filenames directly."
