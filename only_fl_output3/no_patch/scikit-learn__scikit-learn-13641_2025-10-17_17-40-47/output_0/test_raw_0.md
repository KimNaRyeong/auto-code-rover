To address the described task, I will create a Python script named `reproducer.py`. This script attempts to reproduce the issue where `CountVectorizer` with a custom analyzer ignores the `input` argument when it's set to `'filename'` or `'file'`. The expected behavior is that `CountVectorizer` should take the `input` argument into account and behave accordingly, which in this case means treating the input as a filename or file and processing it with the given custom analyzer. 

However, based on the description, the `CountVectorizer` behaves incorrectly by ignoring the `input` type, potentially treating every input as raw text despite the input type. This script will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present and will print a stack trace of the issue. If the issue is fixed (meaning the `CountVectorizer` starts to respect the `input` parameter as expected), the script will exit with code 0 and not raise an exception.

Here is the complete `reproducer.py` script:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_temp_file(content):
    temp_file_path = 'temp_file.txt'
    with open(temp_file_path, 'w') as temp_file:
        temp_file.write(content)
    return temp_file_path

def main():
    try:
        # Creating a temporary file to simulate reading from file
        temp_file_path = create_temp_file('hello world')
        
        # Initialize CountVectorizer with a custom analyzer and input='filename'
        cv = CountVectorizer(analyzer=lambda x: x.split(), input='filename')
        
        # Attempt to fit CountVectorizer on the temporary file
        # Expectation: The vectorizer reads from the file and applies the custom analyzer
        cv.fit([temp_file_path])
        
        # Check if vocabulary is as expected
        expected_vocab = {'hello': 0, 'world': 1}
        assert cv.vocabulary_ == expected_vocab, "Vocabulary does not match the expected output."
        print("Issue not found: CountVectorizer respects the 'input' argument with a custom analyzer.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    finally:
        # Cleanup: Remove the temporary file
        if os.path.exists(temp_file_path):
            os.remove(temp_file_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This script operates by creating a temporary file with the content meant to be split by the custom analyzer ('hello world'). It then initializes `CountVectorizer` with this custom analyzer and sets the `input` to `'filename'`, expecting that it will read from the file, apply the analyzer, and result in a correct vocabulary. If there's a mismatch or an error due to the `input` parameter being ignored, the script will raise and print the traceback of an `AssertionError`, indicating the issue is present. If the vocabulary matches the expected outcome, it means the issue has been addressed, and the script will exit normally with a message indicating no issue was found.
