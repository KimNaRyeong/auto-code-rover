        "intended_behavior": "The decorator `sensitive_variables` should ensure that when it's applied to a function, it does not modify the function's signature in any way that would interfere with `inspect.getcallargs` or similar introspection tools. The decorator needs to maintain all original function metadata, including arguments, in a way that allows for the original function signature to be accurately introspected. The core functionality of hiding or masking sensitive variables during logging or in error reports must remain intact. This may involve refining how `functools.wraps` is used or adjusted within the decorator to ensure it precisely preserves the decorated function's signatures."

        "intended_behavior": "The `authenticate` method's usage of `inspect.getcallargs` to validate backend `authenticate` method signatures before calling them should be reviewed to ensure it correctly handles methods decorated with `sensitive_variables`. While the direct implementation might not be at fault, understanding its interaction with decorated methods might reveal necessary adjustments to accommodate any changes proposed in fixing `sensitive_variables`. The goal here is to preserve the method's functionality of iterating through authentication backends and trying to authenticate with the provided credentials, ensuring backends decorated with `sensitive_variables` do not cause unexpected TypeErrors."
