        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue mentioned, we need to focus on how JSON data is handled in Django admin, especially when the data includes Unicode characters like Chinese. Specifically, we need to explore the serialization process of JSON fields in Django, how they are displayed in the admin interface, and any customization or overrides applied for handling Unicode characters in `JSONField`.\n\nGiven the issue description, we should look into the following areas:\n1. **Django admin customization for `JSONField`**: Since the problem occurs in the Django admin, we should look into any customizations or overrides specific to displaying `JSONField`.\n2. **Serialization of Chinese characters in JSON**: The issue mentions that `json.dumps` uses ASCII encoding by default, which leads to the serialization of Chinese characters into ASCII. We need to find where `json.dumps` is called with respect to `JSONField` serialization.\n3. **Pull request mentioned for a fix**: Although directly accessing the pull request isn't possible through these APIs, we can look for any recent changes or patches applied to relevant files or methods that might address this issue.\n\nBased on the above points, let's structure our search API calls to get the needed context:\n\n- Investigate how `JSONField` is handled in Django admin. Since we don't have a specific class name or method, let's start by searching for code snippets related to `JSONField` in the Django admin.\n  - `search_code(\"JSONField\")`\n\n- Since the issue mentions `json.dumps` directly, let's search for any usage of this function, especially with options that control encoding.\n  - `search_code(\"json.dumps\")`\n\nThese searches will provide us with a starting point to understand how `JSONField` is represented in Django admin and how JSON serialization, particularly with Unicode characters, is managed in the codebase."

        "content": "The search results provided valuable information on where `JSONField` and `json.dumps` are used within the Django framework, giving us potential places to investigate the Unicode characters display issue in Django admin's JSONFields.\n\n### Analyzing `JSONField` Usage\n\nFrom the search results related to `JSONField`, the most relevant files that could potentially affect the admin display include:\n\n- **django/db/models/fields/json.py**: With 12 matches, this is likely the core implementation of the `JSONField` itself. This file is crucial because it handles how JSON data is stored, retrieved, and serialized in the context of Django models.\n- **django/contrib/admin/utils.py**: A single match here suggests there might be admin-specific handling or utilities related to JSON fields that could affect their representation in the admin interface.\n- **django/contrib/postgres/forms/jsonb.py**: Even though the original issue doesn't specify a database, it's known that PostgreSQL's JSONB fields have special handling in Django. This could provide insights if the issue partly depends on the database used.\n\n### Understanding `json.dumps` Usage\n\nThe search for `json.dumps` revealed its usage across various Django components, with the most relevant files likely being:\n\n- **django/db/models/fields/json.py**: This file also appeared in the `JSONField` search, reinforcing its importance. Since it has references to `json.dumps`, it's possible that this is where Django converts Python objects to JSON strings for `JSONField`, potentially using ASCII encoding by default.\n- **django/contrib/admin/options.py**: With 3 matches, there might be logic here related to how model fields are prepared or displayed in the Django admin, possibly including serialization choices that affect Unicode characters.\n\n### Analysis and Intended Behavior\n\n1. **django/db/models/fields/json.py**: This part of the code would be responsible for defining how `JSONField` behaves, including serialization and deserialization of JSON data. Given the issue, it's likely that the default behavior regarding `json.dumps` ASCII encoding is defined here.\n\n2. **django/contrib/admin/utils.py** and **django/contrib/admin/options.py**: These parts likely deal with how the `JSONField` is represented or manipulated in the Django admin. The intended behavior would be to correctly display Unicode characters in `JSONField` within the admin, avoiding the display of escaped ASCII sequences.\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior of these parts of the code is to serialize JSON containing Unicode characters (like Chinese) without defaulting to ASCII escape sequences, ensuring that the Django admin displays these characters correctly. \n\nTo further hone in on the exact location and context of the bug, we should now look into the serialization logic within `django/db/models/fields/json.py` as it seems central to both where `JSONField` is defined and where `json.dumps` is used in relation to `JSONField`. We might also want to investigate any admin-specific logic in `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` and `django/contrib/admin/options.py` to understand how `JSONField` data is handled and displayed within the admin interface."

This will allow Unicode characters to be displayed properly in the Django admin by default, instead of being escaped as ASCII sequences. This change should preserve the field's existing functionality in all contexts, including form submissions, database storage, and admin display.\n  \n- Location 2: File: django/contrib/admin/options.py\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Review and adjust how `JSONField` data is prepared and displayed in the admin interface, specifically in methods that handle or display field values in the admin forms or list displays. If `json.dumps` is used to serialize `JSONField` data for display, ensure it uses `ensure_ascii=False`. This adjustment is to ensure that the admin interface properly displays Unicode characters contained in `JSONField`, enhancing user experience without affecting the admin's performance or security."
