This change should preserve the field's existing functionality in all contexts, including form submissions, database storage, and admin display."

If `json.dumps` is used to serialize `JSONField` data for display, ensure it uses `ensure_ascii=False`. This adjustment is to ensure that the admin interface properly displays Unicode characters contained in `JSONField`, enhancing user experience without affecting the admin's performance or security."
