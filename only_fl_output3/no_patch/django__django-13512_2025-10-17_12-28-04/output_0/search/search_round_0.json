        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue mentioned, we need to focus on how JSON data is handled in Django admin, especially when the data includes Unicode characters like Chinese. Specifically, we need to explore the serialization process of JSON fields in Django, how they are displayed in the admin interface, and any customization or overrides applied for handling Unicode characters in `JSONField`.\n\nGiven the issue description, we should look into the following areas:\n1. **Django admin customization for `JSONField`**: Since the problem occurs in the Django admin, we should look into any customizations or overrides specific to displaying `JSONField`.\n2. **Serialization of Chinese characters in JSON**: The issue mentions that `json.dumps` uses ASCII encoding by default, which leads to the serialization of Chinese characters into ASCII. We need to find where `json.dumps` is called with respect to `JSONField` serialization.\n3. **Pull request mentioned for a fix**: Although directly accessing the pull request isn't possible through these APIs, we can look for any recent changes or patches applied to relevant files or methods that might address this issue.\n\nBased on the above points, let's structure our search API calls to get the needed context:\n\n- Investigate how `JSONField` is handled in Django admin. Since we don't have a specific class name or method, let's start by searching for code snippets related to `JSONField` in the Django admin.\n  - `search_code(\"JSONField\")`\n\n- Since the issue mentions `json.dumps` directly, let's search for any usage of this function, especially with options that control encoding.\n  - `search_code(\"json.dumps\")`\n\nThese searches will provide us with a starting point to understand how `JSONField` is represented in Django admin and how JSON serialization, particularly with Unicode characters, is managed in the codebase."
