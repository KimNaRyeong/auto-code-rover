        "intended_behavior": "Implement a new method named `_print_lerchphi` within the `PrettyPrinter` class. This method should be capable of taking an expression that represents the `lerchphi` function and converting it into a pretty-printed string representation. It's important that this method is recognized by the `PrettyPrinter`'s dispatch mechanism, so it should adhere to the naming conventions (`_print_<FunctionName>`) used within the class. The method should enhance the `PrettyPrinter` class by adding the capability to pretty-print `lerchphi` expressions without altering the existing functionality of the class or affecting the pretty-printing of other types of expressions."
