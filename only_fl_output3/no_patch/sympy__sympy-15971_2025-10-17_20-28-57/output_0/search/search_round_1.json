        "content": "Given the results from the API calls, let's analyze the collected context to move forward:\n\n1. **Context from `search_code(\"lerchphi\")`:**\n    - The `lerchphi` function is mentioned in several files, with the majority of references in `sympy/functions/special/zeta_functions.py`. This indicates that `lerchphi` is part of SymPy's special functions, specifically related to zeta functions, and it's extensively used or defined within this scope.\n    - Additional references in `sympy/simplify/hyperexpand.py` and `sympy/printing/latex.py` suggest that `lerchphi` has simplified representations and supports LaTeX printing. This demonstrates that the function is integrated into SymPy's simplification routines and printing mechanisms, underlining its significance in symbolic expressions and presentation.\n    - The presence in `sympy/functions/__init__.py` shows it's officially exported as part of the `functions` module, making it accessible for users.\n\n2. **Analysis of `PrettyPrinter` class in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`:**\n    - The `PrettyPrinter` class is crucial for pretty-printing symbolic expressions in a human-readable format. This class supports a wide range of expressions, suggesting a highly extensible and modular design for incorporating additional pretty-printing functionalities.\n    - Given the vast number of methods tailored for specific types (like `_print_Function`, `_print_Symbol`, etc.), including a new pretty-print method for `lerchphi` can follow an analogous approach. The methodology for implementing pretty-printing for `lerchphi` might involve creating a method like `_print_lerchphi`, tailored to handle the specific formatting requirements of the `lerchphi` function.\n\n3. **The Intended Behavior:**\n    - Based on the issue description, the intended behavior is to enhance the `PrettyPrinter` functionality to include support for the `lerchphi` function. This involves implementing a method that can transform the abstract representation of `lerchphi` into a format that's visually meaningful and aligned with mathematical notation when printed in a console or Jupyter notebook, for instance.\n\nSince there was no direct result for a `pretty` method within `PrettyPrinter` (which was expected since we're tasked with adding something new), the next steps would involve creating a new pretty-printing method tailored for `lerchphi`. We should align this method with the existing patterns observed for other special functions and mathematical expressions within the `PrettyPrinter` class. This will likely involve understanding how `lerchphi` is represented symbolically (from `zeta_functions.py`) and translating that representation into a visually coherent pretty-print format. \n\nGiven this context, the next API calls that would make sense might be:\n- Investigating how `lerchphi` is defined and used in `sympy/functions/special/zeta_functions.py` to ensure compatibility with pretty print requirements.\n- Looking into similar special function printing methods (like `_print_hyper` or `_print_meijerg`) in the `PrettyPrinter` class to model the implementation after these examples. \n\nHowever, since direct code insertion or further API calls were not part of the instructions for this step, this analysis sets the stage for implementing the pretty-printing functionality for `lerchphi`."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

        "content": "1. **Additional Context Needed:** Based on the analysis, additional context might not be necessary for outlining the resolution steps because we have a clear understanding of where and how to implement the needed functionality. However, examining implementations of similar functions could provide helpful insights into the conventions and patterns used within `PrettyPrinter`. Thus, one could consider looking at existing implementations for complex functions to ensure consistency in implementation style and interface.\n\n2. **Bug Locations and Intended Behavior:**\n   - **Location 1:**\n     - **File:** `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`\n     - **Class:** `PrettyPrinter`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** Implement a new method within the `PrettyPrinter` class specifically designed for the `lerchphi` function. This method, tentatively named `_print_lerchphi`, should take a `lerchphi` expression as input and return a pretty-formatted string representation that accurately reflects the mathematical notation of the lerchphi function for printing purposes. Since `lerchphi` is not currently supported for pretty printing, this method would constitute an extension of the `PrettyPrinter` class's capabilities, aimed at enhancing the user experience by providing visual clarity for `lerchphi` expressions within SymPy's pretty print functionality. The method should carefully translate the `lerchphi` function's symbolic representation into a formatted structure that aligns with both the mathematical standard and the existing pretty-print styles for special functions within SymPy. The implementation should ensure that all existing functionalities of the `PrettyPrinter` class are preserved and that the addition of the `lerchphi` pretty printing capability enriches the overall feature set without causing regressions or compatibility issues."
