Since SymPy is a large library, these could be abbreviations or specialized functions within a context, like combinatorial functions, which are not standalone but part of a module. \n\nConsidering the next step to gather more context, it would be prudent to look for these definitions within files or modules where combinatorial functions or related mathematical operations might be defined or referenced. \n\nSince directly searching for the methods didn't work, a practical approach would be to start searching code snippets or keywords that are likely related to where `ff` and `rf` functionalities could be defined or used, especially focusing on terms used in combinatorics or the specific domain they are related to. Additionally, looking for classes that might encompass these methods could also be helpful. However, without direct hits from the initial queries and lacking specific file names or class names related to `ff` and `rf`, the next best step is to generalize the search to likely modules or mathematical terms related to these functions' functionality.\n\nPossible actions without direct method names could involve:\n- Searching for code snippets that include `ff` and `rf` to see if there are relevant contexts or comments in the code base.\n- Considering they might be mathematical or combinatorial functions, searching for classes or methods related to combinatorics, like factorial functions, could potentially lead us to where `ff` and `rf` are implemented or used.\n- If `ff` and `rf` are abbreviations used within a larger scope or module, looking through modules related to their domain (like combinatorics, series expansion, etc.) might yield better results.\n\nBased on the limitations and the aim to find relevant context, another set of API calls is not directly formulated without making broad speculative searches which are not efficient without further contextual information."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).
