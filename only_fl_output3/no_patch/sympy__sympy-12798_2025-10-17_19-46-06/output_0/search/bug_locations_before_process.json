This means ff(n, k) should calculate the product of k consecutive numbers starting from n and decreasing, and rf(n, k) should calculate the product of k consecutive numbers starting from n and increasing. Any previous functionality that was altered leading to incorrect computations or interface changes should be reverted to preserve the expected mathematical behavior and ensure backward compatibility."
