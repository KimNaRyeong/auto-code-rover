Here is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that demonstrates the described issue. The script is designed to be executed in the context of a Django project.

```python

reproducer.py
This script reproduces the issue where FilePathField does not accept a callable for its path argument,
leading to problems with dynamic path resolution based on the environment.

This script initializes a minimal Django environment to test the behavior of `FilePathField` regarding the acceptance of callables for its `path` argument. It simulates the process of migrating models to check if the `FilePathField` can dynamically resolve paths without raising exceptions. 

However, this script assumes a Django project's typical environment and settings configuration. For a complete test, you might need to adjust the `LOCAL_FILE_DIR` or other settings according to your project's setup.

Please note that this script will exit with code 1 and print a traceback if the issue is present. If Django updates `FilePathField` to accept a callable in the future, you would need to adjust the testing methodology for asserting the issue's resolution, potentially by directly testing if passing a callable does not raise exceptions anymore.
