Search for the class definition of `FilePathField` to understand if and how it currently handles paths, and to see if there's built-in support for callable paths or if modifications are necessary.\n    - `search_class(\"FilePathField\")`\n\n2. Search for the usage of `FilePathField` across the codebase. This will help to find examples of its current usage and any custom implementations or workarounds that developers might have used, which might give us insight into modifying it to accept a callable for the path.\n    - `search_code(\"FilePathField\")`\n\nThese API calls will give us an in-depth understanding of how `FilePathField` is implemented and used, providing a solid foundation on which we can propose a solution to make the file path parameter accept a callable, improving flexibility and usability across different environments."
