Seeing as the place where these files are stored is different on different machines I have the following:\nimport os\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nclass LocalFiles(models.Model):\n\tname = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n\tfile = models.FilePathField(path=os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir'))\nNow when running manage.py makemigrations it will resolve the path based on the machine it is being run on. Eg: /home/<username>/server_files/example_dir\nI had to manually change the migration to include the os.path.join() part to not break this when running the migration on production/other machine.\n"

For a complete test, you might need to adjust the `LOCAL_FILE_DIR` or other settings according to your project's setup.\n\nPlease note that this script will exit with code 1 and print a traceback if the issue is present. If Django updates `FilePathField` to accept a callable in the future, you would need to adjust the testing methodology for asserting the issue's resolution, potentially by directly testing if passing a callable does not raise exceptions anymore."
