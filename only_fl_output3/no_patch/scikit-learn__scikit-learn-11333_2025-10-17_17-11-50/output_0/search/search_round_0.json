Here are the API calls I would like to execute:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ColumnTransformer\")`: This will provide context on the `ColumnTransformer` class, its inheritance, and potentially where `_set_params` is utilized within this class.\n\n2. `search_method(\"_set_params\")`: To see all occurrences of the `_set_params` method to understand how it is generally implemented and potentially overridden in the codebase.\n\n3. `search_code(\"def _set_params(self,\")`: This code snippet search will help find the method definition of `_set_params` to see its parameters and how it's being called, which may not be captured fully by method search if there are variations in other parts of the codebase.\n\n4. `search_code_in_file(\"names, _ = zip(*getattr(self, attr))\", \"/Users/joel/repos/scikit-learn/sklearn/utils/metaestimators.py\")`: This specific code search within `metaestimators.py` will provide direct context to the line raising the error mentioned in the issue, helping to understand the conditions under which it fails."
