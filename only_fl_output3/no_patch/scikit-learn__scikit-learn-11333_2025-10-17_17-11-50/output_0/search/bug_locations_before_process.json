        "intended_behavior": "The `_set_params` method needs to be modified to gracefully handle the case when there are no transformers (or estimators) in a composition like `ColumnTransformer`. When `getattr(self, attr)` returns an empty collection (indicating no transformers are present), the method should not attempt to unpack `names, _` from it, thus avoiding the `ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 0)`. Instead, it should check whether the collection is empty and, if so, skip to directly setting any additional provided parameters without attempting to replace or update any transformers. This change preserves the method's existing functionality of setting and updating parameters while also supporting compositions with no initial transformers."
