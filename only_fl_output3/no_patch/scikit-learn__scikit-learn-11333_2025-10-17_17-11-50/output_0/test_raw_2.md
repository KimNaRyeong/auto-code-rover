To correctly reproduce the issue as initially described, we will create a Python script `reproducer.py` that attempts to invoke the `_set_params` method on a `ColumnTransformer` object with no estimators. If the issue is present, this script will raise an exception, which we will catch and display using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. If the issue is not present (i.e., the setting of parameters does not raise an exception), the script will exit with code 0, indicating the issue has been resolved.

Here's the standalone Python file `reproducer.py`:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_set_params_with_no_estimators():
    from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
    try:
        # Attempt to create a ColumnTransformer with no estimators and set a parameter
        ct = ColumnTransformer([])
        ct.set_params(n_jobs=2)
        
        # If the above lines execute without error, assume the issue has been resolved
        print("Issue appears to be fixed.")
        exit(0)
    except ValueError as e:
        # If a ValueError is caught, we print the stack trace and exit with code 1
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_set_params_with_no_estimators()
```

This script does the following:
1. Defines a function `print_stacktrace` for neatly printing exceptions.
2. Defines a test function `test_set_params_with_no_estimators`, which tries to instantiate a `ColumnTransformer` with an empty list of transformers and then calls `set_params` on it. This is where the issue under discussion is expected to manifest.
3. If the issue is present, a `ValueError` is expected to be raised, causing the script to capture and print the exception's stack trace before exiting with code 1.
4. If the issue is not present (i.e., no exception is raised when calling `set_params`), the script prints a message indicating the issue appears to be fixed and exits with code 0. 

This setup ensures that anyone running the script will clearly understand whether the specific issue with `_BaseComposition._set_params` exists based on the outcome of the script execution.
