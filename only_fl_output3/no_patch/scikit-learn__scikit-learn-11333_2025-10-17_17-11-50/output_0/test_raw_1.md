Given the previous error indicates a misinterpretation of the task due to an environmental setup issue rather than a fault in the code designed to reproduce the target exception, let's provide an accurate `reproducer.py` script to specifically address the originally described issue within its proper operational context:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def test_set_params_with_no_estimators():
    from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
    try:
        ct = ColumnTransformer([])
        ct.set_params(n_jobs=2)
        # If the above line does not raise an error, the issue is considered fixed
        print("The issue appears to be fixed.")
        exit(0)
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert "not enough values to unpack" in str(e), "The error message has changed."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_set_params_with_no_estimators()
    except AssertionError as error:
        # If the AssertionError is raised, it means the specific check we implemented
        # has failed (i.e., the error message has changed or another form of ValueError
        # was detected). This is treated as a failure to reproduce the issue as initially stated.
        print("Failed to reproduce the issue as expected.")
        exit(1)  # Exiting with code 1 to indicate that the reproduction did not match the expected outcome.
```

This version attempts to address both the scenario where the issue remains present (expected behavior leading to an `AssertionError` if the error message changes or no `ValueError` is thrown) and the scenario where the issue may have been resolved (indicated by successful execution without an exception).

If executed in an environment where the reported issue has been fixed in `sklearn`, the script should exit with code `0` after printing `"The issue appears to be fixed."`. Otherwise, it will print the stack trace of the encountered `ValueError`, specifically when the unpacking error occurs due to no estimators being present. This script will serve to validate both the presence of the bug under current conditions and verify its resolution in future updates.
