Based on your request and the indicated need for a correction, understanding that the previous attempt failed due to the script's dependency on a Django project environment which wasn't correctly set up for the code snippet provided. Let's refactor `reproducer.py` to remove dependencies on a Django project or settings, allowing us to focus solely on the `HttpResponse` issue related to handling `memoryview` objects. This version won't require Django setup or environment settings, but please ensure Django is installed in your Python environment.

```python
# reproducer.py
from django.http import HttpResponse

def test_httpresponse_with_memoryview():
    try:
        # memoryview content should convert memoryview to bytes
        response = HttpResponse(memoryview(b"My Content"))
        content = response.getvalue()  # We use getvalue() to directly access the buffered content
        assert content == b'My Content', "Memoryview content assertion failed"

        # If the assertion passed, then it means the issue is fixed
        print("Issue fixed: HttpResponse correctly handles memoryview objects as expected.")
        return 0

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return 1

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.exit(test_httpresponse_with_memoryview())
```

This script focuses on testing whether `HttpResponse` can correctly handle a `memoryview` object. It does so by attempting to create an `HttpResponse` instance with a `memoryview` as its content. It asserts that the content received from the response matches the expected bytes.

- If the assertion fails (signaling the issue is present), the script calls `print_stacktrace` to output the error's stack trace and exits with code `1`.
- If the assertion passes (signaling the issue has been fixed), the script prints a success message and exits with code `0`.

Please ensure you have Django installed (`pip install django`) in your Python environment to execute this script successfully.
