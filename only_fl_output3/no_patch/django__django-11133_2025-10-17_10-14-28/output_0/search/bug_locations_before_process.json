        "intended_behavior": "The `content` setter in the `HttpResponse` class needs modification to handle `memoryview` objects properly. The correction involves adding a condition to check if the `value` is an instance of `memoryview`. If so, convert the `memoryview` to bytes before any further processing or assignment to `_container`. This ensures `memoryview` content is accurately converted to bytes, reflecting the actual data intended for the HTTP response. This approach should coexist seamlessly with the existing logic for handling strings, bytes, and iterables, thereby preserving the functionality for those types while extending support to `memoryview` objects effectively."
