        "content": "To address the issue with `HttpResponse` not handling `memoryview` objects correctly in Django, let's begin by gathering more context on how `HttpResponse` handles content internally. We will start by searching for the `HttpResponse` class and the methods that are likely involved in handling or setting the response content.\n\n1. Search for the `HttpResponse` class to understand its structure and any relevant documentation or comments within the source code that may hint at how it handles various types of content.\n\n2. Since the issue specifically relates to how content is set or interpreted within `HttpResponse`, we'll look for methods that are involved in setting or getting the `content` attribute. This will help in understanding if there's a type check or conversion process that does not account for `memoryview` objects.\n\nTherefore, the API calls we'll perform are:\n\n- `search_class(\"HttpResponse\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"content\", \"HttpResponse\")`\n\nThese calls will provide a good starting point to understand the handling of content within `HttpResponse` and how it might be failing to properly handle `memoryview` objects."
