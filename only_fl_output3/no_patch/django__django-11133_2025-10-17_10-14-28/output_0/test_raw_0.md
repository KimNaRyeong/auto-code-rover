Certainly! Below is the `reproducer.py` file as described. This script attempts to reproduce the issue with `HttpResponse` not handling `memoryview` objects as expected. If the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace. If the issue is fixed, it will simply exit with code 0 without any errors.

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
import django
from django.conf import settings

def setup_django_environment():
    settings.configure(
        DEBUG=True,
        SECRET_KEY='abcdef123456',
        ROOT_URLCONF=__name__,
    )
    django.setup()

def test_http_response_with_memoryview():
    # Testing with memoryview content
    response = HttpResponse(memoryview(b"My Content"))
    return response.content

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    setup_django_environment()

    try:
        content = test_http_response_with_memoryview()
        assert content == b"My Content", "HttpResponse does not handle memoryview objects correctly"

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script sets up a minimal Django environment, needed for the `HttpResponse` object to work outside of a full project. When you run this script in the root directory of a Django project (where `manage.py` is located), it should ideally be run in an environment where Django is installed and properly configured.

Remember to activate your virtual environment and install Django if you haven't already before running the script:

```bash
pip install Django
python3 reproducer.py
```

If the script raises an `AssertionError` and prints a stack trace, it confirms the presence of the issue with `HttpResponse` not handling `memoryview` objects correctly. If the issue is fixed, no error will be raised, and the script will exit successfully.
