        "content": "<issue>Feature/docs: how should url converters decline to match for a named route?\nDescription\nIt is sometimes convenient to have multiple instances of a named route, where the correct one is chosen based on whether the URL converters to_url call succeeds. For example, the attached file has routes like this:\npath('export/foo/<foo:obj>', index, name='export'),\npath('export/bar/<bar:obj>', index, name='export'),\nI then wanted to put {% url \"export\" some_foo_or_bar %} in a generic export template and have the correct URL inserted.\nMy first attempt to do this was to raise ValueError in to_url for non-matching values, hoping that it would work the same as to_python where the docs specify that \"A ValueError is interpreted as no match.\"\nThat didn't work -- nothing catches the ValueError in to_url -- so I found the workaround demonstrated in the attachment: if to_url returns an empty string (or some string that doesn't match the converter's regex), then the later regex check in _reverse_with_prefix will detect the non-match and everything seems to work out.\nSo this is either a feature request or a documentation check. I'm thinking either:\n_reverse_with_prefix could be updated so to_url works the same as to_python, and a ValueError indicates no match (which I think just means wrapping try: ... except ValueError: continue around the appropriate line), or\nthe docs could be updated to indicate that, in to_url, a converter should return a non-regex-matching string such as the empty string in order to decline a match.\n</issue>"

The function iterates over possible URL patterns (possibilities) to find a match, convert arguments to their URL representations using defined converters (`to_url` method of the converters), and constructs the URL if a suitable pattern is found. If no match is found, a `NoReverseMatch` exception is raised with a message detailing the issue.\n\n2. **Relationship between this part of the code and the bug**\n\n   The issue centers around the `to_url` method of converters and how `_reverse_with_prefix` handles the return value of these converters. Specifically, the submitter hoped to use a `ValueError` raised by `to_url` to indicate an unmatched pattern, similar to the `to_python` method where such an exception is explicitly handled as an indication of no match. However, `_reverse_with_prefix` does not currently catch `ValueError` thrown by `to_url`; instead, it seems to expect either a successful conversion (a string that matches the expected URL pattern) or a direct match fail (without throwing exceptions) based on the converter's regex.\n\n3. **Intended behavior of this part of the code**\n\n   Given the issue, the intended behavior would be for `_reverse_with_prefix` to gracefully handle scenarios where `to_url` determines no match is possible, either by detecting a `ValueError` and continuing to the next possibility or by some mechanism that allows `to_url` to indicate a non-match without having to raise exceptions. The aim is to enhance the logic in `_reverse_with_prefix` to understand when a converter has explicitly declined to convert a value, thereby improving the flexibility and robustness of Django's URL reverse matching logic.\n\n#### Lack of \"URL converters\" Code in the Search Result\n\nSince the search for \"URL converters\" did not yield any results, it suggests that either the query was too specific or documentation/comments directly referring to \"URL converters\" under that name are absent in the codebase. Given the context, it could be beneficial to search specifically for the converter class or method definitions like `to_url` to find where the converters are implemented and how they are expected to behave. This would provide direct insights into the converter functionality and any documentation or comments regarding their use and expected behavior, particularly in error or non-match scenarios.\n\n#### Next Steps\n\nGiven the analysis above, to further understand how converters are meant to function (especially regarding error handling with `ValueError`), the following additional search API calls seem appropriate:\n\n- Search for the definition or usage of converters including `to_url` method:\n  \n  ```python\n  search_method(\"to_url\")\n  ```\n  \nThis would help understand how converters are designed to handle non-matching cases and whether there is an established pattern or practice for indicating a conversion failure without raising exceptions."

Therefore, I'll provide an analysis based on typical functionalities of converters in Django and how they might relate to the reported issue.\n\n### Analysis Based on General Knowledge and Issue Context\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n   The `to_url` methods in Django's URL converters are used to convert Python data types into string representations that can be embedded into URLs. These methods are defined within specific converter classes that are registered to handle particular URL parameter patterns. For each registered converter (e.g., `str`, `int`, `slug`, etc.), its `to_url` method takes a Python object and returns a string that matches the URL pattern associated with that converter.\n\n2. **Relationship between this part of the code and the bug**\n\n   The issue discussed pertains specifically to the behavior of these `to_url` methods when they encounter values that they should not handle or cannot correctly convert. The expected behavior, as described in the issue, is for a `to_url` method to signal a non-match in such cases, which would allow Django's URL routing system to continue searching for a route that can handle the given value. The bug, or rather the feature request, highlights that there's no clear, documented way for `to_url` methods to decline a match. Raising a `ValueError` was attempted by the person who reported the issue, but it did not work as expected since such exceptions weren't caught where they hoped.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   The intended behavior for `to_url` methods, in light of the issue, would be to allow these methods to decline to process a value without halting the URL reversing process with an unhandled exception. Ideally, this could take the form of a consistent pattern or return value that `to_url` could use to indicate \"I cannot convert this value,\" allowing the routing system to attempt to use another route/converter combination instead. This could potentially be implemented by:\n   \n   - Returning a specific value (like `None` or an empty string) and adjusting the calling code (`_reverse_with_prefix`) to recognize this as a signal to continue to the next pattern.\n   - Implementing a custom exception that can be caught within the URL routing logic (similar to the handling of `ValueError` in `to_python` methods), allowing `to_url` to signal a non-match scenario gracefully.\n\n### Suggested Next Steps\n\nSince we didn't directly inspect the `to_url` implementations, if precise modifications are to be considered for resolving the issue or improving the documentation, it would be crucial to look into `django/urls/converters.py` and understand the current implementation of these methods. However, based on the analysis, it seems we have sufficient context to deduce the relationship and intended adjustments to address the issue, acknowledging that a detailed review of `to_url` methods' contents would provide the best pathway to a precise solution."

To resolve this,\n  1. Introduce a try-except block around the call to `converters[k].to_url(v)` within the loop where candidate substitutions are converted to text.  \n  2. In the except block specifically catch `ValueError`, and continue iterating through other possibilities without immediately failing. This allows other converters or patterns to be attempted.\n  \n     This change ensures that a `ValueError` thrown by a `to_url` method acts as an indication that the current converter cannot match the provided value, without terminating the URL reversing process. This behavior would align with the issue's request, making URL generation more flexible and robust.\n\nAdding such handling in `_reverse_with_prefix` adapts the Django URL reversing mechanism to more gracefully manage converters that may not be suitable for every value, allowing developers to write more dynamic and flexible code without the fear of uncaught exceptions disrupting the flow."
