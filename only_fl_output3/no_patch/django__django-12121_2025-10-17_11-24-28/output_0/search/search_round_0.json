        "content": "<issue>Feature/docs: how should url converters decline to match for a named route?\nDescription\nIt is sometimes convenient to have multiple instances of a named route, where the correct one is chosen based on whether the URL converters to_url call succeeds. For example, the attached file has routes like this:\npath('export/foo/<foo:obj>', index, name='export'),\npath('export/bar/<bar:obj>', index, name='export'),\nI then wanted to put {% url \"export\" some_foo_or_bar %} in a generic export template and have the correct URL inserted.\nMy first attempt to do this was to raise ValueError in to_url for non-matching values, hoping that it would work the same as to_python where the docs specify that \"A ValueError is interpreted as no match.\"\nThat didn't work -- nothing catches the ValueError in to_url -- so I found the workaround demonstrated in the attachment: if to_url returns an empty string (or some string that doesn't match the converter's regex), then the later regex check in _reverse_with_prefix will detect the non-match and everything seems to work out.\nSo this is either a feature request or a documentation check. I'm thinking either:\n_reverse_with_prefix could be updated so to_url works the same as to_python, and a ValueError indicates no match (which I think just means wrapping try: ... except ValueError: continue around the appropriate line), or\nthe docs could be updated to indicate that, in to_url, a converter should return a non-regex-matching string such as the empty string in order to decline a match.\n</issue>"
