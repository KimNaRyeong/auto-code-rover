        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior here is to ensure that when `evaluate=False` is passed to `sympify`, expressions involving `ceiling` are parsed without automatic evaluation, but still allow for consistent simplification behavior. This requires careful handling of the `evaluate` parameter to ensure it effectively prevents automatic evaluation while not interfering with the subsequent `simplify` process. The existing functionality for converting expressions to SymPy types should be preserved, with additional checks or transformations to maintain consistency in `ceiling` handling."

        "intended_behavior": "The `simplify` method should consistently simplify expressions that involve the `ceiling` function regardless of whether the expressions were parsed with `evaluate=True` or `evaluate=False` in `sympify`. There might need to be a review and potential adjustment in the simplification logic to ensure it handles `ceiling` expressions consistently. The objective is to maintain or enhance the simplification capabilities without disrupting the correct and expected behavior of the `simplify` function across various expressions."
