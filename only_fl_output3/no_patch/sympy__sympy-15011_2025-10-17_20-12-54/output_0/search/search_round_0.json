        "content": "To gather the necessary context to resolve the issue, we'll need to understand how `lambdify` function works, particularly with `MatrixSymbol` objects and when `dummify` is set to `True`. Given that the problem involves `MatrixSymbol` names containing curly braces, we need to look into the implementation of `lambdify` as well as how `MatrixSymbol` objects are handled within that function.\n\nHere are the API search calls that we should make:\n\n1. Search for the `lambdify` function implementation to understand how it handles `MatrixSymbol` objects and the `dummify` parameter.\n2. Search for the `MatrixSymbol` class to understand how names with special characters (like curly braces) are treated or if there's any relevant code that could affect `lambdify`.\n\nGiven these requirements, the following API calls are appropriate:\n\n- `search_method(method_name=\"lambdify\")`: This will help us find where the `lambdify` function is defined and its implementation details.\n- `search_class(class_name=\"MatrixSymbol\")`: This will provide us information about the `MatrixSymbol` class, particularly if there are any special treatments for symbol names containing special characters."
