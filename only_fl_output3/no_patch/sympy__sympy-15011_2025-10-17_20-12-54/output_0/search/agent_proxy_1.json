The intended behavior is to ensure that all symbols, including `MatrixSymbol` instances with names containing special characters like curly braces, are properly dummified if `dummify=True` is passed. This means adjusting the symbol naming conversion process to detect and handle such special characters, ensuring they do not lead to a `SyntaxError` when the lambdified function is evaluated. In essence, the code must be enhanced to sanitize or replace symbol names that are not valid Python identifiers, making this process robust to all valid SymPy symbol names. This change should preserve the existing functionality of the code, allowing for symbols with traditional names to be processed as before while providing support for names that include characters like curly braces."
