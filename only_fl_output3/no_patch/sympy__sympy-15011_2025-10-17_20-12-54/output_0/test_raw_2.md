Based on the conditions and requirements you've specified, here's the corrected `reproducer.py` script. It aims to raise an `AssertionError` when the specific issue with `lambdify` and `MatrixSymbol` names containing curly braces occurs, accurately printing a stack trace for the error. The script will exit with code 0 only if the issue does not manifest, indicating a potential fix.

```python
import sympy as sy

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    curlyx = sy.symbols("{x}")
    v = sy.MatrixSymbol("v", 2, 1)
    curlyv = sy.MatrixSymbol("{v}", 2, 1)

    # Test cases that are expected to work.
    try:
        curlyScalarId = sy.lambdify(curlyx, curlyx)
        vectorId = sy.lambdify(v, v)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "Unexpected error with lambdify on scalars or matrix symbols without curly braces."
    
    # Test case that raises SyntaxError with curly braces in MatrixSymbol's name
    try:
        curlyVectorId = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv)
        print("No SyntaxError, issue seems to be fixed with curly braces in MatrixSymbol without dummify.")
    except SyntaxError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "Issue present: SyntaxError with curly braces in MatrixSymbol name without dummify."

    try:
        curlyVectorIdDummified = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv, dummify=True)
        print("No SyntaxError, issue seems to be fixed with curly braces in MatrixSymbol with dummify=True.")
    except SyntaxError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "Issue present: SyntaxError with curly braces in MatrixSymbol name even with dummify=True."
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, f"Unexpected exception: {e}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code if the assertion fails
    exit(0)  # Exit with success code if no error is raised
```

This script attempts to address the error condition directly related to using `sy.lambdify` with a `MatrixSymbol` containing curly braces, both with `dummify=True` and without it. The script differentiates between the expected success cases (no curly braces in symbols' names) and the problematic scenario (curly braces present). It handles exceptions specifically, prints detailed stack traces for failures, and exits with the appropriate code based on the outcome.
