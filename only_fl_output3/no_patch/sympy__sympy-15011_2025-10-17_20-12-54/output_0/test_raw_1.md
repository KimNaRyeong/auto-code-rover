Understood, let's refine the approach to explicitly check for the incorrect behavior and to correctly interpret success (i.e., the absence of `SyntaxError` as a fix to the issue). Here's an updated `reproducer.py` which will:
- Continue to raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is evidenced by raising a `SyntaxError`.
- Exit with code 0 if no issue is found, properly catching the exception and interpreting its absence as a fix.

```python
import sympy as sy

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    curlyx = sy.symbols("{x}")
    v = sy.MatrixSymbol("v", 2, 1)
    curlyv = sy.MatrixSymbol("{v}", 2, 1)

    # Verify lambdify works with scalar and vector without curly braces
    try:
        curlyScalarId = sy.lambdify(curlyx, curlyx)
        vectorId = sy.lambdify(v, v)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "lambdify should work with both scalar symbols and MatrixSymbols without issue."

    # Test lambdify with MatrixSymbol with curly braces without and with dummify=True
    try:
        curlyVectorId = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv)
        curlyVectorIdDummified = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv, dummify=True)
    except SyntaxError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "lambdify should work with MatrixSymbol names with curly braces, even when dummify=True."
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, f"Unexpected exception: {e}"

    # If we reach this point, it means the issue is presumably fixed
    print("Issue seems to be fixed. No SyntaxError encountered.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(1)  # Indicating failure due to the presence of the issue
    exit(0)
```

This script proceeds with the attempt to `lambdify` an expression with a `MatrixSymbol` name that contains curly braces both without `dummify` and with `dummify=True`. As per your requirement, it correctly captures the specific scenario causing the issue and will only raise an `AssertionError` if the problematic behavior occurs (e.g., a `SyntaxError` happens). 

Conversely, the absence of such errors will lead the script to acknowledge the resolution of the issue, communicating this through standard output and exiting with code 0, consistent with your instructions for indicating a fix.
