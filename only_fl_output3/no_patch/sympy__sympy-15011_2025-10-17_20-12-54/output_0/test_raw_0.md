This script is designed to reproduce the stated issue with `sympy.lambdify` when used with `MatrixSymbol` names that include curly braces, even when `dummify` is set to `True`. Specifically, it confirms the presence of a `SyntaxError` under the described conditions. 

The script will:
- Assert failure if `lambdify` unexpectedly raises exceptions with scalar symbols (including those with curly braces in their names) and regular `MatrixSymbol` without curly braces,
- Properly identify and expect a `SyntaxError` for `MatrixSymbol` names with curly braces, reflecting the issue described,
- Print a detailed stack trace for any unexpected exceptions, helping to diagnose the underlying issue in the code or library.
