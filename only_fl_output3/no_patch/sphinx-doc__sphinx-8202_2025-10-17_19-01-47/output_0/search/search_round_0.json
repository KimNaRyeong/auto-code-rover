If the child class has the `__init__` method (using typed parameters) and I try to reassign the attribute from `Generic` class I got the following error:\n```text\nWARNING: :1: (WARNING/2) Field list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.\n```\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n```\n$ git clone git@github.com:dry-python/returns.git\n$ cd returns\n$ poetry install\n$ cd docs\n$ poetry run make html\n```\nCode example:\n* Python script\n```python\nfrom typing import (\nClassVar,\nType,\nTypeVar,\nGeneric,\n)\n_ValueType = TypeVar('_ValueType')\nclass MyGeneric(Generic[_ValueType]):\n#: Doc comment example.\nsome_type: ClassVar[Type['MyGenericChild']]\nclass MyGenericChild(MyGeneric[_ValueType]):\ndef __init__(self, inner_value: _ValueType) -> None:\npass\nMyGeneric.some_type = MyGenericChild\n```\n* rst\n```rst\n.. test:\nTest\n====\n.. automodule:: lib.test\n:members:\n```\nIf you try to modify something in the script maybe the error will not appear, it's a very specific corner case!\n**Expected behavior**\nThe warning should not appear!\n**Your project**\n[returns](https://github.com/dry-python/returns)\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Linux 5.7.9-1-MANJARO\n- Python version: 3.8.3\n- Sphinx version: 3.1.1\n- Sphinx extensions:\n```text\nsphinx.ext.autodoc\nsphinx.ext.doctest\nsphinx.ext.todo\nsphinx.ext.coverage\nsphinx.ext.viewcode\nsphinx.ext.autosummary\nsphinx.ext.napoleon\nm2r\nsphinx_autodoc_typehints\nsphinxcontrib.mermaid\nhoverxref.extension\n```\n---\nrelated issue https://github.com/dry-python/returns/issues/568\n</issue>"

Based on the description, it seems crucial to understand how the `MyGeneric` and `MyGenericChild` classes are implemented and documented, and also how the Sphinx documentation is generated, especially the automodule directive.\n\nLet's perform the following search API calls:\n1. `search_class(\"MyGeneric\")` - To find the class definition and usage of `MyGeneric`.\n2. `search_class(\"MyGenericChild\")` - To find the class definition and usage of `MyGenericChild`.\n3. `search_code(\"sphinx.ext.autodoc\")` - To understand how Sphinx's autodoc extension is used in the project, which seems related to the documentation generation issue.\n4. `search_code(\"sphinx.ext.autosummary\")` - This will provide context on the autosummary usage, another Sphinx extension mentioned in the environment info, potentially connected to the issue.\n5. `search_code(\".automodule:: lib.test\")` - To investigate how the automodule directive is specifically used within the project, which might be causing the unexpected behavior when it encounters doc comments in generic classes."
