        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior should ensure that Sphinx can correctly parse and render documentation for classes that use Python Generics, especially when those classes are extended, and attributes are reassigned within the subclass. This may involve ensuring Sphinx's autodoc and autosummary extensions are correctly configured to handle Python type annotations, including Generics, without emitting warnings or errors. It may also require checking for custom Sphinx extensions or configurations that could interfere with standard processing. This could involve adjustments in 'doc/conf.py' to either include necessary plugins, exclude problematic ones, or adjust their configuration to better handle the documentation of generic classes and their children."
