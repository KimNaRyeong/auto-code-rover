        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we will need to gather more context around the use of `wspace` and `hspace` parameters in `Figure.subfigures` and how figures and subfigures are laid out. Given the information provided in the issue, we'll start by looking into the `Figure` class and the `subfigures` method since these are directly related to the problem. We also know that the bug involves ignoring `wspace` and `hspace` settings, which suggests that we should look into how these parameters are implemented or used in the `subfigures` method or anywhere relevant in the `Figure` class. \n\nLet's make the following searches:\n\n1. Searching for the `Figure` class within the matplotlib codebase to understand its implementation and to find the `subfigures` method within it.\n2. Searching for the `subfigures` method specifically within the `Figure` class to see how it's implemented and how it's supposed to handle `wspace` and `hspace`.\n3. Looking at the code around the lines of code provided in the expected outcome link from GitHub, as it could give us direct clues on what might be going wrong or how these parameters are intended to work.\n\nAPI Calls:\n- search_class(\"Figure\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"subfigures\", \"Figure\")\n- get_code_around_line(\"lib/matplotlib/figure.py\", 1552, 5)"
