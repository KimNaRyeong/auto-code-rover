This script attempts to verify the behavior of the `wspace` and `hspace` parameters in `matplotlib.figure.Figure.subfigures` by asserting these spacing parameters are effectively applied as intended. Since visual spacing issues can't be directly caught through exceptions when plotting, this script checks if the underlying `gridspec` attributes for `wspace` and `hspace` are set correctly, which is a rough proxy to whether the spacing is likely being applied. 

Note: Direct verification of the issue through visual inspection (i.e., by looking at the plots) is advised alongside this script, as the script primarily aims to catch changes programmatically and may not reflect visual rendering issues directly.
