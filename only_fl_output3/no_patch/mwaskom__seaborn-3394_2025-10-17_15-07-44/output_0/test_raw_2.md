Given the updated request and keeping in mind that previously there was a misunderstanding due to an environmental issue (missing the `pandas` module), I'll provide you with a revised version of the `reproducer.py` script. This script is designed to specifically look for the issue where using `pd.NA` in a dataset seems to reverse the axis ordering when plotting with Seaborn, comparing it against `np.nan` which does not cause this issue. 

This script will attempt to explicitly check the condition described and raise an `AssertionError` if the axis ordering is indeed reversed when `pd.NA` is used, indicating the issue is present. Conversely, it should exit with code 0 if the issue is not reproduced, suggesting that either the issue has been fixed or the behavior observed is as expected.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import seaborn as sns
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Ensure consistent output by setting a seed
    np.random.seed(0)

    mock_data = pd.DataFrame({
        'date': ['0', '1', '2', '3'],
        'value': [1, 2, 1, 1.5]
    })

    mock_data_full = mock_data.copy()
    mock_data_full['type'] = 'no_NA'

    mock_data_pd_na = mock_data.copy()
    mock_data_pd_na['type'] = 'pd.NA'
    mock_data_pd_na.loc[2, 'value'] = pd.NA

    mock_data_np_nan = mock_data.copy()
    mock_data_np_nan['type'] = 'np.nan'
    mock_data_np_nan.loc[2, 'value'] = np.nan

    test_data = pd.concat([mock_data_full, mock_data_pd_na, mock_data_np_nan])
    
    grid = sns.FacetGrid(
        data=test_data,
        col='type',
        sharey=False,
        sharex=True  # time-series consistency
    )
    grid.map(sns.lineplot, 'date', 'value', alpha=0.5)

    def check_axis_order(ax, title_contains, original_order):
        """Check if the axis order of a subplot matches the original."""
        for a in ax:
            if title_contains in a.get_title():
                ys = [line.get_ydata() for line in a.get_lines()][0]
                # Remove NaN values for comparison
                ys = ys[~np.isnan(ys)]
                return np.array_equal(ys, original_order), ys
        return False, []

    original_order = mock_data_full['value'].values
    no_na_order_check, _ = check_axis_order(grid.axes.flatten(), "no_NA", original_order)
    pd_na_order_check, pd_na_order = check_axis_order(grid.axes.flatten(), "pd.NA", original_order)

    assert no_na_order_check, "Y-axis order for 'no_NA' does not match original."
    assert pd_na_order_check, f"Y-axis order for 'pd.NA' is reversed. Expected {original_order}, found {pd_na_order}"

except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)

print("Test passed: 'pd.NA' does not alter the ordering of y-axis values.")
sys.exit(0)
```

This script incorporates a method to compare the y-axis data ordering for plots generated with `pd.NA` and without missing values (`no_NA`). If the data ordering with `pd.NA` is different from the original, it suggests that the issue is present, fulfilling the requirements to exit with code 1 and print a stack trace. Conversely, if the ordering remains consistent across the different types, the script will exit with code 0, indicating the issue could not be reproduced under the test conditions described.
