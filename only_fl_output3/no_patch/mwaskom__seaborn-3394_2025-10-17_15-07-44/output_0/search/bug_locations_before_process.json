        "intended_behavior": "The `lineplot` function should ensure consistent ordering of axes regardless of the presence of `pd.NA` or `np.nan` in the dataset. This may involve adjusting the sorting logic to handle `pd.NA` equivalently to `np.nan` or explicitly before plotting, ensuring that missing values do not influence the ordering of data points on the axis. A specific consideration should be given to how missing values are excluded or considered in the context of the `sort=True` default behavior, ensuring that axis order remains consistent with the input data order when missing values are present."

        "intended_behavior": "While `dropna` successfully filters out missing values, ensuring seamless data plotting, a revision might be necessary to confirm its handling of `pd.NA` does not inadvertently affect data processing in a way that could lead to axis inversion. The method should guarantee that the process of filtering out rows with missing values (`pd.NA` or `np.nan`) does not trigger any reordering or impact on the dataset that could lead to the observed issue. Although `dropna` might not be directly responsible for reversing axis order, ensuring its robustness in handling different missing value indicators is crucial for data integrity throughout the plotting process."
