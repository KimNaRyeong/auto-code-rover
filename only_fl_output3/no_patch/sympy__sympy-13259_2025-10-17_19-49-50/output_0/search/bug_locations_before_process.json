The intended behavior here would involve a better handling of trigonometric functions with complex arguments to ensure that the conversion between `cos` and `cosh` (or vice versa) preserves the mathematical accuracy, particularly in recognizing the difference between adding and multiplying complex parts in these functions. Specifically, the simplification process should correctly interpret and simplify `cos(pi/6 - I*asinh())` expressions without altering their fundamental properties or incorrect numerical simplification."

        "intended_behavior": "Given that `expr.py` likely handles the expression tree at a more fundamental level, any simplification logic here that pertains to trigonometric functions should ensure that operations involving complex numbers are accurately represented within the symbolic manipulation. If `simplify` methods within this file contribute to the incorrect simplification behavior as described, they would need to accurately maintain the distinction between operations that should result in trigonometric conversions among `cos` and `cosh` with the correct handling of complex arguments. This may involve either fixing the rules used for such conversions or ensuring that the existing rules are applied correctly in the context of complex numbers."
