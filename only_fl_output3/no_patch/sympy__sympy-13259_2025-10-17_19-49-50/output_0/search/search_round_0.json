The method named \"simplify\" is directly mentioned in the issue, so we should look into it. Also, since the issue involves trigonometric functions with complex arguments, searching for relevant code handling \"cos\" or \"cosh\" within the context of simplification might be beneficial. \n\nGiven the specific nature of the simplification process described in the issue, we would also want to understand how the transition between `cos` and `cosh` is being handled, particularly with complex arguments.\n\nHere are the API calls I would make to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"simplify\")` - This will help us find where the simplify method is defined or used within the project.\n2. `search_method(\"cos\")` - Given the function is directly involved in the issue, understanding its implementation and usage could provide insights.\n3. `search_method(\"cosh\")` - Similarly, finding details about the `cosh` function could help us understand how it's used in simplifications.\n4. `search_code(\"cos(pi/6 - I*asinh(\")` and `search_code(\"cosh(pi/6 + asinh(\")` - These searches will aim to find code snippets that may directly relate to the problematic conversion mentioned in the issue."
