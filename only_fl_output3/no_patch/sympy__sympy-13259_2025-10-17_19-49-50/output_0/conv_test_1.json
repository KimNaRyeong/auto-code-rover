It then compares numerical evaluations of the original and simplified expressions to check if they differ significantly, which should not happen if both expressions are mathematically equivalent.\n\nThe `assert` statement is used for this purpose, and it raises an `AssertionError` if the numerical evaluations of the expressions before and after simplification show a significant difference - indicating that the issue is present. The script finishes successfully without an error if the issue has been resolved and the simplification does not alter the numerical outcome."
