Here's a Python script named `reproducer.py` that you can use to check for the issue in a standalone manner. This script is specifically designed to raise an `AssertionError` if the issue exists and to print a detailed stack trace to help understand where the error occurs. 

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import *
    
    try:
        # Define the expressions with a complex trigonometric function
        a = 2*sqrt(2)*I*cos(pi/6 - I*asinh(5*sqrt(2)/2)/3)/3
        
        # Evaluate `a` to a floating-point number
        a_eval = a.evalf()
        
        # Simplify the expression `a` and then evaluate it
        b = a.simplify()
        b_eval = b.evalf()
        
        # Check if `a` and `b` are approximately equal after evaluation
        # Raises an AssertionError if the issue is present
        assert abs(a_eval - b_eval) < 1e-10, "The simplification leads to a wrong numeric result."
    
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise
    
    print("No issue detected, the simplification is correct!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
        exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
```

This script uses the `sympy` library to define a symbolic math expression and apply simplification. It then compares numerical evaluations of the original and simplified expressions to check if they differ significantly, which should not happen if both expressions are mathematically equivalent.

The `assert` statement is used for this purpose, and it raises an `AssertionError` if the numerical evaluations of the expressions before and after simplification show a significant difference - indicating that the issue is present. The script finishes successfully without an error if the issue has been resolved and the simplification does not alter the numerical outcome.
