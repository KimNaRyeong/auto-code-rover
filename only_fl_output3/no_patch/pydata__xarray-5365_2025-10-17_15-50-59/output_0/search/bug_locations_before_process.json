        "intended_behavior": "The new method `cross` should be added to the `DataArray` class. This method will facilitate the computation of vector cross products using labeled data in a manner similar to the existing `dot` method but specifically tailored for the cross product operation. The `cross` method will accept another `DataArray` object and a dimension name along which to perform the cross product. It should leverage the `apply_ufunc` utility to wrap `numpy.cross`, handling dimensionality and broadcasting according to `xarray`'s conventions. This addition would involve: - Validating that both input arrays contain the specified dimension and that this dimension has a size compatible with cross product operations (i.e., 3 for 3D vectors, with a potential extension to handle the 2D case). - Ensuring that any non-spatial dimensions are correctly broadcasted between the input arrays according to `xarray`'s rules. - Preserving metadata and attributes where appropriate, following practices used in similar computational methods within `xarray`. The addition of a `cross` method directly aligns with the user\u2019s feature request, enabling a seamless integration of vector cross product calculations into the `xarray` data analysis workflow, thus enriching its utility for physical sciences and engineering applications."
