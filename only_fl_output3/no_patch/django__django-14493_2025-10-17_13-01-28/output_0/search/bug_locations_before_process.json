        "intended_behavior": "Within the `post_process` method, there should be a conditional check to handle scenarios when `max_post_process_passes` is set to 0 to ensure that variable referencing does not lead to an `UnboundLocalError`. Specifically, any logic that depends on variables set or modified based on the number of passes (like `substitutions`, which was likely a misreference in the issue description) should be initialized or conditioned in a way that respects the `max_post_process_passes = 0` setting, effectively bypassing processing steps that are not supposed to run but ensuring the method can complete without errors. This might include initializing relevant variables before their first use or guarding their use with checks on the `max_post_process_passes` setting."
