Based on the instructions and to accurately reflect the issue described, the following `reproducer.py` script is designed to specifically target the outlined problem regarding `rename_vars` in `xarray`. This script checks if the issue where renaming a coordinate to a dimension coordinate does not create an index is still present:

```python
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    data = xr.DataArray([5, 6, 7], coords={"c": ("x", [1, 2, 3])}, dims="x")

    data_renamed = data.rename({"c": "x"})

    if data_renamed.indexes == {}:
        print("Renaming did not create an index as expected.")
        try:
            data_renamed.sel(x=2)
        except KeyError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("The issue is present.") from e
    
    try:
        # This works as expected when index is properly created.
        is_selected = data_renamed.sel(x=2)
        print("Index is present and selection by 'x=2' was successful:", is_selected)
        exit(0)
    except KeyError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Failed due to missing index for 'x' after renaming.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script:
1. Imports necessary modules and defines a function to print detailed stack traces for exceptions.
2. Reproduces the issue by first creating a `DataArray` with a non-dimension coordinate, then renaming this coordinate to match the name of a dimension.
3. Checks if an index for the renamed coordinate exists. If not, it attempts to perform a selection operation expecting to raise a `KeyError`.
4. Clearly identifies whether the issue is present by the outcome of the assertion test and exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed.

Instructions for use:
- Ensure that Python 3 and xarray are installed in your environment.
- Copy this script to a file named `reproducer.py`.
- Execute the script in your terminal with `python3 reproducerer.py`.
- Observe the output for an exception stack trace or a message indicating if the issue is resolved or not.
