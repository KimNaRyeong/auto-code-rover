While the basic functionality of creating directories and locking mechanisms should remain, the method might benefit from a more robust handling mechanism of potential race conditions, ensuring lock files are either checked for existence before unlinking or handling the FileNotFoundError gracefully. Additionally, considering the improvement for handling concurrent pytest sessions, the method could be adjusted to generate directory names with a unique or randomized component, beyond just a numerical sequence, to minimize the chances of interference between sessions."
