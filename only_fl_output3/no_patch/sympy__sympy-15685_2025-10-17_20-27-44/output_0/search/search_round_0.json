In the SI system, 1 V/ 1 A = 1 \u03a9.\n### What I Did\n```\n>>> from sympy.physics.units import Quantity, voltage, current, ohm, convert_to\n>>> vs = Quantity('vs')\n>>> vs.set_dimension(voltage)\n>>> vs_i = Quantity('vs_i')\n>>> vs_i.set_dimension(current)\n>>> convert_to(vs/vs_i, ohm)\nohm/1000\n```\n### Further discussion\nThe problem is related to the kilogram workaround and the property `scale_factor`. The default scale_factor for a Quantity is 1.\n```\n>>> vs.scale_factor\n1.0\n```\nThe docstring for `scale_factor' states:\n> Overall magnitude of the quantity as compared to the canonical units.\nBut, the scale factor for ohm is 1000.\n```\n>>> ohm.scale_factor\n1000\nThis value of 1000 conflicts with the definition. `scale_factor` is a user facing property and should be consistent with the unit system definition, in this case the SI. The kilogram workaround should be an internal implementation factor and not exposed to the user.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand the implementation details of several components within the sympy physics units module, particularly around the `Quantity` class, its `scale_factor` attribute, and how the division operation is handled to yield units like ohm from voltage and current. Based on the description, we should gather information around the `Quantity` class, the `set_dimension` method, and the `convert_to` function, as well as the implementation details of how `scale_factor` is used within these contexts.\n\nLet's break down the necessary API calls to gather this context:\n\n1. **Search for the `Quantity` class**: This will give us an overview of the implementation of `Quantity`, including the `scale_factor` property.\n   \n2. **Search for the `set_dimension` method in the `Quantity` class**: Since `set_dimension` is used to define the dimension of a quantity, understanding its implementation will be crucial, especially in relation to how it interacts with `scale_factor`.\n\n3. **Search for the `convert_to` function**: This function is used to convert quantities to a specific unit, and its implementation detail can shed light on how `scale_factor` affects unit conversion.\n\n4. **Search for the `scale_factor` within the `Quantity` class**: This will help us understand how `scale_factor` is defined and possibly modified, providing insights into its accessibility and whether it should be public or private.\n\nGiven the goals, here are the API calls I will make:\n\n- `search_class(\"Quantity\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"set_dimension\", \"Quantity\")`\n- `search_method(\"convert_to\")`\n- `search_code(\"scale_factor\")`"
