        "intended_behavior": "The `scale_factor` attribute should be made private, i.e., `_scale_factor`, to encapsulate its access and modification. Access to the scale factor should be controlled via a getter (already available as a property) and, if necessary, a setter method that validates changes to the scale factor, ensuring they are consistent with the intended unit system and internal workarounds like the kilogram issue are abstracted from the end user. This change would prevent direct modifications to the `scale_factor` that could lead to inconsistencies or unexpected behaviors in unit conversions."

        "intended_behavior": "Ensure that the `set_scale_factor` method (if it's making `scale_factor` public or allowing direct modification) imposes strict validation or adjustment logic that accounts for the SI system's peculiarities, including the kilogram workaround. The method should ensure that any adjustments to the scale factor are made in a manner that remains consistent with expectations for units within the SI system. This involves reinforcing the abstraction around the scale factor so that end users are shielded from the complexities of the unit system implementations, specifically ensuring any modifications do not inadvertently expose or rely on the end user to account for internal conversion factors like the kilogram's 1000 factor."
