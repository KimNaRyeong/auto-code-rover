In the SI system, 1 V/ 1 A = 1 \u03a9.\n### What I Did\n```\n>>> from sympy.physics.units import Quantity, voltage, current, ohm, convert_to\n>>> vs = Quantity('vs')\n>>> vs.set_dimension(voltage)\n>>> vs_i = Quantity('vs_i')\n>>> vs_i.set_dimension(current)\n>>> convert_to(vs/vs_i, ohm)\nohm/1000\n```\n### Further discussion\nThe problem is related to the kilogram workaround and the property `scale_factor`. The default scale_factor for a Quantity is 1.\n```\n>>> vs.scale_factor\n1.0\n```\nThe docstring for `scale_factor' states:\n> Overall magnitude of the quantity as compared to the canonical units.\nBut, the scale factor for ohm is 1000.\n```\n>>> ohm.scale_factor\n1000\nThis value of 1000 conflicts with the definition. `scale_factor` is a user facing property and should be consistent with the unit system definition, in this case the SI. The kilogram workaround should be an internal implementation factor and not exposed to the user.\n</issue>"

        "content": "The collected context from the API calls provides a comprehensive overview of how quantities, dimensions, and unit conversions are handled within the Sympy physics units module. Let's analyze the key findings:\n\n### `Quantity` class in `quantities.py`\n- **What it does**: This class represents physical quantities, which can have dimensions and scale factors related to a unit system (e.g., SI units). It has methods to set dimensions (`set_dimension`), scale factors (`set_scale_factor`), and a property to get the scale factor (`scale_factor`), among other functionalities.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: The issue revolves around the `scale_factor` attribute being publicly accessible and potentially inconsistent, particularly with the kg workaround, leading to unexpected results when converting units (e.g., `ohm`). Making `scale_factor` private would encapsulate its functionality and allow for better control over its modification and access.\n- **Intended behavior**: Ideally, modifications to the `scale_factor` attribute should be mediated through class methods rather than direct public access, ensuring consistency and correctness in the representation of quantities and their conversions.\n\n### `set_dimension` method in `Quantity`\n- **What it does**: Assigns a dimension (e.g., length, mass) to a `Quantity` instance and restricts it to the SI system for now, throwing an error if a non-SI system is attempted.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: While `set_dimension` itself doesn't directly manipulate `scale_factor`, it sets up the framework within which dimensions are utilized, indirectly affecting how conversions (that rely on dimensions and scale factors) are performed.\n- **Intended behavior**: This method should ensure that the dimension of a quantity aligns with the unit system, supporting accurate conversions, which in turn would depend on correctly set scale factors.\n\n### `convert_to` method/function\n- **What it does**: There are two aspects to this: a method within the `Quantity` class allowing a quantity to be converted to another unit of the same dimension, and a more general-purpose function in `util.py` that handles the actual conversion logic, including the handling of expressions involving quantities.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: The unexpected conversion result (`ohm/1000`) mentioned in the issue arises during the process of converting quantities, which is precisely what `convert_to` handles. The conversion process relies on `scale_factor` to calculate the resulting quantity, highlighting a direct link to the bug.\n- **Intended behavior**: The `convert_to` logic should accurately reflect conversions within the specified unit system (SI, in this case), accounting for the actual scale factors without exposing or being affected negatively by internal workarounds (like the kilogram issue).\n\n### Occurrences of `scale_factor` in various modules\n- These occurrences underscore the widespread use and importance of `scale_factor` throughout the units module, affecting geometry, unit definitions, and utility functions.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: The issue's core is the manipulation and access of `scale_factor`, which is integral to how units are defined, converted, and interpreted across the module.\n- **Intended behavior**: The manipulation of `scale_factor` should be consistent and controlled throughout the module, ensuring that quantities accurately reflect their intended values and conversions align with expectations.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**: To resolve the reported issue, we should aim at modifying the accessibility of `scale_factor` in a way that it's controlled through methods, making sure it aligns with the unit system's intentions without exposing the internal workarounds to the end-user. This would involve ensuring that `scale_factor` adjustments (especially those due to the kg workaround) are hidden from the user or presented in a manner consistent with the SI system's expectations.\n\nGiven the context and the analysis, the next steps would include planning the implementation changes:\n1. Making `scale_factor` a private attribute (e.g., `_scale_factor`).\n2. Adjusting all internal uses of `scale_factor` to reflect this change.\n3. Providing a controlled interface (if not already adequately done) for adjusting the scale factor, encapsulating any workarounds or special handling required for consistency with the unit system."

Access to the scale factor should be controlled via a getter (already available as a property) and, if necessary, a setter method that validates changes to the scale factor, ensuring they are consistent with the intended unit system and internal workarounds like the kilogram issue are abstracted from the end user. This change would prevent direct modifications to the `scale_factor` that could lead to inconsistencies or unexpected behaviors in unit conversions.\n\n   - **Location 2:**\n     - File: `sympy/physics/units/quantities.py`\n     - Class: `Quantity`\n     - Method: `set_scale_factor`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** Ensure that the `set_scale_factor` method (if it's making `scale_factor` public or allowing direct modification) imposes strict validation or adjustment logic that accounts for the SI system's peculiarities, including the kilogram workaround. The method should ensure that any adjustments to the scale factor are made in a manner that remains consistent with expectations for units within the SI system. This involves reinforcing the abstraction around the scale factor so that end users are shielded from the complexities of the unit system implementations, specifically ensuring any modifications do not inadvertently expose or rely on the end user to account for internal conversion factors like the kilogram's 1000 factor.\n\nThese changes aim at maintaining the existing functionality\u2014enabling accurate and expected unit conversions and interactions\u2014while rectifying the inconsistency problem flagged in the issue. Ensuring `scale_factor` is properly encapsulated and managed within the `Quantity` class would resolve the unexpected behavior observed by the user."
