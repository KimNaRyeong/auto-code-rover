And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue mentioned, we need to gather more context about where and how the incorrect hint is being generated in the Django codebase. This involves the usage of ForeignKeys in an intermediary model for a ManyToMany (m2m) field and the specific error message related to it. Given the details from the issue description, we can infer that the error hint is misplaced or incorrect in the context of ForeignKey arguments. \n\nConsidering this, we should look into:\n1. The method or function where this specific error hint is being generated regarding the ForeignKey and ManyToManyField discrepancy.\n2. The correct usage or recommendation for m2m fields especially when dealing with recursive relationships and more than 2 ForeignKeys without specified through_fields.\n3. The relevant part of the Django documentation or codebase where `symmetrical=False` is discussed in the context of ManyToManyField, especially for Django versions 3.0 and after, as the issue mentions it's outdated.\n\nTo begin with, we don't have the exact name of the method or class where this issue originates, so we will start with a broad search based on the keywords and information described in the issue:\n\n- search_code(\"If you want to create a recursive relationship, use ForeignKey\")\n- search_code(\"symmetrical=False, through=\")\n\nThese searches aim to locate the erroneous hint in the codebase, identifying where the correction needs to be applied."
