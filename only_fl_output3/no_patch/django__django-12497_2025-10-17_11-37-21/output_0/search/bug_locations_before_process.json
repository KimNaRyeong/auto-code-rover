        "intended_behavior": "The intention here is to correct the guidance provided in the error hints within the `_check_relationship_model` method. The error message incorrectly refers to configuring a `ForeignKey` for adjustments that should be applied to a `ManyToManyField` in the context of recursive relationships and intermediary models. The corrected hint should not reference `ForeignKey` but instead provide guidance relevant to configuring a `ManyToManyField`, ensuring it aligns with Django's best practices and current version requirements. Additionally, the advice including `symmetrical=False` as a parameter should be re-evaluated and possibly removed if it is indeed outdated, ensuring the hint reflects the correct approach for Django versions 3.0 and beyond. - Remove the incorrect suggestion to use `ForeignKey` in the hint. - Clarify the hint to reflect ManyToManyField configuration steps accurately, especially when custom intermediary models without `through_fields` are involved. - Evaluate and update the advice around using `symmetrical=False`, ensuring the guidance is current with Django's standards for recursive relationships with an intermediary model."
