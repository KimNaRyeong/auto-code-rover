        "intended_behavior": "The `mean` method should include additional logic to check if the specified dimension(s) in the `dim` argument exist within the dataset or data array it is operating upon. If a specified dimension is not present, the method should raise a ValueError with a clear and descriptive message indicating that the dimension does not exist. This behavior ensures that the method does not silently ignore non-existent dimensions, thus providing feedback similar to that of unweighted operations and aligning with user expectations for error handling. This validation step should occur before any computational operations are carried out, ideally at the beginning of the method. The rest of the method's functionality remains as is, preserving its existing capabilities while adding robust error handling for dimension validation."
