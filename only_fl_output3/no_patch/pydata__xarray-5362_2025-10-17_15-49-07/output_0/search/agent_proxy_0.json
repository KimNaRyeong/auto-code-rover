            "content": "To better understand and fix the issue reported, I'll need more context about how weighted operations are implemented in xarray, specifically about how dimensions are processed during these operations. Given the details from the issue, the relevant methods and classes to look at might be those related to the `weighted` functionality and how dimension checks are performed before operations such as the `mean` are executed. Here are the steps I would take using the search APIs:\n\n1. Since the issue is with weighted operations and not raising errors for non-existent dimensions, it's essential to find where these operations are defined within the `xarray` library. The entry point seems to be the `weighted` method, so I'd look for that first.\n\n2. The issue mentions `.mean(\"dummy\")` as part of the operation that doesn't behave as expected, indicating that the `.mean()` method, likely of a class that handles weighted operations, might need examination.\n\n3. To better understand how dimensions are checked (or not checked) during such operations, analyzing the implementation of both `weighted` and `mean` methods could provide insights into where the inconsistency or lack of error handling might occur.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are my API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"weighted\")`: To find where and how the `weighted` function is implemented.\n- `search_method(\"mean\")`: To locate implementations of the `mean` method, which is called on the result of the `weighted` method.\n\nThese calls should provide a good starting point to explore the codebase for the relevant sections that need modification or enhancement to address the issue reported."
