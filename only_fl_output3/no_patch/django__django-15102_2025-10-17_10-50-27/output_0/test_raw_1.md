To address the issue properly and reproduce the situation with a standalone Python script, we must execute the Django `startproject` management command in a way that resembles how users might do it from the command line, while also ensuring our Python script can programmatically set and respect the `umask`.

Given the constraints and requirements, below is a revised standalone Python script that aims to reproduce the issue. This version uses the `subprocess` module to invoke Django's `django-admin startproject` command directly from the script, which should be a closer approximation of the original issue's setup. Additionally, it checks the permissions of the created `settings.py` file to see if they honor the `umask` setting or not.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import stat
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_django_environment():
    """
    This function attempts to create a Django project in a way that simulates the typical command-line usage
    but does so in an isolated environment to understand if the umask settings are respected.
    """
    # Set umask to 077 so that newly created files are accessible only by the owner
    os.umask(0o077)
    project_name = "tmp_project"

    # Attempt to create a Django project using django-admin startproject command
    try:
        subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'django', 'startproject', project_name])
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print("Failed to create Django project with django-admin startproject")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Clean up partially created project directory, if necessary
        return

    # After project creation, check permissions of settings.py
    settings_path = os.path.join(project_name, 'settings.py')
    try:
        # Stat the file to get its mode (permissions)
        st = os.stat(settings_path)
        # Extract the permission bits and assert against expected umask applied permissions
        actual_permissions = stat.S_IMODE(st.st_mode)
        expected_permissions = 0o700  # Expected as umask was set to 077
        if actual_permissions != expected_permissions:
            raise AssertionError(f"settings.py permissions {oct(actual_permissions)} do not match expected {oct(expected_permissions)} considering umask 077")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error checking permissions of {settings_path}")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    
    print("Permissions of settings.py file are as expected, according to umask. Issue not present or has been resolved.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    setup_django_environment()
```

**Please Note:**
- This script now directly uses `subprocess.check_call` to mimic running the `django-admin startproject tmp_project` command, which should more accurately simulate user actions.
- The script sets umask to `077` before project creation, attempting to ensure that files created by `startproject` are only accessible by the file's owner.
- After the project has been created, it checks the permissions of `settings.py` to see if they respect the umask of `077`.
- If the permissions do not match the expectations set by umask `077`, it raises an `AssertionError`.
- The script should be run in an environment where Django is installed and accessible.
