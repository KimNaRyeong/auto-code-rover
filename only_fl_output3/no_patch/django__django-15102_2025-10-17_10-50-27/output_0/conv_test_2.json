This means that the user's umask doesn't work, e.g.:\n$ umask 077\n$ touch foo\n$ ls -l foo\n-rw------- 1 talex talex 0 2007-05-12 13:27 foo\n$ PYTHONPATH=trunk ./trunk/django/bin/django-admin.py startproject mysite\n$ ls -l mysite/settings.py \n-rw-r--r-- 1 talex talex 2804 2007-05-12 13:28 mysite/settings.py\nI discovered this whilst trying to make a Zero Install package for Django. Everything in the Zero Install cache is read-only, so startproject fails with:\n File \"/var/cache/0install.net/implementations/sha1new=262c95b5a7cc34f525408b675106e4e4ae3494cc/django/core/management.py\", line 799, in startproject\n\tfp = open(main_settings_file, 'w')\nIOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '.../site/settings.py'\nThanks,\n"

        "content": "To address the issue properly and reproduce the situation with a standalone Python script, we must execute the Django `startproject` management command in a way that resembles how users might do it from the command line, while also ensuring our Python script can programmatically set and respect the `umask`.\n\nGiven the constraints and requirements, below is a revised standalone Python script that aims to reproduce the issue. This version uses the `subprocess` module to invoke Django's `django-admin startproject` command directly from the script, which should be a closer approximation of the original issue's setup. Additionally, it checks the permissions of the created `settings.py` file to see if they honor the `umask` setting or not.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nimport stat\nimport sys\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef setup_django_environment():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function attempts to create a Django project in a way that simulates the typical command-line usage\n    but does so in an isolated environment to understand if the umask settings are respected.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set umask to 077 so that newly created files are accessible only by the owner\n    os.umask(0o077)\n    project_name = \"tmp_project\"\n\n    # Attempt to create a Django project using django-admin startproject command\n    try:\n        subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'django', 'startproject', project_name])\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\n        print(\"Failed to create Django project with django-admin startproject\")\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        # Clean up partially created project directory, if necessary\n        return\n\n    # After project creation, check permissions of settings.py\n    settings_path = os.path.join(project_name, 'settings.py')\n    try:\n        # Stat the file to get its mode (permissions)\n        st = os.stat(settings_path)\n        # Extract the permission bits and assert against expected umask applied permissions\n        actual_permissions = stat.S_IMODE(st.st_mode)\n        expected_permissions = 0o700  # Expected as umask was set to 077\n        if actual_permissions != expected_permissions:\n            raise AssertionError(f\"settings.py permissions {oct(actual_permissions)} do not match expected {oct(expected_permissions)} considering umask 077\")\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        sys.exit(1)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error checking permissions of {settings_path}\")\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        sys.exit(1)\n    \n    print(\"Permissions of settings.py file are as expected, according to umask.
