This means adjusting the file creation and open process to not explicitly set permissions in a way that overrides umask. For example, when files are being copied or created from templates, the process should either directly respect the umask by not specifying permission bits explicitly or adjust the permissions after file creation by applying the umask to the default permissions. The core functionality of creating files from templates should remain intact, with the only change being the respect for umask settings to ensure file permissions are set according to user expectations and system security policies."
