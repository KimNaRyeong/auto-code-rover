Given your updated requirement, let's create a Python script `reproducer.py` that specifically targets the `startproject` command behavior with respect to `umask`. This script will:

1. Set the `umask` to `077`.
2. Run the `django-admin startproject` command programmatically via Django's command execution interface instead of using `subprocess`. This requires Django to be installed and configured in the environment where the script runs.
3. Check the permissions of the `settings.py` file in the newly created project to see if they honor the `umask`.
4. Use the provided function to print the stack trace if an exception is caught.

```python
import os
import sys
import stat
from django.core import management

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def set_umask_and_check_permissions():
    os.umask(0o077)
    project_name = "test_project"
    settings_path = os.path.join(project_name, project_name, "settings.py")
    
    try:
        # Using Django's command execution interface to simulate 'django-admin startproject'
        management.call_command('startproject', project_name)
        
        # Checking the permissions of the settings.py file
        file_stat = os.stat(settings_path)
        permissions = stat.S_IMODE(file_stat.st_mode)
        expected_permissions = 0o600  # Expected because umask is set to 077
        
        assert permissions == expected_permissions, f"settings.py permissions do not honor umask: {oct(permissions)}"

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    set_umask_and_check_permissions()
    print("Issue has been fixed or cannot be reproduced.")
    sys.exit(0)
```

This script attempts to simulate the reported issue in a Django environment. Make sure to run this script in an environment where Django is installed, and the Django project's settings are properly configured to avoid encountering import errors or other configuration issues. If the script exits with code 0 and prints "Issue has been fixed or cannot be reproduced," it implies that the specific issue with respecting `umask` settings in `django-admin startproject` does not occur in the test environment.

It's important to note that this script directly interacts with Django's command interface and will alter the current directory structure by adding a new Django project. You might want to run this script in a contained environment (like a virtual environment) and remove the created project directory (`test_project`) after the test.
