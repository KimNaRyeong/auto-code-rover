Here's a Python script that aims to reproduce the issue mentioned regarding `django-admin.py startproject` not honoring `umask` settings. The script sets the umask, creates a new Django project using the Django management command programmatically (making it a standalone script without needing the Django command-line interface directly), and then checks the file permissions of the created `settings.py` to assert whether they honor the umask setting or not.

```python
import os
import stat
import subprocess
import sys
try:
    from django.core.management import call_command
    from django.conf import settings
except ImportError as e:
    print("Error: Django needs to be installed to reproduce this issue.")
    sys.exit(1)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def repro_issue():
    # Set umask to 077 so all newly created files should only be accessible by the owner
    os.umask(0o077)

    # Temporarily configure Django settings (minimal)
    settings.configure(
        INSTALLED_APPS=['django.contrib.auth', 'django.contrib.contenttypes', 'django.contrib.sessions']
    )

    # Create a new project programmatically
    try:
        project_name = "test_project"
        call_command('startproject', project_name)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Failed to create project:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    # Check permissions for settings.py, they should inherit from the current umask
    settings_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), project_name, 'settings.py')
    try:
        st = os.stat(settings_path)
        # Assert if settings.py has more permissions than allowed by umask (should not be world-readable or group-readable)
        assert oct(st.st_mode & 0o777) == '0o700', "settings.py does not honor umask 077"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error accessing settings.py to check permissions:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    print("Issue not present, settings.py honors umask.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    repro_issue()
```

This script sets the `umask` value to `077`, meaning files created thereafter should only have permissions for the file's owner (and no permissions for group and others). It then uses Django's internal `call_command` function to programmatically run the `startproject` command, which should simulate the creation of a new Django project similar to using `django-admin.py startproject`. After the project is created, the script checks the permissions of the `settings.py` file in the new project to assert whether it respects the set `umask` or not. If the file permissions are not as expected, the script raises an `AssertionError`.
