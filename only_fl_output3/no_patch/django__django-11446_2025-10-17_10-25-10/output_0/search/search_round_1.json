        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue described, we need to understand how Django serves the default 404 error page, especially in non-debug mode (`DEBUG=False`). The primary objective is to locate the relevant code that generates or serves the default 404 error response. Here are the appropriate API calls to be made based on the descriptions and keywords from the issue:\n\n1. **Search for error handling in Django**: Given that Django is designed around a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture, the logic for serving default error pages like the 404 page would likely be encapsulated in a view or some middleware for handling HTTP responses. Hence, we need to identify where this logic resides.\n\nAPI calls:\n- `search_code(\"DEBUG=False\")`: This search is broad but can help identify how configuration settings, particularly the `DEBUG` setting, affect the behavior of error handling.\n- `search_class(\"HttpResponseNotFound\")`: Since the issue involves the serving of a \"Not Found\" page, it's plausible that Django uses a specific response class for 404 errors.\n\n2. **Locate where Django defines its default error pages**: The issue indicates a difference between the error pages served in debug mode and non-debug mode, pointing towards a conditional logic based on the `DEBUG` setting.\n\nAPI calls:\n- `search_method(\"default_error_page\")`: This is a hypothetical method name. The actual method name might differ, but we're looking for functions or methods responsible for generating or serving default error pages.\n\n3. **Check for HTML template rendering**: Since the expectation is to serve a full HTML document for error pages in non-debug mode, it's essential to find the part of the code that renders or returns HTML responses for errors.\n\nAPI calls:\n- `search_code(\"404 error page\")`: This targets finding any explicit references to the handling or configuration of 404 error pages.\n- `search_method(\"render_to_response\")`: Assuming Django uses a method like this to render HTML responses, it may be involved in generating the error page.\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how Django handles 404 errors, particularly when `DEBUG=False`, and where the current implementation might be modified to ensure a full HTML document is served as the 404 error page."

        "content": "Based on the collected context, let's analyze the information we've gathered to understand how it relates to the issue at hand\u2014the incorrect formatting of default error webpages in Django when `DEBUG=False`.\n\n### Analysis of Search Results\n\n**1. django/utils/log.py (Default Logging Configuration)**\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?** This configuration outlines how Django handles logging. It mentions that HTTP 500 errors trigger an email to the site admins. Additionally, it distinguishes behavior based on the `DEBUG` setting, with log records being sent to the console when `DEBUG=True` and discarded otherwise.\n  \n- **Relationship to the bug:** While this section doesn't directly address the handling of 404 pages or their HTML formatting, it illustrates how Django's `DEBUG` setting influences error handling behavior. It hints at a broader pattern where Django's response to errors\u2014including possibly the rendering of error pages\u2014differs based on whether it's in debug mode.\n  \n- **Intended behavior:** This section suggests that, in general, diagnostics and error reporting in Django are intentionally less verbose or differently formatted when not in debug mode. For the specific issue of error page formatting, it indicates there might be separate logic in place that alters the error page output based on the `DEBUG` setting.\n\n**2. django/views/csrf.py (Inline Translation Handling)**\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?** It discusses handling translation for error messages, particularly how messages appear depending on the `DEBUG` setting. It points out the translation's dependency on `DEBUG=False` for certain texts.\n  \n- **Relationship to the bug:** Though specifically about CSRF error messages and their translation, this highlights Django's pattern of varying response content based on the debug status. It shows that there are different pathways or outputs in the code conditioned on the `DEBUG` setting, which could relate to how error pages are served.\n  \n- **Intended behavior:** The behavior here illuminates how Django considers the user or developer experience, especially in error messaging, by modifying content based on the environment. In the context of the issue, it might imply the necessity for a more user-friendly, fully-formed HTML page for errors in the production environment (`DEBUG=False`).\n\n**3. django/http/response.py (HttpResponseNotFound)**\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?** This part of the code defines the `HttpResponseNotFound` class with a `status_code` of 404. It's a subclass of `HttpResponse` specifically for handling 404 Not Found responses.\n  \n- **Relationship to the bug:** Directly relevant to the issue, this class is likely responsible for generating the HTTP response for 404 errors. The simplistic definition doesn\u2019t indicate any HTML formatting, pointing to the area where enhancements could be integrated for full-page HTML errors.\n  \n- **Intended behavior:** Ideally, this HttpResponse class or its method of instantiation should include or reference a complete HTML template when constructing 404 responses, at least when `DEBUG=False`. This means there could be a need to extend or modify how this object handles response bodies for errors.\n\n**4. django/views/generic/base.py & django/views/i18n.py (render_to_response)**\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?** These methods likely serve the purpose of rendering templates or responses back to the user. `render_to_response` takes a template and context, then produces an HTTP response.\n  \n- **Relationship to the bug:** Given that rendering involves generating HTML content to send to clients, these methods\u2014and the mechanisms they use\u2014could be integral to solving the issue. They might be part of the pathway for delivering fully-formed HTML error pages.\n  \n- **Intended behavior:** For errors like 404, these rendering methods might be tapped to ensure the delivery of a complete HTML document as the error response. The fix could involve ensuring error handling integrates with `render_to_response` or similar methods to output proper HTML structure.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven this analysis, it's clear that adjustments to how Django serves 404 pages in non-debug mode might require intervention at the level of error handling and response rendering. A code modification ensuring `HttpResponseNotFound` or the associated rendering pathway includes a full HTML document seems necessary.\n\nTo further refine the solution, we could:\n1. Investigate how `HttpResponseNotFound` is used across the project to generate 404 responses.\n2. Explore the rendering pathway (`render_to_response` or similar) for opportunities to include or reference complete HTML templates in error responses, particularly when `DEBUG=False`.\n\nGiven this, a good next step with the API would be to delve deeper into the usage of `HttpResponseNotFound` and the mechanisms for rendering responses to ensure error pages are served with full HTML in production environments."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

This ensures even in `DEBUG=False` mode, users see a fully-formed HTML error page. This could involve modifying how instances of `HttpResponseNotFound` are initialized or how they generate their response bodies.\n\nPreserving existing functionality means that any changes introduced should not alter the response's HTTP status code or interfere with projects that override the default 404 behavior. The introduction of a default HTML template for 404 errors must also consider extensibility, allowing developers to easily specify custom templates."
