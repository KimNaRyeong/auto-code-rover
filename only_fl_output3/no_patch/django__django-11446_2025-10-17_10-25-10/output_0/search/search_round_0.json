        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue described, we need to understand how Django serves the default 404 error page, especially in non-debug mode (`DEBUG=False`). The primary objective is to locate the relevant code that generates or serves the default 404 error response. Here are the appropriate API calls to be made based on the descriptions and keywords from the issue:\n\n1. **Search for error handling in Django**: Given that Django is designed around a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture, the logic for serving default error pages like the 404 page would likely be encapsulated in a view or some middleware for handling HTTP responses. Hence, we need to identify where this logic resides.\n\nAPI calls:\n- `search_code(\"DEBUG=False\")`: This search is broad but can help identify how configuration settings, particularly the `DEBUG` setting, affect the behavior of error handling.\n- `search_class(\"HttpResponseNotFound\")`: Since the issue involves the serving of a \"Not Found\" page, it's plausible that Django uses a specific response class for 404 errors.\n\n2. **Locate where Django defines its default error pages**: The issue indicates a difference between the error pages served in debug mode and non-debug mode, pointing towards a conditional logic based on the `DEBUG` setting.\n\nAPI calls:\n- `search_method(\"default_error_page\")`: This is a hypothetical method name. The actual method name might differ, but we're looking for functions or methods responsible for generating or serving default error pages.\n\n3. **Check for HTML template rendering**: Since the expectation is to serve a full HTML document for error pages in non-debug mode, it's essential to find the part of the code that renders or returns HTML responses for errors.\n\nAPI calls:\n- `search_code(\"404 error page\")`: This targets finding any explicit references to the handling or configuration of 404 error pages.\n- `search_method(\"render_to_response\")`: Assuming Django uses a method like this to render HTML responses, it may be involved in generating the error page.\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how Django handles 404 errors, particularly when `DEBUG=False`, and where the current implementation might be modified to ensure a full HTML document is served as the 404 error page."
