        "intended_behavior": "Extend the implementation of `HttpResponseNotFound` to ensure that when a 404 error is generated, instead of just setting a `status_code`, it also should include a default HTML template or a mechanism to render a full HTML page. This ensures even in `DEBUG=False` mode, users see a fully-formed HTML error page. This could involve modifying how instances of `HttpResponseNotFound` are initialized or how they generate their response bodies.\n\nPreserving existing functionality means that any changes introduced should not alter the response's HTTP status code or interfere with projects that override the default 404 behavior. The introduction of a default HTML template for 404 errors must also consider extensibility, allowing developers to easily specify custom templates."
