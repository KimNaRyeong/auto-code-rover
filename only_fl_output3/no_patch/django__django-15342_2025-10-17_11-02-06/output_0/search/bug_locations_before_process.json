        "intended_behavior": "The modified behavior of the `get_field` method should first check if the model actually uses the `order_with_respect_to` option before attempting to replace `_order` with the specified field in `order_with_respect_to`. This means adding a conditional check to ensure 'order_with_respect_to' is not only present in `self.options` but also applies to the current model context. If `order_with_respect_to` is not being used, the method should treat `_order` as a normal field name and proceed to return the field without attempting substitution. To preserve existing functionality for models that do use `order_with_respect_to`, the method should only alter its behavior when 'order_with_respect_to' is not set. This ensures that models relying on automatic `_order` to `order_with_respect_to` field replacement continue to function as expected. This adjustment ensures that a KeyError is avoided by not attempting to access `order_with_respect_to` when it's not applicable, thereby handling models with a `_order` field that are not using `order_with_respect_to` correctly."
