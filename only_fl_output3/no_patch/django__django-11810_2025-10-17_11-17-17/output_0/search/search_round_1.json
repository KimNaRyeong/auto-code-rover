        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results provides us with detailed insights into the parts of the Django framework that likely contribute to the reported issue. Let's break down the findings:\n\n### 1. `select_related` Method in `QuerySet`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `select_related` method in the `QuerySet` class allows for optimization of SQL queries. When called, it alters the query to include fields from related objects (via `ForeignKey`) in a single database query. This method changes the `QuerySet` object's underlying SQL query to prefetch related object data.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug\nThe issue reports that calling `select_related` on a `QuerySet` object that was derived from another `QuerySet` object which had already called `select_related`, unexpectedly modifies the original `QuerySet` as well. According to the provided code snippet, the method uses `_chain()` to seemingly clone the `QuerySet` for modification. However, the mutation of the original `QuerySet` suggests that this cloning process might not be creating a fully independent copy.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nThe intended behavior, as described, would be for the `select_related` call on the new `QuerySet` to not affect the original `QuerySet` from which it was derived. Each `QuerySet` should maintain its own state independently unless explicitly modified.\n\n### 2. `_clone` Method in `QuerySet`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `_clone` method is designed to create a copy of the current `QuerySet`, serving as a lightweight alternative to deep copy. It's crucial for operations that need to produce a new `QuerySet` instance based on the state of an existing one without altering the original.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug\nThis function is central to understanding the issue since the mutation of the original `QuerySet` implies that the clone operation (initiated through `_chain()`, which probably calls `_clone` internally) does not completely isolate the new `QuerySet`'s state from the original. This is evident because the subsequent `select_related` call on the cloned `QuerySet` ends up affecting the query of the original `QuerySet`.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nThe `_clone` method is intended to produce a fully independent copy of a `QuerySet`, such that modifications to the clone do not impact the original `QuerySet`. Given the issue description, it appears there may be references or shared state between the original and the cloned `QuerySet` that should be addressed to ensure independence.\n\n### Summary and Next Steps\n\nThe relationship between `select_related`'s use of `_chain()` for cloning and the unexpected mutation of the original `QuerySet` points towards a potential flaw in the cloning process where not all aspects of the `QuerySet`'s state are being independently copied. The intended behavior of these methods is to allow for the construction of new, independent `QuerySet` instances that can be modified without impacting each other.\n\nTo address the bug, a detailed review of both the `_clone` method and how `select_related` utilizes it (or any other method it uses for cloning or creating new instances) is necessary. Specifically, it would be important to ensure that any references to mutable objects within the `QuerySet` are deeply copied to prevent shared state between clones. This might involve inspecting how the `query` attribute of the `QuerySet` is handled during cloning, as this attribute seems central to the observed mutation issue."

This might involve reassessing how the `_chain` method is utilized within `select_related` or ensuring that the cloning process within `_chain` (`_clone` method) comprehensively duplicates the query state to prevent shared mutable state between instances.\n\n- **Location 2**: File: django/db/models/query.py, Class: QuerySet, Method: _clone\n    - **Intended Behavior**: The `_clone` method should guarantee a deep copy of the `QuerySet's` state, especially considering mutable attributes that influence the outcome of queries. Despite its current implementation aimed at being a lightweight alternative to deepcopy, it must be ensured that no shared references (especially for the `query` attribute and related mutable objects within it) exist between the original and the cloned `QuerySet`. This is to maintain the independence of cloned `QuerySets` modifications.\n\nIn summary, to resolve the issue, alterations in how `select_related` employs cloning (via `_chain` or directly through `_clone`) need to ensure cloned `QuerySet`s are indeed independent from their originals. Additionally, the `_clone` method itself might require adjustments to ensure deeper copying of certain attributes to prevent unintended shared state, specifically concerning how the SQL query construction is managed between clone-parent relationships."
