        "intended_behavior": "The `select_related` method should ensure that when it clones the original `QuerySet` to return a new instance with updated selections, this cloning process must be deep enough so that alterations to the new `QuerySet` do not retrospectively apply to the original `QuerySet`. This might involve reassessing how the `_chain` method is utilized within `select_related` or ensuring that the cloning process within `_chain` (`_clone` method) comprehensively duplicates the query state to prevent shared mutable state between instances."

        "intended_behavior": "The `_clone` method should guarantee a deep copy of the `QuerySet's` state, especially considering mutable attributes that influence the outcome of queries. Despite its current implementation aimed at being a lightweight alternative to deepcopy, it must be ensured that no shared references (especially for the `query` attribute and related mutable objects within it) exist between the original and the cloned `QuerySet`. This is to maintain the independence of cloned `QuerySets` modifications."
