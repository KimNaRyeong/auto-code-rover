        "content": "<issue>Make getting a topocentric ITRS position easier\n### What is the problem this feature will solve?\nRight now, it is not easy to create ITRS coordinates for sources relative to a given location (rather than geocentric), to the level that we have specific instructions on how to calculate relative `CartesianCoordinates` and then put these into an `ITRS`: https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/coordinates/common_errors.html#altaz-calculations-for-earth-based-objects\nThis has led to numerous issues, the latest of which is #12678\n### Describe the desired outcome\nIt would be nice if as part of `EarthLocation.get_itrs()` it would be possible to get a topocentric rather than a geocentric position. In #12678, @tomfelker and @mkbrewer [suggested](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/12678#issuecomment-1463366166) (and below) to extend `.get_itrs()` to take not just an `obstime` but also a `location` argument, with an implementation along [the following lines](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/12678#issuecomment-1464065862):\n> the idea would be to simply add a `location` argument to `get_itrs()` that defaults to `None`. Then if a location is provided, `get_itrs()` would return a topocentric ITRS frame containing the difference between the object's position and that of the `location` argument. One could also use `EARTH_CENTER` as the default and always return the difference.\n### Additional context\nSee #12768. Labeling this a good first issue since it is easy code wise. However, writing the tests and documentation will require understanding of how ITRS and the associated coordinate transformations work.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insight into how `EarthLocation` and its method `get_itrs` currently work in the `astropy` codebase, which is highly relevant to the reported issue. Let's address the considerations one by one.\n\n### Analysis of `EarthLocation`\n\nThe `EarthLocation` class inherits from `u.Quantity`, which implies that it is designed to handle quantities with units, a common practice in `astropy` for physically meaningful computations. `EarthLocation` further specifies several methods for creating instances from either geocentric or geodetic coordinates, among other features. It provides access to properties that describe its location in various coordinate systems (e.g., geodetic, geocentric) and allows transformations into those systems.\n\n### Analysis of `get_itrs` Method\n\nThe `get_itrs` method generates an ITRS (International Terrestrial Reference System) object representing the EarthLocation object's location at a specified observation time (`obstime`). If no time is specified, it uses a default. The current implementation takes a single optional argument, `obstime`, and returns an ITRS object that represents the geocentric position of the `EarthLocation` instance at that time.\n\n### Relationship to the Issue\n\nThe issue at hand proposes to make obtaining a topocentric (local to a given point on Earth) ITRS position easier. The present `get_itrs` method does not support specifying a second location to compute a topocentric position relative to it; it only supports a geocentric perspective by default. This limitation necessitates the cumbersome calculations highlighted in the issue description, particular for Earth-based objects in astrophysics observations.\n\n### Intended Behavior per Issue Description\n\nThe request is to enhance the `get_itrs` method, allowing it to accept an additional `location` argument. This modification would enable it to calculate and return a topocentric ITRS frame when a `location` is provided, rather than a purely geocentric ITRS frame. The issue suggests that this addition would streamline the process of computing relative positions on Earth, particularly for observational astronomy where local reference frames are often required.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven this context, the proposed modification involves expanding the method's signature to include a `location` parameter, potentially defaulting to a value that represents the Earth's center, thus maintaining backward compatibility. When a `location` is provided, the method would calculate the relative position (difference) between the `EarthLocation` instance and the specified `location`, producing a topocentric ITRS frame.\n\nThe analysis suggests a clear path forward:\n- Update the `EarthLocation.get_itrs()` method to accept an additional `location` argument.\n- Implement logic within `get_itrs` to compute the difference between the `EarthLocation` instance's position and the provided `location`, returning this difference in an ITRS frame when `location` is not `None`.\n\nThe modifications would likely involve spatial calculations to determine the relative positions and adjustments in how the `ITRS` object is instantiated within the method. Further investigation into how `astropy` represents spatial differences and integrates them into the `ITRS` frame would be necessary to complete the enhancement."

This argument should default to `None` to preserve existing functionality. If a `location` is provided, the method should calculate the topocentric ITRS position relative to this `location`. This involves computing the difference between the `EarthLocation` instance's position and the `location` provided, returning this difference in an ITRS frame. For backward compatibility and to maintain the current default behavior, when `location` is `None`, the method will continue to return the geocentric ITRS position as it currently does. Additionally, care should be taken to handle the input `location` safely, validating that it is of an appropriate type or transforming it into one as needed, and applying the correct coordinate transformation computational logic to achieve the desired topocentric calculation. This update requires a clear understanding of astropy's coordinate frames and transformation capabilities, ensuring that the change integrates seamlessly with existing coordinate conversion functionalities and usages of the `get_itrs` method within the astropy project."
