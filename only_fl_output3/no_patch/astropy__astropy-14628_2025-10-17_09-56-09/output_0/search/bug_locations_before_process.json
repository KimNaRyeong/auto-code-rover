        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `get_itrs()` method to accept an additional optional argument `location`. This argument should default to `None` to preserve existing functionality. If a `location` is provided, the method should calculate the topocentric ITRS position relative to this `location`. This involves computing the difference between the `EarthLocation` instance's position and the `location` provided, returning this difference in an ITRS frame. For backward compatibility and to maintain the current default behavior, when `location` is `None`, the method will continue to return the geocentric ITRS position as it currently does. Additionally, care should be taken to handle the input `location` safely, validating that it is of an appropriate type or transforming it into one as needed, and applying the correct coordinate transformation computational logic to achieve the desired topocentric calculation. This update requires a clear understanding of astropy's coordinate frames and transformation capabilities, ensuring that the change integrates seamlessly with existing coordinate conversion functionalities and usages of the `get_itrs` method within the astropy project."
