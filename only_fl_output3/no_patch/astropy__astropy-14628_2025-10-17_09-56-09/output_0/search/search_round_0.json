        "content": "<issue>Make getting a topocentric ITRS position easier\n### What is the problem this feature will solve?\nRight now, it is not easy to create ITRS coordinates for sources relative to a given location (rather than geocentric), to the level that we have specific instructions on how to calculate relative `CartesianCoordinates` and then put these into an `ITRS`: https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/coordinates/common_errors.html#altaz-calculations-for-earth-based-objects\nThis has led to numerous issues, the latest of which is #12678\n### Describe the desired outcome\nIt would be nice if as part of `EarthLocation.get_itrs()` it would be possible to get a topocentric rather than a geocentric position. In #12678, @tomfelker and @mkbrewer [suggested](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/12678#issuecomment-1463366166) (and below) to extend `.get_itrs()` to take not just an `obstime` but also a `location` argument, with an implementation along [the following lines](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/12678#issuecomment-1464065862):\n> the idea would be to simply add a `location` argument to `get_itrs()` that defaults to `None`. Then if a location is provided, `get_itrs()` would return a topocentric ITRS frame containing the difference between the object's position and that of the `location` argument. One could also use `EARTH_CENTER` as the default and always return the difference.\n### Additional context\nSee #12768. Labeling this a good first issue since it is easy code wise. However, writing the tests and documentation will require understanding of how ITRS and the associated coordinate transformations work.\n</issue>"

Let's proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. Locate the `EarthLocation` class to understand its current capabilities and structure.\n2. Identify the current implementation of the `get_itrs` method within the `EarthLocation` class to see how it works right now.\n3. Since the issue describes adding an argument to `get_itrs`, it will be helpful to check if there is an existing implementation of `get_itrs` method that could be referenced or modified according to the suggestions.\n4. Gather some context on `CartesianCoordinates` as mentioned in the documentation to comprehend the calculations that are deemed complex by the issue.\n5. Because the issue also touches upon the concept of `ITRS` frame calculations relative to a specific location, any existing code related to `ITRS` calculation might provide insight on how to integrate the topocentric position calculation with the existing system.\n\nLet's start with the first two steps to get a better understanding of `EarthLocation` and its `get_itrs` method. \n\n- search_class(\"EarthLocation\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"get_itrs\", \"EarthLocation\")"
