Adjustments have been made based on the feedback:

1. The `f(x)` variable is properly defined as a Function of `x` to match the expected usage in SymPy. Previous confusion came from improper handling of this symbol.

2. I have ensured the test cases raise an `AssertionError` when issues are detected or proceed without error if not. Note that the issue detection and messaging through `AssertionError`s are aligned with the intent to fail the script execution on detecting the issue as described.

3. Stack traces for exceptions are printed using the provided `print_stacktrace` function, which should provide clearer insights if exceptions occur.

This version of `reproducer.py` should accurately identify and report the specific issue(s) with `idiff` as originally described, adhering to the instructions for issue reproduction, trace printing, and exit behavior based on issue presence or resolution.
