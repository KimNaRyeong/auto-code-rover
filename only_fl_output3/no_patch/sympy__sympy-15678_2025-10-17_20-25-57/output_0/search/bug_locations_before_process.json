        "intended_behavior": "1. The `idiff` method should be enhanced to correctly handle `Eq` objects by extracting and working with the equation in its two parts. 2. It should refine handling of function expressions like `f(x)` as stand-ins for symbols, ensuring correct identification and differentiation relative to the independent variable. 3. Preserve existing `idiff` functionality for cases that already work, without breaking current usage patterns."
