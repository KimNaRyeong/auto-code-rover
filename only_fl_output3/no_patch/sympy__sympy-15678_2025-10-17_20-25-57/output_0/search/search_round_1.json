The search for `idiff` in the specified file path (`./sympy/geometry/util.py`) resulted in a failure, possibly due to an incorrect path or an update in the project structure that has not been reflected in the issue description.\n2. The class `Eq` could not be found through the initial search, which suggests either a lack of understanding of the project's structure or an oversight in how classes are indexed or named within the Sympy library.\n\nGiven these points, the next steps should focus on:\n\n- Correcting the file path for the `idiff` search.\n- Finding a direct reference to the `idiff` function, perhaps through broader search methods if specific paths are not yielding results.\n- Considering alternative ways to locate or reference the `Eq` class, perhaps by understanding how equations are typically handled in SymPy if `Eq` does not directly lead to a class definition.\n- Since `f(x)` returned numerous matches across various files, especially in `sympy/solvers/ode.py` with 603 matches, it's clear that function expressions like `f(x)` are extensively used within the library, potentially providing insight into how such expressions are treated and could be effectively integrated or handled by `idiff`.\n\nTo refine our approach based on these insights, I propose the following adjusted API calls:\n\n- Correct the initial approach to find `idiff`. Given the error in locating the specified file, let's widen the search scope for `idiff` within the entire codebase instead of a specific file. This could help locate the method and understand its implementation scope and dependencies better.\n  - `search_method(\"idiff\")`\n\n- Investigate the `Eq` class or how equations are handled more broadly in SymPy to address the issue's mention of `Eq` support. Since the direct class name search was unfruitful, we might need to look into how equations are generally represented in SymPy. This calls for a broader search that might involve checking documentation or source code comments manually but let's attempt another strategy here.\n  - `search_code(\"Eq\")` as a broader attempt to find how equations are represented if not directly through a class named `Eq`.\n  \n- Reassess how functions like `f(x)` are understood by the Sympy library, focusing on a file that seems highly relevant given our context:\n  - `search_code_in_file(\"f(x)\", \"sympy/solvers/ode.py\")` since this file has a significant number of matches for `f(x)` and is likely to contain logic related to differential equations and their solutions, which is relevant for our `idiff` issue.\n\nThese refined search API calls are designed to provide a broader understanding of how `idiff`, equations, and function expressions are implemented and handled in the SymPy codebase, which is critical for resolving the issue at hand."

Since the exact locations of the bugs could not be precisely determined due to the lack of direct access to code snippets pertaining specifically to the implementation of `idiff` and its handling of `Eq` and expressions like `f(x)`, a definitive list of bug locations and intended behaviors cannot be provided at this stage. \n\nHowever, based on the issue description and the partial search results analysis, a general approach to addressing the bugs can be outlined as follows:\n\n**General Bug Location and Intended Behavior**\n\n- **File**: Initially expected to be `./sympy/geometry/util.py`, but the exact location of `idiff` could not be confirmed. The actual file needs to be identified based on a broader search of the `idiff` function within the Sympy codebase.\n\n- **Class/Method**: The `idiff` method within the file where it's implemented.\n\n- **Intended Behavior**:\n  1. The `idiff` method should be enhanced to correctly handle `Eq` objects. This implies that if an equation is passed to `idiff` wrapped in an `Eq` instance, the method should be able to extract and work with the equation in its two parts. This may require adding support for unwrapping `Eq` objects or ensuring that equations passed in this format are treated the same as those passed in a more direct `lhs - rhs` format.\n  \n  2. The handling of function expressions like `f(x)` as stand-ins for symbols like `y` should be refined. This means ensuring that when `f(x)` is passed as the dependent variable (instead of a simpler symbol like `y`), the method can correctly identify and differentiate it concerning the independent variable (e.g., `x`). This could involve better parsing of function expressions to extract the function symbol and treat it as a differentiable entity relative to the independent variable.\n  \n  3. Preserve existing `idiff` functionality for cases that already work, ensuring that any enhancements do not break current usage patterns.\n\nWithout direct code snippets or confirmation of where within the Sympy codebase these enhancements need to be applied, these descriptions serve as a high-level guide to what needs to be done to resolve the reported issue. A more detailed approach would require locating the specific implementation details of `idiff`, understanding how `Eq` is managed within Sympy, and identifying where and how function expressions like `f(x)` are parsed and handled during differentiation operations."
