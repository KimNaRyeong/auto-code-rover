        "content": "To address the issue effectively, I will need to gather more context about the `idiff` method and its surrounding code. The traceback provided in the issue mentions a file path `./sympy/geometry/util.py`, which is a good starting point. Since the issue mentions that `idiff` doesn't support the `Eq` class and has trouble with expressions like `f(x)` instead of `y`, the following steps seem appropriate:\n\n1. **Locate the `idiff` method within the specified file**: This will provide insight into how `idiff` is currently implemented and where the errors are originating from.\n2. **Understand the usage of the `Eq` class and how `idiff` is expected to interact with it**: Since `Eq` support is mentioned as lacking, obtaining context on how equations are generally handled in the codebase might offer clues on integrating `Eq` with `idiff`.\n3. **Identify how symbols and functions (like `f(x)`) are treated within the `idiff` method**: This could shed light on why `f(x)` is not recognized as a valid symbol and lead to a resolution.\n\nGiven this approach, I'll make the following search API calls:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"idiff\", \"./sympy/geometry/util.py\")`: This call will help locate the implementation of `idiff` within the mentioned file, giving insights into its current logic and possibly why it's failing with the mentioned cases.\n- `search_class(\"Eq\")`: By understanding how the `Eq` class is defined and used throughout the codebase, I can get an idea of how to properly integrate it within the `idiff` method.\n- `search_code(\"f(x)\")`: Since `f(x)` is causing an issue, seeing how similar function expressions are used or defined elsewhere might provide a workaround or solution."
