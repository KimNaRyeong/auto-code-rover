When you run this script (`python3 reproducer.py`), it executes three test cases:\n\n1. It checks if `idiff` can handle instances of `Eq`, expecting to catch an `IndexError`, recognizing the issue.\n2. It verifies whether `idiff` supports a function (`f(x)`) instead of a simple symbol (`y`) for the dependent variable, expecting a `ValueError` due to the described limitation.\n3. It confirms that `idiff` works as expected in a supported configuration, not expecting any errors.\n\nThe script uses the `print_stacktrace` function to print stack traces of caught exceptions, providing clarity on the lines that caused the exceptions. This implementation follows the desired behavior of raising an `AssertionError` if the issues are present and printing relevant stack traces."
