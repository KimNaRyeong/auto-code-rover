        "intended_behavior": "The `delayed` method needs to be enhanced to allow it to accept an optional configuration object explicitly. This configuration should then be used when the wrapped function is executed within a parallel processing context. If the configuration is missing or incomplete, especially for tasks where specific threading or execution contexts are crucial (based on the issue description), a warning should be raised to the developer. This approach maintains the existing functionality of delaying function execution while ensuring that configurations pertinent to threading models or library behavior are appropriately managed and utilized."

        "intended_behavior": "In files and methods where `joblib.Parallel` is used with the `delayed` decorator, code modifications should ensure that any configuration object needed for the parallel execution context is explicitly passed to `delayed`. This might involve passing configuration objects that include necessary information for the execution context (e.g., related to threading, backend selection, or scikit-learn's internal settings). The calls to `joblib.Parallel` need to ensure that the configuration objects are not only prepared but also accurately passed to and used by `delayed`. Furthermore, the related methods should include checks to confirm the presence of these configurations and issue warnings if configurations are improperly passed or missing, encouraging best practices in parallel execution setups."
