            "content": "To address the issue correctly and to gather sufficient context for creating a patch related to the use of `Parallel` and `delayed` in conjunction with explicit configuration passing, we will need to focus on several areas:\n\n1. Understand how `Parallel` and `delayed` are implemented or used in the codebase. This means we should first identify files or classes where these are defined or heavily used.\n2. Since the issue mentions a specific problem related to threading and the import of scikit-learn, it might be helpful to see how `Parallel` is instantiated and used across threads, if there's any code snippet available.\n3. The issue references the need to pass configuration explicitly to `delayed`, which implies we should find where `delayed` is called and examine how arguments are passed.\n4. Lastly, since the issue talks about raising a warning if the configuration is not passed correctly, it would be useful to see if there are any pieces of code that currently handle similar logic or warnings.\n\nBased on these points, here are the API calls we could use:\n\n- `search_method(\"Parallel\")`: To find out where and how `Parallel` is used or defined.\n- `search_method(\"delayed\")`: To get context on how `delayed` is used or defined.\n- `search_code(\"import scikit-learn\")`: To identify where scikit-learn is imported, which may provide insight into threading concerns.\n- `search_code(\"warning\")`: Since the issue mentions raising a warning, searching for code that generates warnings might reveal patterns or areas in the code that handle similar situations.\n\nLet's invoke these API calls to collect the necessary information."
