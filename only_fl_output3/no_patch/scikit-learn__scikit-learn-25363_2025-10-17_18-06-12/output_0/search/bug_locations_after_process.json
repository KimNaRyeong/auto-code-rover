        "intended_behavior": "The `delayed` method needs to be enhanced to allow it to accept an optional configuration object explicitly. This configuration should then be used when the wrapped function is executed within a parallel processing context. If the configuration is missing or incomplete, especially for tasks where specific threading or execution contexts are crucial (based on the issue description), a warning should be raised to the developer. This approach maintains the existing functionality of delaying function execution while ensuring that configurations pertinent to threading models or library behavior are appropriately managed and utilized."
