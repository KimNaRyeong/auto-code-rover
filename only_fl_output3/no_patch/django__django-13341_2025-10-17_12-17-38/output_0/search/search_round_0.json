ListView does not, I yet have to check others.\nThis is inconsistency and, I think, it should be fixed.\nTemplateView.get_context_data()'s kwargs returns SimpleLazyObjects that causes a crash when filtering.\nDescription\nExample Code that works in 3.0, but not in 3.1:\nclass OfferView(TemplateView):\ntemplate_name = \"offers/offer.html\"\ndef get_context_data(self, **kwargs):\noffer_slug = kwargs.get(\"offer_slug\", \"\")\noffer = get_object_or_404(Account, slug=offer_slug)\nreturn {\"offer\": offer, \"offer_slug\": offer_slug}\nIn order to make this work in 3.1, you have to explicitly convert the result of kwargs.get() to a string to get the SimpleLazyObject to resolve:\nclass OfferView(TemplateView):\ntemplate_name = \"offers/offer.html\"\ndef get_context_data(self, **kwargs):\noffer_slug = kwargs.get(\"offer_slug\", \"\")\noffer = get_object_or_404(Account, slug=str(offer_slug))\nreturn {\"offer\": offer, \"offer_slug\": offer_slug}\nThe error generated if you don't is:\nError binding parameter 0 - probably unsupported type\nfrom django/db/backends/sqlite3/operations.py, line 144, in _quote_params_for_last_executed_query\nIn both cases, the urls.py looks like:\npath(\n\"/offers/<slug:offer_slug>/\",\nOfferView.as_view(),\nname=\"offer_view\",\n),\nWhen debugging, I found that offer_slug (coming in from kwargs.get) was of type 'SimpleLazyObject' in Django 3.1, and when I explicitly converted it to a string, get_object_or_404 behaved as expected.\nThis is using Python 3.7.8 with SQLite.\n</issue>"

This might lead us to the critical part of the Django backend raising the error, particularly for SQLite.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"Error binding parameter 0 - probably unsupported type\")\n```\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of the problem areas mentioned in the issue, covering the TemplateView's handling of kwargs, the behavior of `get_object_or_404` with `SimpleLazyObject`, and the specifics of the error encountered."
