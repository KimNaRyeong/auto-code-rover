        "content": "Let's analyze the context collected from the API calls:\n\n### Analysis of `TemplateView` in `django/views/generic/base.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**  \n   The `TemplateView` class is part of Django's class-based views and is designed for rendering templates. From the snippet provided, it extends `TemplateResponseMixin`, `ContextMixin`, and `View`, indicating it leverages these mixins to handle HTTP GET requests and context preparation for rendering templates.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**  \n   The issue mentions that `TemplateView.get_context_data()` automatically pushes `self.kwargs` into the context, which is inconsistent with other views like `ListView`. However, the method `get_context_data` wasn't found in the `TemplateView` via the search made, which suggests that it may be defined in one of its parent classes or mixins (`ContextMixin` looks like a likely candidate given its name). The relationship lies in how `TemplateView` or its mixins process context data and pass `kwargs` to the template context.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**  \n   The intended behavior should provide a consistent approach to passing `kwargs` into the context across different views. Specifically for `TemplateView`, it should either not automatically pass `self.kwargs` into the context or provide clear documentation and handling mechanisms for cases where this behavior leads to issues, like with `SimpleLazyObject`.\n\n### Analysis of `get_object_or_404` in `django/shortcuts.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**  \n   `get_object_or_404` is a Django shortcut that attempts to get an object from the database based on the provided arguments. If the object is not found, it raises an `Http404` exception. It works by calling the `get()` method on a queryset, which is derived from the provided `klass` argument (Model, Manager, or QuerySet).\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**  \n   The issue describes a problem where passing a `SimpleLazyObject` (obtained from `kwargs.get`) to `get_object_or_404` leads to a crash due to an \"Error binding parameter\" when filtering. This suggests that `get_object_or_404` does not handle `SimpleLazyObject` types properly when used as filter parameters. This method, as shown in the code snippet, does not seem to have explicit handling for `SimpleLazyObject`.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**  \n   Ideally, `get_object_or_404` should transparently handle `SimpleLazyObject` instances, likely by ensuring they are evaluated (or coerced to their base types) before being used as filter parameters. This would prevent crashes and provide a seamless experience for developers.\n\n### Additional API Calls Needed\n\nGiven the analysis, the following additional API call would be necessary to complete the context:\n\n- **Search for `ContextMixin` class**: Since we couldn't find `get_context_data` within `TemplateView`, and assuming its behavior is related to how context data is managed (possibly by `ContextMixin`), we should investigate this mixin.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"ContextMixin\")\n```\n\nThis additional context would help in understanding how `kwargs` are passed into the context by `TemplateView` or its mixins, and how we might adjust this behavior to avoid the issue described."

However, based on the issue description and the understanding that `TemplateView` does automatically push `kwargs` into the context, leading to problems, the **intended behavior** should ensure that any `kwargs` passed into the context are checked for being `SimpleLazyObject` and are properly evaluated or converted to a simpler datatype (like string) before being used. Furthermore, this code should either not automatically pass `self.kwargs` into the context to maintain consistency with other views or provide developers with a clear way (documentation or parameters) to control this behavior.\n\n- **Location 2:**  \n  **File:** `django/shortcuts.py`  \n  **Function:** `get_object_or_404`  \n  The issue points to `get_object_or_404` not handling `SimpleLazyObject` properly when used with `slug=str(offer_slug)`. The **intended behavior** here is more about ensuring that external callers of `get_object_or_404` are aware that passing a `SimpleLazyObject` directly could lead to issues. While not directly a bug within `get_object_or_404`, enhancing error handling or documentation to guide developers on the need to evaluate or coerce `SimpleLazyObjects` before passing them as parameters would help prevent similar issues. This could involve either adding a check within `get_object_or_404` to identify `SimpleLazyObject` and attempt to resolve it before executing the query or enhancing the documentation to warn about this scenario."
