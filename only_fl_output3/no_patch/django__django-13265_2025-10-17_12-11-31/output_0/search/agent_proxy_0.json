Search for the `LookImage` model to understand its current implementation including the `Meta` class where `order_with_respect_to` and `indexes` are specified.\n```python\nsearch_class(\"LookImage\")\n```\n\n2. Investigate how the `_order` field is handled or generated within the `LookImage` class, given it's implicated in the reported issue but not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet.\n```python\nsearch_code(\"AlterOrderWithRespectTo\")\n```\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how the model and its related migration are structured, giving insight into where and how the `_order` field manipulation can be corrected to avoid the reported crash."
