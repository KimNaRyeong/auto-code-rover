        "intended_behavior": "The `julia_code` function should ensure that there are spaces around binary operators to prevent Julia's parser from mistaking literal floats and broadcast operators. This includes making spaces around all binary operators by default and potentially including spaces around the exponentiation operator (`^`) based on best practices. The goal is to create syntactically correct Julia code that avoids syntax errors and complies with Julia's syntax rules and community coding styles."
