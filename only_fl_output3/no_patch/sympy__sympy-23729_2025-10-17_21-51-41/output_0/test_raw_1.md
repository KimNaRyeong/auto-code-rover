Below is a standalone Python file `reproducer.py` that you can use to reproduce the issue discussed. This script will check if the generated Julia code from the `sympy.printing.julia.julia_code` function is correctly spaced to avoid syntax error in Julia. If the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace. If the issue is fixed, it will exit with code 0.

```python
import sys
from sympy import symbols
from sympy.printing.julia import julia_code

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_julia_code_generation():
    x, y, A = symbols('x y A')
    generated_code = julia_code(x**2*y*A**3)
    # The corrected code format with proper spacing
    expected_code = "(x .^ 2 .* y) * A ^ 3"
    try:
        assert generated_code == expected_code, "Generated Julia code does not have the expected format."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with an error code to indicate the issue is present
    print("Issue is fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Issue is fixed

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_julia_code_generation()
```

Remember to have `sympy` installed in your environment to run this script, as it imports symbols and the `julia_code` function from `sympy`. You can install `sympy` using pip:

```
pip install sympy
```

Execute this script with Python 3 by running `python3 reproducer.py` in your terminal or command line.
