Below is an example `reproducer.py` file that implements the testing for the described issue. This script checks if `sympy`'s `julia_code` function generates Julia code that would result in a syntax error due to the absence of spaces around the binary operators. When the issue is present, the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace. When the issue is fixed, it will exit with code 0.

```python
import sys
from sympy import symbols
from sympy.printing.julia import julia_code

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_julia_code_spaces():
    x, y, A = symbols('x y A')
    try:
        generated_code = julia_code(x**2*y*A**3)
        # Test for the correct spacing around operators.
        # This is what we expect to succeed when the issue is fixed.
        assert generated_code == "(x .^ 2 .* y) * A ^ 3", "Generated Julia code does not match the expected output."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error status if the test fails
    
    # If the test passes, exit cleanly.
    print("No issues detected.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_julia_code_spaces()
```

This reproducer script tests specifically for spaces around the binary operators in the generated Julia code from a simple SymPy expression. Remember to install SymPy before running this script by using pip:

```bash
pip install sympy
```

If the `sympy.printing.julia.julia_code` function has been updated to generate code with the appropriate spacing, the script will confirm that the issue is resolved. Otherwise, it will indicate where the failure occurred via the provided stack trace function.
