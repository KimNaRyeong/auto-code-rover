        "intended_behavior": "To correct the issue, the `classify_diop` function must include an additional validation step to ensure all even powers in an equation are of the same degree before classifying it as `general_sum_of_even_powers`. This involves iterating over the coefficients dict extracted from the equation, specifically examining the keys (which represent the equation terms) to check not only if they are even powers but also if these powers are uniform across all terms (except the constant term). If this uniformity is not present, the equation should not be classified under `general_sum_of_even_powers`. This new check preserves the existing functionality by accurately categorizing equations that genuinely fit the criteria of general sums of even powers, improving the overall accuracy of classification and subsequently ensuring that the correct solving strategies are applied in `diophantine`."
