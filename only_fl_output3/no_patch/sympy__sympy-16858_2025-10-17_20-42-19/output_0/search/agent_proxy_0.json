Since the issue description doesn't specify which distributions or methods are updated, we will perform a general search to gather some common distributions and methods within `sympy.stats` to get an idea of where these enhancements might be relevant. \n\n1. We can start by looking for classes that represent distributions in sympy.stats. These are typically named after the distributions they model, such as `Normal`, `Binomial`, `Poisson`, etc.\n2. Next, we'll look into common methods across these distribution classes that might be related to handling parameters and attributes, such as an initialization method or parameter validation methods.\n\nHere are the API calls we will use for this purpose:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class(\"Normal\")\nsearch_class(\"Binomial\")\nsearch_class(\"Poisson\")\nsearch_method(\"check\")\n```\n\nThese calls will help us identify specific classes and methods where missing checks and attributes could have been added, providing a starting point for further investigation and patch development."
