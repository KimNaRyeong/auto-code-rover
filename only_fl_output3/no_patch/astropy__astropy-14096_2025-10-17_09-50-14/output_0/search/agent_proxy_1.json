Currently, it raises an `AttributeError` indicating the custom property itself does not exist, instead of the actual attribute the property tried to access. The intended behavior is to preserve all existing functionality while improving error messaging for better debugging and user experience.\n\nTo resolve the issue while maintaining the integrity of existing functionalities:\n- Introduce additional logic within `__getattr__` to distinguish between genuine attribute misses and those caused by deeper attribute access chains, specifically, in cases where an attribute is accessed through a property or a method.\n- In cases where the non-existent attribute access originates from a custom property or method within a subclass of `SkyCoord`, the error message should accurately reflect the actual missing attribute (`random_attr` in the issue) rather than misleadingly point to the intermediary property or method (`prop`).\n- This could involve inspecting the call stack to determine the context of the `__getattr__` call. If it's determined that the call is part of resolving a chain of attribute accesses that started in a user-defined property or method, adjust the `AttributeError` message to pinpoint the original non-existent attribute accurately.\n- Ensure that this additional logic does not affect the performance or functionality of `SkyCoord` instances in typical use cases, including when they are not being subclassed or extended with custom properties or methods."
