        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insights into how the `SkyCoord` class in Astropy handles attribute access, which is directly related to the issue described. Let's examine each part:\n\n### `SkyCoord` Class Overview\n\nThe `SkyCoord` class is a complex object designed to represent coordinates in different astronomical frames. It includes a variety of methods and properties that allow for operations such as transformation between frames, comparison operations, and spatial calculations. The class utilizes the `ShapedLikeNDArray` mixin for array-like behaviors, suggesting it is designed to work with vectorized operations.\n\n### `__getattr__` Method\n\nThe `__getattr__` method is a crucial piece in understanding the bug. This method is called as a fallback when an attribute that doesn't directly exist on an instance is accessed. Here's a breakdown of its functionality in relation to the issue:\n\n- **Coordinate Transformation Capabilities**: It tries to interpret the accessed attribute as a request for transforming the `SkyCoord` object into another frame.\n- **Frame Attribute Handling**: Attributes associated with the frame of the `SkyCoord` object, including custom attributes specific to certain frames, are dynamically fetched. This includes both directly associated frame attributes and those inferred from the frame transformation graph.\n- **Fallback Error Message**: If none of the above conditions are met (i.e., the attribute cannot be resolved as a frame transformation request or a known frame attribute), it raises an `AttributeError` that indicates the accessed attribute doesn't exist on the `custom_coord` object.\n\n### Relation to the Issue\n\nThe misleading error message arises from the `__getattr__` method's behavior. When accessing a non-existent attribute (in this case `random_attr` accessed through `prop`), Python's default mechanism would directly raise an `AttributeError` for `random_attr`. However, because `SkyCoord` (and by inheritance `custom_coord`) has a custom `__getattr__`, this process is intercepted. \n\n1. When `prop` (a custom property defined in the subclass) tries to access `random_attr`, `__getattr__` is called since `random_attr` doesn't exist on the object.\n2. The `__getattr__` method, following its logic, fails to find `random_attr` as a frame attribute, frame transformation capability, or an attribute of `_sky_coord_frame`.\n3. Upon failure, it raises an `AttributeError` that incorrectly points to `prop` as the non-existent attribute, rather than `random_attr`, due to how the error message is constructed.\n\n### Intended Behavior\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior would be for the error message to accurately reflect that `random_attr` is the attribute that doesn't exist, not misleadingly point to `prop` as the missing attribute. This discrepancy arises because the custom `__getattr__` implementation intercepts the attribute access and raises an `AttributeError` before it can cascade to the original, non-existent attribute `random_attr`.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nTo address the issue, a potential approach could involve modifying the error handling within the `__getattr__` method to more accurately reflect the original source of the error. This might include additional checks to differentiate between attempts to access genuinely missing properties and the internal mechanism's failure to resolve attributes meant for frame transformations or frame properties.\n\nGiven this analysis, further detailing or exploring the `frame_transform_graph` operations or how frame attributes are managed might provide deeper insights into creating a precise and informative error message for cases similar to the described issue."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

Currently, it raises an `AttributeError` indicating the custom property itself does not exist, instead of the actual attribute the property tried to access. The intended behavior is to preserve all existing functionality while improving error messaging for better debugging and user experience.\n\nTo resolve the issue while maintaining the integrity of existing functionalities:\n- Introduce additional logic within `__getattr__` to distinguish between genuine attribute misses and those caused by deeper attribute access chains, specifically, in cases where an attribute is accessed through a property or a method.\n- In cases where the non-existent attribute access originates from a custom property or method within a subclass of `SkyCoord`, the error message should accurately reflect the actual missing attribute (`random_attr` in the issue) rather than misleadingly point to the intermediary property or method (`prop`).\n- This could involve inspecting the call stack to determine the context of the `__getattr__` call. If it's determined that the call is part of resolving a chain of attribute accesses that started in a user-defined property or method, adjust the `AttributeError` message to pinpoint the original non-existent attribute accurately.\n- Ensure that this additional logic does not affect the performance or functionality of `SkyCoord` instances in typical use cases, including when they are not being subclassed or extended with custom properties or methods."
