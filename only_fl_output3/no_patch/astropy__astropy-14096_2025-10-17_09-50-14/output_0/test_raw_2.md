Based on the requirements you've provided, here is a standalone `reproducer.py` Python file designed to trigger the described behavior and handle the situation accordingly. It will raise an `AssertionError` if the bug is present (indicating misleading attribute access message) and will also make use of the provided `print_stacktrace` function for clear error reporting. The script is expected to exit with code 0 once the issue has been resolved, i.e., when it correctly identifies the absence of `random_attr` rather than misidentifying the absence of `prop` as the issue.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    import astropy.coordinates as coord
    
    class CustomCoord(coord.SkyCoord):
        @property
        def prop(self):
            return self.random_attr
    
    c = CustomCoord('00h42m30s', '+41d12m00s', frame='icrs')
    # Attempt to access the custom property, which should lead to an AttributeError
    # regarding `random_attr` instead of `prop`
    c.prop
    
except AttributeError as e:
    # Check the error message to determine which attribute it claims is missing
    if "no attribute 'random_attr'" in str(e):
        print("The issue appears to be fixed. AttributeError correctly identifies missing 'random_attr'.")
        sys.exit(0)
    elif "no attribute 'prop'" in str(e):
        print("The original issue is present. The misleading attribute access message is shown.", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
    else:
        print("An unexpected AttributeError message was encountered:", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected exception was caught:", file=sys.stderr)
    print_stacktrace(e)
```

This script assumes the presence of a bug within the Astropy `SkyCoord` class or its handling of attributes in subclasses, specifically when accessing a non-existent attribute. The script checks for the precise nature of the `AttributeError` raised to determine whether the bug is active based on the erroneous message about the `prop` attribute, or correctly raises the issue about `random_attr`, indicating a fix or correct operation.

For this script to successfully verify the issue and its resolution, ensure:
- You are working within an environment where Astropy is installed.
- There are no interfering local modifications within the Astropy package or its dependencies.

Execute this script at the root of your project or an appropriate working directory with access to the necessary Python environment.
