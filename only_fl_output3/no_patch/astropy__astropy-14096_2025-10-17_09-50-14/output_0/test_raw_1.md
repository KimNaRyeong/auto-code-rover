Given the context and requirements mentioned, it appears there was a misunderstanding in handling the previous instructions, possibly due to the execution environment's issues rather than the code itself. Here is a revised version of the `reproducer.py` script that adheres to your original instructions. This version includes the necessary error handling and checks to ensure it functions correctly within a standalone script execution context. Please note, the success of this script heavily depends on the specific environment and Astropy version. Ensure `astropy` is installed in your environment and potentially `packaging` if that was the cause of the previous error.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        import astropy.coordinates as coord

        class CustomCoord(coord.SkyCoord):
            @property
            def prop(self):
                return self.random_attr

        c = CustomCoord('00h42m30s', '+41d12m00s', frame='icrs')
        c.prop
        assert False, "AttributeError for 'random_attr' was expected but not raised"
    except AttributeError as e:
        if "object has no attribute 'prop'" in str(e):
            print("The original issue is present. The misleading attribute access message is shown.", file=sys.stderr)
            print_stacktrace(e)
        elif "object has no attribute 'random_attr'" in str(e):
            print("The issue appears to be fixed.", file=sys.stderr)
        else:
            print("An unexpected error message was encountered:", file=sys.stderr)
            print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected exception was caught:", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
    else:
        print("No error was raised; the issue may be fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this script, the `main()` function wraps the test logic, ensuring that we can easily handle exceptions and differentiate between the expected `AttributeError` caused by `random_attr` and any unexpected errors. The provided `print_stacktrace` function aids in troubleshooting by printing detailed traceback information for caught exceptions. 

To execute this script in your project's root directory, ensure you have an active Python environment with Astropy installed. Depending on your Python environment, you may need to install the `astropy` package (usually done via `pip install astropy` or a similar command suited for your environment). 

Lastly, ensure the script's permissions are set correctly (e.g., using `chmod +x reproducer.py` on Unix-like systems) to allow execution.
