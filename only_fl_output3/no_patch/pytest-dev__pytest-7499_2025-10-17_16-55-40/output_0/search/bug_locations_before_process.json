        "intended_behavior": "The code at this location should be enhanced to provide clearer feedback when a match fails due to the presence of special characters in the strings being compared. Specifically, when match is not None and contains characters that have special meaning in regular expressions, such as parentheses, the error message should: 1. Inform the user that the string being matched is treated as a regular expression. 2. Suggest that if the matching fails due to literal characters that have special meanings in regex (such as parentheses), the user should consider escaping those characters or using a raw string literal if they did not intend for a regex match. 3. This improvement should be made without altering the existing functionality for regular users who are correctly using the match parameter as intended (with properly escaped characters or regex patterns). This enhancement aims to make the debugging process more intuitive, particularly for cases where users may unintentionally include regex-special characters in their strings. Additionally, this should preserve the utility of using regular expressions in the match parameter for more advanced use cases."
