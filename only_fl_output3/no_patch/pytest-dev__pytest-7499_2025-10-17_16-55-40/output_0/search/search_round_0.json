        "content": "To get more context and potentially find the area in the codebase where we could improve the error message as described in the issue, let's perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. First, we need to understand how `pytest.raises` is handling the `match` argument, particularly in scenarios where the match string includes parentheses. This requires us to look into where `pytest.raises` is implemented or where its behavior concerning the `match` argument is defined.\n   \n2. Given the issue description highlights a problem with `pytest.raises` without providing a specific location in the pytest codebase, it's reasonable to search directly for the method or class that handles the `match` logic within `pytest.raises`. Since the user didn't specify a method or class name directly involved, we'll start by searching for code related to the `raises` method.\n   \n3. The minimal example provided uses `with pytest.raises`, indicating that the issue might reside in a context manager handling the `raises` functionality. This suggests we should be looking into the code that defines how exceptions are caught and how the matching is performed.\n\nBased on these insights, we suggest the following API call to grasp the relevant portions of the code:\n\n- `search_method(\"raises\")`: To locate the implementation or handling of the `raises` method/functionality within the pytest codebase. This can help us understand how exception matching is currently implemented and potentially identify where the logic for improving error messages can be introduced."
