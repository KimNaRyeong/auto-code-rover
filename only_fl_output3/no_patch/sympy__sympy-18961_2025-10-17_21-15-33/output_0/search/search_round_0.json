        "content": "For resolving this issue, we need to gather more context about the `digits` method and how it's currently implemented in the codebase, specifically within the `digits.py` file located in the SymPy library. To address this, let's perform the following API calls:\n\n1. **Search the `digits` method in the specified file** to get a broader view of its current implementation and its surrounding context, as the issue suggests modifying its signature and behavior. This can help understand any additional considerations or dependencies within its implementation.\n\nAPI call:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"digits\", \"sympy/ntheory/digits.py\")`\n\n2. **Get the code around the modification point** to understand the existing logic and how the new argument `bits` is intended to integrate with it. The diff provided suggests additions at or around line numbers after the definition of `y.reverse()`, so retrieving code around this area could be beneficial for understanding the necessary context for the patch.\n\nAPI call (Assuming the modification is around existing line numbers based on the diff, we will aim for a line after `y.reverse()` and provide a window size to capture a broad context. The line number is an approximation based on the diff provided):\n- `get_code_around_line(\"sympy/ntheory/digits.py\", 40, 10)`\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive overview of the method's current state and the immediate code context needed for introducing the `bits` argument effectively."
