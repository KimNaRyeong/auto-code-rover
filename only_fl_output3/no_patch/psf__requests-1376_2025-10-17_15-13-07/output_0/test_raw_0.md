This script specifically addresses the issue described in the given `test_unicode_multipart_post_fieldnames` test case. 

1. It creates a POST request which includes both form data (with a key encoded as UTF-8 bytes) and a file.
2. It prepares the request and inspects the prepared body for the presence and absence of specific encoded field names.
3. In case the assertions fail (i.e., the issue is present), it catches the `AssertionError`, prints a detailed stack trace (including the line numbers and code context), and then re-raises the error.
4. Note that it's assumed the HTTP service endpoint `httpbin('post')` replicates the behavior of the httpbin.org service for testing HTTP requests.

You'll need the `requests` library installed to run this script. You can install it via pip if necessary:
```shell
pip install requests
```
