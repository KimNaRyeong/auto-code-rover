The behavior should explicitly account for Unicode characters in field names, preventing erroneous encoding such as wrapping field names in Python's byte-string notation (`b'...'`). The method should accurately encode these field names while preserving the integrity of the data payload. The existing functionality for handling different types of payloads (like form data, files, JSON) should remain unaffected, ensuring only the handling of Unicode names in multipart form data is corrected."

This method must specifically ensure that field names passed through it, which are Unicode, are correctly and efficiently encoded into the multipart body without misrepresenting the field names (e.g., avoiding embedding Python's byte-string notation). This method should correctly handle and maintain encodings for both files and field names, ensuring they are compliant with HTTP standards for multipart/form-data encoding."
