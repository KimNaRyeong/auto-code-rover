        "intended_behavior": "Upon calling `cla()`, the method should not only clear the axes of all artists but also explicitly unset the `.axes` reference for each artist being cleared. This ensures that any direct or indirect reference of the artist to the axes object is removed, mirroring the behavior observed when an individual artist's `remove()` method is called. To preserve existing functionality, the method must continue to perform all its current tasks (clearing the axes, labels, and other properties), with the added step of unsetting the `.axes` attribute for all artists affected by the `cla()` call."
