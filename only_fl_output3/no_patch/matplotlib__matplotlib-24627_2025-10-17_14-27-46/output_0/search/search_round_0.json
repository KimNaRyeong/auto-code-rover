        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to the `.axes` and `.figure` attributes not being unset upon cla() or clf(), let's perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. To understand where the `cla()` method might be affecting the artists' `.axes` attribute:\n   - `search_method(\"cla\")`\n\n2. Similarly, understanding the behavior of artist removal which successfully unsets the `.axes` attribute could provide clues on how to replicate this for `cla()`:\n   - `search_method(\"remove\")`\n\n3. Given the context of the issue, it's likely that changes will need to be made within classes related to plotting. Start by searching for the `Axes` class, as the example code suggests this is where `cla()` could be located:\n   - `search_class(\"Axes\")`\n\n4. The issue mentions the `.figure` attribute as well, so let's also get context about where and how it's managed by searching for the `Figure` class:\n   - `search_class(\"Figure\")`\n\n5. It might be helpful to find where the `plot` method is defined since it's involved in adding an artist, which later fails to have its `.axes` unset after `cla()`:\n   - `search_method(\"plot\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point to understand where and how the issue can be addressed within the codebase."
