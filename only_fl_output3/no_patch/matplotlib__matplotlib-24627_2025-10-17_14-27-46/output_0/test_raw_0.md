This script includes two functions that each test one aspect of the reported issue: the behavior after an artist is directly removed, and the behavior after the axes are cleared with `cla()`. Based on the provided instruction, the script uses assertions to ensure that the artist's `.axes` attribute is correctly set to `None` in both cases. If an `AssertionError` is raised, it indicates the issue is present, and a stack trace is printed for debugging purposes. If no error is raised, it's assumed the issue has been fixed, and the script exits normally with a status code of 0.
