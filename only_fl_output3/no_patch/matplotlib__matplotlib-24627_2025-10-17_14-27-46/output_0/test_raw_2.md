Understood. Since the previous implementation did not reproduce the issue as expected, let's attempt a different approach by focusing specifically on the steps provided and ensuring that the test script directly captures the essence of the issue. 

Given the feedback, we'll adjust the script to explicitly check the conditions tied to the issue, ensuring an `AssertionError` is raised when the artist's `.axes` attribute is incorrectly set post `cla()` invocation. This revised script reflects those conditions, incorporating the provided stack trace function for detailed error reporting.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Create plot and add a line
        f, a = plt.subplots()
        l, = a.plot([1, 2])
        
        # Test removing the line directly
        l.remove()
        assert l.axes is None, "Removing the artist should unset its '.axes' attribute."

        # Recreate plot and add a line again for the second part of the test
        f, a = plt.subplots()
        l, = a.plot([1, 2])
        
        # Test clearing the axes with cla()
        a.cla()  # Clears the axes
        assert l.axes is None, "Calling 'cla()' should unset the '.axes' attribute of deparented artists."
        
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with 1 if the issue is reproduced

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    # If no exceptions are raised, then the issue is assumed to be fixed
    print("The issue has been fixed.")
    exit(0)
```

This script ensures the testing of both scenarios described in the issue: directly removing an artist and clearing the axes with `cla()`. The AssertionError is specifically raised if those actions do not lead to the `.axes` attribute being unset. If the script exits with code 0, it will have passed the test indicating that the issue was not reproduced, hence recognizing that the problem was fixed or not present.
