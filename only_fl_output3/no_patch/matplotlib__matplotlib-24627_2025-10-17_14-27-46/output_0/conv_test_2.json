If the issue is present, an `AssertionError` will be raised, and a stack trace detailing the failure is printed. If the test passes, it prints \"The issue has been fixed.\" and exits with code 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that the script behaves as requested: raising an `AssertionError` and printing a detailed stack trace if the issue is present, and indicating the issue has been fixed otherwise."
