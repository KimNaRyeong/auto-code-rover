Given your request for an accurate reproduction of the issue, let's adjust the previous script to correctly raise an `AssertionError` exactly when the issue described occurs (i.e., when the `.axes` attribute of the deparented artist does not get unset after clearing the axes using `cla()`). 

Here's the revised `reproducer.py` script:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_artist_deparenting_by_clearing():
    """
    Tests if the `.axes` attribute is unset (`None`) after the axes are cleared.
    This is to reproduce the issue where clearing the axes does not unset the `.axes` 
    attribute of deparented artists.
    """
    f, a = plt.subplots()
    l, = a.plot([1, 2])
    a.cla()  # Clear the axes
    try:
        assert l.axes is None, "The artist's `.axes` attribute should be `None` after the axes are cleared."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate failure due to presence of issue.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_artist_deparenting_by_clearing()
    # Exiting with code 0 here means the assertion passed, indicating the issue has been fixed.
    print("The issue has been fixed.")
    exit(0)
```

This script focuses on the reproduction of the specific issue where after clearing an axes via `a.cla()`, the `.axes` attribute of the artist is expected to be `None` to reflect that it is no longer associated with an axes. If the issue is present, an `AssertionError` will be raised, and a stack trace detailing the failure is printed. If the test passes, it prints "The issue has been fixed." and exits with code 0.

This approach ensures that the script behaves as requested: raising an `AssertionError` and printing a detailed stack trace if the issue is present, and indicating the issue has been fixed otherwise.
