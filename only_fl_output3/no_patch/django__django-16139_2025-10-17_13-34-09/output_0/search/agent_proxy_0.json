As described in the issue, this method manipulates the `password` field's `help_text` to format the link to the password reset form, which causes a 404 error due to incorrect path formatting.\n\nFirst, we should find where the `UserChangeForm` class is defined to understand its structure and any inheritance it might have which could affect how the `password` field's `help_text` is being set.\n\nSecond, locating the `__init__` method implementation within `UserChangeForm` is crucial for pinpointing where the incorrect path formatting occurs and thus will be the target for the adjustment suggested in the issue description.\n\nGiven the requirements, our API calls would be:\n\n1. `search_class(\"UserChangeForm\")`: This will help us locate which file(s) the `UserChangeForm` class is defined in.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"UserChangeForm\")`: This will help us find the `__init__` method within the `UserChangeForm` class to see how it's implemented and where the faulty `help_text` formatting occurs.\n\nThese calls should provide enough context to understand how the `UserChangeForm` class is structured and where we need to apply the fix as suggested in the issue description."
