        "intended_behavior": "The `__init__` method's handling of the `password` field's `help_text` should be modified to dynamically construct the URL path to the password reset form based on the current user instance's primary key. This requires changing the static path \"../password/\" to a dynamic path that is correctly formed based on the actual user instance being edited, ensuring the link remains functional regardless of the field used to access the `UserChangeForm`. Specifically, the line:\n```python\npassword.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")\n```\nshould be replaced with:\n```python\npassword.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")\n```\nThis change ensures that the help text for the password field dynamically adjusts the link to include the appropriate user's primary key, making it robust against different methods of accessing the user edit form (e.g., via a UUID or other unique fields). It preserves the existing functionality for scenarios where the form is accessed in the conventional manner (using the primary key directly in the URL), while simultaneously addressing the issue for cases where an alternative unique identifier is employed."
