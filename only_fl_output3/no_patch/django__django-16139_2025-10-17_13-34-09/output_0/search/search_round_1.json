        "content": "<issue>Accessing UserAdmin via to_field leads to link to PasswordResetForm being broken (404)\nDescription\n(last modified by Simon Kern)\nAccessing the UserAdmin via another model's Admin that has a reference to User (with to_field set, e.g., to_field=\"uuid\") leads to the UserAdmin being accessed via an url that looks similar to this one:\n.../user/22222222-3333-4444-5555-666677778888/change/?_to_field=uuid\nHowever the underlying form looks like this:\nCode highlighting:\nclass UserChangeForm(forms.ModelForm):\npassword = ReadOnlyPasswordHashField(\nlabel=_(\"Password\"),\nhelp_text=_(\n\"Raw passwords are not stored, so there is no way to see this \"\n\"user\u2019s password, but you can change the password using \"\n'<a href=\"{}\">this form</a>.'\n),\n)\n...\n...\ndef __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\nsuper().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\npassword = self.fields.get(\"password\")\nif password:\npassword.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")\n...\n...\nThis results in the link to the PasswordResetForm being wrong and thus ending up in a 404. If we drop the assumption that UserAdmin is always accessed via its pk, then we're good to go. It's as simple as replacing password.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\") with password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")\nI've opened a pull request on GitHub for this Ticket, please see:\n\u200bPR\n</issue>"

As described in the issue, this method manipulates the `password` field's `help_text` to format the link to the password reset form, which causes a 404 error due to incorrect path formatting.\n\nFirst, we should find where the `UserChangeForm` class is defined to understand its structure and any inheritance it might have which could affect how the `password` field's `help_text` is being set.\n\nSecond, locating the `__init__` method implementation within `UserChangeForm` is crucial for pinpointing where the incorrect path formatting occurs and thus will be the target for the adjustment suggested in the issue description.\n\nGiven the requirements, our API calls would be:\n\n1. `search_class(\"UserChangeForm\")`: This will help us locate which file(s) the `UserChangeForm` class is defined in.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"UserChangeForm\")`: This will help us find the `__init__` method within the `UserChangeForm` class to see how it's implemented and where the faulty `help_text` formatting occurs.\n\nThese calls should provide enough context to understand how the `UserChangeForm` class is structured and where we need to apply the fix as suggested in the issue description."

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe provided part of the code is from the `UserChangeForm` class, specifically within the `__init__` method, in the file `django/contrib/auth/forms.py`. This class is a Django `ModelForm` used in the admin interface for handling user data changes.\n\n- The `__init__` method customizes form initialization. It obtains the `password` field from the form fields if available.\n- If the `password` field is found, its `help_text` is reformatted with a relative path to the password reset form (`\"../password/\"`).\n- It also adjusts the queryset for the `user_permissions` field, optimizing it with `select_related` to reduce database queries.\n\n#### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\nThe issue centers around the handling of the `password` field's `help_text`. The current setup uses a static relative path to link to the password reset form. This works under the assumption that the `UserChangeForm` is always accessed relative to a URL path that includes the user's primary key (default behavior). However, when accessed via a different field (e.g., `uuid` mentioned in the issue), this assumption breaks, leading to a 404 error because the URL path format does not match the expected structure.\n\n#### Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\nThe intended behavior of this part of the code is to dynamically adjust the link to the password reset form based on the specific instance of the user being edited, ensuring the link remains functional regardless of which field (`pk` or another unique field like `uuid`) was used to access the `UserChangeForm`. The formation of the link should consider the actual access path, ensuring it correctly points to the password reset form for the specific user instance, avoiding hard-coded paths that assume a specific URL structure.\n\nTo address the bug, replacing the line:\n```python\npassword.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")\n```\nwith a more dynamic approach that utilizes the user's actual identifier in the URL, as suggested in the issue:\n```python\npassword.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")\n```\nThis alteration presumes the `self.instance.pk` will correctly reference the primary key of the user instance being edited, making the link functional regardless of the field used to navigate to the `UserChangeForm`.\n\nGiven this understanding, the next step in crafting a solution would be to carefully integrate this change into the `__init__` method, ensuring that it accounts for different potential access patterns (e.g., using `uuid` or other unique fields as entry points) and maintaining backward compatibility with the default access method (via primary key)."

Bug Location:\n   - File: django/contrib/auth/forms.py\n   - Class: UserChangeForm\n   - Method: __init__\n\nIntended Behavior:\nThe `__init__` method's handling of the `password` field's `help_text` should be modified to dynamically construct the URL path to the password reset form based on the current user instance's primary key. This requires changing the static path \"../password/\" to a dynamic path that is correctly formed based on the actual user instance being edited, ensuring the link remains functional regardless of the field used to access the `UserChangeForm`.\n\nSpecifically, the line:\n```python\npassword.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")\n```\nshould be replaced with:\n```python\npassword.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")\n```\nThis change ensures that the help text for the password field dynamically adjusts the link to include the appropriate user's primary key, making it robust against different methods of accessing the user edit form (e.g., via a UUID or other unique fields). It preserves the existing functionality for scenarios where the form is accessed in the conventional manner (using the primary key directly in the URL), while simultaneously addressing the issue for cases where an alternative unique identifier is employed."
