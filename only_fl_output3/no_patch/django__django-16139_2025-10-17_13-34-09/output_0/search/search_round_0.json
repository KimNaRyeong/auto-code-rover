        "content": "<issue>Accessing UserAdmin via to_field leads to link to PasswordResetForm being broken (404)\nDescription\n(last modified by Simon Kern)\nAccessing the UserAdmin via another model's Admin that has a reference to User (with to_field set, e.g., to_field=\"uuid\") leads to the UserAdmin being accessed via an url that looks similar to this one:\n.../user/22222222-3333-4444-5555-666677778888/change/?_to_field=uuid\nHowever the underlying form looks like this:\nCode highlighting:\nclass UserChangeForm(forms.ModelForm):\npassword = ReadOnlyPasswordHashField(\nlabel=_(\"Password\"),\nhelp_text=_(\n\"Raw passwords are not stored, so there is no way to see this \"\n\"user\u2019s password, but you can change the password using \"\n'<a href=\"{}\">this form</a>.'\n),\n)\n...\n...\ndef __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\nsuper().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\npassword = self.fields.get(\"password\")\nif password:\npassword.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\")\n...\n...\nThis results in the link to the PasswordResetForm being wrong and thus ending up in a 404. If we drop the assumption that UserAdmin is always accessed via its pk, then we're good to go. It's as simple as replacing password.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"../password/\") with password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")\nI've opened a pull request on GitHub for this Ticket, please see:\n\u200bPR\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the required context to address the mentioned issue, we need to locate the `UserChangeForm` class and specifically the `__init__` method where the faulty logic is present. As described in the issue, this method manipulates the `password` field's `help_text` to format the link to the password reset form, which causes a 404 error due to incorrect path formatting.\n\nFirst, we should find where the `UserChangeForm` class is defined to understand its structure and any inheritance it might have which could affect how the `password` field's `help_text` is being set.\n\nSecond, locating the `__init__` method implementation within `UserChangeForm` is crucial for pinpointing where the incorrect path formatting occurs and thus will be the target for the adjustment suggested in the issue description.\n\nGiven the requirements, our API calls would be:\n\n1. `search_class(\"UserChangeForm\")`: This will help us locate which file(s) the `UserChangeForm` class is defined in.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"UserChangeForm\")`: This will help us find the `__init__` method within the `UserChangeForm` class to see how it's implemented and where the faulty `help_text` formatting occurs.\n\nThese calls should provide enough context to understand how the `UserChangeForm` class is structured and where we need to apply the fix as suggested in the issue description."
