        "intended_behavior": "Enhance the parsing and formatting logic within this method to ensure: Union[X, Y, Z] is displayed as X | Y | Z. This may involve refining the logic around lines 183-188 and 214-233 to universally apply PEP 604 formatting for Union and, by extension, Optional types. Optional[X] is displayed as X | None. Ensure that the special handling for Optional types around the same lines correctly defaults to X | None when only a single type argument is present. For Literal types, strip the 'Literal' prefix and display the contained value(s) with appropriate syntax highlighting. This might require adjusting or extending the logic around lines 190-195 to more effectively identify Literal annotations and modify the display of their values accordingly. Ensure that these formatting rules are configurable through Sphinx configuration options. This might involve adding new configuration parameters or utilizing existing ones to control whether the PEP 604 and Literal value simplification behaviors are enabled."
