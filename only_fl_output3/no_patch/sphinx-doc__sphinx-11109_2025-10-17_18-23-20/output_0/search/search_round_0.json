Instead, it is much cleaner to display them using the PEP 604 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0604/) syntax:\n`Union[X, Y, Z]` -> `X | Y | Z`\n`Optional[X]` -> `X | None`\nAdditionally, for `Literal` it is cleaner to strip the text \"Literal\" and just display the literal value with normal Python syntax highlighting:\n`Literal[\"X\"]` -> `\"X\"`\nThis is implemented in the tensorstore documentation via an ast transformation:\nhttps://github.com/google/tensorstore/blob/1a59fcb310bc1feb13569f03f7134b4c3a5fa5f4/docs/tensorstore_sphinx_ext/autodoc.py#L259\nThis should be supported in Sphinx via a config option.  The other improvement, of using syntax highlighting for constants, should also be integrated.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context to resolve the issue regarding the formatting improvements of `Union`, `Optional`, `Literal`, and constants in Sphinx's Python domain, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n1. **Search for the Python domain class where annotations are parsed**: Since the issue mentions `sphinx.domains.python._parse_annotation`, it suggests that this method is crucial for the task at hand. However, the method might be part of a class handling the Python domain, possibly named related to `PythonDomain`. Therefore, we should locate this class.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"PythonDomain\")\n```\n\n2. **Search for the `_parse_annotation` method within the file containing Python domain logic**: Once we have the file where the `PythonDomain` (or similarly named) class is located, we will search for the `_parse_annotation` method within this file to understand how annotations are currently parsed.\n\nAssuming the `PythonDomain` class is found within `python.py` (this is a placeholder file name and will be replaced with the actual file name obtained from the previous step), the call would be:\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"_parse_annotation\", \"python.py\")\n```\n\n3. **Search for existing formatting logic**: To understand how Sphinx currently formats `Union`, `Optional`, and `Literal` annotations and constants, and to identify if any related configuration options exist, it's important to search for these within the codebase. As we don't have specific file paths yet, broad searches across the entire codebase can be initiated.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"Union\")\nsearch_code(\"Optional\")\nsearch_code(\"Literal\")\n```\n\nThese API calls will provide a foundational understanding of the current handling and formatting of type annotations within Sphinx, specifically addressing the items mentioned in the issue."
