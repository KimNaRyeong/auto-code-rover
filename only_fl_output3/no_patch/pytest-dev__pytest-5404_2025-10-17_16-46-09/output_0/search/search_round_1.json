        "content": "To begin analyzing this issue, we need to focus on the `KeyError: '__wrapped__'` described in the bug report. This error can occur during the unwrapping of functions or methods, which is often associated with decorators used in Python. Since the error was triggered when the user attempted to import a function (`from xxx import yyy`), and it's mentioned that commenting out the line `from sty import fg` does not produce the error, it might be useful to get more context around where and how `fg` is used within the project. Additionally, understanding any custom decorators or wrappers used in the project that might interact with the `inspect` module can be crucial.\n\nGiven this, the necessary APIs to call for more context could include:\n\n1. Searching for all instances where `fg` is imported from `sty` to understand its usage across the project.\n2. Searching for any custom decorators or wrapper functions that might be influencing this behavior, particularly those that might interact with Python's introspection capabilities or have a `__wrapped__` attribute.\n3. Exploring the use of `inspect.unwrap` or any similar constructs that would directly manipulate or interact with wrapped entities, especially in the context of the `_pytest/doctest.py` as pointed out in the stack trace.\n\nTo meet these objectives, the following search API calls can be made:\n\n- `search_code(\"from sty import fg\")`: To locate all occurrences of importing `fg` from `sty`.\n- `search_code(\"__wrapped__\")`: To identify usages of the `__wrapped__` attribute directly, which might be associated with the error.\n- `search_code(\"inspect.unwrap\")`: To find if there's an explicit call to `inspect.unwrap` within the project codebase, which could be leading to the issue when pytest and tox are being run.\n\nThese API calls should provide a foundational context to understand the nature of the `KeyError: '__wrapped__'` bug further and aid in its resolution."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context reveals pertinent insights into the behavior causing the `KeyError: '__wrapped__'` issue.\n\n### Analysis of the Context\n\n#### 1. Absence of `from sty import fg`\nThe fact that the search for `from sty import fg` yielded no results in the codebase implies that the issue isn't directly related to importing this specific library. However, the mention of `sty` by the issue submitter and its correlation with the error occurrence suggests that the problem might not be with the `sty` library per se but with how imported objects are handled or manipulated at runtime, especially in the context of the testing environment set up by `tox` and `pytest`.\n\n#### 2. Presence of `__wrapped__` in the Codebase\nThe discovery of `__wrapped__` snippets within `testing/python/integration.py` and `src/_pytest/compat.py` is of significant interest. In Python, `__wrapped__` is an attribute used primarily by decorators to refer to the original function that was wrapped. This indicates the project uses or interacts with decorators, which could contribute to the unwrapping process or introspection logic failing when pytest attempts to traverse through the object's attributes or functions.\n\n#### 3. Modifications of `inspect.unwrap` in Pytest\nThe snippets from `src/_pytest/doctest.py` showing the definition and manipulation of `inspect.unwrap` are directly relevant. These code snippets indicate a custom context manager `_patch_unwrap_mock_aware` designed to modify the behavior of `inspect.unwrap` to become aware of mock objects, preventing infinite recursion on them. This mechanism is a significant clue as it suggests pytest has a custom handling process for unwrapping objects, which could inadvertently introduce complications if an object doesn't behave as expected under this patched logic.\n\n### Connection to the Bug\nThe modifications to `inspect.unwrap` could be directly causing the `KeyError` if during the unwrapping process, pytest encounters an object that doesn't have the `__wrapped__` attribute it expects based on how the patch tries to handle mock objects or decorators. This custom logic could have unintended consequences when dealing with certain imports or modules, especially if these modules have objects decorated in ways not accounted for by pytest's patch.\n\n### Intended Behavior\nThe purpose of patching `inspect.unwrap` is to facilitate pytest's ability to introspect and handle mock objects gracefully during the testing phase, specifically within doctests. The intended behavior is to allow afterEach tests to run without modification of the core unwrapping logic used by Python, thus ensuring both mock objects and standard objects/decorators can be correctly introspected and used without errors.\n\nGiven this context, we need to delve deeper into how the patch for `inspect.unwrap` is implemented and potentially whether the object that caused `KeyError` was expected to have a `__wrapped__` attribute or if there's an edge case not covered by pytest's current logic. Further investigation into the implementation of decorators (custom or libraries) used in the project and how they might interact with pytest\u2019s patching could provide the necessary details to address this issue. \n\nTo advance the analysis, it would be useful to examine the implementation details within `testing/python/integration.py` and `src/_pytest/compat.py` regarding their use of `__wrapped__`. Also, inspecting objects or libraries that feature prominently in the failing tests could shed light on possible discrepancies in behavior when subjected to the patched `inspect.unwrap`.\n\nGiven these assumptions, the following API calls would be insightful:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"__wrapped__\", \"testing/python/integration.py\")`\n- `search_code_in_file(\"__wrapped__\", \"src/_pytest/compat.py\")`\n\nThese calls could provide specific implementations or use cases of `__wrapped__` attribute handling that might be contributing to the KeyError encountered during testing."

The function tries to handle unwrapping in a way that does not trip on mock objects, which Python\u2019s standard `inspect.unwrap` might not handle correctly, causing unexpected behavior or errors. To resolve the issue, the intended behavior should include additional logic to gracefully handle cases where an object does not have the `__wrapped__` attribute, explicitly checking for the existence of this attribute before attempting to access or manipulate it. This addition ensures that the patch remains compatible with all objects, whether they are mocks, wrapped functions, or have other custom behaviors not originally anticipated. This would prevent the `KeyError: '__wrapped__'` observed when running under tox or pytest by ensuring the custom unwrap logic only applies to objects it was designed to handle, thus preserving the existing functionality while enhancing reliability.\n\nThis adjustment should maintain all existing functionality, aiming at broadening the compatibility of pytest's mock-aware implementation of `inspect.unwrap` with the diverse ecosystem of Python objects and decorators it might encounter during testing, particularly in scenarios involving decorated functions or methods that do not use the `__wrapped__` attribute convention."
