Based on your requirements, I'll provide a script named `reproducer.py` tailored to trigger the `KeyError: '__wrapped__'` using direct method calls and module imports that resemble the conditions under which the issue appears based on the provided traceback and scenario. In this context, the script will try to import a module (for simplicity, let's mimic the behavior with common Python functionalities that could trigger similar issues) and then manipulate attributes in a way that might lead to a `KeyError` if the same underlying problem is present.

Please note: Since the original issue seems intricately linked to the `pytest` and potentially the `sty` library during a test discovery phase, the exact reproduction outside this context might require specific setup or mimicry of the testing framework's actions. The script will aim to simulate a scenario that could logically raise a similar `KeyError`.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def simulate_test_discovery():
    """
    This function simulates the logic that might be occurring during pytest's test discovery
    or execution phase, which leads to the KeyError with '__wrapped__'.
    """
    # Let's consider the problematic `from sty import fg` is part of what gets imported
    # during this simulated "discovery"
    try:
        # Attempt import to simulate the condition under which the KeyError occurs
        from sty import fg
        print("Imported sty.fg without issue.")
        
        # Dummy wrapping to simulate what might be triggering the '__wrapped__' access error
        def dummy_wrapper(func):
            def wrapped_func(*args, **kwargs):
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
            wrapped_func.__wrapped__ = func
            return wrapped_func

        @dummy_wrapper
        def test_function():
            print("This function is a stand-in for test code.")
        
        # Attempt to access `__wrapped__` directly, simulating introspection utilities
        print(test_function.__wrapped__)

    except KeyError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("KeyError on '__wrapped__' attribute encountered.") from None
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Unexpected error encountered.") from None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        simulate_test_discovery()
        print("No issue was detected; the script executed successfully.")
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        exit(1)
    else:
        exit(0)
```

Ensure the testing environment is closely aligned with the scenario where the `KeyError: '__wrapped__'` was initially encountered. Adjustments might be needed depending on the specific libraries and versions involved in your project setup.
