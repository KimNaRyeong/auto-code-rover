        "intended_behavior": "The method should no longer accept a 'labels' parameter as input. The calculation that uses 'len(labels)' to normalize the number of differences should be replaced by 'y_true.shape[1]'. This change assumes that for multilabel classification problems, 'y_true' will be a 2D array where the second dimension ('y_true.shape[1]') represents the number of labels. This adaptation maintains the functionality of computing the average Hamming loss across all labels without explicitly requiring the 'labels' array. The internal logic must ensure that this method continues to correctly calculate the fraction of labels that are incorrectly predicted, relying solely on the 'y_true' and 'y_pred' arrays for multilabel inputs. All references to the 'labels' parameter within this method need to be carefully removed or updated to ensure the method still functions as expected for both binary/multiclass and multilabel classification tasks. Attention should be paid to keeping or adapting any functionality that infers or utilizes the set of unique labels directly from 'y_true' and 'y_pred' when 'labels' is not provided, ensuring the method remains robust and flexible across different types of input data."
