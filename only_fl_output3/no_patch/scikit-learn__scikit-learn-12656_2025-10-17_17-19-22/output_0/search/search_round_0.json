        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand the location and implementation of the `hamming_loss` function within the codebase. The issue mentions the removal of a `labels` parameter and instances within the method, and a change from `len(labels)` to `y_true.shape[1]`. Let's retrieve the context necessary for crafting a patch by executing the following API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the `hamming_loss` function**: Since this is the central focus of the issue, locating this function will give us the starting point to understand the changes that are necessary.\n   \n2. **Search for code snippet using `labels` within `hamming_loss`**: To find instances of `labels` being used within the `hamming_loss` function, which the contributor mentions need to be removed.\n\n3. **Search for code snippet `y_true.shape[1]`**: Although this might be what they intend to add or replace `len(labels)` with, searching for it could provide insight into similar implementations or usage patterns within the codebase for validation.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"hamming_loss\")\nsearch_code(\"labels\")\nsearch_code(\"y_true.shape[1]\")\n``` \n\nThese queries aim to provide a comprehensive view of where and how the `hamming_loss` function is implemented and how the `labels` parameter and `y_true.shape[1]` are utilized in the context of the project."
