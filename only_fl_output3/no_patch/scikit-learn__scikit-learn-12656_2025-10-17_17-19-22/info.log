1800     Parameters

1803         Ground truth (correct) labels.
1804 
1805     y_pred : 1d array-like, or label indicator array / sparse matrix
1806         Predicted labels, as returned by a classifier.
1807 
1808     labels : array, shape = [n_labels], optional (default=None)
1809         Integer array of labels. If not provided, labels will be inferred
1810         from y_true and y_pred.

1817         .. versionadded:: 0.18
1818 
1819     Returns
1820     -------
1821     loss : float or int,
1822         Return the average Hamming loss between element of ``y_true`` and
1823         ``y_pred``.

1828 
1829     Notes
1830     -----
1831     In multiclass classification, the Hamming loss corresponds to the Hamming
1832     distance between ``y_true`` and ``y_pred`` which is equivalent to the
1833     subset ``zero_one_loss`` function.
1834 
1835     In multilabel classification, the Hamming loss is different from the
1836     subset zero-one loss. The zero-one loss considers the entire set of labels
1837     for a given sample incorrect if it does entirely match the true set of
1838     labels. Hamming loss is more forgiving in that it penalizes the individual
1839     labels.
1840 
1841     The Hamming loss is upperbounded by the subset zero-one loss. When
1842     normalized over samples, the Hamming loss is always between 0 and 1.
