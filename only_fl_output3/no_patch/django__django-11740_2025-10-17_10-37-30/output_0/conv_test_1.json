I am new in django community, so please help me, because i really dont know is it really \"bug\".\nI have a django project named \"testproject\" and two apps: testapp1, testapp2.\nIt will be simpler to understand, with this example:\n# TestApp1(models.py):\nclass App1(models.Model):\n\tid = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, unique=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False, verbose_name=_('identifier'))\n\ttext = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name=_('text'))\n\tanother_app = models.UUIDField(null=True, blank=True, verbose_name=_('another app'))\n# TestApp2(models.py):\nclass App2(models.Model):\n\tid = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, unique=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False, verbose_name=_('identifier'))\n\ttext = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name=_('text'))\nFirst model named \"App1\" has UUID field named \"another_app\":\n another_app = models.UUIDField(null=True, blank=True, verbose_name=_('another app'))\nAfter some time i change field from UUID to FK, like this: \nanother_app = models.ForeignKey(App2, null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, verbose_name=_('another app'))\nAnd as result i create new migration, but Migration class was unexpected result, because it does not create any \"dependencies\" for App2, because of FK.\nI think the correct solution will be create dependency for App2.\nThis project use django version 2.2 and postgresql. Attach archive with sources. Project contains small test, after running him, you will get exception like this: ValueError: Related model 'testapp2.App2' cannot be resolved.\nSo is it problem in django or maybe i dont understand something ?\nHere is my post in django users:\n\u200bhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/django-users/Django$20bug$3A$20change$20uuid$20field$20to$20FK$20does$20not$20create$20dependency%7Csort:date/django-users/-h9LZxFomLU/yz-NLi1cDgAJ\nRegards, Viktor Lomakin\n"

It does not actually change the model's `UUIDField` to a `ForeignKey` as this would require generating and running migrations, which is not practical within a standalone script without a surrounding Django project structure and without executing Django management commands. The `check_migration_dependencies` function is intended to simulate checking if the migration file includes the appropriate dependencies following a change \u2014 in reality, you would need to inspect the generated migration files or enhance this script to integrate more closely with Django's migration system for a complete reproduction of the issue."
