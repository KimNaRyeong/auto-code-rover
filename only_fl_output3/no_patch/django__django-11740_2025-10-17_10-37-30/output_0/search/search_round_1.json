I am new in django community, so please help me, because i really dont know is it really \"bug\".\nI have a django project named \"testproject\" and two apps: testapp1, testapp2.\nIt will be simpler to understand, with this example:\n# TestApp1(models.py):\nclass App1(models.Model):\nid = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, unique=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False, verbose_name=_('identifier'))\ntext = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name=_('text'))\nanother_app = models.UUIDField(null=True, blank=True, verbose_name=_('another app'))\n# TestApp2(models.py):\nclass App2(models.Model):\nid = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, unique=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False, verbose_name=_('identifier'))\ntext = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name=_('text'))\nFirst model named \"App1\" has UUID field named \"another_app\":\nanother_app = models.UUIDField(null=True, blank=True, verbose_name=_('another app'))\nAfter some time i change field from UUID to FK, like this:\nanother_app = models.ForeignKey(App2, null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, verbose_name=_('another app'))\nAnd as result i create new migration, but Migration class was unexpected result, because it does not create any \"dependencies\" for App2, because of FK.\nI think the correct solution will be create dependency for App2.\nThis project use django version 2.2 and postgresql. Attach archive with sources. Project contains small test, after running him, you will get exception like this: ValueError: Related model 'testapp2.App2' cannot be resolved.\nSo is it problem in django or maybe i dont understand something ?\nHere is my post in django users:\n\u200bhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/django-users/Django$20bug$3A$20change$20uuid$20field$20to$20FK$20does$20not$20create$20dependency%7Csort:date/django-users/-h9LZxFomLU/yz-NLi1cDgAJ\nRegards, Viktor Lomakin\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given the results from the API search, let's proceed with the analysis to better understand the context around the issue regarding changing a UUID field to a ForeignKey (FK) that does not create the expected dependency in Django migrations.\n\n### Analysis of Search Results\n\n#### Search for Classes App1 and App2\nThe search for classes `App1` and `App2` returned no results, indicating that these classes might not exist as standalone class definitions accessible through the search API's scope or they might be dynamically defined or modulated in a way that makes them not directly searchable with the provided class name. This might imply the need for a more targeted search, possibly within specific files (models.py in respective apps) or considering alternative class referencing methods in Django's model discovery process.\n\n#### Search for \"ForeignKey\" Usage in Codebase\nThe search for `ForeignKey` revealed multiple occurrences across various Django framework files, illustrating the widespread use of ForeignKey relationships within Django's ORM system. This widespread presence denotes the critical role ForeignKey plays in Django model relationships, including enforcing database-level constraints and modeling object-related fields in Python code.\n\n- The files most pertinent to our issue, like `django/db/migrations/state.py`, `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, and `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, deal with migration states, the automatic detection of changes for generating migrations, and the definition and behavior of related fields, respectively.\n- Understanding how ForeignKey is handled in these files can give insights into why the migration system might not automatically identify or correctly handle the change from a UUIDField to a ForeignKey in terms of dependencies.\n\n#### Search for \"dependencies\" in Codebase\nFound snippets contain references to dependencies in various migration and model-related contexts:\n\n- Especially in `django/db/migrations/loader.py`, `django/db/migrations/writer.py`, and `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, these files involve loading existing migrations, writing new migration files, and detecting changes in models to generate migrations, respectively.\n- The information in these files is crucial for understanding how Django tracks and manages dependencies between different sets of migrations and how it ensures that migrations are applied in a coherent and dependency-respecting sequence.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nGiven the information obtained:\n\n1. **Understanding Dependencies in Migrations**: It seems the issue might stem from the process within `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` where Django analyzes model changes to generate migration operations. The autodetector should ideally recognize the change from a UUIDField to a ForeignKey as not only a field type change but also as introducing a new model-level dependency that needs to be respected in migration dependencies.\n\n2. **ForeignKey Handling and Migration Generation**: The handling of ForeignKey fields, evident in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` and the migration-related files, is generally sophisticated, taking into account various nuances (such as related_name, on_delete behavior, etc.). The bug might relate to the specific scenario where an existing field changes its nature to a ForeignKey, requiring additional logic to identify and handle this case correctly.\n\nGiven the absence of results for `App1` and `App2` directly, further investigation might involve:\n- Direct inspection or targeted search within the migrations directory of both `testapp1` and `testapp2` to find the specific migration file(s) generated during the UUIDField to ForeignKey transition. This can be achieved by searching for filenames that suggest recent migrations or the use of `search_code_in_file` with model names and migration-related keywords within known migration files.\n\n- Closer examination of how migration dependencies are determined in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` and `django/db/migrations/dependencies.py` might reveal whether a particular logic or exception case is missing for handling changes of field types to ForeignKey relations effectively. \n\nBy understanding these mechanisms, the nature of the bug can be pinpointed, and a solution involving either adjusting the migration file manually (as a temporary fix) or proposing a change to Django's migration autodetection mechanism (for a permanent fix) can be considered."

Location 1: File: `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, Class: `MigrationAutodetector`, Method: `generate_altered_fields`\n- **Intended Behavior**: This method should include logic to detect changes in model fields from a non-relationship field (like `UUIDField`) to a relationship field (`ForeignKey`). Upon such detection, it should appropriately add a dependency for the involved models (in this case, `App1` depending on `App2`) in the migration file to ensure the database integrity and order of migrations respects the newly introduced relationship. The method must preserve its current functionality of handling other types of field alterations without disruption.\n\nLocation 2: File: `django/db/migrations/state.py`, Class: `ProjectState`, Method: `add_dependency`\n- **Intended Behavior**: If not existing, a method to properly add dependencies between migrations when changes are detected that introduce or alter relationships between models. This method should ensure that the generated migration for the model with the newly added `ForeignKey` (e.g., `App1`) includes a dependency entry on the related model's migration (`App2`). This addition would ensure coherent migration application, preventing issues like the `ValueError` related to unresolved model references during migration operations. This new or updated method must integrate seamlessly with the existing migration state management mechanisms, ensuring all other dependencies and migration operations remain unaffected except for the additional logic to handle this specific kind of dependency introduction."
