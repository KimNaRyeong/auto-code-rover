Upon such detection, it should appropriately add a dependency for the involved models (in this case, `App1` depending on `App2`) in the migration file to ensure the database integrity and order of migrations respects the newly introduced relationship.

This method should ensure that the generated migration for the model with the newly added `ForeignKey` (e.g., `App1`) includes a dependency entry on the related model's migration (`App2`). This addition would ensure coherent migration application, preventing issues like the `ValueError` related to unresolved model references during migration operations.
