Upon such detection, it should appropriately add a dependency for the involved models (in this case, `App1` depending on `App2`) in the migration file to ensure the database integrity and order of migrations respects the newly introduced relationship. The method must preserve its current functionality of handling other types of field alterations without disruption."

        "intended_behavior": "If not existing, a method to properly add dependencies between migrations when changes are detected that introduce or alter relationships between models. This method should ensure that the generated migration for the model with the newly added `ForeignKey` (e.g., `App1`) includes a dependency entry on the related model's migration (`App2`). This addition would ensure coherent migration application, preventing issues like the `ValueError` related to unresolved model references during migration operations. This new or updated method must integrate seamlessly with the existing migration state management mechanisms, ensuring all other dependencies and migration operations remain unaffected except for the additional logic to handle this specific kind of dependency introduction."
