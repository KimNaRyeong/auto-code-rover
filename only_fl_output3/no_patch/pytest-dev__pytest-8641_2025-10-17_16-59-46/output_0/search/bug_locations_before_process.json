        "intended_behavior": "The regex pattern should be enhanced to accurately identify and match `levelname` fields in the log format string, even if they include precision specifiers. This improvement would allow users to customize their log format strings with precision without losing the functionality of colorized output. The updated regex pattern should be thoroughly tested with a variety of format string examples to ensure compatibility and maintain the existing functionality of the code."
