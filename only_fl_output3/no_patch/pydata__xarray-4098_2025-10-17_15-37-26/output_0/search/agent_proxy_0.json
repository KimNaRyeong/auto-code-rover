Then, based on the location of the `groupby` method (e.g., which class it belongs to or which file it is defined in), we can search for related code snippets to understand how it is implemented and how it currently handles the `name` parameter. Here are the API calls we will execute:\n\n1. `search_method(\"groupby\")` - This will help us locate all occurrences of the `groupby` method throughout the project.\n2. `search_code(\"def groupby\")` - Additionally, this call will help identify the definition of the `groupby` function if it's not picked up as a method in the first call. This is helpful in case `groupby` is not part of a class but defined in a module."
