Certainly! Below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue as described. When you run this script in the root directory of the project with `python3 reproducer.py`, it attempts to handle your described functionality. The script will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, showcasing the absence of the problematic variable's name in the error message. It also contains the `print_stacktrace` function to clearly show the stack trace when an error occurs.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    import xarray as xr

    # Define time attributes according to the issue description
    TIME_ATTRS = {"units": "days since 0001-01-01", "calendar": "noleap"}
    
    # Create valid and invalid DataArrays
    valid_times = xr.DataArray([0, 1], dims=["time"], attrs=TIME_ATTRS, name="valid_times")
    invalid_times = xr.DataArray([1e36, 2e36], dims=["time"], attrs=TIME_ATTRS, name="invalid_times")
    
    # Merge them into a single Dataset
    ds = xr.merge([valid_times, invalid_times])
    
    try:
        # Try decoding the Dataset
        xr.decode_cf(ds)
        # If no error is raised, the issue might have been fixed, no AssertionError needed
        print("The issue appears to be fixed. Exiting with code 0.")
    except ValueError as e:
        # Check if the error message lacks the problematic variable's name, indicating the issue is present
        assert "invalid_times" not in str(e), "The error message correctly identifies the problematic variable."
        print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with an error code if the assertion fails
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with an error code if an unexpected error occurs

    exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating the script did not detect the issue (or it's fixed)
```

This script follows your instructions by trying to decode a dataset with both valid and invalid times, expecting the error message to not include the problematic variable's name (`"invalid_times"`) if the issue is present. When the error occurs, it uses the `print_stacktrace` function to provide a clear and informative stack trace.
