However, this error message will not indicate the problematic variable's name.  It would be nice if it did, because it would make it easier for users to determine the source of the error.\ncc: @durack1\nxref: Unidata/cftime#295\n### Example\nThis is a minimal example of the issue.  The error message gives no indication that `\"invalid_times\"` is the problem:\n```\n>>> import xarray as xr\n>>> TIME_ATTRS = {\"units\": \"days since 0001-01-01\", \"calendar\": \"noleap\"}\n>>> valid_times = xr.DataArray([0, 1], dims=[\"time\"], attrs=TIME_ATTRS, name=\"valid_times\")\n>>> invalid_times = xr.DataArray([1e36, 2e36], dims=[\"time\"], attrs=TIME_ATTRS, name=\"invalid_times\")\n>>> ds = xr.merge([valid_times, invalid_times])\n>>> xr.decode_cf(ds)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/Users/spencer/software/xarray/xarray/coding/times.py\", line 275, in decode_cf_datetime\ndates = _decode_datetime_with_pandas(flat_num_dates, units, calendar)\nFile \"/Users/spencer/software/xarray/xarray/coding/times.py\", line 210, in _decode_datetime_with_pandas\nraise OutOfBoundsDatetime(\npandas._libs.tslibs.np_datetime.OutOfBoundsDatetime: Cannot decode times from a non-standard calendar, 'noleap', using pandas.\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/Users/spencer/software/xarray/xarray/coding/times.py\", line 180, in _decode_cf_datetime_dtype\nresult = decode_cf_datetime(example_value, units, calendar, use_cftime)\nFile \"/Users/spencer/software/xarray/xarray/coding/times.py\", line 277, in decode_cf_datetime\ndates = _decode_datetime_with_cftime(\nFile \"/Users/spencer/software/xarray/xarray/coding/times.py\", line 202, in _decode_datetime_with_cftime\ncftime.num2date(num_dates, units, calendar, only_use_cftime_datetimes=True)\nFile \"src/cftime/_cftime.pyx\", line 605, in cftime._cftime.num2date\nFile \"src/cftime/_cftime.pyx\", line 404, in cftime._cftime.cast_to_int\nOverflowError: time values outside range of 64 bit signed integers\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nFile \"/Users/spencer/software/xarray/xarray/conventions.py\", line 655, in decode_cf\nvars, attrs, coord_names = decode_cf_variables(\nFile \"/Users/spencer/software/xarray/xarray/conventions.py\", line 521, in decode_cf_variables\nnew_vars[k] = decode_cf_variable(\nFile \"/Users/spencer/software/xarray/xarray/conventions.py\", line 369, in decode_cf_variable\nvar = times.CFDatetimeCoder(use_cftime=use_cftime).decode(var, name=name)\nFile \"/Users/spencer/software/xarray/xarray/coding/times.py\", line 687, in decode\ndtype = _decode_cf_datetime_dtype(data, units, calendar, self.use_cftime)\nFile \"/Users/spencer/software/xarray/xarray/coding/times.py\", line 190, in _decode_cf_datetime_dtype\nraise ValueError(msg)\nValueError: unable to decode time units 'days since 0001-01-01' with \"calendar 'noleap'\".

        "content": "To address the issue of enhancing the error message when decoding time fails due to variables that can't be represented as `cftime.datetime` objects without indicating the problematic variable's name, we should gather more context from the `xarray` codebase. Based on the traceback, we can identify several keywords and components to target, such as the involved methods and the classes that might be relevant to this issue:\n\n- Methods like `decode_cf_datetime`, `_decode_datetime_with_pandas`, `_decode_datetime_with_cftime`, and `decode_cf_variable` are directly involved.\n- The `CFDatetimeCoder` class is also mentioned.\n- The flow mentions the use of `decode_cf` method as the entry point for the error.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls will be useful to gather the necessary context for addressing the issue:\n\n1. `search_class(\"CFDatetimeCoder\")` to get the file and context of the `CFDatetimeCoder` class where the decoding process takes place.\n2. `search_method(\"decode_cf_datetime\")` to find where `decode_cf_datetime` is defined and used within the codebase.\n3. `search_method(\"decode_cf_variable\")` to explore how variables are decoded and where the potential enhancement to include variable names in error messages could be implemented.\n4. `search_code(\"decode_cf\")` to understand the entry point of the CF decoding process better and where the error is caught.\n\nLet's execute these four API calls to obtain more detailed context around where and how to implement necessary changes."
