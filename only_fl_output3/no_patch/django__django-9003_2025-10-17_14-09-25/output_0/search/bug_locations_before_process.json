        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue with non-deterministic crashes related to `combine`, the method must implement a more robust handling of the `change_map` to prevent circular references. This involves adding checks or a validation step before adding entries to `change_map` to ensure no circular dependencies can form. Additionally, enhancing the logic to more gracefully handle complex query structures, especially with many-to-many self-joins and usage of `AND`/`OR` connectors, is necessary. The method should maintain its existing functionality but be enhanced to detect conditions that lead to circular references or other forms of query corruption, and either resolve them automatically or provide a clear, actionable error message. This may require refactoring the way aliases are managed or introducing additional structures or checks that can more accurately track and manage the relationships between the original and relabeled aliases, especially in complex scenarios."
