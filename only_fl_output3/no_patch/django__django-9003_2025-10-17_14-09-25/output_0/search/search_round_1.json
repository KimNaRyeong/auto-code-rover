But when I examine change_map, its content does indeed change from reload to reload - I suppose this may have something to do with the order of dicts/sets the combine() algorithm is using.\nHere comes some code, I cut out a bunch of unused stuff, but otherwise it's the same:\nclass Invoice(models.Model):\ncustomer = models.ForeignKey(Customer)\ndate_created = models.DateField(default=datetime.date.today, db_index=True)\ndate_sent = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_due = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_paid = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_credited = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ndate_collect = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\ninvoice_type = models.CharField(default=\"invoice\", max_length=32)\nreminders = models.ManyToManyField(\"Invoice\", related_name=\"reminded_set\", blank=True)\nreminder_counter = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)\nThat's the model, and in the view:\nimport datetime\nfrom django.db.models import Q\ndate = datetime.datetime.now()\ninvoices = Invoice.objects.filter(\nQ(date_created__lte=date),\nQ(date_paid__gt=date) | Q(date_paid=None),\nQ(date_credited__gt=date) | Q(date_credited=None),\ncustomer=1,\n)\nfiltered_invoices = Invoice.objects.none()\nnot_due = Q(date_due__gte=date) | Q(date_due=None)\nnot_reminded_yet = ~Q(reminders__date_created__lte=date)\nnot_collected = Q(date_collect__gt=date) | Q(date_collect=None)\nfiltered_invoices |= invoices.filter(not_due, not_collected, date_sent__lte=date, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfiltered_invoices |= invoices.filter(not_collected, not_reminded_yet, date_sent__lte=date, date_due__lt=date, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfor r in [1, 2, 3]:\nqs = invoices.filter(not_collected, reminders__date_created__lte=date, reminders__reminder_counter=r, invoice_type=\"invoice\")\nfor i in range(r + 1, 3 + 1):\nqs = qs.filter(~Q(reminders__reminder_counter=i) | Q(reminders__reminder_counter=i, reminders__date_created__gt=date))\nfiltered_invoices |= qs\nI realize it's pretty complicated but I'm not sure what's essential and what's not. I hope someone knowledgeable of how combine() works can figure out why ordering in some cases matters.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given the results of the initial API calls, we have some important information and also face some challenges in directly locating the `Invoice` model and the specific query patterns within the codebase. The absence of direct hits for the `Invoice` model and the complex query patterns outlined in the issue description suggests either a degree of encapsulation, dynamic query generation, or perhaps, these parts of the codebase are dynamically modified or influenced by factors not directly visible in the static code (e.g., through metaprogramming, database reflections, or dynamically added behaviors).\n\n### Analyzing `combine` Method\n\nThe `combine` method is found within `django/db/models/sql/query.py` which is a core part of Django's ORM system. Given the issue description, `combine` is presumably responsible for merging two or more querysets in a way that respects their individual conditions and combines them into a single, executable query. The method's association with the issue lies in the fact that it sometimes results in a non-deterministic crash due to a circular reference within a `change_map` variable. The intended behavior, therefore, would be for it to merge querysets without leading to such crashes, consistently producing a valid, executable query regardless of the complexity of the involved querysets or their conditions.\n\n1. The presence of circular references suggests an issue with how queryset merging handles references to fields or tables among combined querysets, potentially not accounting for certain edge cases where such references can create loops.\n2. The non-deterministic nature of the issue hints at underlying operations sensitive to the order of elements (e.g., operations on Python dictionaries or sets before Python 3.7 where order wasn't guaranteed, though the issue mentioning upgrade to Python 3 suggests possibly a post-3.7 version, or complexities involving database-specific behaviors).\n\n### Next Steps for Analysis\n\nGiven this background, further steps should involve:\n\n1. **Deep Dive into `combine` Implementation**:\n   We should know exactly how `combine` tries to merge querysets and specifically how it manipulates the `change_map`. This requires examining the method's implementation.\n   \n   - `search_method_in_file(\"combine\", \"django/db/models/sql/query.py\")`\n\n2. **Investigating How Querysets are Constructed**:\n   Since direct references to the `Invoice` model and its querying pattern weren't found, it might be useful to understand more generally how Django's ORM constructs and manipulates querysets. This insight could help hypothesize about how specific patterns might lead to issues in `combine`.\n\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"filter\", \"Query\")`\n   \n   Given the non-deterministic nature, examining any utility or function that may influence queryset order or construction might reveal insights. However, the failure to find the specific `Invoice.objects.filter` usage and the complex query pattern means we may need to focus on the broader mechanism of queryset construction, manipulation, and combination rather than on specific instances of these operations in the codebase.\n\nThis analysis will provide foundational knowledge to hypothesize about the bug's cause and guide us toward a resolution strategy, possibly involving modifications to how `combine` handles set and dictionary operations."

This involves revising how `change_map` is constructed or checked to remove or prevent cycles. The modification must preserve the method's ability to merge querysets according to Django's ORM logic, ensuring that all conditions of the combined querysets are respected and that the output is a consistently valid queryset under all conditions. This could involve adding logic to detect potential circular references before they occur and to handle them in a way that breaks the cycle without losing the intended queryset conditions. Additionally, improving the assertion logic to provide clearer insight into failures and to prevent crashes from occurring due to non-deterministic behavior related to the order of dict/set elements could be part of the fix."
