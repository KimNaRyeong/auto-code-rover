        "intended_behavior": "The `LiteralInclude` class should be modified to correctly handle the `:prepend:` and `:append:` options such that any leading whitespace in the content specified by these options is preserved in the output. This would involve ensuring that the process which integrates the prepended or appended content into the overall literal include output does so in a manner that respects the original formatting intentions, including any indentation levels. It's essential that this functionality coexists seamlessly with existing features like `:start-at:`, `:end-at:`, and `:dedent:`, to ensure that users can still use all of these options in conjunction without unintended side effects on the formatting."
