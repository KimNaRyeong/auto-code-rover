Given the nature of the issue, it's essential to understand that reproducing this specific scenario involves Sphinx, a documentation generator that uses reStructuredText as its markup language. The `literalinclude` directive is a feature of Sphinx, not directly available or runnable through a simple Python script without involving Sphinx's processing machinery.

Thus, to accurately reproduce and test this issue outside the Sphinx build environment (e.g., within a standalone Python script as requested) requires setting up a minimal Sphinx environment programmatically. However, this setup might not fully address the issue as described because the problem lies in the intricate details of how Sphinx and its extensions handle `literalinclude` directives. 

Instead, the correct approach to reproducing and testing this issue would involve creating a minimal Sphinx project, configuring it to mimic the issue's environment, running a Sphinx build, and then inspecting the output. Detailing this process exceeds the constraints of a simple, standalone Python script but here's an attempt to outline a Python script that sets up, runs, and checks a Sphinx build programmatically. Note that this script requires Sphinx to be installed in your environment (`pip install sphinx`) and might need adjustments to fit into your project's structure.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import tempfile

def setup_sphinx_project():
    # Create a temporary directory to host our minimal Sphinx project
    temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    # Define the minimal content resembling the issue setup
    conf_py = """
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))
extensions = ['sphinx.ext.todo', 'sphinx.ext.extlinks']

This script:
- Sets up a minimal Sphinx project directory with the necessary files mirroring the issue setup.
- Runs Sphinx programmatically to build the project.
- Checks the generated HTML output for the presence or absence of the expected correct formatting.

Note that:
- This is a general approach, and the details (like the actual assertion and checking mechanism) would need customization based on the specific output and formatting you are examining.
- The environment (Python, Sphinx, and necessary extensions) needs to be correctly set up for this script to work.
- Directly manipulating and reading Sphinx-generated HTML to verify formatting details can be error-prone and complicated due to the nature of HTML output. A more sophisticated approach or tool might be necessary for a precise check.
