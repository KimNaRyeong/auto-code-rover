Creating a standalone Python script to reproduce an issue involving Sphinx and its `literalinclude` directive presents a challenge due to the complexity and dependencies of the Sphinx documentation building process. However, based on the initial requirements and acknowledging the limitations, here's an illustrative example of what such a script could look like. This script attempts to generate a mini Sphinx environment programmatically, build it, and check the output for the specific issue described.

Please note, this script assumes you have Sphinx installed in your environment. If not, you will need to install Sphinx (`pip install sphinx`) and ensure `sphinx-build` is accessible in your environment's `PATH`.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys
import tempfile


def print_stacktrace(e):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def setup_sphinx_environment():
    temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    os.mkdir(os.path.join(temp_dir, "_build"))
    with open(os.path.join(temp_dir, "conf.py"), "w") as f:
        f.write("extensions = []\n")
    with open(os.path.join(temp_dir, "index.rst"), "w") as f:
        f.write(""".. literalinclude:: pom.xml
   :language: xml
   :prepend:       </plugin>
   :start-at: <groupId>com.github.ekryd.sortpom</groupId>
   :end-at: </plugin>""")
    with open(os.path.join(temp_dir, "pom.xml"), "w") as f:
        f.write("""<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <!-- Plugin configuration omitted for brevity -->
      <plugin>
        <groupId>com.github.ekryd.sortpom</groupId>
        <artifactId>sortpom-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.15.0</version>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
""")
    return temp_dir


def run_sphinx(temp_dir):
    try:
        subprocess.check_output(
            ['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', temp_dir, os.path.join(temp_dir, "_build")],
            stderr=subprocess.STDOUT
        )
        check_output(os.path.join(temp_dir, "_build", "index.html"))
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)


def check_output(html_file):
    with open(html_file, "r") as f:
        contents = f.read()
        if "       </plugin>" not in contents:
            raise AssertionError("Prepended XML code block is incorrectly formatted.")

try:
    project_dir = setup_sphinx_environment()
    run_sphinx(project_dir)
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
else:
    print("Issue not present or fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)
```

### Key Points:
- This script creates a temporary directory, sets up a minimal Sphinx configuration, and writes the documentation content, including the problematic `literalinclude` directive.
- It runs `sphinx-build` using the subprocess module to generate HTML documentation.
- After the build, it checks the generated HTML file for the specific formatting issue.
- It carefully employs structured exception handling to capture and display any errors encountered during execution, including invoking `print_stacktrace` for detailed traceback output.

### Instructions:
- Ensure Sphinx is installed and properly configured in your Python environment.
- Save the above script to a file named `reproducer.py` in your project's root directory.
- Run the script using `python3 reproducer.py`.

### Caveats:
- The script assumes `sphinx-build` is accessible in the current environment's `PATH`. If you encounter a "No such file or directory" error related to `sphinx-build`, you may need to adjust your environment configuration.
- This script applies a rudimentary check for a specific string in the generated HTML content to assess whether the issue is present. Depending on the Sphinx theme and configuration, additional adjustments might be required for accurate detection.
