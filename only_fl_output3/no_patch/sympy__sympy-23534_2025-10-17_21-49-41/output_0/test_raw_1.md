Based on your feedback, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the approach to reproduce the issue. The instructions need to be clarified and corrected in the script to effectively catch and assert the unexpected behavior regarding the usage of `symbols` with an extra layer of parentheses that incorrectly creates `Symbol` instances instead of `Function` instances.

Let's adjust the script to accurately reproduce and capture the issue as described:

```python
import sympy as smp

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_sympy_symbols_with_function():
    try:
        # Adjusted reproduction of the issue
        q, u = smp.symbols(('q:2', 'u:2'), cls=smp.Function)

        # Adjusted to catch the actual issue where q[0] is expected to be an instance of 'Function'
        # but is instead an instance of 'Symbol'.
        expected_type = smp.function.UndefinedFunction
        actual_type = type(q[0])

        assert issubclass(actual_type, expected_type), f"Expected {expected_type}, got {actual_type}"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Raising the error to indicate failure to match the expectation.
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_sympy_symbols_with_function()
        print("The issue is fixed.")
    except AssertionError:
        # Exiting with code 0 as previously the requirement was to indicate issue reproduction with code 0.
        # In a real scenario, especially for CI/CD, you might consider exiting with a non-zero code to indicate failure.
        import sys
        sys.exit(1)
```

This script is tailored to verify the type of `q[0]` against the expected `UndefinedFunction` class, reflecting the issue's description. The previous confusion in test expectation was my error, and this script is intended to correctly reproduce the described issue, exiting with code 1 to indicate the problem correctly this time rather than implying the issue is fixed when it is not.
