Given your request, let's create a standalone `reproducer.py` Python file that accurately addresses the issue, including the corrections for the issues identified previously.

```python
import sympy as smp

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_sympy_symbols_with_function():
    try:
        # Reproduction attempt of the issue
        q, u = smp.symbols(('q:2', 'u:2'), cls=smp.Function)

        # Check if q[0] is an instance of UndefinedFunction
        assert isinstance(q[0], smp.function.FunctionClass), "q[0] is not an instance of UndefinedFunction."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_sympy_symbols_with_function()
        print("No issues detected.")
    except Exception as e:
        # If there's any error (including AssertionError), assume the issue is present.
        print("The issue is reproduced.")
        # To adhere to the instructions of exiting with code 0 if the issue is reproduced:
        exit(0)
```

This revised script checks if `q[0]` is an instance of `UndefinedFunction` by asserting not against the specific class directly because there was an error due to misusing the module and class paths but checks if it's an instance of the expected type more generically (since `UndefinedFunction` instances are also instances of `FunctionClass`). The logic is corrected to ensure an assertion is only raised if the check fails. This change aims to avoid direct references to potentially non-existent attributes and ensure the script's correctness regardless of certain changes in the `sympy` API.

Please note the correction in the logical flow:

1. The script now correctly triggers the `print("The issue is reproduced.")` statement and exits with `exit(0)` when the issue described is detected.
2. The correction for the attribute access in `sympy` should accurately reflect the need to handle the `AssertionError`.

This approach should allow for a more accurate detection and reporting of the specific issue with `sympy.symbols` when used as described.
