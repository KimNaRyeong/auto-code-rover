        "content": "To address the issue described, it's essential to understand how the `symbols` function is implemented and interacts with classes like `Symbol` and `Function` in Sympy's codebase. Given the problem's outline, focusing on the implementation of `symbols`, and its relation to the creation of `Function` objects would be a good starting point. Additionally, exploring the `Symbol` and `Function` classes might provide insights into why the additional parentheses alter the expected behavior. Here are the specific API calls that could help gather the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"symbols\")`: To get an overview of how the `symbols` method is implemented and where it might handle different `cls` parameters.\n\n2. `search_class(\"Symbol\")`: To understand how the `Symbol` class is defined, which might show why it's being returned instead of a `Function` instance.\n\n3. `search_class(\"Function\")`: To inspect the `Function` class definition or any subclass of it called `UndefinedFunction`, which could reveal insights into its instantiation process.\n\nThese API calls should provide a solid foundation of code context to analyze the issue further and eventually craft a patch."
