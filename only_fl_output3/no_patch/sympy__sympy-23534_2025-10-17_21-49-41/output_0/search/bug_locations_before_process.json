        "intended_behavior": "The `symbols` method should be enhanced to correctly recognize and handle inputs encapsulated within an extra layer of parentheses when the `cls` keyword is specified as `Function`. The parsing logic within this method should precisely discern when the input pattern implies the creation of `Function` instances, even if the symbols are grouped within additional parentheses for tuple unpacking or similar patterns. This enhancement requires no change to the existing functionality for other input formats or when generating `Symbol` instances. The fix should solely address the improved interpretation of the tuple inputs specifically aimed to define multiple function objects with the `cls=Function` argument, ensuring the method returns instances of `UndefinedFunction` instead of `Symbol` when this condition is met."
