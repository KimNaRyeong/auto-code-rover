The instructions need to be clarified and corrected in the script to effectively catch and assert the unexpected behavior regarding the usage of `symbols` with an extra layer of parentheses that incorrectly creates `Symbol` instances instead of `Function` instances.\n\nLet's adjust the script to accurately reproduce and capture the issue as described:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as smp\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef test_sympy_symbols_with_function():\n    try:\n        # Adjusted reproduction of the issue\n        q, u = smp.symbols(('q:2', 'u:2'), cls=smp.Function)\n\n        # Adjusted to catch the actual issue where q[0] is expected to be an instance of 'Function'\n        # but is instead an instance of 'Symbol'.\n        expected_type = smp.function.UndefinedFunction\n        actual_type = type(q[0])\n\n        assert issubclass(actual_type, expected_type), f\"Expected {expected_type}, got {actual_type}\"\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        # Raising the error to indicate failure to match the expectation.\n        raise\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        test_sympy_symbols_with_function()\n        print(\"The issue is fixed.\")\n    except AssertionError:\n        # Exiting with code 0 as previously the requirement was to indicate issue reproduction with code 0.\n        # In a real scenario, especially for CI/CD, you might consider exiting with a non-zero code to indicate failure.\n        import sys\n        sys.exit(1)\n```\n\nThis script is tailored to verify the type of `q[0]` against the expected `UndefinedFunction` class, reflecting the issue's description. The previous confusion in test expectation was my error, and this script is intended to correctly reproduce the described issue, exiting with code 1 to indicate the problem correctly this time rather than implying the issue is fixed when it is not."
