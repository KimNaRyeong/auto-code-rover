        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `ccode` function to handle `sinc(x)` expressions specifically by converting them into a `Piecewise` equivalent in C code, such as generating the ternary operation `((x != 0) ? (sin(x)/x) : (1))`. This addition should check for the presence of a `sinc` function call within the expressions being processed, allowing `ccode` to support the conversion of `sinc(x)` expressions to valid C code while preserving existing functionality."
