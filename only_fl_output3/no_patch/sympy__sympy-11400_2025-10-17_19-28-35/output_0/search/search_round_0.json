        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue with `ccode(sinc(x))` not working properly, I need to locate where the function `ccode` and possibly any references to `sinc` are handled within the project. Since `ccode` likely belongs to a specific class involved in generating C code from some kind of symbolic representation, and the issue seems to pertain to the handling or lack thereof of specific functions like `sinc` in C code generation, the following API calls might be relevant:\n\n1. `search_method(\"ccode\")`: This will help identify in which classes and files the `ccode` method exists, giving us an entry point to understand how functions are processed and converted to C code.\n\n2. `search_code(\"sinc(x)\")`: By searching for \"sinc(x)\", we can identify any specific handling or mentions of the `sinc` function within the project, which will provide insight into why it might not be supported or how it could be implemented.\n\nThese calls should yield the necessary context within the project's codebase to understand how `ccode` functions are structured and where the issue with `sinc(x)` might be addressed."
