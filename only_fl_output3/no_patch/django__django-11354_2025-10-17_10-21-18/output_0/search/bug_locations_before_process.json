        "intended_behavior": "The method `get_aggregation` should maintain necessary INNER JOIN operations even when handling aggregate annotations on querysets that reference inherited model fields. To resolve the issue without removing existing functionalities, a modification should be made to the conditional logic that sets `inner_query.default_cols` to `False`. Specifically, the adjustment involves ensuring that `default_cols` is not set to False if the queryset's annotations could lead to an `OperationalError` due to missing JOIN clauses. The proposal in the issue suggests adding a condition to retain `default_cols` as True if there are existing annotations that would require the INNER JOIN to fetch inherited fields properly. This change aims to prevent the loss of required JOINs while keeping the optimization logic for scenarios where it is safe to streamline `select` and `group_by` clauses. The overarching goal is to ensure that calling `.count()` on an annotated queryset referencing inherited model fields executes successfully without database errors, while preserving query performance optimizations wherever applicable."
