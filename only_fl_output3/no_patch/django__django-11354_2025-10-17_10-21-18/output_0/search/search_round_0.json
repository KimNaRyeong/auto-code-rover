Query.get_aggregation method drops INNER JOIN required to select the title field. Specifically, this code drops it:\nif not inner_query.distinct:\n# If the inner query uses default select and it has some\n# aggregate annotations, then we must make sure the inner\n# query is grouped by the main model's primary key. However,\n# clearing the select clause can alter results if distinct is\n# used.\nif inner_query.default_cols and has_existing_annotations:\ninner_query.group_by = [self.model._meta.pk.get_col(inner_query.get_initial_alias())]\ninner_query.default_cols = False\nCode is taken from Django 1.8 but 1.11 looks the same.\ndefault_cols is set to False and the INNER JOIN is dropped. Quick fix is to add a condition for setting default_cols to False:\nif not inner_query.distinct:\n# If the inner query uses default select and it has some\n# aggregate annotations, then we must make sure the inner\n# query is grouped by the main model's primary key. However,\n# clearing the select clause can alter results if distinct is\n# used.\nif inner_query.default_cols and has_existing_annotations:\ninner_query.group_by = [self.model._meta.pk.get_col(inner_query.get_initial_alias())]\nif not has_existing_annotations:\ninner_query.default_cols = False\nI don't know if it could be done in a nicer way. I was able to reproduce this in 1.8.18 and 1.11.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather comprehensive context for resolving the issue described, we'll start by performing a series of targeted search API calls related to the Django models and queryset manipulation methods mentioned in the issue. Here are the planned API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `BaseItem` class definition to understand how inherited fields are defined and potentially affected.\n2. Search for the `Item` class definition to see if there's any relevant custom logic in the derived model that might influence the described behavior.\n3. Search for the `get_aggregation` method across the codebase as it's directly mentioned as the location of the bug.\n4. Search for code snippets that involve `RawSQL` applied to a queryset to see how raw SQL annotations are commonly used within the project. This will help us understand if there's a consistent pattern or usage that might be influencing the error.\n5. Search for code snippets involving `queryset.count()` on an annotated queryset which might reveal how these interactions are handled elsewhere or if similar issues have been tackled in a different manner.\n\nBased on the above, here are the API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"BaseItem\")`\n- `search_class(\"Item\")`\n- `search_method(\"get_aggregation\")`\n- `search_code('queryset.annotate(title2=RawSQL(\"title\", ()))')`\n- `search_code(\"queryset.count()\")`"
