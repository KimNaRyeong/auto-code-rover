Specifically, I'm interested in the `Permutation` class and its constructor, as well as any relevant methods that handle the construction or processing of permutation instances from cycles. Here are the API calls I plan to make:\n\n1. Search for the `Permutation` class in the codebase to understand its structure and find the relevant file it is located in.\n2. Once the file containing the `Permutation` class is identified, search within that file for the constructor method to see how it currently processes the input cycles.\n3. In the same vein, search for any method that could be responsible for handling or applying cycles in order to understand the expected format and the processing logic that should be adapted to support non-disjoint cycles.\n\nFirst, I'll make the initial calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"Permutation\")`"
