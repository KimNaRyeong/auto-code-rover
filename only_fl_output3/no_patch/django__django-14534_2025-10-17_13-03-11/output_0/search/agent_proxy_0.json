            "content": "To address the issue described, it's beneficial to gather more context about the classes and methods mentioned. We will focus on the `BoundField` and `BoundWidget` classes, especially on the methods `subwidgets` of `BoundField` and `id_for_label` of `BoundWidget`. Furthermore, exploring how `CheckboxSelectMultiple` widgets interact with these might provide insights into the bug's nature and potential fixes. Here are the API calls we will make:\n\n1. Search for the `BoundField` class to get a comprehensive understanding of its implementation and context:  \n`search_class(\"BoundField\")`\n\n2. Similarly, search for the `BoundWidget` class to understand how it is implemented and how the `id_for_label` method fits within it:  \n`search_class(\"BoundWidget\")`\n\n3. Since the issue specifically mentions the handling of `CheckboxSelectMultiple` subwidgets, it's crucial to understand how these are defined. Therefore, we will search for this widget class:  \n`search_class(\"CheckboxSelectMultiple\")`\n\n4. To directly address the issue in the `BoundWidget` implementation, look into the `id_for_label` method within the `BoundWidget` class:  \n`search_method_in_class(\"id_for_label\", \"BoundWidget\")`\n\n5. The issue description brings up how `subwidgets` are handled within the `BoundField` context. Thus, it's pertinent to examine the `subwidgets` method within the `BoundField` class for a closer look at its workings:  \n`search_method_in_class(\"subwidgets\", \"BoundField\")`\n\n6. Lastly, to understand how `CheckboxSelectMultiple` widgets interact more comprehensively, it would be useful to look for any code snippets that instantiate or refer to this widget, which could include overriding the `auto_id` format-string or interactions with `subwidgets`:  \n`search_code(\"CheckboxSelectMultiple\")`\n\nThese API calls are chosen to offer a detailed perspective on the components involved in the issue, allowing for a better understanding of the bug and aid in formulating a solution."
