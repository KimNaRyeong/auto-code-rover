Below is a `reproducer.py` script that you can use to reproduce the mentioned issue. This script checks for consistency between LaTeX printer outputs and pretty printer outputs for the provided expressions in the issue. It raises an `AssertionError` if the outputs are inconsistent, which implies the presence of the issue, and exits with code 0 if the issue is fixed (assuming "fixed" means the outputs have been made consistent).

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_consistency():
    from sympy import var, exp, log, latex, pprint
    from sympy.printing.pretty.pretty import PrettyPrinter
    from io import StringIO
    import sys

    # Redirect stdout to capture pprint outputs
    old_stdout = sys.stdout
    sys.stdout = mystdout = StringIO()

    # Consistency check 1
    x = var('x', positive=True)
    latex_output = latex(exp(-x) * log(x))
    pprint(exp(--x) * log(x))
    pretty_output = mystdout.getvalue()

    # Reset stdout
    sys.stdout = old_stdout
    mystdout.truncate(0)
    mystdout.seek(0)

    if not '\\frac{1}{e^{x}} \\log{\\left (x \\right )}' in latex_output:
        raise AssertionError("LaTeX output for exp(-x)*log(x) is not as expected.")

    if not "e^{-x} \\cdot \\log{(x)}" in pretty_output:  # Simplified checking
        raise AssertionError("Pretty output for exp(-x)*log(x) is not as expected.")

    # Consistency check 2
    x, y = var('x y')
    latex_output_2 = latex(1/(x + y)/2)
    pprint(1/(x + y)/2)
    pretty_output_2 = mystdout.getvalue()

    # Validate
    if not '\\frac{1}{2 x + 2 y}' in latex_output_2:
        raise AssertionError("LaTeX output for 1/(x+y)/2 is not as expected.")

    if not "1/(2â‹…(x + y))" in pretty_output_2:  # Simplified checking
        raise AssertionError("Pretty output for 1/(x+y)/2 is not as expected.")

    print("No issues detected.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        check_consistency()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    sys.exit(0)

This script focuses on reproducing the inconsistency between LaTeX and pretty printer outputs as highlighted in your issue descriptions. Assumptions on variables that might affect the printing are not directly addressed with respect to changes in their representations, but the primary goal is to assert the consistency irrespective of variable assumptions. Note, however, the check for specific strings in the `PrettyPrinter`'s output simplifies this task and might need adjustment depending on the actual formatting and spacing provided by the pretty printer in practice.
