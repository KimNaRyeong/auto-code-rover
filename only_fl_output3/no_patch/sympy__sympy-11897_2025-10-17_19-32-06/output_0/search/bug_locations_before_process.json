Specifically, it needs to handle mathematical expressions, like those involving negative exponents and fractions, to reflect the same logical and mathematical interpretations as the pretty printer's output. Enhancements might include adjusting how expressions are simplified and represented in LaTeX, ensuring any assumptions (such as variable positivity) do not disproportionately affect the output consistency. The goal is not to make the LaTeX output identical to pretty print but to ensure mathematical expressions are intuitively similar and correct in both formats."

Any adjustments here should aim to maintain or improve the clarity and accuracy of the pretty-printed output, especially in expressions that have known inconsistencies in their LaTeX representations. This might involve increased collaboration or shared logic between the `pretty` and `latex` methods for specific kinds of expressions to ensure both outputs align in their mathematical intent and representations."
