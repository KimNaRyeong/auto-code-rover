        "content": "To address the issue related to Django's `fields.E305` error with `ManyToManyFields` using `related_name='+'` in models with the same name across different apps, we should gather more context by searching the relevant parts of the Django codebase that would be involved in this scenario. Given the description, we want to look into how Django processes migrations for models with `ManyToManyFields`, particularly focusing on the handling of `related_name`.\n\nHere are the intended API calls based on the issue described:\n\n1. To understand how Django deals with `related_name` for `ManyToManyField` during the migration process, we need to look into the implementation of the `ManyToManyField` itself and how it is defined within a model. Let's start by searching for the `ManyToManyField` class definition.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"ManyToManyField\")\n   ```\n\n2. Next, it's essential to understand how migrations identify and process models with `ManyToManyFields` especially when `related_name='+'` is specified. This involves looking into the migration framework to see how field options like `related_name` are considered during the migration file creation process. Django's migration system uses operations to represent changes; hence, we should look into relevant migration operation(s) that handle relationships.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"AddField\")\n   search_class(\"CreateModel\")\n   ```\n\n3. Since the error mentioned is `fields.E305`, it implies there's a specific validation or check that raises this error. It would be valuable to search for this error code directly to find the validation logic that triggers it.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"fields.E305\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls will help us gather the necessary insights into how Django processes `ManyToManyField` relationships during migrations and, more specifically, how it handles `related_name` attributes, including `'+'`, across models with the same name in different apps. This information will be crucial to understand the root cause of the issue and to develop a proper patch."
