        "intended_behavior": "The `_check_clashes` method should be updated to correctly interpret `related_name='+'` as indicating that no reverse relationship should be created, and thus no clash could occur in this configuration. The method's logic for checking field name clashes should explicitly handle cases where `related_name='+'`, bypassing the error `fields.E305` under these specific circumstances. This adjustment would prevent raising unnecessary errors for models with the same name in different apps when they are correctly using `related_name='+'` to avoid reverse relationship conflicts."

        "method": "",
        "intended_behavior": "Although the history of this issue does not pinpoint a specific method within `ManyToManyField` as problematic, ensuring that the `ManyToManyField` and its related methods (like `contribute_to_class`, `deconstruct`, `_get_m2m_db_table`) understand and respect the special handling required for `related_name='+'` is important. The `ManyToManyField` class should ensure that when `related_name='+'` is used, it signals clearly to all methods involved in migration processing and schema generation that reverse relation checks and conflict checks should be adjusted accordingly. This may not require a direct code change in a specific method but ensuring that the handling of `related_name='+'` is consistent across all relevant methods in this class."
