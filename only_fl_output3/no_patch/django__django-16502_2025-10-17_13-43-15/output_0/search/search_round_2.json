Since the issue arises when serving HEAD requests improperly with a body, which shouldn't happen according to the HTTP specification, we'll need to inspect how Django processes these requests and ensure compliance by stripping the body for HEAD requests. Here are the API calls we should make based on the issue described:\n\n1. To understand how `runserver` handles requests and potentially identify where the logic for handling HEAD requests could be modified or is missing, we should first locate where the `runserver` command is implemented. This command is part of Django's core management commands, and it is likely involved with setting up the server that directly interacts with incoming HTTP requests.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"runserver\")\n   ```\n\n2. Given that the issue specifies the server's response to include a body for HEAD requests (which it shouldn't), we need to understand how the HTTP response is being constructed and sent back to the client. To do this, we should find where the response to HTTP requests is being finalized or where the server determines the request method to appropriately modify the response for HEAD requests.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"return response\")\n   ```\n\n3. The issue also references the WSGIServer, implying that the problem might lie in how this server handles HEAD requests specifically.

It appears to have properties related to the request queue size and provides methods for initializing the server, possibly allowing customization of IPv6 usage and address reusability. The `handle_error` method might be designed to handle errors that occur during the request handling process.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  Given that `WSGIServer` is the class representing the server used by Django's development server (`runserver`), any behavior regarding how requests are handled\u2014including whether or not the response body is sent for HEAD requests\u2014would be influenced by how this server and its superclass are implemented. However, the snippet does not explicitly show how requests are processed or how responses are assembled and sent back to the client.\n\n- **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n  The intended behavior would be for `WSGIServer` (or its related request/response handling code in Django's server setup) to recognize HEAD requests specifically and ensure that while headers and status codes are appropriately generated and sent, the response body is not included in the response.\n\n### Analysis of search_code(\"return response\")\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The search results show numerous locations where `return response` is used, indicating points in the middleware, handlers, and views where responses are generated and returned. These points could influence or directly control how the response to any HTTP request, including HEAD requests, is finalized before being returned to the client.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  Since the issue revolves around the presence of a response body in HEAD requests, any middleware, handler, or view layer that finalizes and returns HTTP responses could be a potential area where the logic for stripping the body of HEAD requests needs to be ensured or corrected.\n\n- **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n  The expected behavior would be that at some point during the response preparation\u2014potentially in a middleware, given Django's architecture\u2014there should be a check for if the request method is HEAD. If so, the response body should be either prevented from being generated or stripped before the response is returned.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the above analysis, the next step would be to look closer at areas directly involved with the processing of requests and the generation of responses. Specifically, we should examine:\n\n1. The request handling mechanism in `WSGIServer`, although it wasn't revealed in the initial snippet, to find if and how it processes different HTTP methods, particularly HEAD requests.\n2. The middleware or response generation paths identified by `search_code(\"return response\")` to locate a potential point where the response body for HEAD requests can be stripped or not generated.\n\nFurther API calls could include:\n- Examining the `WSGIServer`'s methods closely, such as `handle` or any method that deals with request processing, to understand how requests are categorized and responses are formed.\n- Inspecting relevant middleware or handler files mentioned in the `return response` search results with specifics that could be tied to modifying or inspecting the response, such as in `django/core/handlers/base.py` or middleware layers handling responses.\n\nThis approach will help identify the exact point at which the response for HEAD requests can be adjusted to be compliant with the RFC 2616 by not including a body in the response."

If possible, they attempt to gracefully close the connection by shutting down writing to the socket. This method is integral to how each individual request is processed by the server.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   The described functionality manages request handling but does not specifically address the issue of stripping the response body for HEAD requests. However, its invocation of `handle_one_request` suggests that the logic for differentiating request methods and appropriately crafting their responses will likely lie in or be called by this `handle_one_request` method. Since the `handle` method is a step in the request handling process, its relationship with the bug is indirect: it calls the procedure (`handle_one_request`) that needs to implement the logic for handling HEAD requests according to the specifications (i.e., not including a response body).\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   While the `handle` method itself does not need to change to address the bug directly, the intended behavior within the scope of request processing (likely within `handle_one_request` or similar methods called within the request handling flow) should include checking if the request is a HEAD request. Subsequently, for HEAD requests, it should ensure the response prepared does not include a body while still sending the appropriate headers and status code back to the client. This logic might not be encapsulated within the `handle` method itself but in the methods it invokes for processing requests.\n\nGiven this analysis, a closer look into the `handle_one_request` method or similar methods directly involved in constructing the responses might be necessary to directly address the issue. While the `handle` method sets up the framework for request handling, the specifics of how the response is constructed and sent, including compliance with HTTP method requirements (in this case, for HEAD requests), are likely handled elsewhere in the code. Since the search for `handle_request` in `WSGIServer` did not yield results, and the `handle` method in `WSGIRequestHandler` seems closely related to the issue, further investigation into related request processing methods such as `handle_one_request` would be the next logical step.\n\nHowever, since my directive is to specify bug locations and intended behaviors without further digging into additional context, the actionable insight revolves around ensuring wherever the request is checked and the response is generated, there's a conditional logic to handle HEAD requests by stripping or avoiding the inclusion of the body in the response."

Thus, I will directly address the issue as understood.\n\n### Bug Locations\n\n- **Location 1:**\n  - **File:** django/core/servers/basehttp.py\n  - **Class:** WSGIRequestHandler\n  - **Method:** handle\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The intention for this method is to set up a framework for handling incoming HTTP requests, processing them, and then responding. To address the issue with HEAD requests incorrectly including a response body, the intended behavior should be modified to ensure that when a HEAD request is detected, the response generated does not include a body. This might involve adding additional checks either within this method or, more likely, within the `handle_one_request` method it calls, to verify the request method and adjust the response accordingly. Specifically, after a request is identified as a HEAD request, the process that forms the response should either not include a body from the outset or strip it out before sending the response back to the client. Preservation of existing functionality for all other types of requests is paramount; only the handling of HEAD requests should be altered to make it compliant with the HTTP specification by not including a response body.\n\n### Explanation\n\nSince modifying the `handle` method or related directly might not suffice or be the direct cause of the issue, the actual adjustment needs to occur in the parts of the Django development server logic that directly control the content of the response. This solution will likely involve a careful examination and adjustment either in the `handle_one_request` method itself or in a component of the response generation that `handle_one_request` utilizes, to respect the RFC stipulation for HEAD requests. \n\nThis proposed solution aims to ensure the development server (`runserver`) does not include response bodies in HEAD requests, aligning with RFC specifications and preventing errors or unexpected behaviors observed due to non-compliance."
