        "intended_behavior": "The intention for this method is to set up a framework for handling incoming HTTP requests, processing them, and then responding. To address the issue with HEAD requests incorrectly including a response body, the intended behavior should be modified to ensure that when a HEAD request is detected, the response generated does not include a body. This might involve adding additional checks either within this method or, more likely, within the handle_one_request method it calls, to verify the request method and adjust the response accordingly. Specifically, after a request is identified as a HEAD request, the process that forms the response should either not include a body from the outset or strip it out before sending the response back to the client. Preservation of existing functionality for all other types of requests is paramount; only the handling of HEAD requests should be altered to make it compliant with the HTTP specification by not including a response body."
