To create a standalone Python file `reproducer.py` that reproduces the noted Django issue and behaves as specified, we can follow these steps:

1. Set up a temporary Django project programmatically.
2. Start the Django development server (`runserver`) in a separate thread or process.
3. Perform a HEAD request to the server.
4. Check the response to ensure no body is present for the HEAD request.
5. If the issue is present (i.e., there's a body in the response), raise an `AssertionError`; otherwise, exit normally.

Below is a possible implementation of `reproducer.py`:

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys
import time
import traceback
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_django_environment():
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'testproject.settings')
    import django
    django.setup()

def start_django_server():
    subprocess.Popen(['django-admin', 'runserver', '--noreload'])

def check_head_request():
    response = requests.head('http://127.0.0.1:8000/')
    if len(response.content) > 0:
        raise AssertionError("HEAD request returned a response body.")

def main():
    # Step 1: Set up a temporary Django environment
    os.system("django-admin startproject testproject")
    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath("testproject"))  # Add project to PYTHONPATH
    setup_django_environment()

    try:
        # Step 2: Start the Django development server
        print("Starting Django development server...")
        start_django_server()
        time.sleep(3)  # Wait a bit for the server to start

        # Step 3: Send a HEAD request and check the response
        check_head_request()
        print("No issue detected: HEAD request did not return a response body.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    finally:
        # Clean up environment
        sys.path.remove(os.path.abspath("testproject"))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Notes:
- This file needs to be run in an environment where Django is already installed and configured (`pip install django`).
- It attempts to create a new Django project named `testproject` in the current working directory. Ensure there's no existing directory with the same name or modify the script to handle naming conflicts.
- The script uses `requests` for making the HEAD request. Ensure that `requests` is installed (`pip install requests`) or modify the script to use another method for making the HTTP request.
- Proper cleanup and error handling are crucial for real-world usage but are somewhat simplified here for brevity.
- Be cautious with the use of `os.system` for executing commands, especially if integrating user input or in production environments, to avoid injection vulnerabilities.
- This script directly uses `subprocess.Popen` to start the server without checking for its successful launch or handling its output. In a more robust solution, consider monitoring the server's startup logs for confirmation it has started correctly before proceeding with tests.
