Given the requirements and the need to address the issue described, let's approach the solution by simplifying and refining our script to ensure it's correctly starting a Django project, starting the Django development server, sending a HEAD request, and verifying the response to check for compliance. The previous errors indicated issues in starting the server correctly and making the HEAD request. We need to ensure the Django server is actually up and running before we send the HEAD request. One way to achieve this is to use `subprocess` to start the server in a way that ensures the project settings are correctly identified.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys
import time
import threading
import requests

def run_django_server():
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'testproject.settings')
    subprocess.call(['python', 'manage.py', 'runserver'])

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def send_head_request_and_verify():
    response = requests.head('http://127.0.0.1:8000/')
    assert response.content == b'', "HEAD request should not return a body."

def setup_and_run_test():
    # Set up Django project
    os.system('django-admin startproject testproject')
    os.chdir('testproject')

    # Starting Django server in a background thread
    t = threading.Thread(target=run_django_server)
    t.daemon = True
    t.start()

    time.sleep(5)  # Giving time for the server to start

    try:
        send_head_request_and_verify()
        print("Test passed: No response body for HEAD request.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    setup_and_run_test()
```

### Important Notes:
- This script initiates a new Django project, switches into its directory (which solves the issue of Django not finding the settings module), and then starts the server in a background thread. Adjustments have been made to ensure this sequence of operations aligns correctly with Django's expectations.
- There's a `time.sleep(5)` pause to allow the Django server enough time to start up before the HEAD request is sent. This delay is necessary as starting a Django server is not instantaneous. Adjust this value based on your environment's performance.
- Before running this script, make sure that the Django (`django-admin startproject testproject`) command will successfully execute in your environment. The python environment should have Django installed, and there should not be any directory conflicts with the `testproject`.
- The script assumes the requests library is installed. If not, install it using `pip install requests`.
- This approach isolates the Django server start-up in a separate thread, avoiding the execution flow problems seen previously and aiming for a correct simulation of the server response to a HEAD request.

Keep in mind running this script will modify your current directory structure by adding a Django project to it. It's advisable to run this in a clean, disposable environment to avoid unintentionally overwriting or interfering with your existing projects.
