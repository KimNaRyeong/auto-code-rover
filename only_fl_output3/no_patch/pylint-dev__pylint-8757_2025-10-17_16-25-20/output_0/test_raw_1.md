Based on the feedback that the initial reproducer script encountered an error due to the `pylint` command not found, I'll assume for this revision that either `pylint` is not installed in the system's default PATH, or there's an environment issue that prevents the subprocess from locating it. Let's adjust the script to ensure it uses a fully qualified path to `pylint` or activates a virtual environment before running pylint. However, since locating `pylint` dynamically or handling different virtual environments robustly can be complex and environment-specific, this revised script will suggest checks or steps you might include to ensure the correct execution environment for `pylint`.

Please review your setup and adjust the path to `pylint` or the virtual environment activation as necessary. This revised script will include a placeholder for these adjustments.

```python
import subprocess
import sys
import os


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    traceback_str = ''.join(traceback.format_exception(None, e, e.__traceback__))
    print(traceback_str, file=sys.stderr)


def run_pylint(jobs):
    # Adjust the command to match your environment.
    # If pylint is in a virtual environment, activate it first or use the full path to pylint.
    pylint_command = ["/path/to/your/pylint", f"--jobs={jobs}", "--rcfile=pylintrc", "app/codein", "app/melange", "app/soc", "app/summerofcode", "app/settings.py", "app/urls.py", "app/main.py", "tests", "pavement.py", "setup.py"]
    result = subprocess.run(pylint_command, capture_output=True, text=True)
    if result.returncode != 0:
        raise Exception(f"Pylint exited with a non-zero status: {result.returncode}")
    return len(result.stdout.split("\n"))


def main():
    try:
        # Ensure environment is correctly set up for pylint to run, this may include activating a virtualenv.
        # os.system('source /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate')  # Uncomment and adjust if necessary.

        output_lines_jobs_1 = run_pylint(1)
        output_lines_jobs_2 = run_pylint(2)

        if output_lines_jobs_1 == output_lines_jobs_2:
            print("Issue is fixed: Outputs with different --jobs parameters match.")
            sys.exit(0)
        else:
            raise AssertionError(f"Different number of output lines: --jobs=1 gave {output_lines_jobs_1} lines, but --jobs=2 gave {output_lines_jobs_2} lines.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Ensure 'pylintrc' file exists in the project directory for this script to run as expected.
    if not os.path.isfile('pylintrc'):
        print("Error: 'pylintrc' file is missing in the root directory.", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)
    
    main()
```

**Important Correction Note:** Ensure you replace `"/path/to/your/pylint"` with the actual path to your pylint executable if it's not in the system's PATH or if you're using it from within a virtual environment. Additionally, the comment about activating a virtual environment is targeted for shell environments and would need to be adapted for Python scripting, potentially requiring direct activation within the script or ensuring the script is run within an already activated environment.
