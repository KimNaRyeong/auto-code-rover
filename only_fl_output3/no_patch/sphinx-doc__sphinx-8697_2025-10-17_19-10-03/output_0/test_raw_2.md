Given the context and the need for a reproducible script using Sphinx to mirror the described issue, the initial approach with directly using the Sphinx API inside a script was problematic. Let's adjust the strategy and focus on generating the issue with a more external view by creating a starting Sphinx project structure dynamically, running Sphinx to generate the output, and then checking the generated files for duplicates.

This solution involves creating the necessary Sphinx project structure, files, and content programmatically, then invoking Sphinx build process via a subprocess call (this approach bypasses the need for directly interacting with the Sphinx internal API and its dependencies in the script's environment). Lastly, it checks for the presence of duplicate files in the `_downloads` directory to assert the issue.

Please note: Before running this `reproducer.py`, ensure Sphinx is installed and accessible in your environment.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import shutil
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f'    {line_number}: {code_context}', file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_project_structure():
    project_root = 'test_sphinx_project'
    os.makedirs(os.path.join(project_root, 'source', 'downloads'), exist_ok=True)
    with open(os.path.join(project_root, 'source', 'index.rst'), 'w') as index_file:
        index_file.write("""
:download:`downloads/archive.zip`
:download:`/document/downloads/archive.zip`
:download:`../document/downloads/archive.zip`
""")
    with open(os.path.join(project_root, 'source', 'conf.py'), 'w') as conf_file:
        conf_file.write("project = 'Sphinx Duplicate File Issue Reproducer'\n")
    with open(os.path.join(project_root, 'source', 'downloads', 'archive.zip'), 'wb') as archive_file:
        archive_file.write(b'Fake ZIP content')

def build_sphinx_docs():
    project_root = 'test_sphinx_project'
    subprocess.run(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', os.path.join(project_root, 'source'), os.path.join(project_root, 'build')], check=True)

def check_for_duplicate_files():
    downloads_folder = os.path.join('test_sphinx_project', 'build', '_downloads')
    files = os.listdir(downloads_folder)
    expected_files = ['archive.zip']
    if not all(file in files for file in expected_files) or len(files) > len(expected_files):
        raise AssertionError(f"Duplicate files found in _downloads: {files}")

try:
    setup_project_structure()
    build_sphinx_docs()
    check_for_duplicate_files()
    print("Issue not present, exiting with code 0.")
    sys.exit(0)
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
```

This solution assumes:
- You have a basic Python environment configured.
- Sphinx is installed and `sphinx-build` command is available in your environment. You can install Sphinx via pip if it's not already installed: `pip install sphinx`.
- The script will exit with code 0 if the duplicating issue does not exist (i.e., only `archive.zip` is found within the `_downloads` directory), or it will raise an assertion error indicating the issue persists, followed by printing a stack trace.

Remember, depending on the setup of your environment and the Sphinx version in use, alterations might be necessary for this script to execute successfully.
