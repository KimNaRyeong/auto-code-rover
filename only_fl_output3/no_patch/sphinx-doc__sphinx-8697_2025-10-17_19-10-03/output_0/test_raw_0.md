To create a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` to reproduce the issue described, we would simulate the creation of a Sphinx project, define an `index.rst` file with multiple references to the same file using different paths, build the project, and then check if multiple copies of the same file are created in the `_downloads` directory.

Since the original issue is reported for an older version of Sphinx running on Python 2.7.3, and considering Python 2 is no longer supported, this script will use Python 3 syntax and assumes that you are running a modern version of Sphinx that is compatible with Python 3. 

Please note, this script doesn't precisely mimic the Sphinx internal process but simulates the creation and build process of a Sphinx project using Python script to identify if the described issue persists.

```python
import os
import shutil
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_project():
    if os.path.exists('test_project'):
        shutil.rmtree('test_project')
    os.makedirs('test_project/source/document/downloads', exist_ok=True)
    with open('test_project/source/index.rst', 'w') as f:
        f.write("""
:download:`downloads/archive.zip`
:download:`/document/downloads/archive.zip`
:download:`../document/downloads/archive.zip`
""")
    with open('test_project/source/conf.py', 'w') as f:
        f.write("project = 'Test Project'\n")
    with open('test_project/source/document/downloads/archive.zip', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(b'Test file content')

def build_sphinx_project():
    try:
        subprocess.check_call(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', 'test_project/source', 'test_project/build'])
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

def check_for_duplicate_files():
    downloads_path = 'test_project/build/_downloads'
    files = os.listdir(downloads_path)
    if not len(files) == 1:
        raise AssertionError(f"Expected 1 file, found {len(files)}: {files}")

def main():
    setup_sphinx_project()
    build_sphinx_project()
    try:
        check_for_duplicate_files()
        print("Issue not present, exiting with 0.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("Issue present, see stack trace above.")
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Before running this script:
- Ensure that Sphinx is installed in your Python environment. If not, install it using `pip install sphinx`.
- The script assumes Sphinx's `sphinx-build` command is available in your environment. Adjust the path to `sphinx-build` in the `build_sphinx_project` function if needed.

This script does the following:
- Sets up a minimal Sphinx project structure with an `index.rst` containing multiple references to the same `archive.zip` file.
- Builds the Sphinx project.
- Checks the `_downloads` directory for duplicate files.
- Uses the provided function to print the stack trace if an exception is caught.

This should help in diagnosing if the issue described (multiple files created for the same resource) still exists in the current Sphinx setup.
