        "content": "To gather sufficient context to support resolving the issue described, we'll need information about the `get_random_string` method and its usages across the codebase, particularly focusing on its default length value. Here are the API calls that would help in obtaining the required information:\n\n1. Search for the `get_random_string` method across the entire codebase to identify which file it is defined in:\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"get_random_string\")\n   ```\n\n2. Once we know the file in which `get_random_string` is defined, we need to inspect its implementation to understand how the default value for length is set. Assuming the method is found in a file named \"crypto.py\" (the actual name will be based on the result of the first call), we could then:\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_file(\"get_random_string\", \"crypto.py\")\n   ```\n\n3. Additionally, to understand the impact of changing the method's signature, it would be useful to find examples of calls to `get_random_string` without specifying the length. This would give us an idea of how widespread the use of the default length is and where changes will be needed:\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"get_random_string()\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls will provide an overview of the method's definition, its usage pattern, and the implications of removing the default length value."
