This function generates a random string using the defined length and character set, aiming for secure randomness suitable for cryptographic purposes.\n   \n   - **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**  \n     The core of the issue lies here: the function's signature includes a default length value (`length=12`). The issue seeks to deprecate this default value to encourage explicit length specification by the caller, promoting clearer code and potentially more secure practices depending on the use case.\n   \n   - **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**  \n     The intended behavior post-resolution is for the function to require an explicit `length` parameter, removing the default value of 12. This would entail modifying the function signature to `def get_random_string(length, allowed_chars='...')` and updating any calls to this function without a specified length.\n\n2. **Usage in `BasePasswordHasher`:**\n   - **What does this part of the code do?**  \n     In the `salt` method of the `BasePasswordHasher` class, `get_random_string` is used without specifying a length. This method generates a \"salt\" for password hashing, an essential part of securely storing passwords.\n   \n   - **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**  \n     This usage directly relates to the issue, as it exemplifies the practice of relying on the default length (`12`). Any modifications to `get_random_string` to remove the default length will require updating this call to specify a length explicitly.\n   \n   - **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**  \n     After the change, the call to `get_random_string` within `salt` must include an explicit length argument, e.g., `get_random_string(12)`, ensuring the call is clear about its requirements and remains functional post-changes.\n\nThe next steps in resolving the issue would involve altering the `get_random_string` function to remove its default length value and then identifying and updating all code references to include an explicit length. The single identified usage in `BasePasswordHasher.salt` is a clear starting point, but a comprehensive search for all instances would be necessary to ensure a complete and smooth transition."

The signature of `get_random_string` should change from `def get_random_string(length=12, ...)` to `def get_random_string(length, ...)`. This change will enforce more deliberate usage of the function, with callers required to specify the length of the string they wish to generate. Documentation/comments within the method should also be updated to remove references to the default value.\n\n   - **Location 2:**\n     - **File:** django/contrib/auth/hashers.py\n     - **Class:** BasePasswordHasher\n     - **Method:** salt\n     - **Intended Behavior:** Update the call to `get_random_string` to include an explicit `length` parameter, matching the change to its signature. For instance, change `get_random_string()` to `get_random_string(12)`, assuming that maintaining a 12-character salt preserves the existing functionality. This update ensures that the method remains functional after the change to `get_random_string`, reflecting the need for explicit length specification while preserving the security and functionality of the password hasher's salt generation. \n\nThese modifications will directly address the issue by deprecating the use of `get_random_string` without an explicit length, in line with the goal to encourage clearer and potentially more secure coding practices."
