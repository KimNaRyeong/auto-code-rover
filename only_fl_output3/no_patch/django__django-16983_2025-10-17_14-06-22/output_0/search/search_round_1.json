        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. ModelAdmin Class Analysis (from `django/contrib/admin/options.py`)\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n    The `ModelAdmin` class is a cornerstone of Django admin's customization, allowing developers to define various configurations for how models are represented within the Django admin interface. Attributes like `list_display`, `search_fields`, and methods for handling form and querysets customization are all defined here. Specifically, it does not explicitly mention `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical`, but since these are also configurations managed within `ModelAdmin`, they would be implemented in a similar manner.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug:** \n    The issue description implies that when using `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` with a `ManyToManyField` that specifies a 'through' model, unexpected behavior occurs. This relationship is crucial because any fix or system check would likely need to be implemented in the context of `ModelAdmin` where such configurations are processed, especially since system checks for admin configurations are often integrated here or in closely related modules.\n\n- **Intended behavior:** \n    Ideally, `ModelAdmin` or its validation mechanisms should issue warnings or errors when `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` are used improperly with `ManyToManyField` that specifies a 'through' model. This would prevent silent failures or the \"wasted half a day chasing this down\" scenario described in the issue.\n\n#### 2. ManyToManyField Method Analysis\n\n- The search for `ManyToManyField` in the context of models did not yield direct results within the provided instructions, suggesting a need for alternative search strategies. Considering `ManyToManyField` is a field definition on models, we could have searched more about its usage and limitations directly in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` or in the admin checks.\n\n#### 3. Analysis of `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` Code Snippets\n\n- **What do these parts of the code do?**\n    These code snippets, found primarily within `django/contrib/admin/checks.py` and `django/contrib/admin/options.py`, are likely involved in the rendering and validation of admin interfaces that use the `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` options.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug:**\n    The direct references in checks and options modules suggest these areas are where constraints or conditions on the proper use of `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` should be enforced. If the system currently lacks checks for the specific use case mentioned in the issue, this is where such logic could be introduced.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n    The system should perform thorough validations to ensure that configurations involving `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` are compatible with the specified model relations. If a `ManyToManyField` specifies a 'through' option, indicating a custom intermediary model, then the admin system should either reject such configurations with clear error messages or provide documentation and guidelines on how to handle such cases correctly.\n\n#### 4. Analysis of Methods Named \"check\"\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n    The `check` methods scattered across various Django components are part of Django's system checks framework. This framework is designed to catch common errors and misconfigurations, providing developers with early-warning mechanisms.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug:**\n    The issue likely pertains to a missing or inadequate system check related to `ModelAdmin` configurations. The references to `check` methods in modules like `django/contrib/admin/checks.py` are particularly relevant, as these are where admin-specific checks are implemented.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n    A new or updated system check should be introduced to specifically target the configuration scenario described in the issue. This check would validate that `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` are not used with `ManyToManyField` configurations that specify a custom 'through' model, ensuring this limitation is transparent to developers and addressed before runtime.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the analysis, we should explore how `check` methods in `django/contrib/admin/checks.py` are implemented to understand the framework for admin validation checks better. This will inform the implementation of a new check targeting the issue described. Moving forward, we could search more specifically in the `checks.py` file to understand how to extend or add a new check.\n\nFurthermore, since the search for `ManyToManyField` in the class models did not yield results, exploring the implementation of `ManyToManyField` and related validation in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` or reviewing system checks related to field configurations would be prudent."

If such a configuration is detected, the check should raise a warning or error, pointing out that these options are not compatible with `ManyToManyField(through=\"...\")`. This maintains existing functionality while adding a layer of validation to prevent misconfiguration.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:** \n  - **File:** `django/contrib/admin/options.py`\n  - **Class:** `ModelAdmin`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Though primarily the checks framework (`checks.py`) is where the validation logic belongs, documentation or inline comments within `ModelAdmin` regarding `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` might need updating. It should clearly document that using these with a `ManyToManyField` that specifies a 'through' model is not supported and will lead to errors. This is more about enhancing the developer experience and guidance rather than altering functionality.\n\nThe above locations and behavior adjustments will directly address the issue by preventing misconfiguration and improving developer guidance, without altering the existing, intended functionality of the Django admin and its configuration system."
