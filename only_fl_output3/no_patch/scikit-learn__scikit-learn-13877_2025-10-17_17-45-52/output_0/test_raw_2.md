Based on the given setup, I understand that you're looking for a tailored Python script named `reproducer.py` which demonstrates the issue with `pairwise_distances` returning incorrect results under specific conditions and utilizes the provided function to print an accurate stack trace if the expected results are not met. Below is an adjusted version of such a script tailored to reproduce the described issue with `pairwise_distances`.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_distance_results(metric, n_jobs_setting, expected_output):
    X = np.array([
        [1, 3],
        [2, 1],
        [3, 2]
    ])
    try:
        distances = pairwise_distances(X, metric=metric, n_jobs=n_jobs_setting)
        assert np.allclose(distances, expected_output, atol=1e-7), \
            f"pairwise_distances with metric='{metric}' and n_jobs={n_jobs_setting} returned unexpected results."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

def main():
    # Expected output for cosine similarity.
    expected_cosine = np.array([
        [0.0, 0.29289322, 0.21064778],
        [0.29289322, 0.0, 0.00772212],
        [0.21064778, 0.00772212, 0.0]
    ])

    # Expected output for euclidean distance.
    expected_euclidean = np.array([
        [0.0, 2.23606797749979, 2.23606797749979],
        [2.23606797749979, 0.0, 1.4142135623730951],
        [2.23606797749979, 1.4142135623730951, 0.0]
    ])

    # Check for cosine similarity, using n_jobs=-1.
    check_distance_results('cosine', -1, expected_cosine)

    # Check for euclidean distance, using n_jobs=-1.
    check_distance_results('euclidean', -1, expected_euclidean)

    print("All tests passed successfully!")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script:
- Defines a method `check_distance_results` to centralize the logic of testing the `pairwise_distances` function with provided `metric`, `n_jobs` settings, and an array of `expected_output`. It uses `np.allclose` to compare the function's output against the expected output within a tolerance level.
- Uses the `print_stacktrace` method to report an assertion error detailing line numbers and contexts if the test fails to meet expectations.
- Executes checks for both 'cosine' and 'euclidean' metrics using `n_jobs=-1` to validate the reported issue.
- Exits with code 0 (indicating no issues) if all tests pass, based on the assertion checks not failing.

This approach ensures that if there's a deviation from the expected output indicative of the reported issue, it's captured with a detailed error message and programmatic stack trace for debugging purposes.
