        "intended_behavior": "The method should correctly handle parallel computations, particularly for the `cosine` and `euclidean` metrics, ensuring that results are equivalent to when computed sequentially (`n_jobs=1`). This implies a review and potentially a fix in the way parallel jobs are dispatched and aggregated, especially ensuring that no data type coercion or precision errors turn floating-point distances into integers or create zero-filled matrices for cosine distances. The fix must ensure that the parallel execution path preserves the accuracy and format (e.g., floating-point numbers) of the distance computations, aligning with the results obtained through sequential processing."
