This script, `reproducer.py`, is designed to be executed from the root directory of a Sphinx project (or any directory as it changes its working directory to the script's directory). It automates the process of setting up a minimal Sphinx project with a broken link (with an anchor) in the documentation and then runs a link check to verify if the expected error message (a 404 Client Error) is included in the output. 

The assertion is made against the expected message when the issue is present, it should raise an `AssertionError`, signalling that the issue is indeed present. When the issue is fixed, the script should exit with code 0, indicating the absence of the issue.
