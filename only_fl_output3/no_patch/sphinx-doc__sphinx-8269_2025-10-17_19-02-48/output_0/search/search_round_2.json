        "content": "Analyzing the given context from the search results provides insights into the issue at hand and next steps for further investigation:\n\n### Analysis of `check_anchor` Method\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThe `check_anchor` function in `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` is responsible for examining HTML content from a response object to find a specified anchor. It does so by parsing the HTML content in chunks and looks for the anchor without needing to download the entire content upfront. If the anchor is found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, `False`.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug**\n\nThis method directly relates to the issue mentioned, as it is involved in the process of checking for anchors in URLs. The bug report suggests that regardless of the HTTP response status (e.g., 404, 500), if the anchor check fails, the output misleadingly reports the anchor as not found, irrespective of the fact that the real issue might be an HTTP error rather than the absence of the anchor.\n\n3. **Intended behavior**\n\nIdeally, this function should be part of a workflow where before checking for an anchor, the application determines whether the HTTP response indicates success (e.g., status 200). If the response is an error (e.g., 404 or 500), the check for the anchor should either be skipped, or the error status should take precedence in the reporting mechanism over whether the anchor could theoretically be found or not.\n\n### Context From `linkcheck_anchors` Search\n\nGiven the references to `linkcheck_anchors` found in `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` but without specific code snippets provided in the search result, we can infer a couple of points:\n\n- The implementation related to this configuration option is situated in the same file that houses the `check_anchor` method. This suggests that the handling of anchor checks and the decision-making process influenced by `linkcheck_anchors` configuration is centralized in this module.\n- Since the reported issue describes a discrepancy in the expected output triggered by the `linkcheck_anchors` configuration, it's likely that the logic for deciding when to report HTTP errors versus anchor not found errors might be inadequately handling or prioritizing these conditions.\n\n### Next Steps for Investigation\n\nGiven this analysis, further investigation should concentrate on:\n\n1. **How HTTP errors are handled** in relation to anchor checks. This involves:\n   - Examining the control flow around HTTP response handling and anchor checking to identify where the logic might incorrectly prioritize anchor not found errors over HTTP status codes.\n   - This could mean making API calls like `get_code_around_line(\"sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py\", 62, 10)` to understand the broader context of how `check_anchor` is used, and `search_code_in_file(\"linkcheck_anchors\", \"sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py\")` to get specific snippets where this configuration is applied.\n\n2. **Understanding the error reporting mechanism**:\n   - This requires inspecting the part of the code that formats and outputs the final error message based on the results of link checks, including HTTP status and anchor existence. This might not be directly apparent from the current information, suggesting the need to search for a method or code block responsible for generating or logging these error messages.\n   - Relevant API calls could include searching for functions related to logging or reporting within `linkcheck.py`, or broader searches for error message formatting related to link checks within the Sphinx codebase."

This might involve modifying the control flow in the calling context (rather than within `check_anchor` itself) to ensure that an HTTP error status leads to immediate reporting of the HTTP error, bypassing or annotating the anchor check result with this context.\n\n     Preserving existing functionality means ensuring that anchor checks still occur when the HTTP response is successful or when such behavior is explicitly desired despite HTTP errors, depending on the expanded requirements or configuration options.\n\n   - **Further Context Needed**:\n     The intended modifications suggest that we might need to adjust or extend the error reporting mechanism in `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py`, specifically in how it processes and prioritizes errors for output.

        "content": "### Analyzing the Additional Context\n\n#### Context 1: Code Around `check_anchor` Function\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThe provided code shows the definition of the `check_anchor` function, which checks for the presence of a specified anchor in the HTML content returned by a HTTP response. It uses `AnchorCheckParser`, a custom parser, to process the HTML content in chunks until it finds the anchor or exhausts the content. \n\nThe code before the `check_anchor` function defines `AnchorCheckParser`'s initialization and its method for handling start tags of HTML elements, specifically looking for IDs or names that match the desired anchor.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug**\n\nThis code is closely related to the bug since it is directly responsible for determining whether an anchor exists in a document. However, the bug is about how the outcome of this function is interpreted and reported, especially in the context of HTTP errors, which this snippet does not directly address.\n\n3. **Intended behavior**\n\nThe `check_anchor` function itself seems to behave as intended, correctly identifying whether an anchor exists in the HTML content. The intended behavior surrounding this issue would involve the code that calls `check_anchor`, where it should first check the HTTP response status before deciding whether to look for an anchor. If an HTTP error is present, that error should be reported, preferably, or it should influence how the result of `check_anchor` is reported.\n\n#### Context 2: References to `linkcheck_anchors` in `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThe references to `linkcheck_anchors` across different methods (`init`, `check_thread`, `setup`) in `linkcheck.py` suggest the configuration variable controls how link checking behaves, particularly whether the tool checks for anchors in URLs. The presence in `init` and `setup` indicates that the configuration is read and established when the link checker is initialized, while its use in `check_thread` implies it influences the actual checking process, potentially toggling the anchor checking feature on or off.\n\n2. **Relationship to the bug**\n\nThis is directly related to the bug since `linkcheck_anchors` is the configuration option that, when enabled, causes the reported issue. The decision to check anchors or not, and how that decision impacts error reporting, especially in cases of HTTP errors, is central to what needs fixing.\n\n3. **Intended behavior**\n\nThe intended behavior would ensure that enabling `linkcheck_anchors` does not obscure HTTP errors with anchor not found messages. This means ensuring that the link checking process first validates the HTTP response, reporting any encountered HTTP errors before attempting an anchor check, or clearly differentiating between HTTP errors and anchor-related errors in reports. The handling in `check_thread` and perhaps adjustments during the `setup` or `init` phases to accommodate this nuanced error reporting could be key.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on this analysis, the bug fix needs to address how `linkcheck_anchors` influences the error reporting mechanism to ensure HTTP errors are appropriately reported, which might involve modifying how `check_thread` and potentially other methods manage the order of checks and error reporting. This includes respecting HTTP response statuses before considering the results of the `check_anchor` function and adjusting the error messaging logic to account for these cases distinctly."

In cases of HTTP errors (e.g., status codes 400-599), the method should report these errors directly, bypassing the anchor check, or it should ensure the error message reflects the HTTP error even if the anchor check proceeds. This approach will address the primary concern of misreporting anchor not found, when the actual issue is an HTTP error. This requires implementing a check before the call to `check_anchor` that evaluates the response status code and adjusts the error handling and reporting logic accordingly.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File**: `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py`\n  - **Method**: Relevant error-reporting mechanism (Not explicitly identified in provided snippets)\n  - **Intended Behavior**: If not already in place, enhance or introduce a mechanism that can differentiate between \"anchor not found\" errors and other types of errors, such as HTTP errors. This involves adjusting the logic within or around the method that formats and outputs error messages for link checks. The adjustment should allow for clear communication about the nature of the problem (e.g., distinguishing between a missing anchor and a 404 Not Found HTTP response). If this differentiation is partially implemented, review and refine it to ensure clarity in reporting, particularly under conditions controlled by the `linkcheck_anchors` configuration.\n\nTogether, these modifications seek to preserve the functionality of the Sphinx `linkcheck` feature, while improving its robustness and the accuracy of its reporting, especially regarding missing anchors and HTTP errors."
