        "content": "To effectively gather context for resolving this issue, we'll need to focus on elements related to the `linkcheck` command, particularly how it handles checking of anchors and the reporting of HTTP error statuses versus anchor not found errors. Given the details in the issue, we'll need to explore how Sphinx implements link checking, especially when `linkcheck_anchors` is enabled, and how it decides what error message to output.\n\nFirst, let's explore the implementation of the `linkcheck` mechanism within Sphinx. Since this involves a specific command, there is likely to be a dedicated module or class handling link checking. We'll start by searching for classes or methods named similarly to `linkcheck` or involved with link checking configurations such as `linkcheck_anchors`.\n\nHere are the specific API calls we can start with:\n\n1. **Search for the class or module handling linkcheck**: To find the core implementation logic of the linkcheck command.\n   - `search_class(\"LinkCheckBuilder\")`\n   - This is a speculative class name based on Sphinx's naming conventions and documentation. The actual class name might differ.\n\n2. **Search for methods related to the configuration of link check**:\n   - `search_method(\"check_anchor\")`\n   - This method name is speculative, assuming there's a method specifically for checking anchors in URLs during link checks.\n\n3. **Search code related to handling HTTP errors vs. anchor not found**:\n   - `search_code(\"linkcheck_anchors\")`\n   - We're specifically interested in how this configuration is used to control error reporting.\n\nThese initial calls should give us a better understanding of where and how Sphinx handles link checking, particularly the differences in behavior based on the `linkcheck_anchors` setting and how it processes HTTP errors and anchor availability."
