        "intended_behavior": "Modify the method to ensure it first checks the HTTP status code of each response before attempting to validate anchors with `check_anchor`. In cases of HTTP errors (e.g., status codes 400-599), the method should report these errors directly, bypassing the anchor check, or it should ensure the error message reflects the HTTP error even if the anchor check proceeds. This approach will address the primary concern of misreporting anchor not found, when the actual issue is an HTTP error. This requires implementing a check before the call to `check_anchor` that evaluates the response status code and adjusts the error handling and reporting logic accordingly."

        "intended_behavior": "If not already in place, enhance or introduce a mechanism that can differentiate between \"anchor not found\" errors and other types of errors, such as HTTP errors. This involves adjusting the logic within or around the method that formats and outputs error messages for link checks. The adjustment should allow for clear communication about the nature of the problem (e.g., distinguishing between a missing anchor and a 404 Not Found HTTP response). If this differentiation is partially implemented, review and refine it to ensure clarity in reporting, particularly under conditions controlled by the `linkcheck_anchors` configuration."
