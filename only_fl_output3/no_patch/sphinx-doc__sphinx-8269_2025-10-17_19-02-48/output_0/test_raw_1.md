Given the information that `sphinx-quickstart` was not found, it suggests that Sphinx might not be correctly installed in your Python environment or Sphinx's executable path is not in your system's PATH environment variable. Before proceeding with the standalone Python script to reproduce the issue, ensure Sphinx is installed in your environment and the Sphinx binaries are accessible from your system's PATH. You can install Sphinx using pip (`pip install sphinx`) if you haven't already.

Considering the error encountered and the requirements for the script, let's attempt a different approach that programmatically creates the Sphinx project without relying on the `sphinx-quickstart` command-line tool. This script will directly generate necessary Sphinx project files, thereby bypassing the need for `sphinx-quickstart`.

Please replace the `setup_sphinx_project` function in the previous script with the following code snippet, which manually sets up the project structure and configuration files typically created by `sphinx-quickstart`.

```python
def manual_setup_sphinx_project():
    """
    Manually create the basic Sphinx project structure and files usually done by sphinx-quickstart.
    """
    os.makedirs("source/_static", exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs("source/_templates", exist_ok=True)
    with open("source/conf.py", "w") as conf_file:
        conf_contents = """
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))

project = 'proj'
author = 'me'
release = '1.0'

extensions = []

templates_path = ['_templates']
exclude_patterns = []

html_theme = 'alabaster'
html_static_path = ['_static']

linkcheck_anchors = True
        """.strip()
        conf_file.write(conf_contents)
    with open("source/index.rst", "w") as index_file:
        index_contents = """

        """.strip()
        index_file.write(index_contents)
    with open("Makefile", "w") as makefile:
        makefile_contents = """
.PHONY: help Makefile

# "make mode" option. $(O) is meant as a shortcut for $(SPHINXOPTS).
%: Makefile
\t@sphinx-build -M $@ "source" "build" $(O)

        """.strip()
        makefile.write(makefile_contents)
```

Please use this `manual_setup_sphinx_project` function instead of `setup_sphinx_project` and follow the script as previously provided. Ensure to replace the function call `setup_sphinx_project()` with `manual_setup_sphinx_project()`.

This change aims to sidestep potential issues related to environment setup or external command dependencies and strictly focuses on the issue described with Sphinx's linkcheck.
