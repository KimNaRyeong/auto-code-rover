Specifically, we're interested in the implementation of the `Idx` class, including its constructor (`__new__` method) and perhaps any method that is directly involved in bounds checking. \n\nTo get the necessary context, the following search API calls will be useful:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Idx\")`: This will help us find where the `Idx` class is defined in the Sympy codebase.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__new__\", \"Idx\")`: This will give us details on the constructor of the `Idx` class, which is likely where the bounds are set and where the validation should occur.\n3. `search_code(\"Idx object requires an integer dimension\")`: This search is aimed at finding where the specific error message is raised, providing context on the existing validations for single bounds. It will help us understand how and where to apply a similar validation for tuple bounds."
