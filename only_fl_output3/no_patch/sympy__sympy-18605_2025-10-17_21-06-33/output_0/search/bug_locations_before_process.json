        "intended_behavior": "The `__new__` method should enforce that both the upper and lower bounds of a range tuple are either integers or accepted symbolic infinities (`S.Infinity`, `S.NegativeInfinity`) when initializing an `Idx` object. Although the current implementation attempts to ensure this by iterating through the bounds in the case of a sequence, the reported issue indicates a scenario where `m, n` as symbols that are real but not strictly integers pass through without error. The intended behavior should include a more stringent check that accurately handles SymPy symbols designated as real numbers, ensuring they are treated as integers for the purpose of bound definition. This may necessitate refining the condition at lines 661-662, either by incorporating additional checks specific to SymPy symbols that are considered real but not explicitly integers or by modifying the logic to more accurately capture the constraints intended for index bounds."
