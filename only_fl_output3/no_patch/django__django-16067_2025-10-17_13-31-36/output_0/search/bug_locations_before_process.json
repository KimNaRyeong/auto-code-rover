The intended behavior should allow these values to be validated correctly without raising a `ValidationError` while preserving the existing functionality for all other types of decimal input."

        "intended_behavior": "Within this method, ensure that decimal values in scientific notation, when applicable, are either normalized before validation or validated in a way that recognizes them as equivalent to their decimal form counterparts. The validation logic should account for and properly validate decimal numbers in scientific notation, aligning with the `max_digits` and `decimal_places` requirements, without improperly raising a `ValidationError`. This approach should maintain the validator's intended functionality across all valid decimal formats."
