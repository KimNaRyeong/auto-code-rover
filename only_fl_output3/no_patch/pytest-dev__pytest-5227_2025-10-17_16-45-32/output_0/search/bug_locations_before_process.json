        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` from \"%(filename)-25s %(lineno)4d %(levelname)-8s %(message)s\" to include the module name (`name`) and possibly adjust to incorporate relative paths or the environment variable as suggested. A proposed new format could be \"%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s\". This format aligns with the issue suggestion, emphasizing debug level, module name, filename, line number, and message, which enhances log message details without introducing verbosity. Additionally, evaluate methods to incorporate the suggestion of using relative paths, possibly by customization around the `filename` resolution within the logging setup or by a utility function if necessary, ensuring that excessive length or complexity doesn't detract from log readability."

Ensure the test checks that the log message is formatted as expected, paying attention to the new details introduced by the change."
