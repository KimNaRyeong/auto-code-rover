        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the threshold for deciding when to use `math.sqrt` (`_sqrt` in the code) for calculating the square root needs to be adjusted. The current threshold is set too high, leading to precision errors for large numbers slightly smaller or around the current threshold.\n\nBased on the issue analysis, the threshold should not exceed `2**52 + 2**27` to remain within the safe bounds of floating-point arithmetic in IEEE 754 binary64 format. This change will ensure that `math.sqrt` is used only when its result can be accurately represented as an integer in Python, eliminating the off-by-one errors highlighted in the issue.\n\nFurther, to improve the robustness of the function and safeguard against potential inaccuracies in floating-point to integer conversion (or in the event that `math.sqrt` does not provide a correctly-rounded result due to platform-specific implementations), the function should include a validation step. After computing the square root and converting it to an integer, the function should verify that squaring this integer result does not exceed the original input `n`. If this validation fails, the function could then decrement the result by 1 to ensure it fulfills the contract of being the largest integer less than or equal to the true square root of `n`.\n\nThe intended behavior is to fine-tune the threshold for the decision-making process between using a fast floating-point operation versus a more precise integer-based calculation. Plus, adding a verification step ensures the correctness of the result across all platforms and input sizes, with minimal performance impact for the range of numbers where floating-point arithmetic is still reliable. This adjustment will make the `isqrt` function robust against rounding issues inherent in floating-point arithmetic while preserving its existing functionality for smaller input values."
