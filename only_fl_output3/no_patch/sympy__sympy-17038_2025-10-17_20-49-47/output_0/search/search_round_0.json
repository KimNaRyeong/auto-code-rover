        "content": "<issue>isqrt gives incorrect results\nThe `isqrt` function in `sympy.core.power` gives incorrect results for some inputs. For example:\n```\n>>> from sympy.core.power import isqrt\n>>> n = 4503599761588224\n>>> s = isqrt(n)\n>>> s  # correct result is 67108864\n67108865\n>>> s**2 <= n  # expect True\nFalse\n```\nor\n```\n>>> isqrt(9999999999999999)  # should be 99999999\n100000000\n```\nVersions: Python 3.7.3, SymPy 1.4, macOS 10.14.5\n## Analysis\nFor small values of `n`, the [current implementation](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/3febfc43ca0aa23d916ef06057e8c6d396a955e7/sympy/core/power.py#L23-L27) uses `math.sqrt` (aliased to `_sqrt`):\n```\nif n < 17984395633462800708566937239552:\nreturn int(_sqrt(n))\n```\nThe main problem is that the bound used for `n` here is much too large, at almost `2**104`.\n*If* (and it's quite a big if) we can assume that Python floats are IEEE 754 binary64 format _and_ that `math.sqrt` supplies a correctly-rounded (using round-ties-to-even) square root function, then the largest bound that can safely be used here is `4503599761588224`, or `2**52 + 2**27`.\nIf we can assume IEEE 754 binary64 `float`s but can't assume a correctly-rounded `math.sqrt`, then `int(_sqrt(n + 0.5))` is still safe for smallish `n`, where the definition of \"smallish\" depends on how accurate `math.sqrt` is. For example, if `_sqrt(n)` is known to be accurate to within 2 ulps, then it's possible to show that `int(_sqrt(n + 0.5))` is safe for `n < 2**50`. (The `+0.5` is necessary here: `int(_sqrt(n))` wouldn't be safe even for tiny `n`, since e.g. if the result of `_sqrt(25)` is off by a single ulp downwards, `int(_sqrt(25))` would produce `4` instead of `5`.)\nWhether `math.sqrt` is correctly rounded or not will depend on the platform: Python's `math.sqrt` just wraps the `sqrt` function from C's math library. On modern x64 hardware, one would expect and hope that C's `sqrt` gets mapped to the appropriate SSE2 instruction, in which case it'll be correctly rounded. But on ARM there may well not be a hardware sqrt instruction to map to, and a hand-implemented libm sqrt could easily be incorrectly rounded for some inputs.\nIn the unlikely (but possible) case of non-IEEE 754 binary64 `float`s, it's probably safer to avoid using `math.sqrt` at all. But this case is likely to be exceedingly rare, and doesn't seem worth worrying about in practice.\nI guess one option for fixing this while retaining performance for small `n` would be to continue to use the `int(_sqrt(n))` code, but then to check the result is correct before returning it, falling back to the slow integer-only path if that check doesn't pass.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue with the `isqrt` function in `sympy.core.power`, we need to gather more context on how it's currently implemented and what might be affecting its accuracy for large numbers. Here's a plan for the API calls:\n\n1. Since the issue is with the `isqrt` function, let's start by searching for its implementation to understand how it's currently working. We will need to see the full context of the function including any conditional logic that could lead to inaccuracies for large inputs.\n   \n2. The analysis mentions a specific behavior for large values of `n` and provides a snippet of code that hints at a possible conditional check based on the value of `n`. Finding this code snippet and its surrounding context can give us insight into how the decision is made to use `math.sqrt`.\n\n3. Given the analysis talks about the bounds for safely using `math.sqrt` and the potential for checking results and falling back to another method if inaccuracies are detected, we'll want to see all code related to these conditions and fallbacks, if they exist.\n\nBased on the above, the API calls would be:\n\n1. `search_method(\"isqrt\")` - To find where the `isqrt` function is implemented in the entire codebase.\n2. `search_code(\"if n < 17984395633462800708566937239552:\")` - Since the issue description mentions this specific line of code, finding it will help us understand the conditions under which `math.sqrt` (aliased as `_sqrt`) is used."
