        "content": "<issue>isqrt gives incorrect results\nThe `isqrt` function in `sympy.core.power` gives incorrect results for some inputs. For example:\n```\n>>> from sympy.core.power import isqrt\n>>> n = 4503599761588224\n>>> s = isqrt(n)\n>>> s  # correct result is 67108864\n67108865\n>>> s**2 <= n  # expect True\nFalse\n```\nor\n```\n>>> isqrt(9999999999999999)  # should be 99999999\n100000000\n```\nVersions: Python 3.7.3, SymPy 1.4, macOS 10.14.5\n## Analysis\nFor small values of `n`, the [current implementation](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/3febfc43ca0aa23d916ef06057e8c6d396a955e7/sympy/core/power.py#L23-L27) uses `math.sqrt` (aliased to `_sqrt`):\n```\nif n < 17984395633462800708566937239552:\nreturn int(_sqrt(n))\n```\nThe main problem is that the bound used for `n` here is much too large, at almost `2**104`.\n*If* (and it's quite a big if) we can assume that Python floats are IEEE 754 binary64 format _and_ that `math.sqrt` supplies a correctly-rounded (using round-ties-to-even) square root function, then the largest bound that can safely be used here is `4503599761588224`, or `2**52 + 2**27`.\nIf we can assume IEEE 754 binary64 `float`s but can't assume a correctly-rounded `math.sqrt`, then `int(_sqrt(n + 0.5))` is still safe for smallish `n`, where the definition of \"smallish\" depends on how accurate `math.sqrt` is. For example, if `_sqrt(n)` is known to be accurate to within 2 ulps, then it's possible to show that `int(_sqrt(n + 0.5))` is safe for `n < 2**50`. (The `+0.5` is necessary here: `int(_sqrt(n))` wouldn't be safe even for tiny `n`, since e.g. if the result of `_sqrt(25)` is off by a single ulp downwards, `int(_sqrt(25))` would produce `4` instead of `5`.)\nWhether `math.sqrt` is correctly rounded or not will depend on the platform: Python's `math.sqrt` just wraps the `sqrt` function from C's math library. On modern x64 hardware, one would expect and hope that C's `sqrt` gets mapped to the appropriate SSE2 instruction, in which case it'll be correctly rounded. But on ARM there may well not be a hardware sqrt instruction to map to, and a hand-implemented libm sqrt could easily be incorrectly rounded for some inputs.\nIn the unlikely (but possible) case of non-IEEE 754 binary64 `float`s, it's probably safer to avoid using `math.sqrt` at all. But this case is likely to be exceedingly rare, and doesn't seem worth worrying about in practice.\nI guess one option for fixing this while retaining performance for small `n` would be to continue to use the `int(_sqrt(n))` code, but then to check the result is correct before returning it, falling back to the slow integer-only path if that check doesn't pass.\n</issue>"

        "content": "The collected context from the `isqrt` function in `sympy/core/power.py` provides us with valuable insights into the problem and its potential resolutions. Here's the analysis based on the questions outlined:\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `isqrt` function aims to return the largest integer less than or equal to the square root (`sqrt`) of a given number `n`. The implementation uses two distinct approaches based on the size of `n`:\n- For `n` smaller than a specific threshold (`17984395633462800708566937239552`), it uses the `math.sqrt` function (referred to as `_sqrt` in the code), converts the floating-point result to an integer, and returns it.\n- For `n` equal to or greater than this threshold, it falls back to a possibly slower, but more accurate, integer-based method to compute the square root, ensuring correctness for large numbers.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue arises in the domain where the function decides to use the floating-point `math.sqrt` function for calculating the square root. Since floating-point operations have limited precision, using `math.sqrt` and then converting the result to an integer can lead to inaccuracies for certain numbers. This is particularly true for very large integers, where the precision of the floating-point representation is insufficient to accurately represent the square root. The provided examples in the issue (`n = 4503599761588224` and `n = 9999999999999999`) fall into the category where `math.sqrt` is used, and due to precision limits, the computed integer square root is off by 1 from the true value.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior of the code is to always return the largest integer less than or equal to the true square root of `n`. Regardless of the method used (`math.sqrt` for floating-point computation or a precise integer-based method), the output should be correct and accurate even at the edges of the range where floating-point precision becomes an issue.\n\nBased on the issue description and analysis, a potential fix involves adjusting the threshold value for deciding which calculation method to use, ensuring the `math.sqrt` approach is only applied when the result can be accurately represented and converted to an integer. Additionally, incorporating a result check or a more conservative threshold could mitigate inaccuracies caused by floating-point limitations."

The current threshold is set too high, leading to precision errors for large numbers slightly smaller or around the current threshold.\n   \n   Based on the issue analysis, the threshold should not exceed `2**52 + 2**27` to remain within the safe bounds of floating-point arithmetic in IEEE 754 binary64 format. This change will ensure that `math.sqrt` is used only when its result can be accurately represented as an integer in Python, eliminating the off-by-one errors highlighted in the issue.\n   \n   Further, to improve the robustness of the function and safeguard against potential inaccuracies in floating-point to integer conversion (or in the event that `math.sqrt` does not provide a correctly-rounded result due to platform-specific implementations), the function should include a validation step. After computing the square root and converting it to an integer, the function should verify that squaring this integer result does not exceed the original input `n`. If this validation fails, the function could then decrement the result by 1 to ensure it fulfills the contract of being the largest integer less than or equal to the true square root of `n`.\n   \n   The intended behavior is to fine-tune the threshold for the decision-making process between using a fast floating-point operation versus a more precise integer-based calculation. Plus, adding a verification step ensures the correctness of the result across all platforms and input sizes, with minimal performance impact for the range of numbers where floating-point arithmetic is still reliable. This adjustment will make the `isqrt` function robust against rounding issues inherent in floating-point arithmetic while preserving its existing functionality for smaller input values."
