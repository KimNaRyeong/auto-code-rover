        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context specifically around the usage of float values in the `contrib/gis/templates/gis/admin/openlayers.js` file within the GeoDjango's JavaScript template. This involves examining how float values are handled and identifying the points where the Django template filter `|safe` should be applied to prevent DECIMAL_SEPARATOR from altering the JavaScript syntax.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls will be necessary to gather sufficient context:\n\n1. **Search for Code Snippet in File:** Since the issue mentions a problem with float values and the potential need to use the `|safe` filter, it's critical to locate where float values are outputted within the JavaScript file.\n   ```python\n   search_code_in_file(\"{{\", \"contrib/gis/templates/gis/admin/openlayers.js\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Get Code Around Line:** If the previous query identifies specific lines where float values are handled, we will need to assess the surrounding code to understand how these values are integrated into the JavaScript. Let's reserve this call until we know which line numbers to focus on, based on results from the first call.\n\nThese steps will help us pinpoint where changes need to be made in the `openlayers.js` file to ensure that float values do not cause syntax errors due to the DECIMAL_SEPARATOR setting."
