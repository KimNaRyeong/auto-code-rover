        "content": "The gathered information reveals valuable insights into the root cause of the issue and provides direction for further investigation. Let's analyze the collected context:\n\n### Analysis of Results\n\n1. **RootOf Class in sympy/polys/rootoftools.py**:\n   - This result shows the file and class where `RootOf` is defined. It provides the starting point for understanding how `RootOf` objects are created.\n   - **Relation to Bug**: Since the issue is directly related to the `RootOf` class, this file likely contains relevant code that needs to be examined to understand why the generator gets ignored.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Ideally, `RootOf` should correctly handle the expression with its generator, even after substitutions. It needs to accurately reflect the generator being used in its definition, especially when the generator changes the domain (e.g., from `x` to `tan(x)`).\n\n2. **Search for Method \"RootOf\"**:\n   - The absence of results indicates that there might not be a specific method named `RootOf`. This suggests that `RootOf` might be a constructor or a special method in Python, typically `__new__` in the defined class.\n   - **Relation to Bug & Intended Behavior**: Understanding how `__new__` or similar special methods handle the input arguments for `RootOf` could expose why the generator like `tan(x)` gets ignored in certain cases.\n\n3. **Search Code for Instances of `RootOf` Usage**:\n   - Not finding instances of `RootOf` usage directly in the provided form suggests that these examples might be too specific or that the instantiation of `RootOf` in these manners is handled dynamically, possibly within methods that process expressions before creating `RootOf` objects.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: The processing of expressions should preserve and reflect changes to the generator even after substitutions or transformations are applied.\n\n4. **Occurrences of `poly.gen`**:\n   - The presence of `poly.gen` in several files, especially within `rootoftools.py`, `polytools.py`, and solver-related modules, indicates the areas of the codebase that deal with polynomial generators.\n   - **Relation to Bug**: These snippets likely involve accessing or evaluating the generator of a polynomial. The bug might be related to how these segments of code interpret or use the generator, especially after a transformation like substitution.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Any use of `poly.gen` should accurately reflect the current generator of the polynomial, even after manipulations such as substitutions. This would ensure that expressions like `RootOf` correctly identify and work with the intended generator.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven this analysis, further action should delve deeper into how `RootOf` objects process and store their generator, particularly how substitutions affect the generator. The absence of specific examples in the search results for `RootOf` instantiations and the fact that `poly.gen` is widely used across different files suggest that a more detailed examination of the following is required:\n\n- **Constructor or Special Methods of `RootOf` in `rootoftools.py`**: Specifically, how the constructor handles the generator in different contexts, and whether it checks or transforms the input in a way that could ignore the change in generators.\n- **Usage of `poly.gen` in `rootoftools.py` and `polytools.py`**: Understanding how these sections access and modify the generator could provide insight into potential mismanagement or oversight of generator changes due to substitutions.\n\nTo proceed, it would be apt to explore the implementation details of `RootOf` within `rootoftools.py`, focusing on how the constructor and related methods manage generators. Additionally, inspecting how `poly.gen` is used in the context of `RootOf` would be crucial.\n\n**Next API Calls**:\n- search_method_in_file(\"__new__\", \"sympy/polys/rootoftools.py\"): To examine the constructor of `RootOf`.\n- search_code_in_file(\"poly.gen\", \"sympy/polys/rootoftools.py\"): To understand how `RootOf` handles its polynomial generator within its primary implementation file."

This would include verifying not just the polynomial's coefficients but also its variable (generator) to truly match the user's intent. The modification would require careful handling to maintain the existing functionality for cases where the generator has not been altered, thus preserving backward compatibility while fixing the issue where substitutions might ignore the new generator.\n\n**Rationale**:\n- The `__new__` method is the point of instantiation for `RootOf` objects, making it a crucial location for ensuring the correct handling of the generator, especially when it has been changed through substitution. The reported bug directly relates to this process, indicating a need to better manage or recognize changes to the polynomial's variable.\n- The intended behavior reflects a thorough approach to addressing the issue without disrupting the existing functionalities of the `RootOf` class. It takes into account the necessity to support a wide range of polynomial expressions while ensuring that transformations such as substitutions are accurately realized in the resulting `RootOf` objects. Maintaining the accuracy of the generator's representation is essential for correct symbolic computation and would thus resolve the reported issue."
