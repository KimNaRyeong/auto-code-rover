Additionally, understanding the handling of expressions when substituted might reveal why the generator gets ignored in certain cases. Let's perform the following search API calls:\n\n- search_class(\"RootOf\"): To locate the class definition and relevant files.\n- search_method(\"RootOf\"): To find implementations or usages of `RootOf` constructor across the codebase.\n- search_code(\"RootOf(x**3+x-1,0)\"): To find instances of `RootOf` usage with a simple polynomial to see how it's typically handled.\n- search_code(\"RootOf((x**3+x-1).subs(x,tan(x)),0)\"): To find instances where a substitution is applied before passing to `RootOf`, which might illuminate how the substitution's effect is managed or ignored.\n- search_code(\"poly.gen\"): To see how the generator of a polynomial is accessed and possibly modified."
