        "intended_behavior": "The constructor (`__new__` method) in the `RootOf` class should be enhanced to detect the usage of a new generator due to a substitution or transformation (e.g., from `x` to `tan(x)`) and ensure that this new generator is correctly identified and stored. This would include verifying not just the polynomial's coefficients but also its variable (generator) to truly match the user's intent. The modification would require careful handling to maintain the existing functionality for cases where the generator has not been altered, thus preserving backward compatibility while fixing the issue where substitutions might ignore the new generator."
