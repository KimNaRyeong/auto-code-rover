        "content": "To address the issue described, we need context around how `pytest` generates and reports the paths for skipped tests. The issue suggests a problem with the way relative paths are handled or reported, especially when the path of the tested file is outside the initially called directory. Given this information, the focus should be on finding the part of the code responsible for generating the skip report or determining the file path to display in the report.\n\nThe following API calls seem essential to finding the right context:\n\n1. **Search for classes and methods related to the generation of test reports**: It's likely that a class or method exists specifically for handling the formatting and output of test reports, including skipped tests. \n   - `search_class(\"Report\")`\n   - `search_method(\"generate_report\")`\n   - `search_method(\"format_skipped\")`\n\n2. **Search for code that handles paths in the context of test execution**: Since the issue is with how paths are displayed, it's crucial to find where in the code paths are processed or modified.\n   - `search_method(\"relpath\")`\n   - `search_code(\"path of tested file\")`\n   - `search_code(\"SKIPPED\")`\n\n3. **Investigate file handling during test collection or execution**: The issue might also be related to how pytest collects tests and represents their locations internally, which might affect how paths are displayed.\n   - `search_method(\"collect_tests\")`\n   - `search_method(\"execute_test\")`\n\n4. **Direct assessment of how paths are displayed in skip reports**: To understand exactly how the paths are handled in skip reports, directly searching for related snippets could be useful.\n   - `search_code(\"SKIPPED\")`\n\nGiven the nature of the issue, these searches should provide a good starting point to understand how `pytest` is handling paths in the skip reports and where the disconnect occurs when dealing with files outside the invocation directory."
