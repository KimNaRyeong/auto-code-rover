        "intended_behavior": "The parse_expr function should include enhanced capability to recognize and convert Greek letters (and potentially other special symbols) into corresponding SymPy symbols. This might involve adjusting or adding to the standard_transformations to specifically address Greek letters or leveraging the local_dict or global_dict parameters more effectively to map these characters to their symbolic names (e.g., mapping \"\u03b1\" to Symbol(\"alpha\")). This enhancement should not alter the function's ability to parse and evaluate other expressions as currently implemented."

        "intended_behavior": "Potentially, the suite of standard_transformations within this file needs to be extended or modified to ensure Greek letters and similar special characters are parsed correctly by parse_expr. This could mean either introducing new transformation functions dedicated to handling such scenarios or modifying existing ones to better detect and transform these specific characters without disrupting the accurate parsing of other mathematical expressions and symbols. The goal would be to retain existing functionality while expanding the parsing capabilities to include comprehensive support for Greek letters and similar symbols in string expressions. This approach should ensure that when a user tries to sympify an expression containing Greek letters, the process seamlessly translates these characters into their corresponding symbolic representations in SymPy, enhancing both utility and user experience."
