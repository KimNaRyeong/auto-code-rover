Until such\n245     autosimplification is no longer done, the ``kernS`` function might be of\n246     some use. In the example below you can see how an expression reduces to\n247     -1 by autosimplification, but does not do so when ``kernS`` is used.\n248 \n249     >>> from sympy.core.sympify import kernS\n250     >>> from sympy.abc import x\n251     >>> -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n252     -1\n253     >>> s = '-2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1'\n254     >>> sympify(s)\n255     -1\n256     >>> kernS(s)\n257     -2*(-(-x + 1/x)/(x*(x - 1/x)**2) - 1/(x*(x - 1/x))) - 1\n258 \n259     \"\"\"\n260     if evaluate is None:\n261         if global_evaluate[0] is False:\n262             evaluate = global_evaluate[0]\n263         else:\n264             evaluate = True\n265     try:\n266         if a in sympy_classes:\n267             return a\n268     except TypeError: # Type of a is unhashable\n269         pass\n270     try:\n271         cls = a.__class__\n272     except AttributeError:  # a is probably an old-style class object\n273         cls = type(a)\n274     if cls in sympy_classes:\n275         return a\n276     if cls is type(None):\n277         if strict:\n278             raise SympifyError(a)\n279         else:\n280             return a\n281 \n282     # Support for basic numpy datatypes\n283     # Note that this check exists to avoid importing NumPy when not necessary\n284     if type(a).__module__ == 'numpy':\n285         import numpy as np\n286         if np.isscalar(a):\n287             return _convert_numpy_types(a)\n288 \n289     try:\n290         return converter[cls](a)\n291     except KeyError:\n292         for superclass in getmro(cls):\n293             try:\n294                 return converter[superclass](a)\n295             except KeyError:\n296                 continue\n297 \n298     if isinstance(a, CantSympify):\n299         raise SympifyError(a)\n300 \n301     try:\n302         return a._sympy_()\n303     except AttributeError:\n304         pass\n305 \n306     if not strict:\n307         # Put numpy array conversion _before_ float/int, see\n308         # <https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/13924>.\n309         try:\n310             from ..tensor.array import Array\n311             return Array(a.flat, a.shape)  # works with e.g. NumPy arrays\n312         except AttributeError:\n313             pass\n314 \n315     if not isinstance(a, string_types):\n316         for coerce in (float, int):\n317             try:\n318                 return sympify(coerce(a))\n319             except (TypeError, ValueError, AttributeError, SympifyError):\n320                 continue\n321 \n322     if strict:\n323         raise SympifyError(a)\n324 \n325     if iterable(a):\n326         try:\n327             return type(a)([sympify(x, locals=locals, convert_xor=convert_xor,\n328                 rational=rational) for x in a])\n329         except TypeError:\n330             # Not all iterables are rebuildable with their type.\n331             pass\n332     if isinstance(a, dict):\n333         try:\n334             return type(a)([sympify(x, locals=locals, convert_xor=convert_xor,\n335                 rational=rational) for x in a.items()])\n336         except TypeError:\n337             # Not all iterables are rebuildable with their type.\n338             pass\n339 \n340     # At this point we were given an arbitrary expression\n341     # which does not inherit from Basic and doesn't implement\n342     # _sympy_ (which is a canonical and robust way to convert\n343     # anything to SymPy expression).\n344     #\n345     # As a last chance, we try to take \"a\"'s normal form via unicode()\n346     # and try to parse it.

According to the information obtained from `sympy/core/sympify.py`, this conversion process encompasses a broad range of data types and is capable of handling strings that represent mathematical expressions. \n\nKey aspects highlighted in `sympify` include:\n- Evaluation control via the `evaluate` parameter, where expressions can be prevented from being automatically simplified.\n- The use of evaluation globals and locals to control the interpretation of symbols in the expression.\n- Conversion of strings into symbolic expressions using an AST transformation, followed by parsing with `parse_expr`.\n\n### 2. Relationship to the Bug\n\nThe bug with `sympify(u\"\u03b1\")` not parsing Greek letters correctly appears to stem from the way `sympify` processes strings and how it interfaces with the parsing mechanism. Specifically, the issue occurs in the last resort of string processing, where `sympify` attempts to convert the expression using `unicode()` and then parse it with `parse_expr` using transformations. This step involves handling Greek letters or other symbols that may not be directly recognized by the standard transformations or the parser.\n\n### 3. Intended Behavior and Issue Relation\n\nConsidering the issue description, the intended behavior of `sympify` should be to recognize Greek letters as valid symbolic inputs, converting them properly into corresponding symbolic objects (e.g., converting the Unicode character \"\u03b1\" into a SymPy Symbol object representing the Greek letter alpha). This conversion should work seamlessly for strings, especially given that SymPy allows Greek letters as valid symbol names and prints them as such.\n\nThe failure to parse `\"\u03b1\"` suggests a shortcoming in either:\n- The parsing transformations and their ability to recognize and correctly interpret Greek letters as symbol names.\n- The interaction between the encoding of strings (Unicode) and how these are handled or interpreted by `parse_expr` and its subsequent processing steps.\n\nThe inability to find the `ast_parser.py` file and specifics regarding `parse_expr` does somewhat limit the analysis. However, it's indicative that looking closer into how `parse_expr` works, and especially into how special transformations or recognition of Greek letters and similar characters are managed, could be a productive avenue for resolving this bug.\n\nTo proceed, it would be essential to investigate further into `parse_expr` functionalities, particularly the transformations applied during parsing. Since `parse_expr` from `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` likely plays a critical role here, inspecting its implementation could offer insights into why the Greek letter failed to be parsed. Given the mistake in the file path referenced in the issue (`ast_parser.py` does not seem to exist; rather, the relevant code is likely in `sympy_parser.py`), reorienting the search to locate and understand `parse_expr` within this correct file context might provide the needed clues to crafting a solution."

To resolve the issue, ensure that the parsing logic (especially when handling unicode strings like `\"\u03b1\"`) includes transformation rules or parsing configurations that can map Greek letters to their symbolic equivalents in SymPy. This may involve adjusting or extending the `standard_transformations` in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` or ensuring that `parse_expr` (used within `sympify`) has access to a context or mechanism to treat Greek letters as symbols by default. The existing functionality, which includes safely evaluating expressions and converting various data types to SymPy objects, must be preserved while extending support for Greek letters.\n\nThe resolution approach involves ensuring `sympify` (and by extension, `parse_expr`) properly interprets Greek letters within the provided string expressions, mapping them correctly to their symbolic representations within the SymPy framework without altering the existing evaluation logic or the secure handling of input expressions."

Functionality of `parse_expr`\n\n`parse_expr` converts a string `s` into a SymPy expression, utilizing local and global dictionaries for the context of variable names and a set of transformations to modify the parsed expression tokens before evaluation. The flexibility of `parse_expr` comes from:\n- Allowing customization of the parsing environment through `local_dict` and `global_dict`.\n- Enabling the application of different `transformations` to the expression prior to its evaluation.\n- Controlling the evaluation behavior through the `evaluate` parameter, impacting the automatic simplification of the resulting expression.\n\n### 2. Relationship to the Bug\n\nThe issue with sympifying Greek characters like `u\"\u03b1\"` likely relates to how `parse_expr` and its associated `standard_transformations` handle such characters. Since `parse_expr` is the method tasked with parsing and converting string input into SymPy expressions, any limitations or oversights in its ability to recognize and correctly process Greek characters or Unicode input are directly relevant to the issue at hand.\n\nThe function's current implementation, including its handling of transformations and the default behavior of pre-evaluating expressions, does not explicitly mention or demonstrate accommodation for non-standard characters or symbols used in mathematical expression strings, such as Greek letters. The oversight seems to lie in the set or application of `transformations` that do not account for such use cases.\n\n### 3. Intended Behavior\n\nThe intended behavior of `parse_expr`, in this context, should extend to correctly identifying and converting Greek characters and likely other non-ASCII symbols into their corresponding SymPy symbol objects. This would involve either:\n- Ensuring that existing transformations can handle these characters correctly.\n- Introducing new transformations specifically designed to interpret and convert Greek letters and similar symbols into SymPy expressions.\n\nGiven the issue description and the role of `parse_expr`, enhancing its string parsing capabilities to include comprehensive support for Greek letters (both in isolation and within broader expressions) is crucial. For a successful resolution, the method should be able to seamlessly interpret `\"\u03b1\"` as equivalent to `Symbol(\"alpha\")`, much in the same way it would process other symbols and expressions provided as strings.\n\nTo effectively address the reported bug while preserving the existing functionalities of SymPy's expression parsing, the solution may also entail augmenting or refining the `standard_transformations` to encompass special rules or logic for handling Unicode inputs like Greek letters. Moreover, ensuring that these transformations do not negatively interact with other components or features of `parse_expr` (such as the handling of local and global dictionaries or the `evaluate` parameter's behavior) will be imperative."
