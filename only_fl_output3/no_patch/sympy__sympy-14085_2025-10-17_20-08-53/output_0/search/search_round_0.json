        "content": "To address the issue outlined about `sympify(u\"\u03b1\")` not working, we need further context about the functions and classes involved in the traceback and their interactions, particularly `sympify`, `ast_parser.parse_expr`, and how symbols like Greek letters are handled within SymPy. Based on the provided issue details, here are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"sympify\", \"sympy/core/sympify.py\")` to get the context of the `sympify` function as mentioned in the issue.\n2. `search_method_in_file(\"parse_expr\", \"sympy/core/ast_parser.py\")` to examine how `parse_expr` is implemented and determine why it fails to parse Greek letters.\n3. `search_code(\"Transform\")` to understand how `Transform` (mentioned in the error trace as part of `ast_parser.py`) works and relates to the parsing process.\n4. `search_method(\"Symbol\")` since `Symbol('alpha')` creating a Greek letter `\u03b1` is part of the sympifying process described in the issue, understanding `Symbol` creation is crucial."
