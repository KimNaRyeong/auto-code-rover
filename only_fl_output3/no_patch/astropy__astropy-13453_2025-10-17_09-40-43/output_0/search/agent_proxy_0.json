Below are the specific API calls that would help gather the needed context:\n\n1. **Search for the Table Class**: Since the issue is directly related to the `Table` class and its `write` method, we first need to understand the implementation details of this class.\n   - `search_class(\"Table\")`\n\n2. **Search for the write Method Within the Table Class**: To get specific details on how the `write` method is implemented and to see if it handles the `formats` parameter differently based on output format.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"write\", \"Table\")`\n\n3. **Search for HTML Write Functionality**: Since the issue specifically affects HTML output, it's important to identify if there's a dedicated method or function handling HTML formatting that might be overlooking the `formats` argument.\n   - `search_code(\"format='html'\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to locate the relevant parts of the code that are most likely related to the bug, providing a solid foundation for further investigation and eventual bug fixing."
