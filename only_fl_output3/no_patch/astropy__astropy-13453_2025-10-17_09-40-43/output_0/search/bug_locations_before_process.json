This entails modifying the method to iterate over each column of the table, check if there is a specified format for that column in the `formats` argument, and apply this format to each value in the column before generating the HTML output. This ensures consistency with the behavior of the `write` method across other formats (e.g., CSV, LaTeX) that do respect the `formats` argument. It's crucial that existing functionalities, such as default formatting and handling of non-specified columns, remain unchanged to preserve backward compatibility."

        "intended_behavior": "Ensure that any method within the `Table` class that leads to HTML output generation (either directly or indirectly through utility methods or class instantiation) properly propagates the `formats` argument to the HTML writing logic. The precise adjustment needed may vary based on the method's current responsibilities and its role in HTML output generation. The goal is to provide a seamless and consistent interface for users, where specifying formats for table output produces the expected results regardless of the output format chosen."
