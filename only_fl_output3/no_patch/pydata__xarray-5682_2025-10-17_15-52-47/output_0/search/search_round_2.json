Given the user's report that manually using `plt.xlabel(name)` with the LaTeX string works but xarray's automatic handling does not, it implies that the issue might lie in how xarray processes the `long_name` attribute for plotting.

It determines the type of plot to generate based on the dimensions of the input `DataArray`. For 1D data, it uses a line plot; for 2D data, it uses a pcolormesh plot, and for anything else, it defaults to a histogram.\n   - It handles additional plotting parameters such as faceting by rows or columns, specifies axes, and supports customized subplot keywords and additional matplotlib kwargs.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Given that the bug involves improper rendering of LaTeX in `long_name`s when plotting, this portion is directly related as it is the entry point where plotting with xarray begins. Since the issue doesn't arise when using matplotlib directly, the bug might reside in how this xarray plot functionality handles or passes `long_name` attributes to matplotlib for rendering.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Ideally, during the plotting process, this part of the code should ensure that any LaTeX expressions in `long_name` attributes of the `DataArray` are correctly processed and passed to matplotlib so that they are rendered as intended. This means recognizing when the `long_name` contains LaTeX syntax and ensuring it's correctly interpreted by matplotlib's rendering engine.\n\n### Analysis of Code Snippets containing `long_name`\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - These snippets didn't have their code displayed, but generally, occurrences of `long_name` in the codebase are likely used to fetch or set descriptive names for variables in `DataArray` or `Dataset` objects. These descriptors are often used in plots as labels.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Given that the issue is specifically about LaTeX in `long_name`s not rendering, these parts of the code are probably crucial. They may be where `long_name` attributes are either being ignored for LaTeX parsing or incorrectly handled when plots are generated.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be to handle `long_name` attributes containing LaTeX correctly so that when they are passed to matplotlib for rendering in plots, the LaTeX is interpreted and displayed as expected, just like when using matplotlib directly.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Investigation\nTo move closer to identifying and eventually resolving the bug, further specific contextual analysis is needed around how `long_name` is used within the plotting process in xarray. Given the results, additional API calls should focus on:\n\n- The `plot/utils.py` file which might contain utility functions used in plotting that could manipulate or handle `long_name` attributes.\n- How `long_name` attributes are processed or passed to matplotlib in the plotting function.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following API call could provide more targeted insight:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"long_name\", \"xarray/plot/utils.py\")` to see how `long_name` is specifically handled in the context of plotting utilities in xarray."

However, a hypothetical bug location based on the general analysis could be anticipated as follows:\n\n     **Hypothetical Bug Location 1:**\n     - **File:** `xarray/plot/plot.py`\n     - **Class/Method:** Potentially within the `plot` function or surrounding utilities that manage plot labels.\n     - **Intended Behavior:** The plot function or a related utility should correctly interpret and render `long_name` attributes that contain LaTeX expressions. This means ensuring that any text passed to matplotlib for labels (like axis labels or titles) that comes from `long_name` attributes is flagged or processed in a way that matplotlib recognizes and renders the LaTeX syntax correctly. The existing functionality for handling non-LaTeX `long_name` should remain unaffected.\n\n    Without specific code snippets detailing how `long_name` attributes are actually processed for rendering in plots, suggesting a more precise location for the needed fix remains speculative. Further investigation into `xarray/plot/utils.py` or how plot labels are set in `xarray/plot/plot.py` might reveal the exact mechanisms leading to the issue, allowing for a concrete identification of the bug location and a targeted approach to preserving and extending functionality to correctly render complex LaTeX expressions."

This function appears to construct labels for plotting from a `DataArray`'s attributes, adhering to the CF conventions by prioritizing `long_name` and `standard_name` attributes.\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `label_from_attrs` function extracts a label for use in plots from the attributes of a `DataArray`. It checks for a `long_name` attribute first and uses it as the label if available. If `long_name` is not found, it looks for `standard_name`. This approach is designed to create meaningful, human-readable labels for plots constructed from data arrays.\n\n#### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\nThis part of the code is likely central to the issue reported. The bug involves complex LaTeX expressions within `long_name` attributes not rendering correctly in plots. Since `label_from_attrs` is responsible for fetching these `long_name` values and presumably passing them to the plotting functions, the method of extraction and passing to matplotlib without additional processing or without considering LaTeX rendering might be where the problem lies.\n\n#### Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\nThe intended behavior should be an enhancement to the existing functionality, where if a `long_name` contains LaTeX expressions, the label extraction process should ensure these are correctly passed on in a format that matplotlib can render as LaTeX. This implies not merely passing the string as-is but marking it in a way that matplotlib recognizes it requires LaTeX processing (usually done by wrapping text intended for LaTeX rendering in `$...$`).\n\nSince matplotlib already renders LaTeX when it notices text wrapped within `$...$`, a closer look at how `long_name` attributes are handed off to matplotlib might be needed. There's a possibility that either:\n\n1. The LaTeX in `long_name` is not correctly formatted or escaped for matplotlib to recognize it.\n2. There might be an additional step or flag required when passing these labels from xarray to matplotlib, ensuring the text is interpreted as LaTeX.\n\nConsidering the snippets, an adjustment in `label_from_attrs` or perhaps further down the line where matplotlib processes the label might be needed to ensure LaTeX is rendered correctly. The function correctly identifies and prioritizes `long_name`, but may not account for special handling for LaTeX rendering, which seems to be necessary."

The function already fetches `long_name` or `standard_name` for use as a plot label.

This might involve verifying that the entire label or parts of it are enclosed in `$` if they are meant for LaTeX interpretation. This change should be made in such a way that if no LaTeX is present, labels should be handled as they are currently, preserving existing functionality for non-LaTeX labels.\n\nThe modification aims to ensure that complex LaTeX expressions in `long_name` are correctly recognized and rendered by matplotlib, addressing the core issue reported.
