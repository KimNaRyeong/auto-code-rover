        "content": "To address the reported issue about complex LaTeX expressions in `long_name`s not being rendered correctly when plotting with xarray, but working fine with matplotlib, I will perform a series of search API calls to gather the necessary code context. Based on the information provided in the issue, I will start with searching for how xarray handles plotting and specifically how it sets labels, which could involve looking into how `long_name` attributes are processed during plotting.\n\n1. I'll search for the class where xarray handles its plotting functionality. This is likely to be a class dedicated to visualization or plotting within the xarray library:\n   - `search_class(\"Plot\")`\n\n2. Then, since the issue involves setting axis labels, which in the context of matplotlib is often handled with methods like `xlabel`, it's logical to search for methods that set axis labels within xarray's plotting classes or methods that might handle `attrs` (attributes) related to plotting:\n   - `search_method(\"xlabel\")`\n   - `search_method(\"set_xlabel\")`\n   - `search_method(\"plot\")`\n\n3. Given the user's report that manually using `plt.xlabel(name)` with the LaTeX string works but xarray's automatic handling does not, it implies that the issue might lie in how xarray processes the `long_name` attribute for plotting. To this end, searching for code snippets that reference `long_name` in the context of plotting is crucial:\n   - `search_code(\"long_name\")`\n\nThese initial searches should provide a foundational understanding of where the problem might reside in xarray's plotting mechanism and how attributes like `long_name` are processed for plots."
