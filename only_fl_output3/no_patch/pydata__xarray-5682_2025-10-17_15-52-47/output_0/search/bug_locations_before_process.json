        "intended_behavior": "This function should be enhanced to detect if the 'long_name' (or 'standard_name' if 'long_name' is not present) contains LaTeX syntax. If LaTeX syntax is found (e.g., the string contains '$...$'), it should ensure that this is passed correctly to matplotlib for rendering. The function already fetches 'long_name' or 'standard_name' for use as a plot label. The enhancement should involve a check to preserve any LaTeX markup by ensuring it's appropriately formatted or flagged for matplotlib to render as LaTeX without stripping or altering the LaTeX commands. This might involve verifying that the entire label or parts of it are enclosed in '$' if they are meant for LaTeX interpretation. This change should be made in such a way that if no LaTeX is present, labels should be handled as they are currently, preserving existing functionality for non-LaTeX labels."
