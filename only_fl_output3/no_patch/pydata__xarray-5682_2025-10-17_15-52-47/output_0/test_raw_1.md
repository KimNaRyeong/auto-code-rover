Given your request for a revised Python script named `reproducer.py`, which aims to reproduce the issue related to xarray's handling of complex LaTeX in `long_name`s and checks whether the issue is resolved (exits with code 0 if fixed), here is an updated version in a code block as requested:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import xarray as xr

    plt.ioff()  # Turn off interactive plotting

    try:
        # Preparation of the DataArray with a complex LaTeX expression in long_name
        da = xr.DataArray(np.arange(5), dims="x", coords=dict(x=np.arange(5)))
        complex_latex_label = r"$Ra_s = \frac{\mathrm{mean}(\epsilon_k)}{\mu M^2_\infty}$"
        da.x.attrs['long_name'] = complex_latex_label

        # Plotting with xarray which attempts to automatically use the long_name attribute
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        da.plot(ax=ax)

        # Extracting the x-axis label text to verify if it matches the intended complex LaTeX expression
        rendered_xlabel = ax.get_xlabel()
        if rendered_xlabel != complex_latex_label:
            raise AssertionError("LaTeX expression in `long_name` is not correctly rendered by xarray.")

        # Cleanup after test to close the figure, preventing unnecessary display/resource holding
        plt.close(fig)

    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 indicating issue is present

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(2)  # Exit with a distinct code indicating an unexpected error occurred

    print("The issue is fixed. LaTeX expressions in `long_name` are correctly rendered by xarray now.")
    exit(0)  # Exit code 0 indicating the issue has been resolved

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Ensure this script is saved as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project. It's designed to attempt reproducing the rendering issue described with `xarray` and uses assertions to verify if complex LaTeX expressions in `long_name` attributes are correctly rendered when plotting. The script exits with code 0 if the issue is fixed, or 1 if the AssertionError is thrown indicating the problem persists, and a different code if an unexpected exception occurs. This should meet the criteria for an automated test in a continuous integration setup or manual execution to confirm the presence of the bug or verify its resolution.
