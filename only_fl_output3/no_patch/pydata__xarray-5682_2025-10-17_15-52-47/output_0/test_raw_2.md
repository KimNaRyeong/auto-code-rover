Understanding the earlier issue and your current request, let's adjust the Python script to ensure compatibility and focus on reproducing the issue related to LaTeX rendering. The following standalone Python script, `reproducer.py`, is updated to consider potential library and environment disparities that could lead to different outcomes.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import xarray as xr

    plt.ioff()  # Ensure matplotlib is in non-interactive mode

    try:
        # Create a DataArray with a complex LaTeX expression in its long_name attribute
        da = xr.DataArray([1, 2, 3], dims="x", coords={"x": [1, 2, 3]})
        complex_latex_label = r"$Ra_s = \frac{\mathrm{mean}(\epsilon_k)}{\mu M^2_\infty}$"
        da.x.attrs['long_name'] = complex_latex_label

        # Attempt to plot using xarray to check if LaTeX rendering is correctly applied
        fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 4))
        da.plot(ax=ax)

        # Check if the LaTeX label is correctly applied on the x-axis
        current_xlabel = ax.get_xlabel()
        if current_xlabel != complex_latex_label:
            raise AssertionError("Expected LaTeX expression in `long_name` is not rendered by xarray.")

        plt.close(fig)  # Clean up figure to conserve memory

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with an error indicating the problem exists

    print("Issue resolved. LaTeX expressions in `long_name` are correctly rendered by xarray.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Ensure to include correct dependencies and environment settings before running this script, especially concerning the versions of `xarray`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy`. The script is designed to fail (exit with code 1) if the problem persists, specifically if LaTeX expressions within the `long_name` attribute of an `xarray` DataArray object are not rendered properly when plotted. It will exit with code 0 if the issue has been resolved, indicating successful LaTeX rendering in plots generated by `xarray`.
