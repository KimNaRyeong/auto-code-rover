Based on the updated requirements, let's correct the issues in the reproduction script, specifically addressing the method for registering a colormap, which should be done through `matplotlib.cm.register_cmap`. If the initial issue was due to a misunderstanding of the `register_cmap` method not existing on the `cm` module, this attempt will correctly use matplotlib functionalities to register and then attempt to use a custom colormap. This time, ensuring the script matches the expectations outlined for reproducing the issue correctly.

```python
# reproducer.py
import matplotlib
from matplotlib.colors import LinearSegmentedColormap
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_colormap_issue():
    my_cmap_data = [[1.5e-03, 4.7e-04, 1.4e-02],
                    [2.3e-03, 1.3e-03, 1.8e-02],
                    [3.3e-03, 2.3e-03, 2.4e-02]]
    my_cmap = LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list('some_cmap_name', my_cmap_data)
    # Correct use of registering a colormap
    matplotlib.cm.register_cmap(name='my_cmap_name', cmap=my_cmap)

    try:
        # Attempt to set and use the custom colormap by the registered name
        plt.set_cmap('my_cmap_name')
        plt.imshow([[1, 2], [2, 3]])
        plt.colorbar()  # To ensure colormap is applied.
        print("No AssertionError: Issue seems to be fixed.")
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Colormap name handling is broken.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_colormap_issue()
```
This corrected version of the script includes appropriate error handling and makes use of the proper method to register the colormap. When the issue is reproduced, an `AssertionError` will be raised, leading to the printing of the stack trace. If the issue is not present, indicating a potential fix or misunderstanding, the script will complete without raising an exception, outputting a message that the issue seems to be fixed.
