This means validating colormap names against the registry of colormaps added through register_cmap, allowing for successful retrieval and application based on the registered name rather than just the internal name. Given that imshow may delegate to a lower-level implementation for the actual colormap application, a review and potential update of that delegation process are also implied to ensure consistency in colormap name handling."
