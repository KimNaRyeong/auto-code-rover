        "intended_behavior": "The task involves adding a new method 'average' to the 'Dataset' class that computes weighted averages. This new method doesn't really fix a bug but introduces new functionality, which should harmonize with the existing infrastructure of the 'Dataset' class. To resolve the issue and properly add the 'average' method, the following objectives and behaviors need to be included: Support for Weighted Averages: The method should allow the user to specify weights for different dimensions or coordinates, which is crucial for applications such as processing geospatial data. Predictable Axes Ordering: The method needs to either ensure or clearly document how axes (dimensions) are handled and how weights are applied relative to these axes to ensure that users can predict the outcome of their average calculations. Extensibility and Integration: The method should be designed in a way that feels natural within the 'Dataset' ecosystem, possibly leveraging existing computational utilities (like 'reduce', 'map', or 'apply') for efficient data processing. Documentation and Examples: Given the complexity of weighted averages in multidimensional data, providing clear documentation and usage examples will be crucial for user adoption and correctness of implementation."
