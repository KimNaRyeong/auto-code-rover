Here's how you can structure `reproducer.py` to encapsulate your requirements. The script attempts to recreate the mentioned issue and employs the provided function to display a detailed stack trace only if the issue persists. It gracefully exits with code 0 if the problem is resolved, ensuring that the behavior aligns with your instructions.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        from cartopy.crs import PlateCarree
        from cartopy.mpl.geoaxes import GeoAxes
        from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import AxesGrid

        # Reproduce the issue
        fig = plt.figure()
        axes_class = (GeoAxes, dict(map_projection=PlateCarree()))
        AxesGrid(fig, 111, nrows_ncols=(1, 1), axes_class=axes_class)

        # Reaching this point without exceptions means the issue is fixed
        print("No TypeError encountered. Issue is fixed.")
        exit(0)
    except TypeError as e:
        print("TypeError encountered. Asserting the issue is present.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue with creating an AxisGrid using GeoAxes is present.") from e
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script begins with a `main` function that replicates the problematic behavior. It attempts to create an `AxesGrid` using `GeoAxes` and catches a `TypeError` if it arises, using this as an indication of the problem's presence. If the `TypeError` is caught, the script asserts that the issue remains, displaying the stack trace for diagnostic purposes. If any other exception occurs, the script also prints a stack trace, providing valuable debugging information without making assumptions about the issue's nature. This structured approach ensures clarity and focusses on diagnosing the specific issue at hand.
