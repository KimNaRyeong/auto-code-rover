        "intended_behavior": "The `_tick_only` method should be updated to gracefully handle axes types where the `axis` attribute is not subscriptable, such as `GeoAxes`. An additional check should be introduced to either verify `ax.axis` is subscriptable before attempting to access it like a dictionary or to catch the `TypeError` and handle `GeoAxes` specifically. The goal is to preserve compatibility with `Axes` types that provide an `axis` attribute behaving as expected, while also accommodating `GeoAxes` or other axes where `axis` might be implemented differently."
