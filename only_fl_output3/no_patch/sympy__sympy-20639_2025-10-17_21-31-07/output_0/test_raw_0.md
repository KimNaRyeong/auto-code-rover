Below is a Python script designed to reproduce the issue described. You can save it as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of the project. This script checks if the pretty printing of `pi**(1/E)` is incorrect as detailed, by asserting the specific incorrect rendering against the expected output. If the issue is present (i.e., the incorrect rendering matches the current output), it will raise an `AssertionError`. If the issue is fixed (i.e., the rendering outputs expectedly), the script exits with code 0 without raising an error.

```python
# reproducer.py
from sympy import pi, E, latex, pretty, symbols, exp
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    expr = pi**(1/E)
    pretty_output = pretty(expr)
    expected_incorrect_rendering = "-1___\n╲╱ π "
    try:
        # Asserting against the incorrect output to determine if the issue exists
        assert pretty_output == expected_incorrect_rendering, "The rendering issue seems resolved"
        
        # Printing statements for clarity on the issue reproduction.
        print("Issue reproduced successfully - incorrect rendering matches")
        print("Pretty Output:")
        print(pretty_output)

        # Raising AssertionError if issue is reproduced successfully 
        # (i.e., the issue is present and the incorrect rendering is outputted)
        raise AssertionError("Incorrect rendering of pi**(1/E) is still present")
    
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Exiting with code 0 when the issue is fixed, or the assertion catches the resolved status
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script targets the specific rendering issue of `pi**(1/E)` in a pretty print format. When you run `python3 reproducer.py`, it will perform the check and behave as described:
- It will produce a stack trace if the issue is present, aiding in identifying where the issue arises.
- It will exit quietly with code 0 if the issue has been resolved, meaning the incorrect rendering doesn't occur, implying the assertion that checks for the incorrect output fails, catching that the issue seems resolved.

This approach is specific to this issue and involves direct assertion against an expected incorrect output, making it a suitable method for automated testing or manual reproduction of this bug.
