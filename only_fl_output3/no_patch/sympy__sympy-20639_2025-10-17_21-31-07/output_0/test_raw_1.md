Given the earlier misunderstanding, let's adjust the approach to ensure the script correctly identifies whether the issue exists based on the specific criteria described and exits appropriately. This version of `reproducer.py` will verify the pretty printing output for `pi**(1/E)` and will raise an `AssertionError` only if the issue is present, matching the specified incorrect rendering. If the rendering has been corrected, the script will exit with code 0, indicating the issue has been resolved.

```python
# reproducer.py
from sympy import pi, E, pretty, init_printing
import sys

# Ensure that symbols are rendered as strings
init_printing(use_unicode=True)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def verify_issue():
    expr = pi**(1/E)
    pretty_output = pretty(expr)
    incorrect_output = "-1___\n╲╱ π "

    # Check if the pretty printing of the expression matches the incorrect output
    if pretty_output == incorrect_output:
        raise AssertionError("The issue with pretty printing of pi**(1/E) is reproduced.")


def main():
    try:
        verify_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error status indicating the issue is present
    
    # If the issue is not reproduced, exit with code 0
    print("The issue with pretty printing of pi**(1/E) has been resolved.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script is more aligned with the given instructions where:

- It correctly raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is reproduced (indicating the specific incorrect pretty printing).
- Exits with code 0 if the issue is not encountered, meaning the pretty printing of `pi**(1/E)` does not match the incorrect output, thereby suggesting the issue has been fixed.
- The stack trace will be printed if and only if the incorrect rendering occurs, helping to trace back the error within the script or the relevant library it interacts with.
