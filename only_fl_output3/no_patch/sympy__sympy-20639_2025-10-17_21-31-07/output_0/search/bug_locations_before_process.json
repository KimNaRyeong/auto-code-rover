        "intended_behavior": "The `_print_Pow` method should be adjusted to properly handle cases like `pi**(1/E)` by: 1. Introducing additional logic to differentiate between scenarios where `root_notation` is appropriate and when it might lead to misleading representations, such as the unintended application of a root notation to `pi**(1/E)`. This might involve checking the specific nature of the exponent (whether it truly corresponds to a clear root notation that is commonly understood and mathematically accurate for the given base) before applying `root_notation` logic. 2. Ensuring that for expressions involving special constants or irrational numbers as either the base or exponent, the representation adheres to conventional mathematical notations, avoiding automatic simplifications that might misrepresent the expression's true value or meaning. 3. Preserving the functionality intended for handling various special cases outlined within the method, including handling of negative exponents and relational bases, ensuring that any enhancements or fixes do not interfere with these cases."
