        "content": "To gather the required context for resolving the issue, we'll need to identify where the problematic code is located. Since the issue description mentions a specific code snippet that throws an `IndexError` when dealing with a `null` value, we should start by looking for this snippet within the codebase. Additionally, understanding where this snippet is being used might help identify which file or class we should focus on. Given the information provided, here are the API calls I would like to make:\n\n1. `search_code(code_str: \"if str_number[0] == \\\"-\\\"\")`: This will help us find where the mentioned code snippet is being used in the project.\n2. `search_code(code_str: \"IndexError: string index out of range\")`: Although it's unlikely this exact error message is hard-coded in the project, making this API call could help us identify similar issues or error handling mechanisms related to the problem at hand."
