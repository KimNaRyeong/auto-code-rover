        "content": "To address this issue effectively, we need to understand how the project interacts with docutils, specifically with version 0.17b1 as mentioned. We should look for integration points or configurations that point to the version of docutils being used, as well as any custom handling or compatibility patches for docutils within the project.\n\nGiven that the issue is concentrated on testing with a specific beta version of docutils (0.17b1), it suggests there may be tests or configurations hardcoded with the docutils version, or there may be conditional logic to handle different docutils versions. Here's a plan to gather the needed context using the provided search APIs:\n\n1. **Search for direct references to docutils or its specific versions in the codebase.** This can help identify any configuration files or code segments that explicitly mention docutils or handle its versions.\n   - `search_code(\"docutils==0.17b1\")`\n   - `search_code(\"docutils\")`\n\n2. **Identify key classes or methods that might be involved with testing or configuration of docutils.** Without explicit class or method names related to docutils from the issue, we can start with broad searches to locate potential points of interaction.\n   - `search_code(\"setup.py\")` or files typically used for dependency management might contain version specifics.\n   - `search_code(\"conf.py\")` as Sphinx-based documentation setups (which rely heavily on docutils) use this file for configuration and might contain compatibility code or settings.\n   - If any specific classes or files known to handle dependencies or tests are mentioned in the results of these searches, detail-oriented searches can be performed on them.\n\nUsing these searches, we aim to identify exactly where in the project's codebase the version of docutils could impact test results or behavior and look for any signs of version-specific handling or configurations that could guide a patch."
