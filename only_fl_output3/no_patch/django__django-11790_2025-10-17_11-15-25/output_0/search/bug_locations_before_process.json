        "intended_behavior": "In the `__init__` method, after setting the `max_length` attribute for the `username` field (line 194), the method should also ensure that the `maxlength` HTML attribute is correctly set so that it is rendered in the form's HTML output. This can be achieved by adjusting the widget's attributes of the `username` field to include `maxlength`. For example, it should ensure that the following adjustment is made:\n```python\nself.fields['username'].widget.attrs['maxlength'] = self.fields['username'].max_length\n```\nThis code snippet ensures the HTML rendered for the `username` field includes a `maxlength` attribute that matches the `max_length` value of the field. This change will enforce the maximum length constraint directly within the HTML, preventing users from inputting more characters than allowed and mirroring the validation logic on the client side that already exists on the server side."

        "intended_behavior": "If the `widget_attrs` method of `UsernameField` does not already handle setting the `maxlength` attribute based on the field's `max_length`, this method should be updated or implemented to ensure that the `maxlength` attribute is correctly set for widgets of `UsernameField`. The method should merge any existing attributes with the `maxlength` attribute, ensuring not to overwrite any existing widget attributes. This approach provides a more generic solution ensuring that all instances of `UsernameField` across the application respect the `max_length` constraint in their HTML rendering."
