Here is a standalone Python script `reproducer.py` aimed at reproducing the issue as described. This script checks if the `label_ranking_average_precision_score` function accurately applies sample weighting to samples with zero true labels. If the issue is present, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints a detailed stack trace. If the issue is fixed, the script will exit with code 0, indicating success.

```python
import numpy as np
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def main():
    from sklearn.metrics import label_ranking_average_precision_score

    # Sample data setup
    truth = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=bool)
    scores = np.array([[0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]])
    sample_weight = [1.0, 1.0, 0.0]

    # The expected result if sample weights are applied correctly
    expected_result = 0.625

    try:
        actual_result = label_ranking_average_precision_score(truth, scores, sample_weight=sample_weight)
        # Check if the result matches the expected value
        assert np.isclose(actual_result, expected_result), f"Expected result is {expected_result}, but got {actual_result}"
        print("Test passed: Issue is fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 if everything is fine
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 if there is an unexpected error
```

Ensure to run this script in an environment where the necessary dependencies, particularly sklearn, are correctly installed and updated to the version that initially observed the issue. This script performs the check using an example mimicking the problem scenario and uses assertion to validate the expected behavior against the actual outcome of the function call.
