Separately, individual samples whose labels are the same for all classes (all true or all false) are treated as a special case (precision == 1, [line 732](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7b136e9/sklearn/metrics/ranking.py#L732)). However, this special case bypasses the application of sample_weight ([line 740](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7b136e9/sklearn/metrics/ranking.py#L740)).  So, in the case where there is both non-default sample_weighting and samples with, for instance, zero labels, the reported metric is wrong.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\nSee example in [this colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19P-6UgIMZSUgBcLyR7jm9oELacrYNJE7)\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport sklearn.metrics\n# Per sample APs are 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 (default for zero labels).\ntruth = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=np.bool)\nscores = np.array([[0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]])\nprint(sklearn.metrics.label_ranking_average_precision_score(\ntruth, scores, sample_weight=[1.0, 1.0, 0.0]))\n```\n#### Expected Results\nAverage of AP of first and second samples = 0.625\n#### Actual Results\nSum of AP of all three samples, divided by sum of weighting vector = 2.25/2 = 1.125\n#### Versions\nSystem:\npython: 3.6.7 (default, Oct 22 2018, 11:32:17)  [GCC 8.2.0]\nexecutable: /usr/bin/python3\nmachine: Linux-4.14.79+-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-18.04-bionic\nBLAS:\nmacros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\nlib_dirs: /usr/local/lib\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\nPython deps:\npip: 19.0.3\nsetuptools: 40.8.0\nsklearn: 0.20.3\nnumpy: 1.14.6\nscipy: 1.1.0\nCython: 0.29.6\npandas: 0.22.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the provided code snippets in the context of the reported issue brings several insights:\n\n### What does this part of the code do?\n\n1. **Code around line 732:**\n   - The code checks if a sample (row in `y_true`) either has all labels relevant or irrelevant. In such cases, it assigns the score of 1 to the output (`out`) for that sample and continues to the next sample without further processing. This logic implements the part where samples with zero true labels or all true labels are given a precision of 1.\n\n2. **Code around line 740:**\n   - This portion further processes each sample by calculating a mean of the aux variable, which seems to be a calculated score based on ranking. If `sample_weight` is not None, it multiplies `aux` by the sample's weight. The total output (`out`) is then incremented by the weighted or unweighted `aux`.\n\n3. **Implementation of `label_ranking_average_precision_score`:**\n   - This function computes the Label Ranking Average Precision Score. It first checks for input consistency and shapes, formats `y_true` as a sparse matrix, and inverts `y_score` because the ranking is done in descending order. The original issue appears in the loop that processes each sample, specifically in how it handles samples with all labels the same (all-zero or all-non-zero), and subsequently how weights are applied.\n\n### Relationship between this part of the code and the bug\n\nThe issue arises in the special handling logic for samples with all labels being the same, located around line 732, where it adds 1 to `out` without considering `sample_weight`. This results in those samples contributing equally to the score irrespective of their assigned weight, which is incorrect per the described bug. The intended functionality for weighting seems to be correctly applied to other samples in the logic encapsulated around line 740, where `aux` is multiplied by the sample weight if provided.\n\n### Intended behavior of this part of the code\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior would involve adjusting the handling of samples with all labels the same (either all relevant or all irrelevant) to respect the `sample_weight`. That is, when a sample that falls into this special category is encountered, its contribution to the final score (`out`) should also be adjusted based on its weight. This adjustment would ensure that the final computed score accurately reflects the weighted contributions of all samples, thereby correctly implementing the `sample_weight` functionality across all cases.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the code that adds 1 to `out` for these special-case samples would need to be modified to incorporate the sample's weight from `sample_weight`. The final computation of the metric (located around line 743) would be expected to remain the same, where `out` is either divided by the number of samples or the sum of the sample weights, reflecting the total weighted or unweighted average score. \n\nWith this understanding, a patch would involve introducing a conditional weight application for the `out += 1.` line similar to how it is applied further down in the function, respecting whether `sample_weight` is provided and applying it accordingly."

Specifically, before adding 1 to the `out` variable to signify a perfect precision score for these cases (line 731), we need to check if `sample_weight` is provided. If so, the contribution of the sample to `out` should be scaled by its corresponding weight in `sample_weight`. The adjustment would be something like:  \n\nIf `sample_weight` is not None, instead of directly adding 1 to `out`, it should be `out += sample_weight[i]`. This ensures that the special case samples contribute to the final score in proportion to their specified weights.\n\nThis modification will resolve the inconsistency and ensure that the behavior of the `label_ranking_average_precision_score` function aligns with the intention behind `sample_weight`. It preserves existing functionality for cases where `sample_weight` is not provided, maintaining backward compatibility while correcting the behavior when weights are used."
