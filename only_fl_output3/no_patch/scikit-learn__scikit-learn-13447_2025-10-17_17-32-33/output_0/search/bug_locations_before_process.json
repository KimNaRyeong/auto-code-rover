        "intended_behavior": "For the `label_ranking_average_precision_score` method, when processing samples that have all zeros or all ones (i.e., samples for which `relevant.size == 0 or relevant.size == n_labels` around line 728), the sample weighting should be applied to maintain consistency with how other samples are weighted in the computation. Specifically, before adding 1 to the `out` variable to signify a perfect precision score for these cases (line 731), we need to check if `sample_weight` is provided. If so, the contribution of the sample to `out` should be scaled by its corresponding weight in `sample_weight`. The adjustment would be something like:  \n\nIf `sample_weight` is not None, instead of directly adding 1 to `out`, it should be `out += sample_weight[i]`. This ensures that the special case samples contribute to the final score in proportion to their specified weights.\n\nThis modification will resolve the inconsistency and ensure that the behavior of the `label_ranking_average_precision_score` function aligns with the intention behind `sample_weight`. It preserves existing functionality for cases where `sample_weight` is not provided, maintaining backward compatibility while correcting the behavior when weights are used."
