Separately, individual samples whose labels are the same for all classes (all true or all false) are treated as a special case (precision == 1, [line 732](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7b136e9/sklearn/metrics/ranking.py#L732)). However, this special case bypasses the application of sample_weight ([line 740](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7b136e9/sklearn/metrics/ranking.py#L740)).  So, in the case where there is both non-default sample_weighting and samples with, for instance, zero labels, the reported metric is wrong.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\nSee example in [this colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19P-6UgIMZSUgBcLyR7jm9oELacrYNJE7)\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport sklearn.metrics\n# Per sample APs are 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 (default for zero labels).\ntruth = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=np.bool)\nscores = np.array([[0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]])\nprint(sklearn.metrics.label_ranking_average_precision_score(\ntruth, scores, sample_weight=[1.0, 1.0, 0.0]))\n```\n#### Expected Results\nAverage of AP of first and second samples = 0.625\n#### Actual Results\nSum of AP of all three samples, divided by sum of weighting vector = 2.25/2 = 1.125\n#### Versions\nSystem:\npython: 3.6.7 (default, Oct 22 2018, 11:32:17)  [GCC 8.2.0]\nexecutable: /usr/bin/python3\nmachine: Linux-4.14.79+-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-18.04-bionic\nBLAS:\nmacros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\nlib_dirs: /usr/local/lib\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\nPython deps:\npip: 19.0.3\nsetuptools: 40.8.0\nsklearn: 0.20.3\nnumpy: 1.14.6\nscipy: 1.1.0\nCython: 0.29.6\npandas: 0.22.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "To thoroughly investigate and fix the described issue in the `label_ranking_average_precision_score` function where sample weighting is not applied correctly to samples with zero true labels, let's perform a series of API calls to collect the necessary context.\n\n1. First, we will retrieve the code around the locations where the problem is described. The issue mentions that the special treatment of samples with all true or all false labels and the bypassing of sample_weight takes place around lines 732 and 740. Thus, we should look at the code around these lines for context.\n\n2. Next, it's critical to understand how `label_ranking_average_precision_score` is implemented and interacts with the weights. Therefore, obtaining the implementation of this function is crucial for proposing a fix.\n\nGiven these requirements, I will make the following API calls:\n\n- `get_code_around_line(file_path: str, line_number: int, window_size: int)` twice to get context around lines 732 and 740 in \"sklearn/metrics/ranking.py\", with a sufficient window size to understand the surrounding logic.\n- `search_method_in_file('label_ranking_average_precision_score', 'sklearn/metrics/ranking.py')` to get more details on the implementation of the `label_ranking_average_precision_score` method itself.\n\nLet's execute these API calls now:\n\n1. `get_code_around_line('sklearn/metrics/ranking.py', 732, 10)`\n2. `get_code_around_line('sklearn/metrics/ranking.py', 740, 10)`\n3. `search_method_in_file('label_ranking_average_precision_score', 'sklearn/metrics/ranking.py')`"
