Based on your request for a revised approach and taking into account the guidelines provided for error handling, below is an appropriately structured Python script named `reproducer.py`. This script is designed to reproduce the reported issue and validate if it persists, by evaluating the label ranking average precision score function's handling of sample weights, specifically when samples have zero true labels.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.metrics import label_ranking_average_precision_score

    # Setup test data
    truth = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0]])
    scores = np.array([[0.3, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], [0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]])
    sample_weight = [1.0, 1.0, 0.0]

    expected = 0.625  # Expected result is average of the first two samples' AP

    try:
        # Compute label ranking average precision score
        result = label_ranking_average_precision_score(truth, scores, sample_weight=sample_weight)

        # Verify if the obtained result is close to the expected value
        assert np.isclose(result, expected), f"Expected {expected}, got {result}"
        print("Test passed: Issue is fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code if the issue is present

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script fulfills the criteria by determining the presence of the issue through an `AssertionError` if the result does not match the expected behavior, thus signifying that the issue is still present. Conversely, if the program runs without throwing an error, it exits with code 0, indicating that the issue has been resolved. The `print_stacktrace` function is utilized to provide detailed error tracebacks, ensuring that any assertion failures are easily understandable.
