While this may be desirable for casually browsing data when the user is unfamiliar with the data range, it causes serious problems for batch applications where the user legitimately intends to use their list of levels but does not know whether every input array will produce contours.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nmyplot = plt.contour( x , y , data , levels = [100] )\r\nprint( myplot.levels )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above prints `[0.0]` when `data` is an array of values ranging from 0 to 50 (i.e., the requested contour level of 100 is outside the data range). As a result, the plot contains erroneous contours around near-zero values, presumably due to floating point precision.\r\n\r\nThis is a consequence of the change described here (https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_3.0.0.html?highlight=contour%20levels):\r\n\r\n> Selection of contour levels is now the same for contour and contourf; previously, for contour, levels outside the data range were deleted. **(Exception: if no contour levels are found within the data range, the levels attribute is replaced with a list holding only the minimum of the data range.)**\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd a kwarg to `contour()` that overrides the autoscaling behavior. When the kwarg is set, it would trigger a flag in `_process_contour_level_args()` (https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/main/lib/matplotlib/contour.py):\r\n\r\n```\r\nif not self.filled:\r\n            inside = (self.levels > self.zmin) & (self.levels < self.zmax)\r\n            levels_in = self.levels[inside]\r\n            if len(levels_in) == 0 and not(OVERRIDE_AUTOSCALE_FLAG):\r\n                self.levels = [self.zmin]\r\n                _api.warn_external(\r\n                    \"No contour levels were found within the data range.\")\r\n```\n"

The previous conclusion might have been premature or based on incorrect assumptions.\n\nWe'll keep the focus on making an assertion that specifically checks for the issue described: that contour levels provided outside the data range are overridden, which isn't the desired behavior. This script is expected to raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present, indicating that the levels are being autoscaled (replaced by `[0.0]` or `[zmin]` when they should not be), reflecting the erroneous state described.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport sys\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef test_contour_level_behavior():\n    x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)\n    y = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)\n    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)\n    Z = X**2 + Y**2  # Simple function, all values are >= 0\n\n    levels = [100]  # This is outside the Z range, which does not exceed 50\n\n    try:\n        plt.figure()\n        cont = plt.contour(X, Y, Z, levels=levels)\n        plt.close()\n\n        # Checking if matplotlib replaced specified levels with [zmin] due to all levels being outside the data range\n        assert cont.levels.tolist() == levels, f\"Contour levels were incorrectly adjusted to {cont.levels}, expected {levels}.\"\n\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error if assertion fails\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    test_contour_level_behavior()\n    print(\"No issue detected. Contour levels behave as expected.\")\n    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with success code if issue is non-existent or fixed\n```\n\nThis script will more accurately reproduce the issue described, by directly asserting against the unexpected replacement of user-specified levels that are wholly outside the range of the data. This should cause an assertion failure that matches the issue's description. If the issue is fixed (i.e., the user-specified levels are respected regardless of their relationship to the data range), the script will exit with a success code (0) and print a message to indicate no issue was detected."
