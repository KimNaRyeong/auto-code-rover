        "content": "<issue>[ENH]: Allow override of contour level autoscaling\n### Problem\nIn Matplotlib 3, when using a list of values for the `levels` argument in `contour()`, the list of values is overridden in the case that all requested levels fall outside the data range. While this may be desirable for casually browsing data when the user is unfamiliar with the data range, it causes serious problems for batch applications where the user legitimately intends to use their list of levels but does not know whether every input array will produce contours.\nExample:\n```\nmyplot = plt.contour( x , y , data , levels = [100] )\nprint( myplot.levels )\n```\nThe above prints `[0.0]` when `data` is an array of values ranging from 0 to 50 (i.e., the requested contour level of 100 is outside the data range). As a result, the plot contains erroneous contours around near-zero values, presumably due to floating point precision.\nThis is a consequence of the change described here (https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_3.0.0.html?highlight=contour%20levels):\n> Selection of contour levels is now the same for contour and contourf; previously, for contour, levels outside the data range were deleted. **(Exception: if no contour levels are found within the data range, the levels attribute is replaced with a list holding only the minimum of the data range.)**\n### Proposed solution\nAdd a kwarg to `contour()` that overrides the autoscaling behavior. When the kwarg is set, it would trigger a flag in `_process_contour_level_args()` (https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/main/lib/matplotlib/contour.py):\n```\nif not self.filled:\ninside = (self.levels > self.zmin) & (self.levels < self.zmax)\nlevels_in = self.levels[inside]\nif len(levels_in) == 0 and not(OVERRIDE_AUTOSCALE_FLAG):\nself.levels = [self.zmin]\n_api.warn_external(\n\"No contour levels were found within the data range.\")\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue, we need more context about the implementation of contours in Matplotlib, especially regarding autoscaling behavior when defining contour levels that fall outside the data range. The issue description suggests modifications within the `_process_contour_level_args` method, part of a class likely to be handling contour plotting. To gather enough context, we should start by identifying the relevant portions of Matplotlib's codebase.\n\nThe following API calls will be pivotal in collecting the required information:\n\n1. **Search for the _process_contour_level_args Method**: To understand how contour levels are processed and to identify where the proposed solution could be integrated.\n    - `search_method(\"_process_contour_level_args\")`\n\n2. **Search for Instances of Autoscaling Logic in Contour Processing**: The issue description references a specific piece of logic we need to find within the code.\n    - `search_code(\"inside = (self.levels > self.zmin) & (self.levels < self.zmax)\")`\n\n3. **Search for the Contour Class**: Understanding the structure of the class that handles contour plots will provide insight into how contour levels are set and managed.\n    - `search_class(\"Contour\")`\n\nThese calls aim to locate the relevant method implementation and provide a clear understanding of how contour levels are currently being auto-scaled, which is necessary to propose a precise solution that introduces an override mechanism."
