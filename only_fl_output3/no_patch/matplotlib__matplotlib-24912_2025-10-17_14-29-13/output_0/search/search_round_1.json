        "content": "<issue>[ENH]: Allow override of contour level autoscaling\n### Problem\nIn Matplotlib 3, when using a list of values for the `levels` argument in `contour()`, the list of values is overridden in the case that all requested levels fall outside the data range. While this may be desirable for casually browsing data when the user is unfamiliar with the data range, it causes serious problems for batch applications where the user legitimately intends to use their list of levels but does not know whether every input array will produce contours.\nExample:\n```\nmyplot = plt.contour( x , y , data , levels = [100] )\nprint( myplot.levels )\n```\nThe above prints `[0.0]` when `data` is an array of values ranging from 0 to 50 (i.e., the requested contour level of 100 is outside the data range). As a result, the plot contains erroneous contours around near-zero values, presumably due to floating point precision.\nThis is a consequence of the change described here (https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_3.0.0.html?highlight=contour%20levels):\n> Selection of contour levels is now the same for contour and contourf; previously, for contour, levels outside the data range were deleted. **(Exception: if no contour levels are found within the data range, the levels attribute is replaced with a list holding only the minimum of the data range.)**\n### Proposed solution\nAdd a kwarg to `contour()` that overrides the autoscaling behavior. When the kwarg is set, it would trigger a flag in `_process_contour_level_args()` (https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/main/lib/matplotlib/contour.py):\n```\nif not self.filled:\ninside = (self.levels > self.zmin) & (self.levels < self.zmax)\nlevels_in = self.levels[inside]\nif len(levels_in) == 0 and not(OVERRIDE_AUTOSCALE_FLAG):\nself.levels = [self.zmin]\n_api.warn_external(\n\"No contour levels were found within the data range.\")\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "The gathered information from the API calls provides significant insights into how Matplotlib currently handles contour level arguments and autoscaling. Let's analyze the results in the context of the issue described:\n\n### 1. Analysis of `_process_contour_level_args` Method\nThe method `_process_contour_level_args` found in `lib/matplotlib/contour.py` under `ContourSet` class is central to determining the contour levels stored in `self.levels`. This method processes the contour levels based on given arguments or defaults and has conditions for when the contours are filled or not. Notably, the method contains the logic that the issue aims to address, specifically the part where it checks if specified levels fall within the data range (`self.zmin` to `self.zmax`). If no levels fall within this range and the plot is not filled, it defaults the levels to include only `self.zmin`, issuing a warning that no contour levels were found within the data range.\n\n#### Relationship with the Bug\nThe behavior described in the issue precisely corresponds to the logic in this method: when user-specified contour levels fall outside the data range, the levels are overridden to just `[self.zmin]`. This could disrupt batch applications where specific contour levels are intentionally set outside the observed data range.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nThe intended behavior, as suggested by the issue, would require modification to this logic. Specifically, a new keyword argument could be introduced to skip the autoscaling logic, therefore maintaining the user-specified levels regardless of whether they fall within the current data range or not.\n\n### 2. Search Code for Autoscaling Logic\nThe specific code snippet where autoscaling logic checks (`inside = (self.levels > self.zmin) & (self.levels < self.zmax)`) matches the behavior described in the issue. It indicates where the override behavior is located and confirms the need to modify this part of the code to accommodate the proposed solution.\n\n### 3. Search for the Contour Class\nThe search for a `Contour` class did not yield results, which indicates a need for a revised approach. Given the context, the contour logic is implemented within the `ContourSet` class, not a `Contour` class. This misunderstanding highlights the importance of accuracy when identifying the relevant classes and methods within a large codebase.\n\n### Next Steps for the Patch\nBased on the analysis:\n1. **Modification of `_process_contour_level_args` Method**: The implementation of an additional keyword argument (e.g., `override_autoscale`) will be required to control the conditional logic that currently overrides the user-specified levels. This modification should be made within the `ContourSet` class in `lib/matplotlib/contour.py`, specifically around the block of code that handles the `inside` variable and the subsequent logic that defaults contour levels to `[self.zmin]`.\n\n2. **Update Documentation and Examples**: Alongside code changes, it's imperative to update the documentation to include the new keyword argument and possibly provide examples showcasing how to use this argument to maintain specified contour levels regardless of their relation to the data range.\n\n3. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing will be required to ensure that the new keyword argument behaves as expected across various scenarios, including both filled and non-filled contours, with levels specified within and outside the data range.\n\nConsidering the above findings and analysis, the next step towards crafting a patch would involve modifying the `ContourSet` class's `_process_contour_level_args` method to incorporate a flag that disables the described autoscaling behavior when explicitly requested by the user."

This argument would default to `False` to preserve existing functionality.\n- Within the `_process_contour_level_args` method, adjust the conditional logic that checks if specified levels fall within the data range. Specifically, modify the block that assigns `self.levels = [self.zmin]` if no levels fall within the range. This modification should allow the method to skip this adjustment if `override_autoscale` is `True`, effectively preserving the user-specified levels even if they do not fall within the observed data range.\n- Ensure that this logic works correctly for both filled and non-filled contours. The condition that enforces at least two levels for filled contours (`if self.filled and len(self.levels) < 2: raise ValueError(...)`) should remain unaffected by the new keyword argument.\n- Update the documentation to reflect the new keyword argument and its intended use. Provide examples showing how to set this argument to maintain specific contour levels outside the data range.\n- The modification should maintain backward compatibility by ensuring the new keyword argument defaults to not changing existing behavior unless explicitly specified by the user.\n\nThe implementation of this feature would resolve the issue by providing finer control over contour level autoscaling, catering to both interactive use cases where autoscaling is beneficial and batch processing scenarios where precise control over contour levels is necessary."
