Given the feedback, let's adjust the approach in the `reproducer.py` script to ensure it will reproduce the issue as intended. The previous conclusion might have been premature or based on incorrect assumptions.

We'll keep the focus on making an assertion that specifically checks for the issue described: that contour levels provided outside the data range are overridden, which isn't the desired behavior. This script is expected to raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present, indicating that the levels are being autoscaled (replaced by `[0.0]` or `[zmin]` when they should not be), reflecting the erroneous state described.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_contour_level_behavior():
    x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
    y = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    Z = X**2 + Y**2  # Simple function, all values are >= 0

    levels = [100]  # This is outside the Z range, which does not exceed 50

    try:
        plt.figure()
        cont = plt.contour(X, Y, Z, levels=levels)
        plt.close()

        # Checking if matplotlib replaced specified levels with [zmin] due to all levels being outside the data range
        assert cont.levels.tolist() == levels, f"Contour levels were incorrectly adjusted to {cont.levels}, expected {levels}."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error if assertion fails

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_contour_level_behavior()
    print("No issue detected. Contour levels behave as expected.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with success code if issue is non-existent or fixed
```

This script will more accurately reproduce the issue described, by directly asserting against the unexpected replacement of user-specified levels that are wholly outside the range of the data. This should cause an assertion failure that matches the issue's description. If the issue is fixed (i.e., the user-specified levels are respected regardless of their relationship to the data range), the script will exit with a success code (0) and print a message to indicate no issue was detected.
