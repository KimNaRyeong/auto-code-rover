Below is a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue at hand. To follow your guidance, it runs a simple test using Matplotlib to plot a contour, checks if the levels used match the provided levels when they are outside the data range, and uses the `print_stacktrace` function to show the stack trace in case of assertion failure. Lastly, it exits with the appropriate status code.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_contour_level_override():
    x = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.25)
    y = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.25)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    Z = np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)

    levels = [100]  # This is outside the generated data range
    try:
        contour_plot = plt.contour(X, Y, Z, levels=levels)
        contours = contour_plot.levels
        
        # Check if the used contour levels are as specified by the user
        assert list(contours) == levels, f"Expected levels {levels}, but got {contours}"

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code if assertion fails

# Run the test
if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_contour_level_override()
    print("Test passed, issue fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with success code if everything is correct
```

This script will raise an `AssertionError` if the Matplotlib behavior does not match the expected outcome, where the specified contour levels are not employed when they are outside the data range. Once the issue is fixed (i.e., by implementing the proposed solution or by ensuring that the provided contour levels are used as specified), the script will indicate that the test has passed and exit with code 0.
