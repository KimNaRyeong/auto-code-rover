To accurately reproduce the issue described using a Python script, the script below is designed explicitly to validate the behavior of Matplotlib's contour plotting with level settings outside the data range. The issue, as stated, arises when the specified contour levels do not align with the data provided, leading to Matplotlib automatically adjusting these levels in a way that might not be intuitive or expected, especially for batch processing applications. Here's how you would write `reproducer.py`:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    x = np.arange(0, 10, 1)
    y = np.arange(0, 10, 1)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    Z = X + Y  # Data range is from 0 to 18

    levels = [100]  # Level outside the data range

    try:
        plt.figure()
        cont = plt.contour(X, Y, Z, levels=levels)
        plt.close()

        # Validate if the only contour level set to 100 as intended
        if cont.levels[0] != 100:
            raise AssertionError(f"Expected contour levels to be [100], got {cont.levels}")
        
        print("No issue detected. Contour levels behave as expected.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit code for successful execution when the issue is fixed.
    
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code when the issue is present

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

This script is designed to exit with an error and print a stack trace if it encounters the problem as described. If the issue has been resolved (for example, if Matplotlib's behavior is updated to allow for user-specified contour levels to be respected, even when those levels fall outside the data range), the script will indicate no issue was detected and exit gracefully with code 0.
