I looked at this and #20558 and hoped / thought maybe I could find some `selector.set_*` or `selector.handle_props` or something to modify but I don't see anything. How should we update our code? (And it might be worth improving the deprecation warning to give some hints to anyone else who hits this issue.) Maybe with something like this?\n```\nselector.artists[0].set_color(color)\n```\nthe `artists[0]` is the `selector.rect`. But this just seems like a hack workaround, and if there are properties held internally it will not \"stick\" so I'm guessing it's not the right idea...\n_Originally posted by @larsoner in https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/20113#issuecomment-877345562_\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about how selectors are implemented and used in the MNE project, specifically how colors are set and updated for selector objects. Considering the issue revolves around deprecation warnings and finding the appropriate way to update selector colors post-deprecation, the following API calls would be beneficial:\n\n1. Search the codebase for instances where `selector.rect.set_color` is used, as this usage is directly related to the reported issue:\n   - `search_code(\"selector.rect.set_color\")`\n\n2. Search for any mentions or usages of `selector.rectprops` to understand how rectangle properties are being updated across the codebase:\n   - `search_code(\"selector.rectprops.update\")`\n\n3. Given the uncertainty around how to correctly apply updates to selector objects post-deprecation, it would be useful to look for methods prefixed with `set_` or properties similar to `handle_props` within the selector class, as suggested in the issue. However, without the exact name of the selector class or knowing if \"selector\" itself is the class name, we'll search broadly for methods or code snippets resembling these patterns:\n   - `search_method(\"set_\")`\n   - `search_code(\"handle_props\")`\n\nThese searches aim to provide a broader understanding of how selector objects are intended to be manipulated, specifically in relation to setting colors, within the MNE codebase. Understanding the context in which these patterns are used or are supposed to be used will be crucial in recommending a sustainable solution to the reported issue."
