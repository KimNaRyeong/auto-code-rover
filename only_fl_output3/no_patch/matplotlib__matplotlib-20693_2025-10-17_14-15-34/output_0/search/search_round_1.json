I looked at this and #20558 and hoped / thought maybe I could find some `selector.set_*` or `selector.handle_props` or something to modify but I don't see anything. How should we update our code? (And it might be worth improving the deprecation warning to give some hints to anyone else who hits this issue.) Maybe with something like this?\n```\nselector.artists[0].set_color(color)\n```\nthe `artists[0]` is the `selector.rect`. But this just seems like a hack workaround, and if there are properties held internally it will not \"stick\" so I'm guessing it's not the right idea...\n_Originally posted by @larsoner in https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/20113#issuecomment-877345562_\n</issue>"

Considering the issue revolves around deprecation warnings and finding the appropriate way to update selector colors post-deprecation, the following API calls would be beneficial:\n\n1. Search the codebase for instances where `selector.rect.set_color` is used, as this usage is directly related to the reported issue:\n   - `search_code(\"selector.rect.set_color\")`\n\n2. Search for any mentions or usages of `selector.rectprops` to understand how rectangle properties are being updated across the codebase:\n   - `search_code(\"selector.rectprops.update\")`\n\n3. Given the uncertainty around how to correctly apply updates to selector objects post-deprecation, it would be useful to look for methods prefixed with `set_` or properties similar to `handle_props` within the selector class, as suggested in the issue. However, without the exact name of the selector class or knowing if \"selector\" itself is the class name, we'll search broadly for methods or code snippets resembling these patterns:\n   - `search_method(\"set_\")`\n   - `search_code(\"handle_props\")`\n\nThese searches aim to provide a broader understanding of how selector objects are intended to be manipulated, specifically in relation to setting colors, within the MNE codebase. Understanding the context in which these patterns are used or are supposed to be used will be crucial in recommending a sustainable solution to the reported issue."

        "content": "Given the results from the initial set of API calls:\n\n1. **`search_code(\"selector.rect.set_color\")` and `search_code(\"selector.rectprops.update\")`:**\n   - **Analysis:** These results indicate that the specific code snippets `selector.rect.set_color` and `selector.rectprops.update` do not directly appear in the codebase. This might suggest that the usage patterns mentioned in the issue are either outdated, used in a different form, or are part of higher-level abstractions not straightforwardly visible through simple code search.\n   - **Next Steps:** It would be wise to search directly for classes or methods that relate to the \"selector\" entity within the MNE context, specifically focusing on widgets or components that deal with interactive elements. Searching for the class or methods related to \"selector\" could yield the necessary context.\n\n2. **`search_method(\"set_\")`:**\n   - **Analysis:** This search parameter was likely too broad, leading to a non-specific result (in this case, indicating the method couldn't be found, which is expected given the generic nature of the query).\n   - **Next Steps:** Considering the non-specific result, refining the search to more closely investigate setter methods within the context of selectors or interactive widgets (if we can identify a specific class or widget name from further analysis) would be more productive.\n\n3. **`search_code(\"handle_props\")`:**\n   - **Analysis:** Finding 19 instances of `handle_props` in `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py` is significant. Given that the issue mentions looking for a potential method or property similar to `handle_props` for updating selector properties, this result could be exactly where we need to look. The presence of this term within `widgets.py` suggests that there may be infrastructure in place for handling properties of interactive widget components, possibly including selectors, in a generic or unified manner.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** The intended behavior, as inferred from the issue, should allow for updating properties of selector objects (or their visual representation) without directly manipulating low-level attributes and doing so in a way that is consistent with new API guidelines or deprecation resolutions.\n   - **Relationship to the Bug:** Since the original mechanism for setting selector colors is deprecated, `handle_props` (or mechanisms it represents) could be part of the new intended approach for property manipulation, including visual styles.\n\n**Next Step Recommendations Based on Analysis:**\n\n1. Investigate `handle_props` within `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py` to understand how it's used and whether it can apply to our selector color update problem:\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"lib/matplotlib/widgets.py\", line_number, 10)` for each mention of `handle_props` found in the file. Since the exact line numbers are not provided, inspecting instances within the file is essential but requires specific line numbers to proceed efficiently.\n\n2. Since direct queries for `selector.rect.set_color` and `selector.rectprops.update` did not yield results, and given the broad and unsuccessful search for `set_` methods, narrowing the exploration to specific widget or selector implementations in MNE might provide the right context:\n   - `search_class(\"Selector\")` or alternative class names if \"Selector\" is not accurate.\n   - Because `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py` was identified as relevant, it might be beneficial to look for classes within this file that relate to interactive selection widgets:\n     - `search_class_in_file(class_name, \"lib/matplotlib/widgets.py\")` with `class_name` replaced by actual widget/selector class names identified in further investigation.\n\nThese steps are designed to draw a closer link between the missing functionality mentioned in the issue and the current implementation details available in the MNE/matplotlib project codebase."

Given the information at hand and the absence of specific search results for \"selector.rect.set_color\" and \"selector.rectprops.update\", as well as the broad and inconclusive result for \"set_\" method searches, we cannot precisely pinpoint the bug locations without additional context or assumptions.\n\nHowever, based on the returned context regarding `handle_props` within `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py`, we can infer that adjustments related to property handling for selectors, specifically regarding deprecation warnings and the appropriate way to update selector colors, will likely need to be made in this general area.\n\nIntended behavior for resolving the issue, with an abstract approach assuming `handle_props` is central to the new implementation strategy, may involve:\n\n- **File:** `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py`\n- **Class/Method:** Potentially within a class that represents the \"selector\" functionality. This would involve ensuring there are clear and updated methods for setting the color of selector components that adhere to the new guidelines post-deprecation.\n- **Intended Behavior:** Create or update methods within the selector's class to manage color and other properties without directly accessing low-level attributes like `rect`. Implement a mechanism, possibly leveraging `handle_props` or similar, that allows for a clean, maintainable way to update visual properties. This approach should respect the encapsulation of the selector's properties and provide a clear migration path from deprecated methods.\n\nWithout more precise details on the class structure or existing methods involved with the \"selector\" functionality, this is an educated direction based on the available context. Further investigation into `lib/matplotlib/widgets.py` and related classes for interactively selecting elements in MNE plots would be necessary for crafting a specific patch."
