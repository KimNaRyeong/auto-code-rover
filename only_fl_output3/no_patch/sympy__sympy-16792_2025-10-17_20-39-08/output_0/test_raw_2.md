Certainly! Let's correct the oversight and ensure that all necessary imports and error handling are properly managed in the script. This version of `reproducer.py` is designed to catch the specific issue reported, along with handling the missing `sys` module import for proper script exit codes management.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        from sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap
        from sympy import MatrixSymbol
        import numpy as np

        x = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)
        expr = 1.0
        f = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')
        result = f(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))
        assert result == 1.0, "Result does not match expected value of 1.0"
        print("No error encountered. Issue may have been fixed.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate the assertion failed but was caught

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(0)  # Exiting with code 0 to indicate the script ran correctly and caught an issue

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script will attempt to reproduce the reported issue involving `autowrap` with the Cython backend in SymPy, specifically targeting the problem where array arguments do not appear in the wrapped expression and lead to a `TypeError`. The provided `print_stacktrace` function is used to detail exceptions, ensuring clear visibility into the part of the code that failed during execution.

It exits with code 0 when the issue described is encountered and properly caught, adhering to the original request. Conversely, if an assertion fails but is caught, it will exit with code 1, signaling a different type of error encountered during the script's execution.

Before executing this script, please ensure SymPy, Cython, and NumPy are installed in your Python environment. If these packages are not installed, you may encounter an `ImportError`. They can typically be installed via pip with commands like `pip install sympy`, `pip install cython`, and `pip install numpy`.
