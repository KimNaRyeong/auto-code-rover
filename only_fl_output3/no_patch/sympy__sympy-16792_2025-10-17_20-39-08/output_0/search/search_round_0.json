        "content": "<issue>autowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr\nWhen using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:\n```python\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\nimport numpy as np\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\nexpr = 1.0\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\n```\nThis should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:\n```python\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\n```\nA little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:\n```C\ndouble autofunc(double x) {\ndouble autofunc_result;\nautofunc_result = 1.0;\nreturn autofunc_result;\n}\n```\n(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)\nI've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:\n```python\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\nimport numpy as np\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\n# now output depends on x\nexpr = x[0,0]\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\n# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\n```\nThis may seem like a silly issue (\"why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?\"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.\nI think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue outlined, we need more context on certain components of the SymPy project, particularly around the `autowrap` function, the `codegen` process for Cython, and how array arguments are handled. Specifically, we are interested in how `MatrixSymbol` arguments are processed in the context of Cython code generation and what might lead to the incorrect generation of the C function signature.\n\nHere are the API calls to get the required context:\n\n1. Search for the `autowrap` function to understand its implementation and how it decides to generate code for different types of arguments.\n   - `search_method(\"autowrap\")`\n\n2. Given that the issue might be rooted in the code generation (\"codegen\") process when utilizing Cython, we should look for classes or methods related to Cython code generation. This would potentially include classes or methods responsible for generating C function signatures from SymPy expressions.\n   - `search_code(\"CythonCodeWrapper\")`\n   - `search_code(\"codegen\")`\n\n3. To understand how `MatrixSymbol` arguments are transformed into code, specifically within the context of Cython backend, we need to see if there are any specific handlers or transformations for `MatrixSymbol`.\n   - `search_code(\"MatrixSymbol\")`\n\n4. Since the issue involves the incorrect handling of array arguments (where they should be represented as `double *` in C but are incorrectly being treated as `double`), we should look for where argument types for the generated C functions are determined.\n   - `search_code(\"double autofunc\")`\n\nThis set of API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how `autowrap` works with the Cython backend and where things might be going awry with array argument handling in the code generation process, leading to the incorrect C function signature."
