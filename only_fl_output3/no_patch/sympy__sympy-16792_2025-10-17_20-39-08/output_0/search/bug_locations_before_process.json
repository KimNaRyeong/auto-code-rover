This modification should carefully check if an argument is a MatrixSymbol and modify the Cython and ultimately the C code generation accordingly. The existing functionality for scalar arguments and other types of inputs should remain intact."

        "intended_behavior": "Enhanced verification or preprocessing may need to be added within or around this method to ensure that when expressions and their corresponding arguments are processed\u2014especially those that do not directly contribute to the final expression (like the mentioned MatrixSymbol that doesn't appear in the expression)\u2014they are still correctly accounted for in the generated code's function signatures. This could involve adjusting the logic that determines the types and roles of arguments in the generated code, especially focusing on instances where the backend is cython to ensure array data is treated correctly while preserving its handling of arguments for other backends and cases."
