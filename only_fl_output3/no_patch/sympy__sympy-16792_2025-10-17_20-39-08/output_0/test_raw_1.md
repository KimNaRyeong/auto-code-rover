Given the output from your previous attempt to execute `reproducer.py`, the error seems to originate from a missing `numpy` module rather than directly from the issue you are trying to reproduce. However, this script has been crafted to explicitly catch the primary issue described, as well as any assertion errors. If the issue is accurately reproduced (i.e., a `TypeError`), the script will handle and indicate this correctly. 

Please ensure all dependencies, including `sympy` and `numpy`, are installed in your environment before running this script. If your environment still lacks `numpy`, causing the `ModuleNotFoundError`, you would need to install it (for example, using `pip install numpy`) and ensure your Python environment is correctly set up to execute the script.
