        "content": "The provided code snippet is the implementation of the `parse_http_date` function found in `django/utils/http.py`. This function is designed to parse a date formatted as specified by HTTP RFC7231 section 7.1.1.1, supporting three different formats as per RFC: RFC1123 dates, RFC850 dates, and ASCTIME dates. The function ultimately converts the parsed date into an integer representing the time in seconds since the Unix epoch, in UTC.\n\n**1. What does this part of the code do?**\n\n- The function starts by iterating over three different regular expression patterns corresponding to the three supported date formats.\n- Upon finding a match, it uses the matched groups to parse out components of the date, such as the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second.\n- For years specified as two digits (which is allowed in RFC850 dates), the code has a hard-coded logic (lines 178-182) to determine the century:\n  - If the year is less than 70, 2000 is added to it, implying the year falls in the range 2000-2069.\n  - Else, 1900 is added, implying the year is in the range 1970-1999.\n- After parsing and adjusting the year, the function converts the date components into a Python `datetime` object, which is then converted into UTC seconds.\n\n**2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\nThe issue with the provided logic revolves around how two-digit years are interpreted. The current implementation hard-codes the assumption that 0-69 maps to 2000-2069 and 70-99 maps to 1970-1999. However, according to the issue description which quotes RFC 7231, a two-digit year should be interpreted as the most recent year in the past that matches the last two digits if it appears to be more than 50 years in the future. The reported bug is due to this logic not comparing the two-digit year against the current year to make this determination, potentially leading to incorrect year calculation for dates.\n\n**3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n- The intended behavior would be to dynamically adjust how two-digit years are interpreted based on the current year, instead of the current static range checks. This means:\n  - For a given two-digit year, the code should calculate whether that year, when interpreted as being in the 20th or 21st century, would place it over 50 years in the future relative to the current year. \n  - If it is more than 50 years ahead, then the year should be considered as referring to the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n- To implement this logic correctly, the code would need additional checks against the current year to dynamically adjust the century of the two-digit year based on the current date at the time of parsing.\n\nThe necessary update would involve replacing the static year interpretation logic with a more dynamic approach that considers the current year to comply with RFC 7231's guidelines."

Specifically:\n   \n   - The logic in lines 178 to 182 needs to be enhanced to dynamically determine the century of a two-digit year based on the current year at the time of parsing. This means if parsing happens in the year 2023, and the two-digit year is '30', this should be interpreted as 2030 because it is not more than 50 years in the future. Conversely, if the two-digit year is '95', then it should be interpreted as 1995, as that is the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n   \n   - The updated logic should calculate the full year from the two digits by assessing the current year and determining whether adding the two digits to either 1900 or 2000 would place the year more than 50 years in the future. If so, it should select the century that places the year in the past, not the future.\n   \n   Such a dynamic adjustment adheres to the RFC 7231 stipulation and ensures that dates are interpreted correctly, regardless of the current year, ensuring both backward compatibility and future-proofing the function."
