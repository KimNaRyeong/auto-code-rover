While this indeed corresponds to `AxesImage.get_size`, this is not consistent with the numpy API, where `array.shape = (nrows, ncols)` and `array.size = nrows * ncols`.\nPerhaps we can consider 1) tweaking `__str__` to `AxesImage(shape=(nrows, ncols))` instead, and add `get_shape` as an alias for `get_size`?  Alternatively, `get_shape` could return `self._A.shape` (i.e., including whether the data is colormapped, RGB, or RGBA), and we could use *that* info in `__str__`?  (displaying whether the data is colormapped/RGB/RGBA seems reasonably useful)\n### Proposed solution\n_No response_\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the `AxesImage` class from the provided code snippet gives us insight into how images are represented and manipulated within this specific library, most likely part of the Matplotlib project (considering the file path and the context). \n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThe `AxesImage` class definition starts with an `__init__` method that initializes an instance of `AxesImage` with a variety of parameters such as `cmap` (color map), `norm` (normalization), `interpolation`, `origin`, `extent`, `filternorm`, `filterrad`, `resample`, and `interpolation_stage`, along with other keyword arguments. This setup suggests `AxesImage` is a customizable component for image handling in plots, allowing for detailed configuration of how an image is rendered.\n\nThe class also defines methods for handling the image extent (`set_extent` and `get_extent`), retrieving cursor data (`get_cursor_data`), and making the actual image (`make_image`). The `get_window_extent` and `_check_unsampled_image` methods suggest functionality for managing how images are viewed and ensuring they meet certain criteria before being rendered.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\nThe issue describes a discrepancy between the terminology and functionality in `AxesImage` and common NumPy conventions: size vs. shape. NumPy uses `.shape` to describe the dimensions of an array, while the current `AxesImage.__str__` refers to `.get_size`, which might only return width and height (consistent with describing size but not shape) and might not include depth, which would be relevant for color images or specific rendering details. The issue suggests either creating a `get_shape` method that aligns with NumPy's `.shape` attribute or adjusting `get_size` to include depth information, thereby providing a more complete description of the image dimensions.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\nThe intended behavior, according to the issue, would be for `AxesImage` to either:\n- Include a `get_shape` method that acts as an alias for `get_size` or actually returns the shape (including depth) of the image data it represents. This method would ideally reflect the dimensions of the image in a way that's consistent with NumPy's `array.shape`.\n- Modify the `__str__` representation to display information that is more useful and standard-compliant, potentially showing the image's dimensions in a way that includes depth information when relevant.\n\nTo further investigate and address the issue, a logical next step might include examining implementations of `__str__`, `get_size`, and the handling of `_A` (presumably the attribute holding the actual image data). This would help in understanding if `get_size` could be adjusted or if a new method should be created, and how the `__str__` method could accurately represent the full dimensions of the image data."
