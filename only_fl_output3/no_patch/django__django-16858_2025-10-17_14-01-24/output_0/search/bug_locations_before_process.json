        "intended_behavior": "The method `get_db_prep_value` should be modified to utilize `get_prep_value` for processing the value before it is sent to the database. This change ensures that any custom logic in overridden `get_prep_value` methods by developers is executed as expected. This means replacing or augmenting the direct call to `connection.ops.adapt_json_value(value, self.encoder)` with a call that first processes the value using `self.get_prep_value(value)`. This modification ensures that the custom `get_prep_value` logic is respected, maintaining backward compatibility and adhering to the documented expectations for extending Django model fields. This approach preserves existing functionality by ensuring that any value sent to the database is processed according to both Django's built-in serialization logic and any custom transformations defined in `get_prep_value`."
