        "content": "<issue>`get_prep_value` no longer called for JSONField\nDescription\n(last modified by Julie Rymer)\nHello, I just upgraded from django 4.1 to 4.2 and I have a custom JSONField with a get_prep_value() override that stopped working. After searching a bit, I saw that was because JSONField.get_prep_value() is no longer called in 4.2 (\u200b5c23d9f0c32f166c81ecb6f3f01d5077a6084318).\nI think this issue need a resolution either:\nJSONField should call get_prep_value() like all other fields type, because this is the method that the \u200bdocumentation tell us to override in custom fields.\nOtherwise we need to override get_db_prep_value() which is heavier and does not have the same purpose. I think simply replacing connection.ops.adapt_json_value(value, self.encoder) with connection.ops.adapt_json_value(self.get_prep_value(value), self.encoder) in JSONField.get_db_prep_value() would fix this\nIf there is a good reason to no longer call get_prep_value(), this exception for JSONField should be clearly documented in \u200bcustom get_prep_value() doc. It should also be added to \u200bBackwards incompatible changes in 4.2 release note because I got stuck with this issue with no warning when migrating.\nPS: #34397 seems to be related but in fact is about Django 3.2 so it is not the current issue\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue described, we need to understand how `JSONField` and its method `get_db_prep_value` work in Django 4.2, and how they interact with `get_prep_value` now. We also need to verify the commit mentioned (`5c23d9f0c32f166c81ecb6f3f01d5077a6084318`) to see the changes made to JSONField. The first step is to locate the definitions and usages of these functions and the `JSONField` class itself. Therefore, the following API calls would be appropriate:\n\n1. `search_class(\"JSONField\")`: This will help us locate the file(s) where `JSONField` is defined, which is crucial for inspecting its methods and any recent changes.\n\n2. `search_method(\"get_prep_value\")`: Since `get_prep_value` is no longer being called for `JSONField` in Django 4.2, we need to find all occurrences of this method to understand its intended use across different field types.\n\n3. `search_method(\"get_db_prep_value\")`: This will give us an overview of where `get_db_prep_value` is implemented, and how it's being used, especially in relation to `JSONField`.\n\n4. `search_code(\"connection.ops.adapt_json_value(value, self.encoder)\")`: Looking for this specific code snippet will help us understand the current implementation of `get_db_prep_value` for `JSONField` and how it's different from the proposed solution in the issue description."

Let\u2019s go through the analysis based on the questions:\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\n- The `JSONField` class defined in `django/db/models/fields/json.py` is the one most relevant to the issue. It inherits from the base `Field` class and introduces or overrides methods to serialize and deserialize JSON data to and from the database. Notably, it includes a `get_db_prep_value` method that is responsible for preparing the field's value before it's sent to the database.\n\n- The `get_db_prep_value` method, specifically, prepares a value for database insertion by ensuring it's properly serialized. The code snippet found indicates that it directly uses `connection.ops.adapt_json_value(value, self.encoder)` to serialize the value, bypassing `get_prep_value`.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue at hand emerges from the change in how `get_db_prep_value` is implemented in Django 4.2, particularly how it no longer calls the `get_prep_value` method for `JSONField`. This deviation means that custom logic placed in `get_prep_value` by developers extending `JSONField` is ignored, potentially breaking applications upon upgrading to Django 4.2.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior, as suggested in the issue, would incorporate a call to `get_prep_value` within `get_db_prep_value`. This integration ensures that any custom processing or validation done in overridden `get_prep_value` methods is accounted for when the field value is prepared for the database. Specifically, instead of passing the value directly to `connection.ops.adapt_json_value`, it should pass the result of `self.get_prep_value(value)`, allowing the custom logic to be applied.\n\nBased on this analysis, a potential code change would involve modifying the `get_db_prep_value` within `django/db/models/fields/json.py` to incorporate a call to `get_prep_value`. This alteration ensures backward compatibility and adheres to the Django documentation's suggestion that `get_prep_value` is the appropriate method for custom field value preparation logic.\n\nGiven the clear path towards a resolution, the next steps involve creating a patch for the `get_db_prep_value` method of `JSONField`. This patch would ensure `get_prep_value` is called as part of the value preparation process, reinstating the custom field behavior expected by developers."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This change ensures that any custom logic in overridden `get_prep_value` methods by developers is executed as expected. This means replacing or augmenting the direct call to `connection.ops.adapt_json_value(value, self.encoder)` with a call that first processes the value using `self.get_prep_value(value)`.\n\n   The modified method might look something like this:\n   \n   ```python\n   def get_db_prep_value(self, value, connection, prepared=False):\n       if value is None:\n           return value\n       elif hasattr(value, \"as_sql\"):\n           return value\n       # Incorporate get_prep_value into the serialization process\n       prepped_value = self.get_prep_value(value)\n       return connection.ops.adapt_json_value(prepped_value, self.encoder)\n   ```\n\n   This modification ensures that the custom `get_prep_value` logic is respected, maintaining backward compatibility and adhering to the documented expectations for extending Django model fields. This approach preserves existing functionality by ensuring that any value sent to the database is processed according to both Django's built-in serialization logic and any custom transformations defined in `get_prep_value`."
