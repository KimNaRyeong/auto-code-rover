Let's make the following API calls to gather this information:\n\n1. search_class(\"S\"): To find out where the class `S` is defined in the codebase since it seems to be a central part of the issue.\n2. search_method(\"Half\"): Since `S.Half` suggests that `Half` might be a method or a property of class `S`, it's important to identify its implementation to understand how it's contributing to the issue."
