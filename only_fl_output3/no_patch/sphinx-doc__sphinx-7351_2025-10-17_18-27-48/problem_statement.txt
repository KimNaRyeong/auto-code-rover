Files with same name but different extensions leads to unexpected behaviour
**Describe the bug**

If there are multiple files with the same name but different file extensions;
sphinx will silently choose only one to parse:

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Given I have an extension installed to parse  `md`

with:
```
index.rst
a.md
a.rst
```

index.rst:

```restructuredtext
.. toctree::
    a.md
```

This will actually include `a.rst` in the document, not `a.md`

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

Ideally you would have a config option to specify the order of preference for file extensions,
or if not set, a warning would be logged.

**Your project**
Link to your sphinx project, or attach zipped small project sample.
