Given the previous attempt did not directly address a successful reproduction of the issue due to environment setup errors, let's adjust the approach, keeping the requested printing function for clarity in errors.

This script aims to programmatically create a Sphinx project with the described file structure, adjusting to avoid environmental errors and making sure Sphinx is correctly invoked from within the script. The script will still check for the incorrectly prioritized document inclusion (`.rst` over `.md` despite explicit directive), but it will bypass directly calling Sphinx through the command line in ways that previously led to errors, instead relying more heavily on Python functionality available from Sphinx APIs directly whenever possible.

```python
import os
import sys
from sphinx.application import Sphinx

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_files():
    if not os.path.exists('_build'):
        os.makedirs('_build')
    with open('index.rst', 'w') as f:
        f.write('.. toctree::\n   a\n')
    with open('a.rst', 'w') as f:
        f.write('This is a.rst file')
    with open('a.md', 'w') as f:
        f.write('# This is a.md file')
    with open('conf.py', 'w') as f:
        f.write("extensions = ['myst_parser']\n")

def build_sphinx():
    srcdir = os.path.abspath('.')
    confdir = srcdir
    outdir = os.path.join(srcdir, '_build', 'html')
    doctreedir = os.path.join(srcdir, '_build', 'doctrees')

    app = Sphinx(srcdir, confdir, outdir, doctreedir, 'html')
    app.build(force_all=True)
    if app.statuscode:
        raise RuntimeError("Sphinx build encountered a problem")

def verify_issue():
    try:
        setup_files()
        build_sphinx()
        
        with open(os.path.join('_build', 'html', 'a.html'), 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
            if 'This is a.md file' in content:
                # This means a.md was processed instead of a.rst, contrary to the issue described
                print("Test inconclusive: .md file was processed, indicating Sphinx's behavior might have changed or setup is incorrect.")
            elif 'This is a.rst file' in content:
                raise AssertionError("Sphinx processed a.rst instead of a.md, reproducing the issue.")
            else:
                raise AssertionError("Unexpected document content detected, unable to verify the specific issue.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("The issue is fixed, or could not be reproduced.")
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    verify_issue()
```

### Notes on Adjustments:

- This script directly uses `Sphinx` from `sphinx.application` for building the documents, hopefully averting path and environment issues that led to the import error in the previous attempt.
- It programmatically sets up `index.rst`, `a.rst`, `a.md`, and a minimal `conf.py` within the current directory. This setup simulates the file structure you provided in the issue description, focusing on accurately reproducing the scenario within the Sphinx build process.
- It then verifies if the build output contains content from `a.rst` when `a.md` was explicitly stated in the TOC, aiming to identify if the described issue persists.
