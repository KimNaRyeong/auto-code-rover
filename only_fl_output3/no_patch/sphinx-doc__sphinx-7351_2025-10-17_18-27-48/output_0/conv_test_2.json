This script is designed to run in the root directory of a Sphinx project.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef setup_sphinx_project():\n    # Create necessary files in the project directory\n    with open('index.rst', 'w') as f:\n        f.write('.. toctree::\\n    a.md\\n')\n    \n    with open('a.rst', 'w') as f:\n        f.write('..

It sets up the project environment, including the `index.rst`, `a.md`, and `a.rst` files, with the content as described.\n2. It also generates a minimal `conf.py` configuration file enabling the `myst_parser`.\n3. Then, it runs the Sphinx build process via the `sphinx-build` command.\n4. It checks the generated HTML for `a.html` to determine which file Sphinx processed. The assertion checks for the presence of content specific to `a.md`, but due to the reported issue, we expect the content to come from `a.rst`.\n5. If the issue is present (meaning `a.rst` was chosen instead of `a.md`), the script should raise an `AssertionError` as expected.\n6. If the build process fails or if any other exception occurs, it prints a detailed stack trace."
