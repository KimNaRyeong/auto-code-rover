To create a script `reproducer.py` that will attempt to replicate the issue described, we'll simulate the environment and the steps necessary to reproduce the issue with Sphinx, including file creation and Sphinx configuration programmatically. This script checks if Sphinx indeed prefers `a.rst` over `a.md` despite the explicit mention of `a.md` in `index.rst`'s TOC. If it detects the issue, it will raise an `AssertionError`. This script is designed to run in the root directory of a Sphinx project.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_project():
    # Create necessary files in the project directory
    with open('index.rst', 'w') as f:
        f.write('.. toctree::\n    a.md\n')
    
    with open('a.rst', 'w') as f:
        f.write('.. This is a.rst file\n')

    with open('a.md', 'w') as f:
        f.write('# This is a.md file')

    # Sphinx config minimal setup
    with open('conf.py', 'w') as f:
        f.write("extensions = ['myst_parser']\n")

def build_sphinx():
    command = ['sphinx-build', '.', '_build']
    result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result

def verify_issue():
    try:
        setup_sphinx_project()
        result = build_sphinx()
        if result.returncode != 0:
            print("Sphinx build failed", file=sys.stderr)
            print(result.stdout, file=sys.stderr)
            print(result.stderr, file=sys.stderr)
            sys.exit(1)

        with open('_build/a.html', 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
            # Check if the content is from a.md, but it's expected to see a.rst due to the bug
            if '# This is a.md file' in content:
                raise AssertionError("Sphinx incorrectly processed a.md instead of a.rst.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("The issue is fixed, or could not be reproduced.")
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    verify_issue()
```

This script works by doing the following:
1. It sets up the project environment, including the `index.rst`, `a.md`, and `a.rst` files, with the content as described.
2. It also generates a minimal `conf.py` configuration file enabling the `myst_parser`.
3. Then, it runs the Sphinx build process via the `sphinx-build` command.
4. It checks the generated HTML for `a.html` to determine which file Sphinx processed. The assertion checks for the presence of content specific to `a.md`, but due to the reported issue, we expect the content to come from `a.rst`.
5. If the issue is present (meaning `a.rst` was chosen instead of `a.md`), the script should raise an `AssertionError` as expected.
6. If the build process fails or if any other exception occurs, it prints a detailed stack trace.
