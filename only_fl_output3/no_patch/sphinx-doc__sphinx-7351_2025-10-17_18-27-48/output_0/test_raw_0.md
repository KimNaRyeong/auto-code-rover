Here's a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that you can use to reproduce the issue described. This script will create a mock Sphinx project with the given file structure and content, run Sphinx to build the documentation, and then check the generated output to see if the unexpected behavior occurred. If the issue is present, it will print a stack trace.

```python
import os
import subprocess
from pathlib import Path
import shutil

def setup_sphinx_project():
    """Sets up a minimal Sphinx project to reproduce the issue."""
    os.makedirs("source", exist_ok=True)
    
    with open("source/conf.py", "w") as f:
        f.write("extensions = ['myst_parser']\n")
        
    with open("source/index.rst", "w") as f:
        f.write(".. toctree::\n    a.md\n")
        
    with open("source/a.md", "w") as f:
        f.write("# This is a.md")
        
    with open("source/a.rst", "w") as f:
        f.write(".. _a:\n\nThis is a.rst")

def run_sphinx():
    """Runs Sphinx to build the project documentation."""
    subprocess.run(["sphinx-build", "-b", "html", "source", "build"], check=True)

def check_output():
    """Checks the output to determine if the issue exists."""
    with open("build/a.html", "r") as f:
        content = f.read()
        if "This is a.md" not in content:
            raise AssertionError("a.md was expected to be included, but it wasn't.")

def clean_up():
    """Cleans up the created files and directories."""
    shutil.rmtree("source", ignore_errors=True)
    shutil.rmtree("build", ignore_errors=True)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        setup_sphinx_project()
        run_sphinx()
        check_output()
        print("Issue is fixed.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        clean_up()
        exit(1)
    clean_up()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Before running the script, ensure that Sphinx and the `myst_parser` extension are installed in your Python environment. You can install these with pip if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install sphinx myst-parser
```

Run the script from the root directory of your Sphinx project using Python 3. If the issue is present, the script will raise an `AssertionError`, print a stack trace detailing where the issue occurred, and exit with code 1. If the issue is fixed, the script will print "Issue is fixed." and exit with code 0.
