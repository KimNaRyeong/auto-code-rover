        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we should focus on the mechanisms related to file parsing and extension handling by Sphinx, particularly looking into how Sphinx decides which file to include when a name conflict exists (same base name, different extensions). Given the context, it's relevant to focus on classes or methods involved in the document parsing, especially those that handle the inclusion of files into the document.\n\n1. We should look into how Sphinx handles the `toctree` directive since this is directly involved in including files into the document structure. This directive is mentioned in the `index.rst` content provided in the issue.\n\n2. The issue mentions the usage of a particular Sphinx extension `myst-parser`, which suggests that the handling of `.md` files might be relevant. Likely, Sphinx has a system for prioritizing or selecting file extensions when multiple candidates are available. Understanding how Sphinx integrates with extensions for file parsing could uncover this mechanism.\n\nGiven these considerations, here are the search API calls that might provide more context:\n\n- Check how Sphinx processes the `toctree` directive:\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"toctree\")\n```\n\n- Since the issue involves file extensions and possibly Sphinx's file selection logic, let's see if there is a known method or class handling file extensions:\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"resolve_extension_conflict\")\nsearch_method(\"select_file_extension\")\n```\n\n- The `myst-parser` extension is crucial here, so understanding how Sphinx handles extensions for parsing could give insights. However, without knowing the exact method names or classes Sphinx uses for extension handling, it's a bit of a guess. A generic approach to see how extensions are loaded or managed might be:\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"load_extension\")\nsearch_method(\"add_extension\")\n```\n\n- To get a broader context, seeing if there are any specific classes dedicated to handling documents or file parsing can be useful:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Document\")\nsearch_class(\"Parser\")\n```\n\nThese calls are designed to unearth mechanisms Sphinx uses for file parsing, extension handling, and document inclusion, which should help in developing a patch to address the issue described."
