This would enable Sphinx to resolve conflicts where multiple files share the same basename but have different extensions. The configuration system would use this information to determine which file to prioritize during the build process. If this option is not set, Sphinx could maintain its current behavior or emit a warning indicating the conflict and suggesting the use of the new configuration option for resolution."

        "intended_behavior": "Modify the document collection/processing logic to consult the `file_extension_priority` configuration when encountering files with the same basename but differing extensions. This logic should then prioritize or select files based on the user-defined order in the configuration. If conflicts arise and no preference is defined, it should either follow a default priority order or, if feasible, log a warning to inform users of the unspecified conflict, encouraging them to define their preference via the new configuration option."
