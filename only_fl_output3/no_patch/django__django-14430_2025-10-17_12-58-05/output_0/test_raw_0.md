Below is a `reproducer.py` script designed to run at the root of a Django project. It reproduces the issue described above by attempting three different queries and asserting the expected behavior. If the issue exists, the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace indicating where the issue occurred.

Note: Before running this script, ensure that the Django environment is properly set up and that the `OrderItem` model exists and is appropriately migrated in your database. If needed, modify the script to adapt to your specific model and field names.

```python
import os
import django
from django.db.models import Sum, Value
from django.db.models.functions import Coalesce
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand

os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "your_project.settings")
django.setup()

# Assuming 'OrderItem' is your model and 'quantity' is a field in your model.
# You might need to adjust these to fit your actual model names and fields.
from your_app.models import OrderItem

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_aggregate_coalesce():
    try:
        matched_result = OrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[1]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))
        assert matched_result['test'] is not None, "Matched queryset did not return a sum"

        unmatched_result = OrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[-1]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))
        assert unmatched_result['test'] == 0, "Unmatched queryset did not return 0"

        empty_list_result = OrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))
        assert empty_list_result['test'] == 0, "Queryset with empty list did not return 0"

        print("All tests passed successfully. The issue is fixed.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_aggregate_coalesce()
```

Make sure to replace `"your_project.settings"` with the path to your project's settings module and `your_app.models` with the path to your model `OrderItem`. The script assumes the issue as described: that an aggregation with a coalesce function returns `None` instead of `0` when used with an empty list in the filter's `__in` clause. When the issue is present, an `AssertionError` will be raised, and the stack trace will be printed. When the issue is fixed, the script will complete successfully without any error.
