See below:\n# Test with matched Queryset. Sum will return 50\nOrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[1]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))\n>>>{'test': 50}\n# Test with unmatched Queryset. Sum will return 0\nOrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[-1]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))\n>>> {'test':0}\n# Test with unmatched Queryset (using empty list). EmptyResultSet returned because of empty list. Sum will return NONE\nOrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))\n>>> {'test': None}\nSimon Charette on django-users suggested the following:\nFrom what I understand the ORM simply doesn't perform any query in this case\nas the pk__in lookup cannot match any OrderItem and result in an\nEmptyResultSet exception[1].\nThis exception is caught in the Query.get_aggregation() method where all\naggregates are converted to None[2].\nI suppose we should alter the except EmptyResultSet clause to account for\nouter_query.annotation_select items that are Coalesce() instances used with\nValue() but I'm unsure about how it should be done.\n[1] \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/2e0cd26ffb29189add1e0435913fd1490f52b20d/django/db/models/lookups.py#L221-L223\n[2] \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/2e0cd26ffb29189add1e0435913fd1490f52b20d/django/db/models/sql/query.py#L439-L445\nSee full discussion here:\n\u200bhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/django-users/HGD3Vv3IerA\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address this issue efficiently, we need to understand how the `EmptyResultSet` exception affects the processing of aggregates, especially in the context of using `Coalesce` with `Sum` and `Value` within an aggregate query. Based on the description and links provided in the issue, I'll make several API calls to gather the required context:\n\n1. Search for where the `EmptyResultSet` exception is defined and used within the codebase as it directly relates to the described problem.\n2. Check the `Query.get_aggregation()` method mentioned, to understand how aggregates are converted to `None` upon catching an `EmptyResultSet` exception. This will give insight into where modifications might be needed to handle `Coalesce` and `Value` differently.\n3. Explore how `Coalesce` is implemented or used within aggregations to pinpoint where the exception might affect its expected behavior.\n\nGiven these objectives, here are the API calls I'll make:\n\n- `search_code(\"EmptyResultSet\")`: This will help locate where `EmptyResultSet` is used and possibly give additional context on its implementation and handling within the framework.\n- `search_method_in_file(\"get_aggregation\", \"django/db/models/sql/query.py\")`: Since the path to the file was already provided, this call will help us directly inspect the method where the exception handling affects the aggregation result.\n- `search_class(\"Coalesce\")`: To understand how `Coalesce` is implemented and if there are any specific catch mechanisms for exceptions like `EmptyResultSet` or conditional handling that could influence the outcome of aggregate queries.\n\nThese calls should provide us with a solid understanding of the affected components and suggest where changes might be made to address the issue."
