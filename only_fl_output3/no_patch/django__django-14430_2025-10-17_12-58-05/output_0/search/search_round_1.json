Based on the description and links provided in the issue, I'll make several API calls to gather the required context:\n\n1. Search for where the `EmptyResultSet` exception is defined and used within the codebase as it directly relates to the described problem.\n2. Check the `Query.get_aggregation()` method mentioned, to understand how aggregates are converted to `None` upon catching an `EmptyResultSet` exception. This will give insight into where modifications might be needed to handle `Coalesce` and `Value` differently.\n3. Explore how `Coalesce` is implemented or used within aggregations to pinpoint where the exception might affect its expected behavior.\n\nGiven these objectives, here are the API calls I'll make:\n\n- `search_code(\"EmptyResultSet\")`: This will help locate where `EmptyResultSet` is used and possibly give additional context on its implementation and handling within the framework.\n- `search_method_in_file(\"get_aggregation\", \"django/db/models/sql/query.py\")`: Since the path to the file was already provided, this call will help us directly inspect the method where the exception handling affects the aggregation result.\n- `search_class(\"Coalesce\")`: To understand how `Coalesce` is implemented and if there are any specific catch mechanisms for exceptions like `EmptyResultSet` or conditional handling that could influence the outcome of aggregate queries.\n\nThese calls should provide us with a solid understanding of the affected components and suggest where changes might be made to address the issue."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides us with insights into how Django's ORM handles aggregates, specifically when an EmptyResultSet is anticipated, and how the `Coalesce` function is implemented. Let's break down the information gathered:\n\n### Analysis of `EmptyResultSet`\n\nThe mentions of `EmptyResultSet` across several files indicate its critical role in query execution, particularly when a query is determined to have no possible results. This exception is pivotal in the context of this issue because it leads to a scenario where, instead of executing a query that is known to result in an empty set, Django preemptively halts execution and bypasses the normal aggregation process, which in turn affects `Coalesce`'s expected operation.\n\n### Analysis of `get_aggregation` Method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`\n\nThe `get_aggregation` method performs the aggregation on a query and returns the result. If the query's results are empty (`EmptyResultSet`), instead of returning the default value provided in `Coalesce`, it returns `None` for all aggregations. This method is crucial to our issue as it explicitly handles the scenario where a query, due to its conditions (`pk__in=[]`), leads to an optimization where the database is not hit, and aggregates are directly assumed to be `None`. The intended behavior, especially when `Coalesce` is used, should arguably handle the case of an empty query set differently, ensuring that the default value provided in `Coalesce` is returned instead of `None`.\n\nThe relation to the bug is direct: the handling of `EmptyResultSet` within this method does not consider the possibility of a default value specified via `Coalesce`, leading to unexpected behavior from the user's perspective.\n\n### Analysis of `Coalesce` Class in `comparison.py`\n\nThe `Coalesce` class allows multiple expressions to be passed, returning the first non-null value among them. Its simple presence and behavior suggest that when used in conjunction with `Sum`, even in cases of no matching records, the user's expectation of receiving the `Coalesce` default value is logical. The disconnect arises in the handling of empty queries where `EmptyResultSet` is involved, as described previously.\n\n### Intended Behavior and Fix Insights\n\nGiven the issue description and the collected context:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?** The code is responsible for handling aggregate queries, specifically optimizing scenarios to avoid unnecessary database hits and determining the result of aggregate functions when no records match the query conditions.\n   \n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?** The bug arises due to the optimization that leads to an `EmptyResultSet`, bypassing the execution of the `Coalesce` function as intended in an aggregate query context. This results in `None` being returned instead of the default value provided in `Coalesce`.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?** Ideally, the `get_aggregation` method should recognize when a `Coalesce` function is used within an aggregate query and ensure that, even in cases where an `EmptyResultSet` is anticipated, the default value specified within `Coalesce` is returned rather than nullifying all aggregate results.\n\n### Possible Patch Direction\n\n- Modify the `get_aggregation` method to detect the presence of `Coalesce` within the aggregate's parameters. When an `EmptyResultSet` scenario occurs, instead of converting all aggregates to `None`, it should check for a `Coalesce` wrapper and apply its specified default value.\n- This modification would likely involve inspecting the `annotation_select` or `added_aggregate_names` within `get_aggregation` for instances of `Coalesce` and altering the handling of results accordingly.\n\nThis analysis sets the stage for creating a patch that ensures the `Coalesce` function within Django's ORM behaves as expected, even in cases leading to an early-recognized `EmptyResultSet`."

Specifically, rather than defaulting all aggregates to `None` when it catches an `EmptyResultSet`, it should check if any of the aggregation functions are wrapped with `Coalesce` and, if so, return the default value provided in `Coalesce` instead of `None`. This preserves the existing functionality of bypassing unnecessary database hits while correctly implementing the logic of `Coalesce` in scenarios where no data matches the query conditions. The modification must ensure that this special handling does not affect other sections of the code where `EmptyResultSet` exceptions are appropriately thrown and handled. This could potentially involve inspecting aggregates in `annotation_select` for instances of `Coalesce` and altering how results are compiled in response to an `EmptyResultSet`."
