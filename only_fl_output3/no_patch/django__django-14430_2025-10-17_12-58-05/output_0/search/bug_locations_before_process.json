        "intended_behavior": "This method should be modified to properly handle `Coalesce` when an `EmptyResultSet` is anticipated. Specifically, rather than defaulting all aggregates to `None` when it catches an `EmptyResultSet`, it should check if any of the aggregation functions are wrapped with `Coalesce` and, if so, return the default value provided in `Coalesce` instead of `None`. This preserves the existing functionality of bypassing unnecessary database hits while correctly implementing the logic of `Coalesce` in scenarios where no data matches the query conditions. The modification must ensure that this special handling does not affect other sections of the code where `EmptyResultSet` exceptions are appropriately thrown and handled. This could potentially involve inspecting aggregates in `annotation_select` for instances of `Coalesce` and altering how results are compiled in response to an `EmptyResultSet`."
