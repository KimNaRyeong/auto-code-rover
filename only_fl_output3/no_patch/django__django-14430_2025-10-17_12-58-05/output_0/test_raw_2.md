Below is a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that specifically attempts to reproduce the outlined Django issue. This script is self-contained and can be placed in the root directory of a Django project for execution. The script utilizes Django's ORM features to replicate the described problem, involving the use of `__in` queryset lookup with an empty list and how it affects aggregate queries combined with `Coalesce`. 

This script aims to evoke an `AssertionError` if the issue exists (i.e., the aggregate function returns `None` instead of the coalesced value when filtering with an empty list), and to provide a clear stack trace in the case of failure.

```python
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Sum, Value
from django.db.models.functions import Coalesce

# Replace 'your_project.settings' with your actual Django project settings
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project.settings')
django.setup()

# Simple model definition for demonstration
class OrderItem(models.Model):
    quantity = models.IntegerField()

    class Meta:
        # Assuming `app_label` is set to bypass the need for a fully functional Django app
        app_label = 'test_app'

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_test_environment():
    """

    This is required for testing in a standalone script.
    """
    with django.db.connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:
        schema_editor.create_model(OrderItem)

def teardown_test_environment():

    """
    with django.db.connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:

def test_aggregate_coalesce_issue():
    # Setup test environment
    setup_test_environment()

    try:
        # Expected to return {'test': 0} but may return {'test': None} if the issue exists
        result = OrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))
        assert result['test'] == 0, "Coalesce in Aggregations ignored when EmptyResultSet returned"

        print("Test passed: Coalesce in Aggregations works as expected with an EmptyResultSet.")
    
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e

    finally:
        # Clean up to prevent interfering with the actual project's database
        teardown_test_environment()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_aggregate_coalesce_issue()

Ensure you replace `'your_project.settings'` with the correct Django settings path for your project. This script should be executed in an environment where Django is properly installed and set up.

Note: Since this script dynamically creates a model and executes database queries, make sure your database user has the necessary permissions and that you're comfortable running these operations on your database. It is highly recommended to run this script in a development or test environment rather than directly in production.
