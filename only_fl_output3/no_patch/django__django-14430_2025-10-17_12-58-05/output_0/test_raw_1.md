Given the requirements and the previous issue with the execution context, I've made adjustments to ensure the script is more universally applicable and explicitly self-contained. This script should be placed in the root of a Django project and executed there. It assumes that Django is already installed and set up correctly, and it uses generic model and field names, so you might need to adjust `"your_project.settings"` and the model import path according to your project's configuration.

```python
import os
import django
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Sum, Value
from django.db.models.functions import Coalesce

os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "your_project.settings")
django.setup()

# Define a temporary model for the purpose of demonstration.
# In a real scenario, replace this with the import of your actual model.
class OrderItem(models.Model):
    quantity = models.IntegerField()

    class Meta:
        app_label = 'your_app_name_here'  # Make sure to set your app label or model import statement here.

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_aggregate_coalesce():
    try:
        # Initialize test instances if necessary.
        # In a real scenario, ensure the database contains relevant entries or adjust these pk values.
        OrderItem.objects.create(pk=1, quantity=50)  # Only for demonstration; remove or adjust in actual use.

        matched_result = OrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[1]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))
        assert matched_result['test'] == 50, "Matched queryset did not return expected sum"

        unmatched_result = OrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[-1]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))
        assert unmatched_result['test'] == 0, "Unmatched queryset did not return 0"

        empty_list_result = OrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))
        assert empty_list_result['test'] == 0, "Queryset with empty list did not return 0"

        print("All tests passed successfully. The issue appears to be fixed.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_aggregate_coalesce()
```

Remember to:
- Replace `"your_project.settings"` with your actual Django project settings module path.
- Adjust the `OrderItem` model import statement to match your project structure or replace the temporary model definition with your actual model.
- Ensure the defined temporary model resonates with the model usage in your project. For accurate testing, it is recommended to use actual models and database entries.
- If you opt to create or modify database entries (as shown with `OrderItem.objects.create(pk=1, quantity=50)`), please be cautious and tailor these actions to fit your testing environment and requirements without affecting your production data.

This script demonstrates reproducing the issue under test conditions. Upon running this script, if the issue persists, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace to help identify the problem. If the issue doesn't occur, the script will note that all tests passed successfully.
