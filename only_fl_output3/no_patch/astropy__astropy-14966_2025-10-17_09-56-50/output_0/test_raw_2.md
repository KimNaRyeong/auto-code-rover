Given the detailed requirements for printing a stack trace upon encountering an issue, the objective here appears to be fine-tuning the behavior of the standalone Python script `reproducer.py` to handle the specific case where an `AssertionError` should be raised if the reproduced issue matches the one described (group keys not maintaining units in `QTable`). Below is an adjusted version of the initial script which incorporates more rigorous error handling and reporting through `print_stacktrace` function as specified.

```python
# reproducer.py
from astropy.table import QTable
import astropy.units as u

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        tbl = QTable({"length": [1., 1., 2., 3., 1., 2.,]*u.m})
        gtbl = tbl.group_by('length')

        for cols in gtbl.groups.keys:
            # Attempt to check for unit in the key
            if not hasattr(cols['length'], 'unit'):
                raise AssertionError("Group key does not contain a quantity with the appropriate unit: Unit is missing.")

        print("Test passed: Group keys contain quantities with appropriate units.")

    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        exit(1) # Indicates error presence due to issue reproduced
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1) # Exit with error code due to an unexpected issue

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This version introduces a `main` function for clarity and structure, ensuring that all operations are encapsulated within a single entry point. The script precisely checks for the presence of a unit within the group keys after grouping a `QTable`, aiming to directly target the issue as described.

If the unit is missing (thereby confirming the issue), an `AssertionError` is raised with a message indicating the problem. The `print_stacktrace` method is then used to detail where the error occurred. This method should ensure that any caught `AssertionError` directly related to the unit's absence in group keys is reported with a traceback to aid in debugging, while any other unexpected exception is also caught and reported similarly.

The script exits with status code 1 when an error is detected, indicating the presence of the described issue or any unexpected error. Conversely, it exits with 0 if the test passes, suggesting the absence of the reported issue or its resolution.
