This script aims to directly reproduce the issue as described, focusing on the scenario where group keys do not maintain their unit when a `QTable` is grouped by a quantity column. It explicitly checks if the key after grouping is an instance of `float` rather than a quantity with units, which reflects the described issue.

- If the issue is reproduced (i.e., the group key is found to be a mere float without associated units), an `AssertionError` is raised, and the script exits with code 1, indicating error presence.
- If no issues are found (i.e., group keys correctly include units), the script prints a success message and exits with code 0, indicating the issue is fixed or cannot be reproduced.
- Any unexpected exceptions are caught and reported, exiting with code 1 to indicate an abnormal condition.
