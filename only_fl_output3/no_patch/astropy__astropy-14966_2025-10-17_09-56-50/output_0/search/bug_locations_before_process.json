        "intended_behavior": "The method should ensure that when keys are accessed or set (`out.groups._keys = parent.groups.keys[item]`), they retain the associated unit information from the original grouped `QTable`. This might require modifying the internal representation of keys to support unit metadata or ensuring that the units are not stripped when keys are generated. The existing functionality of indexing groups and retrieving subsets of the table based on group keys must remain intact, with the enhancement that the keys now correctly reflect quantity data with units."

        "intended_behavior": "This method should be modified such that when it returns the keys (`return self._keys` or `return self.parent_table.groups.keys`), it includes the unit information for quantities. The modification should not affect non-quantity columns (i.e., those without units) but ensure that for quantity columns, the keys are full quantities with correct units. The adjustment should be in how keys are stored or retrieved, to avoid loss of unit information."
