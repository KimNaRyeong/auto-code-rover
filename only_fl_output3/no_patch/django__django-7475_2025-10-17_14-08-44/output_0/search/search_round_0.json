        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, I'll need to look into Django's management command infrastructure, specifically for `manage.py diffsettings`. This involves understanding how the command is implemented and figuring out how to extend its functionality to compare with a user-specified settings module.\n\n1. **Search for the `diffsettings` Command Implementation**: The first step is to identify where the `diffsettings` command is defined within Django's codebase. This could be done by looking for the command in files.\n\n2. **Understand the Current Implementation**: After locating the command, we'll need to examine its current logic, especially how it fetches and compares settings. This may involve looking at specific methods within the command class.\n\n3. **Identify Settings Loading Mechanism**: Since the feature request involves comparing settings from different modules, understanding how Django loads settings will be crucial. This could mean finding where Django merges its default settings with the user's project settings.\n\nBased on these steps, here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. ```python\nsearch_code(\"class DiffSettingsCommand\")\n```\n2. ```python\nsearch_method(\"handle\", \"DiffSettingsCommand\")\n```\n3. ```python\nsearch_code(\"from django.conf import settings\")\n```\n\nThese searches should give us a good starting point to understand where and how to implement the requested feature."
