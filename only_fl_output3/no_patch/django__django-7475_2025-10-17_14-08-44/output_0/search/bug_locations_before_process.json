        "intended_behavior": "This `Command` class should be modified to include an additional argument (for example, `--default` or a similarly named flag) that allows users to specify a custom settings module against which the current settings will be compared. The command should then load or reference the specified settings module and use it as the basis for comparison instead of solely comparing against Django's default settings. The logic for comparing settings should remain unchanged, ensuring that current functionality is preserved for users who do not specify this new argument. Implementing this feature would involve parsing the new command-line argument, dynamically importing the specified settings module, and then comparing the settings defined therein against the current project's settings, outputting the differences."
