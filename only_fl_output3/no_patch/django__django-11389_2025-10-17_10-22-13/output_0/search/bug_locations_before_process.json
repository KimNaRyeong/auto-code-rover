One approach could involve checking if SESSION_COOKIE_AGE is callable and, if so, calling it with the current session instance as the parameter, allowing it to return a dynamic age based on session-specific contexts or attributes. This should be done while ensuring that if SESSION_COOKIE_AGE is not callable, the default behavior remains unchanged."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to get_expiry_age, adjust this method to support dynamic determination of the session's expiry date. If incorporating a callable SESSION_COOKIE_AGE impacts this method (e.g., by affecting the expiry calculation), ensure that the method is capable of handling such dynamic values correctly. This means potentially recalculating expiry from the base modification date whenever a dynamic age is provided, ensuring the returned expiration date is correctly adjusted per session."
