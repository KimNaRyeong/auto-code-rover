        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, we have two primary areas of focus derived from the results:\n\n### SessionStore Classes\nThe `SessionStore` class has implementations across different session backends in Django, as listed:\n- `django/contrib/sessions/backends/db.py` for database-backed sessions.\n- `django/contrib/sessions/backends/file.py` for file-based sessions.\n- `django/contrib/sessions/backends/cached_db.py` for cached database sessions.\n- `django/contrib/sessions/backends/signed_cookies.py` for client-side sessions using signed cookies.\n- `django/contrib/sessions/backends/cache.py` for cache-based sessions.\n\n### SESSION_COOKIE_AGE Setting Occurrences\nThe `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` setting is referenced in several places:\n- `django/contrib/sessions/backends/file.py` and `django/contrib/sessions/backends/signed_cookies.py` hint at direct usages in those session backends.\n- `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py` contains two matches, likely referring to core functionalities shared by all session backends.\n- `django/conf/global_settings.py` mentions `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`, which is likely the default value definition for this setting.\n\n#### Analysis\n\n1. **What do these parts of the code do?**\n   - The `SessionStore` classes handle session data storage and retrieval mechanisms for different storage backends (DB, cache, file, etc.). These mechanisms include how a session starts, expires, is saved, and is loaded.\n   - The occurrences of `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` in the backend files and the base session backend file indicate where the session cookie's lifespan is defined or utilized, crucial for managing when sessions should expire.\n\n2. **Relationship with the Bug**\n   - The issue describes the limitation in dynamically setting the session cookie's age due to the direct usage of the `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` setting in the `SessionStore` implementations. Currently, these implementations don't easily allow changing the expiry age based on session-specific parameters without overriding `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date`.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**\n   - The intended behavior, following the issue description, would be to make the session cookie age dynamic, allowing developers to specify or modify the expiry time based on certain session parameters or conditions. This could involve introducing a mechanism to evaluate the session cookie age on-the-fly based on customizable criteria, rather than relying solely on the static `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` setting from the global configuration.\n\nGiven this analysis, potential next steps in gathering context could include examining the specific implementations of `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date` within the `SessionStore` classes, especially in the `backends/base.py` file where the core logic is likely shared. This examination will help understand the current logic for determining session expiry and what modifications might be necessary to support dynamic session cookie ages.\n\nTo proceed, it would be insightful to inspect:\n- The implementation of `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date` in `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py`, as changes here could affect all session backends.\n- How `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` is specifically used in `backends/base.py` to identify opportunities for making session cookie age dynamic."

        "content": "1. **Do we need more context?**\n\n   Yes, to effectively craft a solution, we need to inspect the methods that directly relate to the issue. Specifically, we should examine the implementations of `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date` in the `SessionStore` base class, as making modifications there could potentially allow session cookie age to be dynamic. Thus, the necessary API calls are:\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"get_expiry_age\", \"SessionStore\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"get_expiry_date\", \"SessionStore\")\n   ```\n\n   And since the base logic is possibly defined in `backends/base.py`, let's look into that as well:\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_file(\"get_expiry_age\", \"django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py\")\n   search_method_in_file(\"get_expiry_date\", \"django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Where are bug locations?**\n\n   Assuming we have enough context (though as noted above, we need more information), potential locations for the bug and necessary fixes based on initial analysis would be:\n\n   - **Location 1:**\n     - **File:** `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py`\n     - **Class:** `SessionStore`\n     - **Method:** `get_expiry_age`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** This method should be adapted to include a mechanism for determining the session expiry age dynamically, perhaps based on session-specific details or conditions. While it must continue to honor the `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` setting as the default, it should provide a straightforward way for subclasses to introduce custom logic for determining expiry age without completely overriding the method.\n\n   - **Location 2:**\n     - **File:** `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py`\n     - **Class:** `SessionStore`\n     - **Method:** `get_expiry_date`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** Similarly to `get_expiry_age`, `get_expiry_date` should allow dynamic calculation of the session's expiry date. This could involve leveraging the possibly adjusted `get_expiry_age` method or introducing a parallel mechanism that supports conditional logic based on the session's context.\n\n   The above potential fixes preserve existing functionalities by maintaining `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` as the default expiry definition while providing the needed flexibility for dynamic expiry times. \n\n**Note:** To proceed effectively, we'll need to conduct the proposed API calls to gather the specific implementations of `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date`. This ensures our suggested modifications are applicable and accurately targeted."

Both methods are essential for determining the lifetime of a session cookie.\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\n- **`get_expiry_age` Method:** This method calculates the number of seconds until the session expires. Accepting optional `modification` and `expiry` parameters allows for flexibility in defining when the session was last modified and when it should expire. If an explicit expiry time is not provided, it defaults to the static `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` setting.\n- **`get_expiry_date` Method:** Similar to `get_expiry_age`, this method calculates the session's expiry date as a `datetime` object. It also takes optional `modification` and `expiry` arguments to determine the session's modification time and intended expiry time, defaulting to `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` if not explicitly set.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue reported is directly related to these methods' reliance on the static `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` setting for calculating the expiry time. This setup limits the ability to dynamically adjust session expiry based on parameters evaluated at runtime. For instance, different users or session types could necessitate varying expiry lengths, which the current implementation does not facilitate without overriding these methods.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior would be to enhance these methods (or the underlying logic they rely on) to allow for dynamic determination of `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`, not just through direct modification or overriding of these methods, but by providing a mechanism\u2014perhaps via the session object itself or configurable callbacks\u2014that allows for runtime calculation of expiry periods based on the current session's details or user-specific rules.\n\nAn example of such intended behavior could be implementing a system where `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` can be defined as a callable that receives the session instance as an argument, allowing it to return different values based on the session data. Alternatively, adding additional hooks or parameters that can be set on a per-session basis to influence the expiry period directly within the session's data structure could be considered.\n\nTo address the issue while preserving existing functionality:\n- Ensure any changes keep `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` as the default behavior for backwards compatibility.\n- Provide a clear and documented way for developers to specify custom expiration logic, reducing the need for direct overrides or modifications of `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date` methods.\n- Consider the impact on all backend implementations that inherit from `SessionBase`, ensuring that any new mechanism is universally applicable and doesn't require backend-specific adjustments."

One approach could involve checking if `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` is callable and, if so, calling it with the current session instance as the parameter, allowing it to return a dynamic age based on session-specific contexts or attributes. This should be done while ensuring that if `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` is not callable, the default behavior remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Location 2:**\n   - **File:** `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py`\n   - **Class:** `SessionBase`\n   - **Method:** `get_expiry_date`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Similar to `get_expiry_age`, adjust this method to support dynamic determination of the session's expiry date. If incorporating a callable `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` impacts this method (e.g., by affecting the `expiry` calculation), ensure that the method is capable of handling such dynamic values correctly. This means potentially recalculating `expiry` from the base modification date whenever a dynamic age is provided, ensuring the returned expiration date is correctly adjusted per session.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThese changes target the core issue by providing a way to make the session expiry time responsive to runtime conditions without compromising the simplicity and robustness of the default Django sessions framework. Any adaptation made should be thoroughly documented to guide developers on how to correctly utilize dynamic expiration times for sessions, including any edge cases they might need to be aware of (e.g., ensuring thread safety of callable `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`, handling exceptions or non-integer values gracefully)."
