Let's start with finding the occurrences and definitions that will give us the required context for crafting a patch:\n\n1. Search for the `SessionStore` class to find in which file it is defined. This will help us narrow down where to look for the `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date` methods.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"SessionStore\")\n   ```\n\n2. Search for mentions of the `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` setting within the codebase to understand how it is used. This step is critical for identifying parts of the code that might need adjustments to allow dynamic session cookie age.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"SESSION_COOKIE_AGE\")\n   ```\n\nAfter obtaining results from these searches, we will likely be able to make more targeted API calls to drill down into the specific implementations or code snippets that need to be examined or modified for allowing dynamic session cookie ages."
