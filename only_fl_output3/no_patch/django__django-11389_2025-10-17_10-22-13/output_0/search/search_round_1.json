        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, we have two primary areas of focus derived from the results:\n\n### SessionStore Classes\nThe `SessionStore` class has implementations across different session backends in Django, as listed:\n- `django/contrib/sessions/backends/db.py` for database-backed sessions.\n- `django/contrib/sessions/backends/file.py` for file-based sessions.\n- `django/contrib/sessions/backends/cached_db.py` for cached database sessions.\n- `django/contrib/sessions/backends/signed_cookies.py` for client-side sessions using signed cookies.\n- `django/contrib/sessions/backends/cache.py` for cache-based sessions.\n\n### SESSION_COOKIE_AGE Setting Occurrences\nThe `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` setting is referenced in several places:\n- `django/contrib/sessions/backends/file.py` and `django/contrib/sessions/backends/signed_cookies.py` hint at direct usages in those session backends.\n- `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py` contains two matches, likely referring to core functionalities shared by all session backends.\n- `django/conf/global_settings.py` mentions `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE`, which is likely the default value definition for this setting.\n\n#### Analysis\n\n1. **What do these parts of the code do?**\n   - The `SessionStore` classes handle session data storage and retrieval mechanisms for different storage backends (DB, cache, file, etc.). These mechanisms include how a session starts, expires, is saved, and is loaded.\n   - The occurrences of `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` in the backend files and the base session backend file indicate where the session cookie's lifespan is defined or utilized, crucial for managing when sessions should expire.\n\n2. **Relationship with the Bug**\n   - The issue describes the limitation in dynamically setting the session cookie's age due to the direct usage of the `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` setting in the `SessionStore` implementations. Currently, these implementations don't easily allow changing the expiry age based on session-specific parameters without overriding `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date`.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**\n   - The intended behavior, following the issue description, would be to make the session cookie age dynamic, allowing developers to specify or modify the expiry time based on certain session parameters or conditions. This could involve introducing a mechanism to evaluate the session cookie age on-the-fly based on customizable criteria, rather than relying solely on the static `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` setting from the global configuration.\n\nGiven this analysis, potential next steps in gathering context could include examining the specific implementations of `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date` within the `SessionStore` classes, especially in the `backends/base.py` file where the core logic is likely shared. This examination will help understand the current logic for determining session expiry and what modifications might be necessary to support dynamic session cookie ages.\n\nTo proceed, it would be insightful to inspect:\n- The implementation of `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date` in `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py`, as changes here could affect all session backends.\n- How `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` is specifically used in `backends/base.py` to identify opportunities for making session cookie age dynamic."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

        "content": "1. **Do we need more context?**\n\n   Yes, to effectively craft a solution, we need to inspect the methods that directly relate to the issue. Specifically, we should examine the implementations of `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date` in the `SessionStore` base class, as making modifications there could potentially allow session cookie age to be dynamic. Thus, the necessary API calls are:\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"get_expiry_age\", \"SessionStore\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"get_expiry_date\", \"SessionStore\")\n   ```\n\n   And since the base logic is possibly defined in `backends/base.py`, let's look into that as well:\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_file(\"get_expiry_age\", \"django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py\")\n   search_method_in_file(\"get_expiry_date\", \"django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Where are bug locations?**\n\n   Assuming we have enough context (though as noted above, we need more information), potential locations for the bug and necessary fixes based on initial analysis would be:\n\n   - **Location 1:**\n     - **File:** `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py`\n     - **Class:** `SessionStore`\n     - **Method:** `get_expiry_age`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** This method should be adapted to include a mechanism for determining the session expiry age dynamically, perhaps based on session-specific details or conditions. While it must continue to honor the `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` setting as the default, it should provide a straightforward way for subclasses to introduce custom logic for determining expiry age without completely overriding the method.\n\n   - **Location 2:**\n     - **File:** `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py`\n     - **Class:** `SessionStore`\n     - **Method:** `get_expiry_date`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** Similarly to `get_expiry_age`, `get_expiry_date` should allow dynamic calculation of the session's expiry date. This could involve leveraging the possibly adjusted `get_expiry_age` method or introducing a parallel mechanism that supports conditional logic based on the session's context.\n\n   The above potential fixes preserve existing functionalities by maintaining `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` as the default expiry definition while providing the needed flexibility for dynamic expiry times. \n\n**Note:** To proceed effectively, we'll need to conduct the proposed API calls to gather the specific implementations of `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date`. This ensures our suggested modifications are applicable and accurately targeted."
