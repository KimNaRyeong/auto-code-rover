        "intended_behavior": "This method should be updated to accept an additional boolean parameter named `squared`. The default value of this parameter should be `True` to preserve existing functionality. If `squared` is `True`, the function should return the mean squared error as it currently does. If `squared` is `False`, the function should return the square root of the mean squared error, effectively providing the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error). This change requires updating the function's logic to conditionally apply `np.sqrt` to the output based on the `squared` parameter."

        "intended_behavior": "In this file, a new scorer named `neg_root_mean_squared_error` should be added. This scorer will internally use the updated `mean_squared_error` function with the parameter `squared=False` to calculate the RMSE and return this value multiplied by -1. This requires defining a new scorer object (following the pattern used by existing scorers in the file) that properly handles the inversion and leverages the newly updated `mean_squared_error` capability. This scorer will make it convenient to use RMSE in model evaluation processes where lower error scores are preferred, consistent with scikit-learn's conventions for scorers."
