        "intended_behavior": "This method should more robustly validate URLs to ensure malformed inputs like `http://.example.com` are caught as invalid. The improvement involves refining the conditional checks to catch edge cases where a URL might technically pass existing validations but is nonetheless fundamentally invalid (e.g., due to an empty hostname or invalid label). This means enhancing the logic around lines 400-407, possibly with additional conditions or a more comprehensive approach to validating the host part of the URL before proceeding with IDNA encoding or further processing. The validation logic here must continue to allow all previously valid URLs, preserving existing functionality for valid use cases, while improving error handling to prevent `UnicodeError` by raising an `InvalidURL` exception in additional scenarios where the URL is malformed."
