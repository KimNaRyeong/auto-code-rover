It seems like the intention so far has been to raise `InvalidUrl` instead (see e.g. [this line](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/ca6f9af5dba09591007b15a7368bc0f006b7cc50/requests/models.py#L401)).\nI see there was some hesitation in fixing a similar issue (#4168) and would like to add that even catching the error just to rethrow as a requests exception would be beneficial.\n## Expected Result\nBased on PR #774: `InvalidUrl: URL has an invalid label.`\n## Actual Result\n`UnicodeError: encoding with 'idna' codec failed (UnicodeError: label empty or too long)`\n## Reproduction Steps\n```python3\nimport requests\nrequests.get(\"http://.example.com\")\n```\n## System Information\n$ python -m requests.help\n```\n{\n\"chardet\": {\n\"version\": \"3.0.4\"\n},\n\"cryptography\": {\n\"version\": \"2.8\"\n},\n\"idna\": {\n\"version\": \"2.8\"\n},\n\"implementation\": {\n\"name\": \"CPython\",\n\"version\": \"3.8.0\"\n},\n\"platform\": {\n\"release\": \"5.3.0-40-generic\",\n\"system\": \"Linux\"\n},\n\"pyOpenSSL\": {\n\"openssl_version\": \"1010104f\",\n\"version\": \"19.1.0\"\n},\n\"requests\": {\n\"version\": \"2.23.0\"\n},\n\"system_ssl\": {\n\"version\": \"1010103f\"\n},\n\"urllib3\": {\n\"version\": \"1.25.8\"\n},\n\"using_pyopenssl\": true\n}\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue about handling URLs that result in a `UnicodeError` when they should raise an `InvalidUrl` exception instead, we need to look into specific areas of the codebase mentioned in the issue description and potentially related points of interest in handling URL validation and exception handling in the `requests` library.\n\nGiven the information and the direct mention of a specific line in the `models.py` file of the `requests` library, let's start by examining the code around this mentioned line to understand how URLs are being validated and processed.\n\nHere are the specific API calls we need to make:\n\n1. `get_code_around_line(\"requests/models.py\", 401, 10)`: This call will help us understand the context in which the `InvalidUrl` might be raised or where a potential place to catch the `UnicodeError` and re-raise it as `InvalidUrl` could be added.\n\n2. `search_method_in_file(\"get\", \"requests/api.py\")`: Since the reproduction steps involve using the `get` method directly, examining its implementation might provide insights into how URLs are being passed down and where exactly the validation or handling could be improved.\n\n3. `search_code(\"InvalidUrl\")`: This call will help us find all instances where `InvalidUrl` is being used or raised in the codebase. Understanding its current uses might give clues on how and where to appropriately catch and convert the `UnicodeError` into an `InvalidUrl` exception.\n\nThese calls should give us a comprehensive view of the relevant parts of the code involved in the issue and help in formulating a strategy to fix it."
