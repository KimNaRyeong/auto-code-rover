Given the context of your previous message and the specific request for error handling and reporting, below is an adjusted `reproducer.py` script. This script aims to directly address the issue of reproducing a `UnicodeError` and exits correctly based on the issue presence or resolution when working with the given URL `http://.example.com`. Additionally, it incorporates the detailed stack trace printing as requested:

```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    # Dynamically import requests to handle potential ImportError
    import requests
    # Attempt to request the problematic URL
    requests.get("http://.example.com")
    print("Issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Indicates the lack of an exception; the issue is presumed fixed
except requests.exceptions.InvalidURL as e:
    # Expected exception handling if mentioned issue is resolved
    print("InvalidURL exception raised as expected. Issue appears to be fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Successful exit indicating the problem no longer exists
except UnicodeError as e:
    # The specific exception type leading to failure, expecting resolution
    print("UnicodeError encountered, indicating issue reproduction. Printing stack trace...")
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise AssertionError("Failure: UnicodeError should not occur given proper handling.")
except Exception as e:
    # General exception handling to cover unforeseen errors
    print("An unexpected error occurred, which was not properly handled:")
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Non-zero exit code indicating a failure or unexpected outcome
```

This script is designed to run in the root directory and should be executed as mentioned with `python3 reproducer.py`. If the issue you described exists, the script will catch the `UnicodeError` and output the stack trace while asserting failure. Conversely, if the requests library handles the issue effectively (either no exception or a correct `InvalidURL`), the script will end gracefully with an exit code of 0, indicating the problem's absence or resolution. The function `print_stacktrace` is used here to give a detailed stack trace for any caught exceptions, greatly aiding in diagnosing or verifying the issue.
