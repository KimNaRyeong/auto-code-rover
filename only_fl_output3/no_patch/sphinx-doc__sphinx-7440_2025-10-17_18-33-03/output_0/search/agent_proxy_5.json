Without the ability to directly access or modify the `doc/glossary.rst` file or further explore the configuration via `conf.py` due to the limitations in the APIs provided and the results returned, we're at an impasse regarding directly pinpointing or addressing the issue's root in the codebase.\n\nBased on the provided scenario and results:\n- **Retrieving code directly from the identified bug location (`doc/glossary.rst`) is not possible** with the given API commands and outcomes. The intended modifications or checks (to address duplicate terms with different case sensitivities) cannot be directly queried or edited through this interface.\n\nConsidering the described limitations and outcomes, further actions to address or resolve the reported issue would rely on manual investigation and modifications:\n- **Manual Review of `glossary.rst`**: Directly accessing the `glossary.rst` file in the code repository and manually reviewing the terms to correct any inconsistencies in case usage among glossary entries.\n- **Exploring Configuration Options**: Manually checking the Sphinx `conf.py` file within the phpMyAdmin documentation setup for any available options or customizations that could influence how Sphinx processes and checks glossary terms, focusing on case sensitivity handling.\n\nIn conclusion, without the ability to directly apply or invoke more targeted search or edit operations within the project's documentation setup, the next best steps involve manual review and potential modification by a developer with access to the project's repository and files."
