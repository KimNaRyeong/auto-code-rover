This might involve modifying how c_id_attributes is used within this parsing context to ensure attributes in enums are handled according to the expected documentation output, without misinterpretation or causing duplicate declaration issues."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to the C domain, the DefinitionParser class and the setup function in the C++ domain (cpp.py) should be adjusted to correctly handle cpp_id_attributes during enum parsing. This involves ensuring attributes tagged on enum values do not cause parsing issues or misnomers in the generated documentation. The correct approach would filter or properly recognize these attributes so that they do not lead to errors or misnamed enum values in the documentation output."
