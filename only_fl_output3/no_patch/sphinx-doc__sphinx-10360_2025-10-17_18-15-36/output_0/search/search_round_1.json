This enum has a deprecated value `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN`. The macro `JXL_DEPRECATED` is defined elsewhere, but it is included in `c_id_attributes` and `cpp_id_attributes`, so that shouldn't be the problem.\n```\n/** Data type for the sample values per channel per pixel.\n*/\ntypedef enum {\n/** Use 32-bit single-precision floating point values, with range 0.0-1.0\n* (within gamut, may go outside this range for wide color gamut). Floating\n* point output, either JXL_TYPE_FLOAT or JXL_TYPE_FLOAT16, is recommended\n* for HDR and wide gamut images when color profile conversion is required. */\nJXL_TYPE_FLOAT = 0,\n/** DEPRECATED: Bitpacked 1-bit. As an alternative, use JXL_TYPE_UINT8.\n*/\nJXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN JXL_DEPRECATED,\n[...]\n```\nWhen building documentation from this, it is parsing it as if the enum value is `JXL_DEPRECATED`, not `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN` as it should be. When there are two or more enum values deprecated like this, it results in `Duplicate C++ declaration`.\n### Expected behavior\nJust like attributes for function definitions, attributes for enum values should be ignored when parsing.\n### Your project\nhttps://libjxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nLinux\n### Python version\n3.9.10\n### Sphinx version\n4.5.0\n### Sphinx extensions\n_No response_\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

Given that the issue mentions parsing for documentation purposes, we might need to look into how parsing is implemented, potentially in documentation generation scripts or related parsing functions.\n\nHowever, without specific names of parser functions or scripts, I will aim to find references to the `enum` definition that includes attributes (like `__attribute__((__deprecated__))` or `JXL_DEPRECATED`).

These configurations appear to be part of Sphinx, a documentation generator that processes source code to produce documentation. Specifically, these configurations (`c_id_attributes` and `cpp_id_attributes`) likely allow specifying attributes that should be recognized and handled during parsing of C and C++ identifiers. The presence of such configurations suggests flexibility in how Sphinx processes and filters attributes in code identifiers.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\nThe bug described in the issue relates to Sphinx's handling (or mishandling) of attributes in `enum` values, resulting in misparsed documentation where enum values with attributes like `__attribute__((__deprecated__))` aren't correctly recognized. The handling of `c_id_attributes` and `cpp_id_attributes` is directly relevant because these settings might control how Sphinx processes such attributes. The misparsing could stem from these configurations not appropriately handling or ignoring attribute directives in enum values.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior would be for Sphinx to properly recognize and ignore (or otherwise correctly process) attributes applied to enum values during parsing. This means when Sphinx encounters an enum value with an attribute like `__attribute__((__deprecated__))` or `JXL_DEPRECATED`, it should still correctly identify the enum value's name and assign it to the documentation without confusion or misinterpretation as another identifier. Importantly, this would avoid issues like treating the attribute as the enum value's name or causing duplicate declaration errors.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven the insights from analyzing the code and understanding its current functionality related to the bug, several next steps become apparent in formulating a possible resolution or at least gathering more context:\n\n1. **Review how `c_id_attributes` and `cpp_id_attributes` are used during parsing**: \n   - It would be beneficial to examine the parsing logic within `sphinx/domains/c.py` and `sphinx/domains/cpp.py` that utilizes these configurations. Specifically, how enum values are parsed and how attributes are treated during this process.\n\n2. **Look further into `DefinitionParser` and its methods**:\n   - Investigating the `id_attributes` method in both C and C++ domains, understanding its logic and how it influences parsing could provide insights. This might reveal mechanisms to enhance or adjust to accommodate attributes in enum values correctly.\n\nTo proceed with further analysis based on these steps, more specific information or code snippets involving the parsing logic and usage of these configurations would be necessary. This could involve examining the `DefinitionParser` class or methods that directly participate in parsing `enum` declarations and their attributes."

This might involve modifying how `c_id_attributes` is used within this parsing context to ensure attributes in enums are handled according to the expected documentation output, without misinterpretation or causing duplicate declaration issues.\n\n- **Location 2:** \n  - **File:** `sphinx/domains/cpp.py`\n  - **Class:** `DefinitionParser`\n  - **Method:** `id_attributes`, `setup`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Similar to the C domain, the `DefinitionParser` class and the `setup` function in the C++ domain (`cpp.py`) should be adjusted to correctly handle `cpp_id_attributes` during enum parsing. This involves ensuring attributes tagged on enum values do not cause parsing issues or misnomers in the generated documentation. The correct approach would filter or properly recognize these attributes so that they do not lead to errors or misnamed enum values in the documentation output.\n\n**General Intended Behavior for Both Locations:**\n\n- Preserve the functionality of Sphinx to accurately generate documentation from source code, including correctly identifying and documenting enum values that may have attributes.\n- Enhance the handling or ignoring of specific attributes in enum value declarations to prevent documentation generation errors or incorrect parsing outcomes.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nBy focusing on these locations, the aim is to refine the process of parsing and documenting enum values, especially those with attributes, to match expected behavior without introducing side effects or regressions in documentation generation capabilities."
