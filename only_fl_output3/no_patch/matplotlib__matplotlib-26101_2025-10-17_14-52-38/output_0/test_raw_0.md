This script attempts to determine whether the mathtext marker `"$\star$"` is center-aligned with standard markers like `"*"` by comparing their vertical positions after plotting. It uses matplotlib to plot the markers, retrieves the paths of these markers, and calculates the average (mean) position of their vertices to check the alignment. The script will raise an `AssertionError` if the markers are not aligned as expected, indicating the presence of the issue. When executed in an environment where the issue is present, it should provide a detailed traceback; whereas, if the issue is fixed, it will exit with code 0 and print a confirmation that all markers are aligned.
