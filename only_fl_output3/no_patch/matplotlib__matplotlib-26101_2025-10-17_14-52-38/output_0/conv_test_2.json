However, it captures a wrong assumption because this approach will not visually verify the alignment of the markers within their bounding boxes, which is the core of the issue. \n\nAdvanced methods involving the extraction and comparison of marker bounding boxes, or pixel-level image comparison, might be necessary to programmatically verify the accurate alignment, especially when dealing with markers that are rendered as text (mathtext). Visual inspection remains a critical step for such graphical issues."
