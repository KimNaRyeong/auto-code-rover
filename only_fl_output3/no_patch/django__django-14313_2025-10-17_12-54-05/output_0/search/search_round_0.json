        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving this issue, we need to inspect the relevant classes and methods mentioned in the bug description. Given the details, we'll focus on searching the `Post` and `User` models within \"models.py\", the `PostAdmin` class within \"admin.py\", and specific methods that are related to the exception mentioned in the traceback. \n\nFirst, we should confirm the implementation of the `Post` and `User` models to understand the structure and fields properly. This will give us context regarding the `ManyToMany` relationship and any possible custom implementations that might influence the error.\n\nSecond, examining the `PostAdmin` class, especially how the `search_fields` are configured, could reveal how the search is handled and why a `.distinct()` call might be implicitly introduced when filtering by related fields through the admin search.\n\nLastly, given that the stack trace points towards a delete action triggered from the admin interface, understanding how the `delete()` method on querysets is extended or overridden in the application, as well as how the admin actions handle queryset deletion, could provide insights into why the `TypeError` is being raised.\n\nBased on these considerations, the following API calls can be made:\n\n1. `search_class_in_file(\"Post\", \"models.py\")`\n2. `search_class_in_file(\"User\", \"models.py\")`\n3. `search_class_in_file(\"PostAdmin\", \"admin.py\")`\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"delete_queryset\", \"PostAdmin\")`\n5. `search_method(\"delete\")` - To understand how `delete()` is being used across the project, as the error involves calling `delete()` after `.distinct()` which might not be directly visible in the `PostAdmin` class.\n6. `search_code(\"search_fields = (\\\"title\\\", \\\"authors__email\\\")\")` - It might be useful to confirm the exact implementation and see if there's additional context around this line.\n\nExecuting these searches will provide a comprehensive overview of how the models and admin classes are defined and how deletion and searching are handled within the project, offering the requisite context to approach a fix for the reported issue."
