        "intended_behavior": "The `delete` method should be adapted to handle `QuerySets` with `.distinct()` applied in a way that allows for the deletion operation to proceed without raising a `TypeError`. This could involve introducing a pre-check or an intermediate step that either removes the `.distinct()` condition from the `QuerySet` in a controlled manner or ensures that the `QuerySet` can be safely modified to a state where deletion is permissible. The solution should ensure that the deletion process remains consistent with Django's data integrity and model deletion cascade rules."

        "intended_behavior": "The admin views handling search and subsequent actions like `delete_selected` should be capable of detecting when a search query results in a `QuerySet` that will not be deletable due to `.distinct()` application. The handling might involve adjusting the search query logic or the deletion logic to ensure compatibility. For example, implementing a mechanism to 'clean' the `QuerySet` of `.distinct()` before deletion actions are performed or providing a way to flag certain `QuerySets` for 'safe' deletion. The goal is to maintain the unique results of searches via `.distinct()` while ensuring that bulk actions relying on the resulting `QuerySets` do not fail."
