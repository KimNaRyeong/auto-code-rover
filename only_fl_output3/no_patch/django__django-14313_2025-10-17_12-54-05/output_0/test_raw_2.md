Creating a standalone `reproducer.py` file to simulate the issue observed requires setting up a minimal Django project environment within the script itself. This includes defining models, simulating the admin interface setup, performing a search as described in the issue, and attempting to delete a record, replicating the conditions under which the `TypeError` occurs. The script will then catch any exceptions, use the provided `print_stacktrace` function to print details about the issue, and perform an assertion to confirm the presence of the issue.

```python
"""
Standalone script to reproduce the issue with Django admin when deleting objects
after searching related many-to-many field results in an internal server error.

This script attempts to replicate the steps mentioned in your issue, essentially:

1. Configures a minimal Django environment with a memory database for simplicity and quick startup.
2. Defines the required models and registers them with the Django admin.
3. Mimics the admin's delete action after performing a search.

Please adjust the database settings and other configurations as needed, depending on your specific requirements or environment. Note that the script uses a memory database for simplicity and should not be used directly in production environments.

The assertion at the end of the `main` function serves as the condition to check if the issue has been successfully replicated. If the script executes without encountering the specific `TypeError`, it means the issue does not occur in the simulated environment, otherwise, it should print the stack trace and assert an error, indicating the issue's presence.
