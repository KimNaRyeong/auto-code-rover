Given the previous misunderstanding about the execution environment and the specifics of the error, here is an adjusted version of the `reproducer.py` script that should better align with the initial request. This script adheres more closely to the constraints and aims at reproducing the described issue under correct assumptions:

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_assign_coords_on_stacked_dataset():
    ds = xr.DataArray(
        [[[1, 1], [0, 0]], [[2, 2], [1, 1]]],
        dims=("lat", "year", "month"),
        coords={"lat": [-60, 60], "year": [2010, 2020], "month": [3, 6]},
        name="test",
    ).to_dataset()

    stacked = ds.stack(time=("year", "month"))
    try:
        stacked = stacked.assign_coords(
            {"time": [y + m / 12 for y, m in stacked["time"].values]}
        )
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Error when assigning coordinates to the stacked dataset.") from e

    try:
        # Assertion to ensure the length of the dataset is non-negative
        assert len(stacked) >= 0, "The length of the dataset should not be negative."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

    try:
        # Additional check to ensure _coord_names is updated correctly
        expected_coords = {"time", "lat"}
        actual_coords = set(stacked._coord_names)
        assert actual_coords == expected_coords, f"Expected coords: {expected_coords}, but found: {actual_coords}"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_assign_coords_on_stacked_dataset()
    print("Test completed successfully - issue not present or has been fixed.")
```

This script does the following:

1. It attempts to reproduce the issue described by creating a dataset, stacking it, and then assigning new coordinates to the stacked dimensions.
2. If the assignment fails due to an unexpected exception, it prints the stack trace using the `print_stacktrace` function, providing clarity on where and why the error occurred.
3. It asserts that the length of the dataset is non-negative after assigning new coordinates, which relates closely to the reported issue.
4. Also checks if `_coord_names` is correctly updated after the coordinate assignment, which was part of the issue description. 

Run this script in the root directory of your project using `python3 reproducer.py`. If the issue is still present, it should raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace. If the issue has been fixed or is not present, the script completes successfully and prints a confirmation message.
