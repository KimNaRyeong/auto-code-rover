After assigning the coordinates, the dataset was in a state where its length was coming out as less than zero, which caused all sorts of issues.\n### What did you expect to happen?\nI think the issue is with the updating of `_coord_names`, perhaps in https://github.com/pydata/xarray/blob/18454c218002e48e1643ce8e25654262e5f592ad/xarray/core/coordinates.py#L389.\nI expected to just be able to assign the coords and then print the array to see the result.\n### Minimal Complete Verifiable Example\n```Python\nimport xarray as xr\nds = xr.DataArray(\n[[[1, 1], [0, 0]], [[2, 2], [1, 1]]],\ndims=(\"lat\", \"year\", \"month\"),\ncoords={\"lat\": [-60, 60], \"year\": [2010, 2020], \"month\": [3, 6]},\nname=\"test\",\n).to_dataset()\nstacked = ds.stack(time=(\"year\", \"month\"))\nstacked = stacked.assign_coords(\n{\"time\": [y + m / 12 for y, m in stacked[\"time\"].values]}\n)\n# Both these fail with ValueError: __len__() should return >= 0\nlen(stacked)\nprint(stacked)\n```\n### MVCE confirmation\n- [X] Minimal example \u2014 the example is as focused as reasonably possible to demonstrate the underlying issue in xarray.\n- [X] Complete example \u2014 the example is self-contained, including all data and the text of any traceback.\n- [x] Verifiable example \u2014 the example copy & pastes into an IPython prompt or [Binder notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pydata/xarray/main?urlpath=lab/tree/doc/examples/blank_template.ipynb), returning the result.\n- [X] New issue \u2014 a search of GitHub Issues suggests this is not a duplicate.\n### Relevant log output\n```Python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"mre.py\", line 17, in <module>\nlen(stacked)\nFile \".../xarray-tests/xarray/core/dataset.py\", line 1364, in __len__\nreturn len(self.data_vars)\nValueError: __len__() should return >= 0\n```\n### Anything else we need to know?\nHere's a test (I put it in `test_dataarray.py` but maybe there is a better spot)\n```python\ndef test_assign_coords_drop_coord_names(self) -> None:\nds = DataArray(\n[[[1, 1], [0, 0]], [[2, 2], [1, 1]]],\ndims=(\"lat\", \"year\", \"month\"),\ncoords={\"lat\": [-60, 60], \"year\": [2010, 2020], \"month\": [3, 6]},\nname=\"test\",\n).to_dataset()\nstacked = ds.stack(time=(\"year\", \"month\"))\nstacked = stacked.assign_coords(\n{\"time\": [y + m / 12 for y, m in stacked[\"time\"].values]}\n)\n# this seems to be handled correctly\nassert set(stacked._variables.keys()) == {\"test\", \"time\", \"lat\"}\n# however, _coord_names doesn't seem to update as expected\n# the below fails\nassert set(stacked._coord_names) == {\"time\", \"lat\"}\n# the incorrect value of _coord_names means that all the below fails too\n# The failure is because the length of a dataset is calculated as (via len(data_vars))\n# len(dataset._variables) - len(dataset._coord_names). For the situation\n# above, where len(dataset._coord_names) is greater than len(dataset._variables),\n# you get a length less than zero which then fails because length must return\n# a value greater than zero\n# Both these fail with ValueError: __len__() should return >= 0\nlen(stacked)\nprint(stacked)\n```\n### Environment\n<details>\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\n------------------\ncommit: e678a1d7884a3c24dba22d41b2eef5d7fe5258e7\npython: 3.8.13 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Mar 25 2022, 06:04:14)\n[Clang 12.0.1 ]\npython-bits: 64\nOS: Darwin\nOS-release: 21.5.0\nmachine: arm64\nprocessor: arm\nbyteorder: little\nLC_ALL: None\nLANG: en_AU.UTF-8\nLOCALE: ('en_AU', 'UTF-8')\nlibhdf5: 1.12.2\nlibnetcdf: 4.8.1\nxarray: 0.1.dev4312+ge678a1d.d20220928\npandas: 1.5.0\nnumpy: 1.22.4\nscipy: 1.9.1\nnetCDF4: 1.6.1\npydap: installed\nh5netcdf: 1.0.2\nh5py: 3.7.0\nNio: None\nzarr: 2.13.2\ncftime: 1.6.2\nnc_time_axis: 1.4.1\nPseudoNetCDF: 3.2.2\nrasterio: 1.3.1\ncfgrib: 0.9.10.1\niris: 3.3.0\nbottleneck: 1.3.5\ndask: 2022.9.1\ndistributed: 2022.9.1\nmatplotlib: 3.6.0\ncartopy: 0.21.0\nseaborn: 0.12.0\nnumbagg: 0.2.1\nfsspec: 2022.8.2\ncupy: None\npint: 0.19.2\nsparse: 0.13.0\nflox: 0.5.9\nnumpy_groupies: 0.9.19\nsetuptools: 65.4.0\npip: 22.2.2\nconda: None\npytest: 7.1.3\nIPython: None\nsphinx: None\n</details>\n</issue>"

The `__len__` method of a dataset where the `ValueError: __len__() should return >= 0` is raised.

Since there are multiple occurrences, it's likely that one is a more general implementation (`common.py`) and the other is specialized for grouped datasets (`groupby.py`).\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?** The `assign_coords` methods are likely responsible for assigning new coordinates to the dataset or data array, altering the dataset's metadata without changing its data.\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?** The issue suggests that after using `assign_coords` on a dataset, `_coord_names` isn't updated appropriately, leading to an inconsistent state that affects operations relying on the dataset's coordinates.\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?** The intended behavior would be to correctly update `_coord_names` after coordinates are assigned, ensuring that the dataset's metadata reflects the updated state, thus preventing errors related to dataset length calculations.\n\n### `__len__` Method Context:\nThe search for the specific `__len__` implementation didn't yield direct results, indicating it may not be straightforwardly defined with `def __len__(self):` or is dynamically handled in a manner not captured by the simplistic search parameter. \n\nGiven the error occurs in `dataset.py` when trying to determine the dataset\u2019s length, we need to explore directly within `dataset.py` how length is calculated, focusing particularly on how it interacts with `_coord_names`, as the issue suggests this calculation ends up negative due to the discrepancy.\n\n1. **Revised search approach**: Given the pivotal role of `dataset.py` in the error, a targeted approach would be to examine `__len__` or related methods within this file to understand how lengths are determined and the role `_coord_names` play in this calculation.\n\n### `_coord_names` Context:\nFound across several files with a heavy concentration in `dataset.py`.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?** The references to `_coord_names` throughout the codebase indicate that it is a crucial component in managing dataset coordinates, likely holding the names of variables that are designated as coordinates.\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?** The incorrect or outdated state of `_coord_names` post `assign_coords` operation seems to directly relate to the erroneous length calculation, suggesting a misalignment between actual coordinate variables and the `_coord_names` list.\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?** The intended behavior would ensure that any operation modifying the dataset's coordinates (like `assign_coords`) would accurately reflect changes in `_coord_names`, thus maintaining the integrity of length calculations and other operations depending on a correct understanding of the dataset's coordinates.\n\nTo further dissect the issue, targeting the exact behavior of dataset length calculation and the management of `_coord_names` in `dataset.py` is crucial. Additionally, examining the `assign_coords` implementation in `common.py` (likely to be the more general one affecting all xarray objects) will provide insights into where the disconnect between coordinate assignment and `_coord_names` update might occur.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nGiven this analysis, we should perform two follow-up API calls:\n1. `get_code_around_line(\"xarray/core/common.py\", line_number, window_size)`: where `line_number` and `window_size` are adjusted to target the `assign_coords` method effectively.\n2. `search_method_in_file(\"__len__\", \"xarray/core/dataset.py\")`: to uncover the specific implementation details of length calculation within datasets, directly addressing the nature of the ValueError encountered."

This involves ensuring that any changes to coordinates (addition, deletion, modification) via `assign_coords` are mirrored in the `_coord_names`, preserving the dataset's integrity and consistency. The method should manage the `_coord_names` list such that no negative lengths can result from operations reliant on the dataset's dimensions and coordinate names. Additionally, any action that modifies coordinates should trigger a validation or update routine to synchronize `_coord_names` with the changed state.\n\n### Bug Location 2:\n- **File:** `xarray/core/dataset.py`\n- **Class/Method:** The method where `__len__` is implemented for the Dataset class, or the logic leading to its computation.\n- **Intended Behavior:** The correction or enhancement needs to ensure that the length of the dataset, presumably calculated as the number of data variables adjusted by the count of coordinate names (`len(dataset._variables) - len(dataset._coord_names)`), never results in a negative value. The `__len__` implementation or surrounding logic should include safeguards against inconsistent states where `_coord_names` might contain entries not reflected in `_variables` or account for situations where coordinate modifications lead to discrepancies. This may involve placing checks or updates in methods altering the dataset's structure to maintain the consistency between `_variables` and `_coord_names`, ensuring correct length calculation."
