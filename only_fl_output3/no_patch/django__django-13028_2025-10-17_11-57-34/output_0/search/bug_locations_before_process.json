        "intended_behavior": "The intended modification to the `check_filterable` method should ensure it differentiates between a model field named `filterable` (which is a legitimate use case) and its internal usage to determine if an expression can indeed be part of a `WHERE` clause. Currently, the method checks if an expression has a `filterable` attribute and if not set to `True`, raises a `NotSupportedError`. This behavior inadvertently conflicts with model fields named `filterable`, causing legitimate filter operations to fail. To resolve the issue without altering existing functionality for other Django users, the method needs an update to explicitly verify if the `expression` is indeed referring to a model field and treat it accordingly, overriding the generic attribute check in these instances. This might involve: Identifying if the expression is a model field early in the `check_filterable` method. Ensuring that model fields named `filterable` do not get mistaken for the internal `filterable` attribute check. Possibly introducing an additional internal check or naming convention that distinguishes ORM-reserved attributes like `filterable` from model field names, thereby avoiding this and similar conflicts. This implies a change not just for this specific scenario, but a broader consideration in Django's ORM design regarding reserved attribute names and model field namespaces, ensuring they are handled in a way that avoids collision and maintains backward compatibility."
