        "intended_behavior": "Modify `open_dataset` to allow for a callable (either a function or a class) to be passed via the `engine` parameter. This callable should be directly used to load the dataset, bypassing the current mechanism of selecting a backend based on string identifiers. The method must first check if the provided `engine` is a callable. If it is, the method should bypass the usual string-based backend selection process and instead directly invoke this callable to load the dataset. This callable is expected to follow a predefined interface or contract, meaning it should accept certain parameters and return data in a format consistent with what xarray expects from its backend systems."
