This callable should be directly used to load the dataset, bypassing the current mechanism of selecting a backend based on string identifiers. The method must first check if the provided `engine` is a callable. If it is, the method should bypass the usual string-based backend selection process and instead directly invoke this callable to load the dataset. This callable is expected to follow a predefined interface or contract, meaning it should accept certain parameters and return data in a format consistent with what xarray expects from its backend systems.\n\nTo achieve this, the following modifications are necessary within `open_dataset`:\n- Implement a check to determine if `engine` is a callable.\n- If `engine` is a callable, use it directly to load the dataset, ensuring that any expected parameters are passed correctly, and handle the dataset object returned by the callable.\n- Ensure that this new pathway is fully compatible with the existing functionalities, such that it doesn't break current implementations that use string identifiers for selecting a backend.\n- Extensively document the expected interface or contract for the callable, including the necessary parameters it must accept, any return value specifications, and potentially any exceptions it must handle or raise.\n\nThis enhancement should allow users to integrate custom backends more seamlessly, providing a more intuitive and flexible approach to extending xarray's data access capabilities."
