Example:\n```python\nfrom custom_backend import engine\nds = xr.load_dataset(filename, engine=engine)\n```\nThis seems like a small function change to me from my initial _quick_ look because there's mainly a bunch of string checks in the normal case until we get to the registered backend functions, if we send in a function instead in the engine-parameter we can just bypass those checks.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n1. **Context from `load_dataset` in `xarray/tutorial.py` and `xarray/backends/api.py`**:\n   - The `load_dataset` function in `xarray/tutorial.py` is a high-level function designed for loading datasets from an online repository into memory. It delegates to `open_dataset`, indicating `open_dataset` might be where the engine parameter is more relevant.\n   - The `load_dataset` function in `xarray/backends/api.py` is more pertinent to the issue. It's described as a thin wrapper around `open_dataset`, suggesting that `open_dataset` is responsible for handling the `filename_or_obj` parameter and possibly the `engine` parameter, which is implicated in selecting the correct backend for data reading. The comment indicates that all parameters, potentially including `engine`, are passed directly to `open_dataset`.\n\n2. **Context from `if engine ==` in `to_netcdf` method within `xarray/backends/api.py`**:\n   - This snippet provides insight into how the engine parameter is currently processed, albeit in the context of saving data rather than loading it. The check `if engine == \"h5netcdf\"` suggests a pattern where the engine's value is compared against known identifiers to conditionally apply processing logic. This logic is not directly related to loading datasets (i.e., the focus of the issue), but it exemplifies how engines are typically handled within xarray's backend API - using string identifiers to dictate processing flow.\n\n**Analysis Based on the Issue Description:**\n- The issue proposes allowing functions to be passed to the `engine` parameter to bypass the string check logic and directly use custom backends for data loading. This implies that the current implementation relies heavily on string identifiers to select and invoke data processing backends, which is consistent with the discovered usage pattern in the `to_netcdf` method.\n- The intended behavior, following the issue description, would be for the `open_dataset` method (and by extension, methods that wrap or depend on it like `load_dataset`) to accept a function as an `engine` argument, bypass the existing string check/selection mechanism, and directly use the provided function for loading data. This would necessitate adding logic to detect when `engine` is a callable (i.e., a function) and integrating this new processing path into the current backend selection and invocation process without disrupting the existing mechanism for string-based identifiers.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps should involve examining the `open_dataset` method directly since it's hinted as the critical juncture for backend selection and thus would be the central point for implementing the requested feature. This means we should look into how `open_dataset` is implemented and specifically how it handles the `engine` parameter.\n\n**Next Steps for Deeper Context**:\n1. Investigate the `open_dataset` implementation to understand how it currently accepts and processes the `engine` parameter:\n   - `search_method(\"open_dataset\")`\n2. Examine how `engine` parameter is evaluated or used to select backends in `open_dataset` or related functions, which might require looking at conditional statements similar to the ones already found but within the context of `open_dataset`.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"if engine ==\", \"xarray/backends/api.py\")`"

However, this pattern reflects a design approach where the engine type is used to dictate the backend-specific logic, albeit in the context of writing data rather than reading it.\n   - **What this part of the code does**: It processes the `engine` parameter to apply backend-specific options when saving datasets.\n   - **Relationship to the bug**: Although this specific code snippet deals with data output, it exemplifies the broader pattern of using string-matched engine parameters to branch the logic within xarray's backend system. This pattern is likely mirrored (and thus more directly related) in the part of the code responsible for reading datasets and needs modification to accommodate the feature request.\n   - **Intended behavior**: While not directly impacting the loading of datasets, the handling pattern here could inform how a similar flexible mechanism for the `engine` parameter might be designed for dataset loading, allowing for function objects or custom backend classes to be passed directly, bypassing or complementing the existing string-based mechanism.\n\nGiven these considerations, the intended behavior to resolve the issue should focus on modifying `xarray/backends/api.py`, specifically how the `open_dataset` method processes the `engine` parameter. This process should be adapted to not only handle string identifiers for known backends but also directly accept and utilize function objects or custom classes representing custom dataset-loading logic.\n\n**Next Steps for Resolution**:\n- **Bug Location & Intended Behavior**:\n  - **File**: `xarray/backends/api.py`\n  - **Method**: `open_dataset`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Enhance the method to check if the `engine` parameter is a callable (function or class). If so, bypass the standard engine string lookup and directly use the callable as the backend engine. This approach would maintain compatibility with existing use cases (string-based engine identifiers) while enabling the dynamic registration and utilization of custom backends as described in the issue.\n\nThe solution should ensure that the rest of `open_dataset`'s functionality, including dataset preprocessing and post-loading operations, remains unaffected by the nature of the engine parameter (string vs. callable). This approach requires careful consideration of how arguments are passed to the callable and how the returned data structure integrates with xarray's expectations for datasets loaded by backend engines."

This callable should be directly used to load the dataset, bypassing the current mechanism of selecting a backend based on string identifiers. The method must first check if the provided `engine` is a callable. If it is, the method should bypass the usual string-based backend selection process and instead directly invoke this callable to load the dataset. This callable is expected to follow a predefined interface or contract, meaning it should accept certain parameters and return data in a format consistent with what xarray expects from its backend systems.\n\nTo achieve this, the following modifications are necessary within `open_dataset`:\n- Implement a check to determine if `engine` is a callable.\n- If `engine` is a callable, use it directly to load the dataset, ensuring that any expected parameters are passed correctly, and handle the dataset object returned by the callable.\n- Ensure that this new pathway is fully compatible with the existing functionalities, such that it doesn't break current implementations that use string identifiers for selecting a backend.\n- Extensively document the expected interface or contract for the callable, including the necessary parameters it must accept, any return value specifications, and potentially any exceptions it must handle or raise.\n\nThis enhancement should allow users to integrate custom backends more seamlessly, providing a more intuitive and flexible approach to extending xarray's data access capabilities."
