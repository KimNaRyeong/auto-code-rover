Based on your requirements, here is a standalone `reproducer.py` script. This script attempts to make a GET request to a URL that will redirect and monitors for the specific `TypeError` related to the byte string issue. It uses the provided function to print the stack trace clearly in case the exception is caught:

```python
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_pyopenssl_redirect():
    try:
        # Attempt to make a GET request that will redirect
        requests.get('https://httpbin.org/status/301')
        # If we reach this point, the assumption is the redirect handling did not fail as expected with TypeError
        raise AssertionError("The expected exception due to the byte string issue was not raised.")
    except TypeError as e:
        # If the specific expected TypeError is caught, check if it is the anticipated byte string issue
        if "buf must be a byte string" in str(e):
            print("Issue reproduced successfully: TypeError due to byte string issue was raised.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(0)  # Exit code 0 indicates the issue was successfully reproduced
        else:
            raise AssertionError("A TypeError was raised, but it does not match the expected byte string issue.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An unexpected exception occurred.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_pyopenssl_redirect()
```
This script is designed to be executed in an environment where it's assumed the issue is present due to specific package versions mentioned in your original description. It should be run with Python 3 and requires the `requests` library to be installed in the environment. 

If the environment or library versions do not align with those known to cause the issue, or if library updates have resolved the underlying problem, the script's behavior might differ (not reproducing the bug as expected). 

Remember, Python and library versions evolve, and changes in behavior could occur due to fixes in new versions.
