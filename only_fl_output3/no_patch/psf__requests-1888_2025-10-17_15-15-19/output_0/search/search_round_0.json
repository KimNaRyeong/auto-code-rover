I see that after the redirect is received the returned URL is [decoded to a Unicode string](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/requests/adapters.py#L181). Then requests passes the response to `resolve_redirects` which uses the url to make a new request. This leads to a Unicode string being passed to urllib3 and eventually pyopenssl. And because in pyopenssl they now check that the data is of type bytes, an exception is thrown.\nI Wrote this test:\n```\ndef test_pyopenssl_redirect(self):\nrequests.get('https://httpbin.org/status/301')\n```\nand this is the result of py.test:\n```\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nself = <OpenSSL.SSL.Connection object at 0x000000000345CC50>\nbuf = u'GET /redirect/1 HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: httpbin.org\\r\\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, defl...cept: */*\\r\\nUser-Agent: python-r\nequests/2.2.1 CPython/2.7.6 Windows/8\\r\\n\\r\\n'\nflags = 0\ndef sendall(self, buf, flags=0):\n\"\"\"\nSend \"all\" data on the connection.

        "content": "To address the issue regarding the `301 redirect` problem with `pyopenssl/SNI`, and the `TypeError` exception raised due to passing a Unicode string instead of a byte string, we will need more context about how the `requests` library handles redirects, particularly with the `resolve_redirects` method mentioned, and where exactly the transformation to a byte string should occur to be compliant with `pyOpenSSL` expectations. Therefore, we'll need to look at the relevant parts of both `requests` and possibly `urllib3` as it's typically used by `requests` for HTTP handling, to understand how the URL is being handled throughout the redirect process.\n\nGiven the bug description, our plan will include:\n\n1. Examining how the `requests` library's `resolve_redirects` function works since the issue seems to stem from how the URLs are being handled during redirect resolution.\n2. Reviewing how `pyOpenSSL` expects data to be passed to it, focusing on the part where the exception is thrown to understand the byte string requirement.\n\nLet's perform the following API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"resolve_redirects\")` to understand how redirects are resolved within the `requests` library.\n- `search_class(\"Connection\")` in `OpenSSL.SSL` as the traceback points to an error in the `Connection` object's `sendall` method.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"sendall\", \"Connection\")` to examine the implementation of the `sendall` method where the type check causing the exception occurs."
