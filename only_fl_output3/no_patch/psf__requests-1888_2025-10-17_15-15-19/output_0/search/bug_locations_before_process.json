        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior within the `resolve_redirects` method is to ensure that all URL strings used in redirects, especially when dealing with HTTPS requests that will be passed to `pyOpenSSL`, are handled as byte strings rather than Unicode strings. This is a critical requirement given that `pyOpenSSL` specifically expects byte strings.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the method should:\n- Encode the URL to bytes before it is passed along to `urllib3` and eventually to `pyOpenSSL`. This encoding step should consider the standard encoding used for URLs in HTTP requests (`utf-8`) while ensuring no data loss or alteration occurs during the conversion process.\n- Make sure that this byte string solution seamlessly integrates with the existing redirect handling logic, preserving functionalities such as URL re-quoting and scheme normalization.\n- Implement this encoding at a point in the `resolve_redirects` method where the URL is final and prepared for the next request, ensuring that all modifications and adjustments to the URL (like scheme normalization, encoding non-ASCII characters, etc.) are completed.\n- It's important to maintain the usability and functionality of the `requests` library, particularly its ability to handle redirects across different schemes (HTTP to HTTPS, for instance) and maintain headers, cookies, and other request elements without disrupting users' expectations.\n\nGiven the absence of direct access to `pyOpenSSL` connection handling in the provided context, the adjustment in the `requests` library, specifically within the `resolve_redirects` method, should ensure compliance with the byte string requirement by proactively managing how URLs are encoded and passed through the request preparation and sending pipeline. This approach will mitigate the `TypeError` experienced when a Unicode string is inadvertently passed to `pyOpenSSL`."
