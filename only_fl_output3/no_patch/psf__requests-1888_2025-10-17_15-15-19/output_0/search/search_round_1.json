I see that after the redirect is received the returned URL is [decoded to a Unicode string](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/requests/adapters.py#L181). Then requests passes the response to `resolve_redirects` which uses the url to make a new request. This leads to a Unicode string being passed to urllib3 and eventually pyopenssl.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the `resolve_redirects` function within `requests/sessions.py`, here are the points relevant to our analysis:\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `resolve_redirects` method is responsible for handling HTTP redirects. When a request is made using the `requests` library, and the response is a redirect status code (`301`, `302`, etc.), this method takes the initial response and follows the redirect path until a non-redirect response is received or the maximum number of redirects is reached. It does so by repeatedly preparing new requests to the URLs indicated in the `location` headers of the redirect responses.\n\nKey operations performed by this method include:\n- Consuming the content of the response to release the socket.\n- Checking for the maximum number of redirects.\n- Updating the request URL based on the `location` header.\n- Correctly handling redirects related to POST requests and converting them to GET requests if necessary, based on standards and observed behaviors of web browsers.\n- Removing the `Content-Length` header and request body if not applicable to the redirected request.\n- Updating cookies based on the responses received during the redirection path.\n- Preparing and sending the new request for each redirect encountered.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue description highlights a problem where a Unicode string (instead of a byte string) is passed along the redirection chain, eventually causing a `TypeError` in the `pyOpenSSL` library. The `resolve_redirects` function plays a crucial role here as it prepares and sends each follow-up request in the redirect chain. The manner in which URLs are processed and passed along\u2014the transformation from a Unicode string to a properly encoded URL ready for another request\u2014can be central to resolving the bug. \n\nNotably, the code already handles encoding the URL via `requote_uri` and attempts to normalize the URL scheme and handling non-standard `location` headers. However, the issue likely arises from how these URLs, once prepared, are handled downstream, particularly when passed to `pyOpenSSL` through the request process.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior would be for the `resolve_redirects` method to handle redirects seamlessly, even when `pyOpenSSL` with SNI support is involved. This implies that all URLs, including those that result from redirects, should be adequately prepared and encoded as byte strings before they are used in any request sent over SSL/TLS connections. Ultimately, the `requests` library should ensure that URLs are encoded in a manner compatible with the underlying libraries it uses (like `urllib3` and `pyOpenSSL`).\n\n### Moving Forward:\n\nGiven that the `Connection` class from `pyOpenSSL` wasn't found, it may be due to looking in the wrong codebase or perhaps an incorrect class name was used. However, since the error traceback points to a method within `pyOpenSSL`, and the available information mentions a failure in handling byte strings, we should focus on how `requests` (and possibly `urllib3`) prepare the URL and ensure it's converted to bytes correctly before reaching `pyOpenSSL`. It would be beneficial to investigate further into how `requests` interfaces with `urllib3` for sending requests, especially over HTTPS, to pinpoint where the encoding conversion should be handled or is mishandled.\n\nFurther API Calls to Consider:\n- Investigate how `requests` uses `urllib3` to send requests (`search_method(\"send\")` in the context of `requests/sessions.py`) to find the actual sending mechanism and how the URL is processed.\n- Since the `Connection` class wasn't found directly, looking into `pyOpenSSL` documentation or source directly might be necessary, or searching for how `requests` or `urllib3` invokes `pyOpenSSL` functions may uncover more details about the interaction leading to the error."

This is a critical requirement given that `pyOpenSSL` specifically expects byte strings.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the method should:\n- Encode the URL to bytes before it is passed along to `urllib3` and eventually to `pyOpenSSL`. This encoding step should consider the standard encoding used for URLs in HTTP requests (`utf-8`) while ensuring no data loss or alteration occurs during the conversion process.\n- Make sure that this byte string solution seamlessly integrates with the existing redirect handling logic, preserving functionalities such as URL re-quoting and scheme normalization.\n- Implement this encoding at a point in the `resolve_redirects` method where the URL is final and prepared for the next request, ensuring that all modifications and adjustments to the URL (like scheme normalization, encoding non-ASCII characters, etc.) are completed.\n- It's important to maintain the usability and functionality of the `requests` library, particularly its ability to handle redirects across different schemes (HTTP to HTTPS, for instance) and maintain headers, cookies, and other request elements without disrupting users' expectations.\n\nGiven the absence of direct access to `pyOpenSSL` connection handling in the provided context, the adjustment in the `requests` library, specifically within the `resolve_redirects` method, should ensure compliance with the byte string requirement by proactively managing how URLs are encoded and passed through the request preparation and sending pipeline. This approach will mitigate the `TypeError` experienced when a Unicode string is inadvertently passed to `pyOpenSSL`."
