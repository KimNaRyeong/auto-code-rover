Given the context and the goal to have a script capable of indicating when the issue is present through an `AssertionError` and exiting with code 0 when it's resolved, I've adapted the initial approach to more precisely target the problem as described. Note, this script directly tackles the exception handling around the `TypeError` of expecting a byte string instead of a Unicode string, which was the core issue.

```python
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_pyopenssl_redirect():
    try:
        # Attempt to make a GET request that will redirect
        response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/status/301', allow_redirects=True)
        
        # It is assumed that the status code should be 200 after redirects are followed
        if response.status_code != 200:
            raise AssertionError("The request did not complete successfully. Status code: {}".format(response.status_code))
        
        print("No AssertionError. Issue is either not present or not reproducible with this test.")
    except TypeError as e:
        # If the expected TypeError is caught, print a detailed stack trace
        if "buf must be a byte string" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            
            # The following line may not be reached if the exception matches and is significant, adjust as needed
            exit(0)  # Exiting with code 0 when the issue is fixed or validated
        else:
            # If there's a TypeError but doesn't match the expected reason, raise an assertion error with details.
            raise AssertionError("TypeError encountered but the reason does not match the expected byte string issue.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An unexpected exception occurred, indicating a potential different problem or setup issue.")

if __name__ == "__main__":

Please ensure that your environment matches the specifics where this issue is known to manifest. This includes the version of Python, `requests`, and dependencies like `pyOpenSSL` and `cryptography` matching those described. Differences in environment setup can lead to variations in behavior and may not reproduce the issue as anticipated.
