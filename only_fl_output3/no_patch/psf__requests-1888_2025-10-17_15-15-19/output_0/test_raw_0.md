Certainly! Below is the standalone Python script `reproducer.py`. This script will attempt to issue a `GET` request to a URL that responds with a `301` redirect while using the specific versions of the libraries your issue pertains to. It then checks for the `TypeError` raised due to the bug described, printing a detailed stack trace if the error is caught. The script assumes the environment already has the specified packages installed and will use them to attempt to reproduce the described issue.

```python
import requests
from requests.exceptions import RequestException

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_pyopenssl_redirect():
    try:
        requests.get('https://httpbin.org/status/301')
        # If no exception, consider it a failure to reproduce
        raise AssertionError("Expected TypeError due to byte string issue, but no exception was raised.")
    except RequestException as e:  # Catching RequestException as TypeError from requests would be encapsulated
        # Inspect the exception to confirm it's related to the byte string issue
        if "must be a byte string" in str(e):
            print("Exception correctly raised for byte string issue.")
            exit(0)  # Exit code 0 for successful reproduction
        else:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("An exception was raised, but it does not seem to be related to the byte string issue.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_pyopenssl_redirect()
```

This script assumes that your environment is already set up with the specified versions of `cryptography`, `ndg-httpsclient`, `pyOpenSSL`, and `pyasn1`, along with the version of `requests` that would demonstrate the issue. Additionally, it presumes that these versions are compatible with Python 3, despite some of the versions listed in the issue being quite old and potentially not fully compatible with more recent Python versions.

If running this script in an incompatible environment or with incompatible package versions, you might encounter other issues or errors unrelated to the one described. Always ensure your virtual environment matches the requirements for reproducing described issues as closely as possible.
