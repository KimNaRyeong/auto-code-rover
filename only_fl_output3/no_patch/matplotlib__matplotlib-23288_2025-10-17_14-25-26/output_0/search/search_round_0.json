QuadPoints\nshall be ignored if any coordinate in the array lies outside the region\nspecified by Rect.\nSo one would also need to provide a larger Rect, which, for viewers not supporting QuadPoints will lead to that the total rectangle outlined by the rotated text will be clickable.\nThis also holds for mathtexts.\n### Operating system\n_No response_\n### Matplotlib Version\nmain\n### Matplotlib Backend\n_No response_\n### Python version\n_No response_\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\ngit checkout\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, it seems necessary to gather more context about how URLs are associated with text elements in matplotlib, particularly in the context of PDF generation. We need to understand the implementation details related to text rendering, PDF output generation, and how URL regions are defined and manipulated within the matplotlib PDF backend.\n\nConsidering the details from the issue, especially the mention of \"QuadPoints\" within the PDF specification and its potential absence leading to the use of the Rect area for clickable links, we should investigate the relevant portions of the matplotlib codebase that handle PDF text rendering and the embedding of URLs.\n\nBased on this, the following API calls would be relevant to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. **Search for PDF-rendering related classes**: Since the issue is specific to PDF outputs, identifying classes responsible for PDF rendering could provide entry points. Classes like `PdfPages`, `PDFBackend`, or similar might be involved in handling PDF specifics.\n\n2. **Search for methods related to text rendering in the PDF backend**: Methods that might be responsible for drawing text or embedding hyperlinks in the PDF output should be looked into. This could include methods that specifically handle the embedding of URLs within the text elements.\n\n3. **Search for occurrences of 'Rect' and 'QuadPoints'**: Since these are specific PDF terms mentioned in the issue, finding their usage within the matplotlib codebase could lead directly to the functionality that needs to be modified.\n\nTherefore, the initial set of API calls to execute would be:\n\n- `search_method(\"savefig\")`\n- `search_class(\"PDFPages\")`\n- `search_method(\"draw_text\")`\n- `search_code(\"QuadPoints\")`\n- `search_code(\"Rect\")`\n\nThese calls aim to find where in the codebase PDF files are generated (`savefig` method), how PDF pages are managed (`PDFPages` class), how text is drawn in the PDF backend (`draw_text` method), and how clickable areas for URLs are currently defined (`Rect` and `QuadPoints` search).\n\nLet's execute these search API calls to gather the needed context."
