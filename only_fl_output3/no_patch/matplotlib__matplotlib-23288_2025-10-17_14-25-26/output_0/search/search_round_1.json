QuadPoints\nshall be ignored if any coordinate in the array lies outside the region\nspecified by Rect.\nSo one would also need to provide a larger Rect, which, for viewers not supporting QuadPoints will lead to that the total rectangle outlined by the rotated text will be clickable.\nThis also holds for mathtexts.\n### Operating system\n_No response_\n### Matplotlib Version\nmain\n### Matplotlib Backend\n_No response_\n### Python version\n_No response_\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\ngit checkout\n</issue>"

We need to understand the implementation details related to text rendering, PDF output generation, and how URL regions are defined and manipulated within the matplotlib PDF backend.\n\nConsidering the details from the issue, especially the mention of \"QuadPoints\" within the PDF specification and its potential absence leading to the use of the Rect area for clickable links, we should investigate the relevant portions of the matplotlib codebase that handle PDF text rendering and the embedding of URLs.\n\nBased on this, the following API calls would be relevant to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. **Search for PDF-rendering related classes**: Since the issue is specific to PDF outputs, identifying classes responsible for PDF rendering could provide entry points. Classes like `PdfPages`, `PDFBackend`, or similar might be involved in handling PDF specifics.\n\n2. **Search for methods related to text rendering in the PDF backend**: Methods that might be responsible for drawing text or embedding hyperlinks in the PDF output should be looked into. This could include methods that specifically handle the embedding of URLs within the text elements.\n\n3. **Search for occurrences of 'Rect' and 'QuadPoints'**: Since these are specific PDF terms mentioned in the issue, finding their usage within the matplotlib codebase could lead directly to the functionality that needs to be modified.\n\nTherefore, the initial set of API calls to execute would be:\n\n- `search_method(\"savefig\")`\n- `search_class(\"PDFPages\")`\n- `search_method(\"draw_text\")`\n- `search_code(\"QuadPoints\")`\n- `search_code(\"Rect\")`\n\nThese calls aim to find where in the codebase PDF files are generated (`savefig` method), how PDF pages are managed (`PDFPages` class), how text is drawn in the PDF backend (`draw_text` method), and how clickable areas for URLs are currently defined (`Rect` and `QuadPoints` search).\n\nLet's execute these search API calls to gather the needed context."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context gives us valuable insights into how matplotlib handles saving figures to PDF and rendering text, which is critical for addressing the bug described in the issue.\n\n### Analyzing `savefig` Method Calls\nThe `savefig` method is a key entry point for generating output files, including PDFs, in different backends like `backend_pdf`, `backend_pgf`, and more. Since the issue occurs when saving a figure with text containing a URL to a PDF, the implementation in `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py` is particularly relevant. This suggests that:\n1. The PDF backend has specific methods to handle figure saving and likely delegates text rendering and URL embedding to other methods within the same or related classes.\n2. The issue likely resides in how these methods process text rotation and URL embedding, possibly not accounting for rotated text regions accurately.\n\n### Absence of `PDFPages` Class\nAlthough `PDFPages` was not found, it's possible it was a misunderstanding or misremembering on my part regarding its exact name or existence. We might need to look for similarly named classes or functionalities within `backend_pdf.py` that handle multipage PDF document creation or manipulation.\n\n### `draw_text` Method Calls\nThe presence of `draw_text` methods across various backends, including `backend_pdf.py`, indicates these are likely responsible for rendering text onto the output medium. Given that the bug involves improperly rotated URL-sensitive areas in PDFs:\n1. `draw_text` within `backend_pdf.py` is a candidate for reviewing how text and associated URLs are drawn, particularly how rotation is applied to the text and whether this rotation extends to clickable areas.\n2. The bug may stem from a mismatch or oversight in how rotation is applied to the text itself versus the clickable URL region specified by `Rect`.\n\n### `QuadPoints` Absence\nThe absence of `QuadPoints` in the codebase suggests that the current implementation does not utilize this PDF feature to specify clickable regions accurately for rotated text. This absence is directly related to the bug since `QuadPoints` would allow defining rotated clickable areas matching the visual orientation of the text.\n\n### Analysis of `Rect` Usage\nThe widespread use of `Rect` throughout the codebase, including in `backend_pdf.py`, indicates that it is a fundamental part of how spatial regions are defined, likely including clickable regions for URLs in PDFs. The current use of `Rect`:\n1. May not accommodate the need to define non-axis-aligned (rotated) clickable regions, contributing to the bug.\n2. Modifying how `Rect` is used or augmenting it with `QuadPoints` (if it were to be implemented) could be a solution to achieving the expected behavior of clickable areas matching the visual orientation of text.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\nGiven this analysis, the immediate next steps for further investigation should include:\n- **Inspecting `backend_pdf.py`**: We need to delve deeper into the `backend_pdf.py` file, especially the `draw_text` method and any code handling the creation of URL regions (`Rect` usage in PDF contexts). This will offer insights into where the bug's root causes lie and highlight potential avenues for implementing `QuadPoints` or alternative solutions.\n- **Exploring Alternate API Calls**: Since `PDFPages` was not found, another API call to search methods related to managing PDF pages or documents in `backend_pdf.py` could provide more context. Similarly, a specific search in `backend_pdf.py` for `Rect` usage can help understand how the clickable areas are currently implemented.\n\nBy focusing on how `backend_pdf.py` implements text rendering and URL handling, we can identify the mismatch between visual text orientation and clickable areas, guiding the implementation of a solution that ensures that clickable areas accurately reflect the text's rotation."

Therefore, the following searches are proposed:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"draw_text\", \"lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py\")`\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"Rect\", \"lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py\")`\n\n2.

The intended behavior here is to ensure that when `draw_text` is rendering text with an associated URL, it should calculate the `Rect` in such a way that it accurately reflects the orientation (rotation) of the text. This could involve computing the bounding box of the rotated text and using this information to adjust the clickable URL area appropriately. If `QuadPoints` support is to be added, this method would be the right location to incorporate logic to calculate and include `QuadPoints` data for PDF viewers that support it, ensuring backward compatibility with viewers that only read `Rect`.\n\n   - **Location 2:** File: `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pdf.py`, Class: Not specified, Functionality: implementation of `QuadPoints`. The intended behavior here is to add support for `QuadPoints` if it turns out to be feasible and beneficial for accurately mapping the clickable areas of URLs to the visual display of rotated text. This would likely involve creating a new method or modifying existing methods to calculate and set `QuadPoints` for text annotations with URLs when saving as PDF, making sure that if a viewer does not support `QuadPoints`, the fallback behavior (using `Rect`) is sensible and does not lead to a larger clickable area than intended.\n\nThese proposed locations and behaviors aim at directly addressing the observed bug by ensuring that the clickable areas for URLs in PDF documents correctly match the visual orientation of the associated text, thus improving user interaction with generated PDFs from matplotlib figures."
