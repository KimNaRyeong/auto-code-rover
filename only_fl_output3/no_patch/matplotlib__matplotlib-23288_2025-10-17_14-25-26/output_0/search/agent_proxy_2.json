This involves adjusting the coordinates specified in the `Rect` field based on the rotation angle (`angle` parameter) so that the clickable area for the URL accurately matches the visual representation of the rotated text. This might require transforming the corner points of the rectangle using the rotation matrix or similar mathematical approach that aligns the clickable area with the rotated text bounds. The current functionality of creating a clickable area should be preserved, but the calculation of the `Rect` should be enhanced to incorporate the text rotation. Additionally, if feasible, investigate the possibility of implementing support for `QuadPoints` for a more precise definition of the clickable area aligning with the actual rotated text appearance. This adjustment ensures that users interacting with the PDF document have a consistent and intuitive experience, where clicking on visually rotated text activates the linked URL as expected. \n\nThis modification addresses the core issue described, ensuring that the clickable areas for URLs in PDFs generated by matplotlib are rotation-aware and visually intuitive."
