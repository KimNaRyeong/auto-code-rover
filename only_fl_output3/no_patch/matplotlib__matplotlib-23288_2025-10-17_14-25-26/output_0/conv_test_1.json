QuadPoints\r\nshall be ignored if any coordinate in the array lies outside the region\r\nspecified by Rect.\r\n\r\nSo one would also need to provide a larger Rect, which, for viewers not supporting QuadPoints will lead to that the total rectangle outlined by the rotated text will be clickable.\r\n\r\nThis also holds for mathtexts.\n\n### Operating system\n\n_No response_\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\nmain\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\n_No response_\n\n### Python version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\ngit checkout\n"
