Given the context, we should focus on the built-in validators of Django, how they raise `ValidationError`, and how they format their error messages. The document link provided in the issue points towards writing validators, which could imply that we need to look into how custom validators are implemented or how to enhance error messages in existing validators.\n\nHere are the necessary steps:\n\n1. **Search for Built-in Validators**: To understand how they are currently implemented and how they raise validation errors without including the provided value.\n   \n2. **Search for ValidationError Implementation**: To check how `ValidationError` is raised and if it currently supports including provided values in the error message or if it can be enhanced to do so.\n\n3. **Search for Error Message Formatting Logic**: If there's a specific method or pattern used in formatting error messages within validators, studying this could provide insights into how to include the provided value in the message.\n\nBased on these requirements, here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. **Searching for Built-in Validators**:\n   - `search_class(\"BaseValidator\")`: This is a generic call to find base or common validators which might be extended or used by more specific validators.\n   - `search_code(\"ValidationError\")`: To see how `ValidationError` is being used across the codebase, specifically in contexts where validators are involved.\n\n2. **Investigate ValidationError Implementation**:\n   - `search_class(\"ValidationError\")`: To understand the constructor and methods of `ValidationError`, focusing on how it handles error messages.\n\n3. **Examine Error Message Formatting**:\n   - `search_method(\"format_message\")`: Assuming there might be a method responsible for formatting error messages that could be enhanced or used as reference.\n\n4. **Validators Error Message Implementation**:\n   - `search_code(\"raise ValidationError\")`: To find occurrences where `ValidationError` is raised within validators, which can give context on how error messages are currently built and how they could possibly be modified to include the provided value.\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive view of the current implementation of validators, how `ValidationError` is constructed, and the feasibility of including the provided value in error messages."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. BaseValidator in django/core/validators.py\n- **What this part of the code does**: The `BaseValidator` class defines a structure for validator classes in Django. It includes a template message with placeholders for `limit_value` and `show_value`. This class is likely the foundation for various specific validators.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: The issue describes the need to include the provided value in the `ValidationError` message. The `BaseValidator` already uses a placeholder mechanism (`%(show_value)s`) which could potentially accommodate the `value` mentioned in the issue by ensuring it is included when errors are raised.\n- **Intended behavior post-resolution**: Extend or ensure that `BaseValidator` and derived validators gracefully handle including the provided value in error messages, leveraging the template mechanism already in place.\n\n#### 2. ValidationError in django/core/exceptions.py\n- **What this part of the code does**: Defines the `ValidationError` exception class, including initialization that accepts a message, code, and params. This exception can handle structured error messages, including dictionaries and lists of errors.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: Directly related, as the issue concerns enhancing how `ValidationError` includes and formats the provided value in error messages.\n- **Intended behavior post-resolution**: Enhance the `ValidationError` to natively support including the provided value in its error message, possibly through the existing `params` argument or by introducing a new mechanism for it.\n\n#### 3. Usage of ValidationError across the codebase\n- **What this part of the code does**: Various usages of `ValidationError` show it being raised in many different contexts within Django, especially within form and model validation.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: Highlights the widespread impact of changing how `ValidationError` messages are formatted, as these changes will affect form, model, admin, and other validations.\n- **Intended behavior post-resolution**: Ensure the enhanced message formatting, including the provided value, is compatible and beneficial across all usages without introducing regressions or breaking existing custom validations.\n\n#### 4. Absence of format_message Method\n- **What this part of the code does**: The search did not return a method named `format_message`, which suggests that message formatting might not be centralized or explicitly named as such in the Django codebase.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: This indicates that making modifications to how error messages are formatted, specifically including the provided value, might require changes in several places or introducing new functionality.\n- **Intended behavior post-resolution**: Potentially introduce a standardized method or mechanism for formatting error messages, which could then be utilized to include the provided value as required by the issue.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the direct relevance of `ValidationError` and its usage, as well as the implicit capability in `BaseValidator` to handle placeholders in error messages, the next steps involve proposing changes or enhancements in these areas. Specifically:\n\n1. Explore enhancing `ValidationError`'s constructor or methods to better support including the provided value in error messages. This might involve leveraging the `params` argument or introducing a standardized formatting mechanism.\n2. Ensure that this enhancement is compatible with the current usage of placeholders in validators like `BaseValidator`.\n3. Provide guidance or modifications to all built-in validators to consistently include the provided value in error messages, aligning with the new mechanism or enhancements introduced to `ValidationError`.\n\nIt might also be worth considering a review of places where `ValidationError` is raised without utilizing a structured message that could benefit from including the provided value, ensuring these scenarios are also covered by the solution."

This enhancement would allow dynamically inserting the provided value into the error message template, possibly utilizing the `params` dictionary already passed to `ValidationError`. The implementation must ensure that existing functionality, such as message formatting and error dict handling, remains intact and backward compatible. Additionally, consider extending the class documentation to include examples of using the new capability.\n\n    - **Location 2**:\n      - **File**: django/core/validators.py\n      - **Class**: BaseValidator\n      - **Intended Behavior**: Modify the `__call__` method to ensure that when raising `ValidationError`, the provided value is included in the error message in a standardized manner. This may involve adjusting how `message` and `code` are passed to `ValidationError`. The modification should preserve the validator's current logic for comparing values and determining validity, only extending the functionality to enhance error messaging. Incorporating the provided value directly in the error message template (e.g., using `%(value)s` placeholder as suggested in the issue) would require ensuring that all validators properly pass the provided value when constructing error messages.\n\nThese enhancements aim to make the error messaging in Django's validation mechanism more informative and user-friendly by including context about the provided value that caused the validation to fail, without altering the core validation functionality."
