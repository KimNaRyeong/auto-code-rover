For example:\n\u201cblah\u201d is not a valid email.\nBy making built-in validators provide value to ValidationError, one can override an error message and use a %(value)s placeholder.\nThis placeholder value matches an example already in the docs:\n\u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/validators/#writing-validators\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue of making validators include the provided value in `ValidationError` with the ability to use a placeholder like `%(value)s` in the error message, we need to investigate the current implementation of the validators and `ValidationError` raising mechanism. Given the context, we should focus on the built-in validators of Django, how they raise `ValidationError`, and how they format their error messages. The document link provided in the issue points towards writing validators, which could imply that we need to look into how custom validators are implemented or how to enhance error messages in existing validators.\n\nHere are the necessary steps:\n\n1. **Search for Built-in Validators**: To understand how they are currently implemented and how they raise validation errors without including the provided value.\n   \n2. **Search for ValidationError Implementation**: To check how `ValidationError` is raised and if it currently supports including provided values in the error message or if it can be enhanced to do so.\n\n3. **Search for Error Message Formatting Logic**: If there's a specific method or pattern used in formatting error messages within validators, studying this could provide insights into how to include the provided value in the message.\n\nBased on these requirements, here are the API calls I would make:\n\n1. **Searching for Built-in Validators**:\n   - `search_class(\"BaseValidator\")`: This is a generic call to find base or common validators which might be extended or used by more specific validators.\n   - `search_code(\"ValidationError\")`: To see how `ValidationError` is being used across the codebase, specifically in contexts where validators are involved.\n\n2. **Investigate ValidationError Implementation**:\n   - `search_class(\"ValidationError\")`: To understand the constructor and methods of `ValidationError`, focusing on how it handles error messages.\n\n3. **Examine Error Message Formatting**:\n   - `search_method(\"format_message\")`: Assuming there might be a method responsible for formatting error messages that could be enhanced or used as reference.\n\n4. **Validators Error Message Implementation**:\n   - `search_code(\"raise ValidationError\")`: To find occurrences where `ValidationError` is raised within validators, which can give context on how error messages are currently built and how they could possibly be modified to include the provided value.\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive view of the current implementation of validators, how `ValidationError` is constructed, and the feasibility of including the provided value in error messages."
