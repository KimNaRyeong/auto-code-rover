This enhancement would allow dynamically inserting the provided value into the error message template, possibly utilizing the `params` dictionary already passed to `ValidationError`. The implementation must ensure that existing functionality, such as message formatting and error dict handling, remains intact and backward compatible. Additionally, consider extending the class documentation to include examples of using the new capability."

This may involve adjusting how `message` and `code` are passed to `ValidationError`. The modification should preserve the validator's current logic for comparing values and determining validity, only extending the functionality to enhance error messaging. Incorporating the provided value directly in the error message template (e.g., using `%(value)s` placeholder as suggested in the issue) would require ensuring that all validators properly pass the provided value when constructing error messages."
