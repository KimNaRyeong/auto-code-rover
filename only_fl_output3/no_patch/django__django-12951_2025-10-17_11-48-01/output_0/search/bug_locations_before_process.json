        "intended_behavior": "The `__init__` method of the `When` class should be modified to support directly using an `Exists` expression alongside keyword arguments, without the need for explicitly wrapping it in a `Q` object. This involves adjusting the conditional verification process within the method to allow `Exists` as a valid condition even when keyword arguments are present. The modification must ensure that this change does not impact the existing functionality of the `When` class, especially its ability to handle `Q` objects, boolean expressions, or simple lookup conditions. This includes preserving type checking and raising errors for truly unsupported types or conditions. The intended behavior aims to make the usage of `When` with `Exists` more intuitive, aligning it with how developers can use conditions in `filter()` calls, thereby enhancing consistency across the Django ORM API."
