For instance, consider:\nclass State(models.Model):\npass\nclass County(models.Model):\nname = CharField(max_length=50)\nstate = ForeignKey(State, related_name='counties')\nI can execute the following query just fine:\nCounty.objects.filter(\nExists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")),\nname=\"Dallas\",\n)\nBut a similar query using When does not work:\n>>> County.objects.annotate(\nstatus=Case(\nWhen(Exists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")), name=\"Dallas\", then=Value(\"DALLAS COUNTY\")),\ndefault=Value(\"ELSEWHERE\"),\n))\nTypeError: When() supports a Q object, a boolean expression, or lookups as a condition.\nInstead the arguments must be wrapped in a Q object:\n>>> County.objects.annotate(\nstatus=Case(\nWhen(Q(Exists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name=\"Texas\")), name=\"Dallas\"), then=Value(\"DALLAS COUNTY\")),\ndefault=Value(\"ELSEWHERE\"),\n))\nThis is inconvenient and inconsistent with how filter works, as shown.\nWhen's init method can be modified to allow similar input as filter. \u200bCode is in a branch in my repo, but as this is my first time contributing to Django, I want to make sure I open a ticket and get feedback first.\nAlso I wasn't sure how to classify this. I wasn't sure if it was a bug, as I wasn't sure if it was designed this way.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context and the issue concerning the inability to mix an `Exists` expression with keyword arguments to `When`, let's address the questions for a comprehensive understanding.\n\n### Analysis of the Collected Context\n\n#### `When` Class\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \n  The `When` class is part of the Django ORM and is used within a `Case` statement. It represents a single condition and result expression within `Case`. The constructor (`__init__`) accepts a `condition`, a `then` argument representing the outcome if the condition is met, and any number of lookups as keyword arguments.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug**  \n  The issue describes a problem where passing an `Exists` expression directly into a `When` alongside keyword arguments (e.g., `name=\"Dallas\"`) doesn't work as expected, contrary to similar usage in `filter()`. The error message suggests that `When` only accepts a `Q` object, a boolean expression, or lookups as a condition. The initialization code explicitly checks if the condition is valid, raising a `TypeError` if not constructed properly, thus directly relating to the reported issue.\n\n- **Intended behavior**  \n  Ideally, developers expect `When` to allow an `Exists` expression to be combined with keyword arguments without explicitly wrapping them in a `Q` object, similar to how `filter()` works. This would involve `When`'s `__init__` method handling an `Exists` expression appropriately while also allowing for additional keyword arguments.\n\n#### `Case`, `Exists`, and `OuterRef` Classes\n- These classes form a toolkit within Django's ORM for constructing complex SQL queries.\n\n- **`Case` Class**  \n    - **Intended behavior**: The `Case` expression lets you create SQL `CASE` statements, which return specific values based on conditional expressions. It's a higher-level construct that depends on `When` objects to define these conditions.\n\n- **`Exists` Class**  \n    - **Intended behavior**: This class is used to create SQL `EXISTS` statements. An `EXISTS` condition in SQL returns true if the subquery returns one or more records. Being able to use `Exists` within `When` would allow for complex conditional logic in annotations.\n\n- **`OuterRef` Class**  \n    - **Intended behavior**: It is used for referencing outer fields within a subquery, enabling correlated subqueries. This functionality is essential for the described use case, allowing an `Exists` subquery to reference fields from the outer query.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\nThe core issue relates to the design of the `When` class and how it parses and validates its arguments, specifically interaction with `Exists`. The expected behavior is for `When` to gracefully accept an `Exists` expression alongside keyword arguments for a more intuitive developer experience.\n\nGiven this analysis, modifications to the `When.__init__` method could allow direct integration of `Exists` with keyword arguments by modifying the condition check to support this pattern. This could involve altering how `condition` and `lookups` are processed and validated, ensuring compatibility with both `Exists` use cases and maintaining existing functionalities for backward compatibility.\n\nThe next logical step would entail examining how `lookups` and `condition` are uniquely processed within `When.__init__` and exploring adjustments that can generalize the handling of `Exists` expressions similar to Django's `filter` method functionality. This would address the user's issue while streamlining `When`'s usability for complex conditional logic in Django queries."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

This involves adjusting the conditional verification process within the method to allow `Exists` as a valid condition even when keyword arguments are present. The modification must ensure that this change does not impact the existing functionality of the `When` class, especially its ability to handle `Q` objects, boolean expressions, or simple lookup conditions. This includes preserving type checking and raising errors for truly unsupported types or conditions. The intended behavior aims to make the usage of `When` with `Exists` more intuitive, aligning it with how developers can use conditions in `filter()` calls, thereby enhancing consistency across the Django ORM API."
