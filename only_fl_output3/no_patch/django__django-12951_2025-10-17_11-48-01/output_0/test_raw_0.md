This script will try to annotate County model instances based on an `Exists` condition mixed with keyword arguments in a `When` clause, as described in the given issue. If the issue is present, it will catch a `TypeError` and print a detailed stack trace. If for some reason the operation is successful, it will raise an `AssertionError`, indicating the problem might have been resolved (the script then exits with code 1). Please ensure Django is installed in your environment before running this script.
