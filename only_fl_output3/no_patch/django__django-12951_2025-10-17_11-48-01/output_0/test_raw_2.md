Given the revised requirements, here is an attempt to write a more precise `reproducer.py` that aims to directly reproduce the issue initially described. In this version, we focus on mixing `Exists` expressions with keyword arguments in a `When` clause correctly and handling errors in line with the described requirement.

```python
# reproducer.py

import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import When, Case, Value, Exists, OuterRef, CharField, ForeignKey, Q

# Define minimal Django settings
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={"default": {"ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3", "NAME": ":memory:"}},
    INSTALLED_APPS=["__main__"],
    USE_TZ=True,
)
django.setup()

# Setup test models
class State(models.Model):
    name = CharField(max_length=50)

    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'

class County(models.Model):
    name = CharField(max_length=50)
    state = ForeignKey(State, related_name='counties', on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'

# Utility function to print stack trace
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    # This is the main part to reproduce the issue as described
    County.objects.annotate(
        status=Case(
            When(Exists(State.objects.filter(counties=OuterRef('pk'), name="Texas")) & Q(name="Dallas"), then=Value("DALLAS COUNTY")),
            default=Value("ELSEWHERE"),
        )
    )
    print("The issue has been resolved, script did not raise an error.")
    exit(0)  # Exit code 0, if the issue is fixed and no assertion is raised
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    # Raising an AssertionError if the script encounters the described issue.
    raise AssertionError("The issue 'Cannot mix Exists expression with keyword arguments to When' was reproduced.")
```

This script first sets up a minimal Django environment, defining a simple database schema with a couple of models to illustrate the issue. Then it attempts to create an annotation using `Case` and `When` where a `When` clause includes an `Exists` expression combined with a `Q` object for keyword arguments. The expectation is that it will trigger a `TypeError`, showing the issue as described. The script uses the provided `print_stacktrace` function to detail the error if it occurs as expected.

Please ensure that this script is run in an environment where Django is installed and configured correctly to execute Django ORM commands.
