        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior for `_unregister_lookup` is to ensure that after a lookup is removed from `class_lookups`, the lookup cache should also be cleared to avoid serving stale or removed lookups. This aligns with the cache clearing mechanism employed in the `register_lookup` method. Therefore, the method should call `_clear_cached_lookups` after the lookup is successfully removed from `class_lookups`. This change ensures that the cache does not retain entries for lookups that have been unregistered, maintaining system integrity and consistency in the behavior of dynamic lookup registration and unregistration. This approach preserves existing functionality while fixing the reported issue."
