Corresponding to this change, minor changes need to be brought in the schema.tests.SchemaTests.test_func_unique_constraint_lookups test.\nThe PR generated is \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/15569\n</issue>"

Search for the `RegisterLookupMixin` class to understand its structure and the intended behavior of both `_unregister_lookup()` and `register_lookup()` methods.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"RegisterLookupMixin\")\n```\n\n2. Search for the `_unregister_lookup` method within `django/db/models/query_utils.py` to understand its current implementation and to see if the cache clearing mechanism is indeed missing.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"_unregister_lookup\", \"django/db/models/query_utils.py\")\n```\n\n3. To contrast the above, let's search for the `register_lookup` method within `django/db/models/query_utils.py` to understand how cache clearing is implemented there, thereby understanding what might be missing in `_unregister_lookup`.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"register_lookup\", \"django/db/models/query_utils.py\")\n```\n\n4. Finally, since the issue mentions that minor changes are required in a specific test following the modification of `_unregister_lookup`, it would be prudent to look at the current state of that test. This involves searching for the `test_func_unique_constraint_lookups` within the `schema.tests.SchemaTests` test case.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"test_func_unique_constraint_lookups\", \"SchemaTests\")\n```\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive context on the structure of `RegisterLookupMixin`, the implementation of both `_unregister_lookup` and `register_lookup` methods, and the state of the related test case in the Django codebase."
