        "content": "<issue>Nested blueprints are not respected when mounted on subdomains\nHello, and thanks for all your work \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\nNested blueprints [as described in the docs](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/blueprints/#nesting-blueprints) work perfectly fine when using `url_prefix`. However, when mounting the parent blueprint using a subdomain, the child routes are not accessible.\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom flask import Blueprint\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config[\"SERVER_NAME\"] = \"localhost:5000\"\nparent = Blueprint(\"parent\", __name__)\nchild = Blueprint(\"child\", __name__)\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\nreturn \"index\"\n@parent.route('/')\ndef parent_index():\nreturn \"parent\"\n@child.route('/child/')\ndef child_index():\nreturn \"child\"\nparent.register_blueprint(child)\napp.register_blueprint(parent, subdomain=\"api\")\nif __name__ == '__main__':\napp.run(debug=True)\n```\nThe index route works as expected:\n```\n\u276f http http://localhost:5000/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 5\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:44:10 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\nindex\n```\nSo does the parent route in the subdomain:\n```\n\u276f http http://api.localhost:5000/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 6\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:44:06 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\nparent\n```\nBut the child responds with a 404:\n```\n\u276f http http://api.localhost:5000/child/\nHTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 207\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:45:42 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=en>\n<title>404 Not Found</title>\n<h1>Not Found</h1>\n<p>The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.</p>\n```\nIf we change the `subdomain=\"api\"` for `url_prefix=\"/api\"` when registering the blueprint however everything works as expected:\n```\n\u276f http http://localhost:5000/api/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 6\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:46:53 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\nparent\n\u276f http http://localhost:5000/api/child/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 5\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:46:59 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\nchild\n```\nThis was surprising to me as I expected the same nesting to apply regardless of whether the parent is mounted using a subdomain or a URL prefix. Am I missing something?\nEnvironment:\n- Python version: 3.10\n- Flask version: 2.2.2\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n### Blueprint Class in `src/flask/blueprints.py`\nThe `Blueprint` class extends `Scaffold` and provides functionalities that are essential for constructing and organizing applications into components. It supports various attributes like `url_prefix` and `subdomain`, which are crucial for the issue at hand. The initialization parameters of this class, particularly `url_prefix` and `subdomain`, allow for the configuration of the URL structure and domain under which the blueprint's routes will be accessible.\n\n**Relationship with the bug:** The issue arises when a nested blueprint is mounted using a subdomain. Given that the `Blueprint` class handles the registration of blueprints and supports the `subdomain` parameter, it\u2019s clear that this class plays a key role in the issue. The intended behavior should allow nested blueprints to be accessible under the parent blueprint's subdomain.\n\n### Register_blueprint Methods\nWith `register_blueprint` methods found in both `src/flask/blueprints.py` and `src/flask/app.py`, these methods are responsible for actually registering a blueprint with the application or another blueprint. The blueprint being registered can have its own `url_prefix` and `subdomain`, which should be respected during the registration process.\n\n**Relationship with the bug:** The issue potentially lies within how these `register_blueprint` methods manage the `subdomain` parameter for nested blueprints. The expected behavior would be to allow access to nested blueprints under the parent blueprint\u2019s subdomain, but the child routes are returning a 404 error instead.\n\n### Code Snippets Containing `url_prefix` and `subdomain`\nThe numerous references to `url_prefix` and `subdomain` in `src/flask/blueprints.py` and `src/flask/app.py` indicate the pervasive support for these configurations within the Flask framework. These attributes are applied throughout the routing and registration processes, influencing how URLs are constructed and resolved.\n\n**Relationship with the bug:** Clearly, both `url_prefix` and `subdomain` are integral to Flask's routing mechanism. The bug reflects a discrepancy in how these settings are applied to nested blueprints, particularly concerning `subdomain`. While `url_prefix` works as expected, applying a `subdomain` to a parent blueprint does not carry through to child blueprints in the manner the reporter expected.\n\n### Intended Behavior Based on the Issue\nFor this Flask framework configuration, the user expected that when a parent blueprint is mounted on a subdomain, any registered child blueprints would also be accessible under that subdomain. This functionality works as intended when using `url_prefix`, suggesting that the issue lies specifically with how subdomains are handled during the blueprint registration or routing process.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps may involve:\n1. Investigating the internal logic of `register_blueprint` methods in both the `Blueprint` class and the Flask app to understand how subdomains are treated for nested blueprints.\n2. Looking deeper into how routes are matched against requests within subdomains might also provide insight, indicating whether Flask properly recognizes the nested blueprint routes under subdomains.\n\nUnderstanding these aspects will be crucial for identifying the root cause of the issue and formulating a corresponding patch."

This means enhancing the logic within these methods to check if the parent blueprint (or Flask app, in case of root blueprints) has a `subdomain` specified and applying it to the child blueprint being registered. This behavior should be optional and only kick in if the child blueprint does not specify its own `subdomain`, preserving the existing flexibility of Flask's blueprint system.\n\nAdditionally, this adjustment must maintain backward compatibility, ensuring that existing applications that rely on the current behavior without using `subdomain` continue to function as expected. The patch should focus on improving how subdomain inheritance works in the context of nested blueprints to cover use cases brought up by the issue without altering the core functionalities and behaviors of blueprints in Flask that users depend on."
