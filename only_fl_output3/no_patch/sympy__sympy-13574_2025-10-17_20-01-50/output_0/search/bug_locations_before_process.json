        "intended_behavior": "The method should be enhanced to ensure that when generating sparse symmetric matrices (i.e., when both symmetric=True and percent < 100 are specified), it maintains the matrix\u2019s symmetry in the distribution of non-zero elements. A possible approach to achieving this is after calculating the number of non-zero elements based on the percent value, the adjustment for sparsity should be applied by identifying positions for zero elements in a symmetric fashion. Essentially, if an element [i][j] is chosen to be made zero, then element [j][i] should also be made zero, ensuring the symmetry is preserved even after introducing sparsity. This change must preserve the original functionality of the method for all other use cases, ensuring that it only affects the behavior when a matrix is specified to be both symmetric and sparse. The original generates symmetric matrices well when percent=100, but fails to do this sensibly for values of percent less than 100. The fix should adjust how elements are made zero while ensuring the total number of zero elements roughly matches the specified percentage, and maintaining the symmetric property of the matrix."
