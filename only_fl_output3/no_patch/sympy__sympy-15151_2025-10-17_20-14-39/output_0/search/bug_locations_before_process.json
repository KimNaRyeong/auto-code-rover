        "intended_behavior": "This method, responsible for converting indexed objects to their string representation, should be revisited to ensure that it formats indexed objects in a mathematically conventional manner. Specifically, when dealing with indexed variables, it should adopt a formatting style that aligns with common mathematical notation, such as LaTeX. For instance, an indexed variable like x1, i (which is currently not being pretty-printed as expected) should be formatted as x_{1,i}. This adjustment will require the method to intelligently recognize when the object represents an indexed entity and apply the appropriate formatting rules. This enhancement should be made while ensuring that all other functionalities provided by _sympystr remain intact and other types of expressions continue to be formatted correctly without any regressions."
