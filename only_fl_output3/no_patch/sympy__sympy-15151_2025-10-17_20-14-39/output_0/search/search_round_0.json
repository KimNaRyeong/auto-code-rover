        "content": "To address the issue related to pretty printing indexed expressions like `x1, i` with the expected output being `x_{1,i}`, I would propose the following API calls to gather more context:\n\n1. Since the issue likely pertains to a function or method that handles the rendering or formatting of mathematical expressions, a logical step would be to search for methods related to pretty printing or formatting. This could involve methods with names such as `prettyPrint`, `formatExpression`, or similar. Therefore, we should start by searching for methods that may be responsible for this functionality:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_method(\"prettyPrint\")\nsearch_method(\"formatExpression\")\n```\n\n2. Given the specific nature of the issue\u2014focusing on rendering indexed expressions\u2014it's plausible there are specialized classes or methods dedicated to handling indexed variables or expressions. Hence, searching for classes or methods that mention \"indexed\" might reveal relevant code:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class(\"Indexed\")\nsearch_method(\"indexed\")\n```\n\n3. The provided image in the issue suggests that the problem lies within a specific context where mathematical expressions are being rendered. If there's a method directly responsible for rendering expressions to a visual format or for converting them to a LaTeX-like syntax (which seems to be implied by the expected output `x_{1,i}`), it would make sense to locate this code:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_method(\"toLatex\")\nsearch_method(\"renderExpression\")\n```\n\n4. Lastly, if there's already code related to handling indexed expressions but there might be a bug in how these are specifically formatted, looking for occurrences of code snippets that handle indexing could be insightful. Snippets such as `.indexed(` or `_index` in the code might lead to the problematic area:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_code(\".indexed(\")\nsearch_code(\"_index\")\n```\n\nThese API calls are designed to explore different aspects of the problem, from looking for methods and classes that could directly be related to the issue, to more general searches that might reveal underlying utilities or helper methods that contribute to the problem. They aim to provide a broad overview of the potential areas in the codebase that could be contributing to the issue at hand."
