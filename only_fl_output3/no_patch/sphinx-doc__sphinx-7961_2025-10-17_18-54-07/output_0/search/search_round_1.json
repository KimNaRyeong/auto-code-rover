It would be great to get this into the Sphinx MathJax extension.\nThe [MathJax upgrading docs](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/v2.html#upgrading-from-v2-to-v3) suggest that it will not be trivial to upgrade, but it may be worth it given the performance and modularity improvements.

        "content": "To tackle the issue of upgrading MathJax to version 3.0 within the Sphinx MathJax extension, we need comprehensive context about the current integration. Particularly, we need to understand how MathJax is initialized and configured, as the upgrade from version 2 to 3 involves significant changes in initialization and configuration syntax. Let's proceed with the following API calls to gain the necessary insights:\n\n1. Search for any class named `MathJax` which might encapsulate the integration configuration or usage within the Sphinx project:\n   ```\n   search_class(\"MathJax\")\n   ```\n\n2. Given that Sphinx extensions have a structured way of organizing code, there's likely a specific file that handles the MathJax extension. We'll start by looking for a file named something like `mathjax.py` or similar, and inspect classes or methods there. The MathJax configuration could be defined in a class constructor or a setup method within that file:\n   ```\n   search_code(\"MathJax\")\n   ```\n\n3. Since the issue mentions an \"extension,\" we should also look for any Sphinx extension initialization code snippet that mentions MathJax, which might give us the registration or setup point in the Sphinx lifecycle. A common pattern in Sphinx is to use `add_js_file` or similar methods for adding external JavaScript resources. This might have changed for MathJax 3.0, so identifying this is crucial:\n   ```\n   search_code(\"add_js_file\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches are aimed at gathering enough information to understand where and how MathJax is configured and initialized in the current Sphinx project setup, which will inform the necessary changes to upgrade to MathJax 3.0."

Let\u2019s evaluate the search results one by one:\n\n1. **Search for a class named `MathJax`**:\n   - The search did not find a class named `MathJax`. This suggests that the integration does not reside within a dedicated class named after MathJax but is likely handled more procedurally or configured within other components of the system.\n\n2. **Search for code snippets containing `MathJax`**:\n   - Found in `sphinx/cmd/quickstart.py` and `sphinx/ext/mathjax.py`.\n   - **sphinx/cmd/quickstart.py**: This file likely deals with sphinx project setup or initialization procedures. The mention of MathJax here could be related to setting default configurations or enabling the MathJax extension during the initial project setup.\n   - **sphinx/ext/mathjax.py**: This file is presumably the core of the MathJax integration with Sphinx. It likely includes configuration, setup routines, and possibly templating logic for outputting the necessary MathJax scripts onto generated pages.\n   - Considering the issue at hand\u2014upgrading to MathJax 3.0\u2014the modifications will most likely need to occur within `sphinx/ext/mathjax.py`, focusing on adapting the current integration to the new initialization and configuration requirements of MathJax 3.0.\n\n3. **Search for code snippets containing `add_js_file`**:\n   - Found in multiple files, notably `sphinx/application.py`, `sphinx/registry.py`, `sphinx/ext/mathjax.py`, and `sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py`.\n   - This method is used for adding JavaScript files to the Sphinx documentation pages. The specific appearances within `sphinx/ext/mathjax.py` indicate that this method is instrumental in including MathJax-related JavaScript files into the generated documentation.\n   - The relation to the issue is clear: the upgrade to MathJax 3.0 will likely involve changes in how JavaScript files are added to the documentation, especially since MathJax 3.0 has a new modular structure and possibly different file requirements than its predecessor.\n\n**Next Steps Based on Analysis**:\nGiven the relevance of `sphinx/ext/mathjax.py` to the issue, it would be insightful to look more closely at the configuration and initialization logic within this file to understand how MathJax is currently integrated. Similarly, examining the usage of `add_js_file` within this file will be crucial since it directly relates to how MathJax scripts are included in the output, which we know has changed in MathJax 3.0.\n\nTo progress towards resolving the issue, the next logical steps would include:\n\n- Delving deeper into `sphinx/ext/mathjax.py` to review the current MathJax setup, and\n- Analyzing how `add_js_file` is used within `sphinx/ext/mathjax.py`.\n\nThe intention is to adapt these areas to accommodate the new requirements and structure of MathJax 3.0, ensuring compatibility and leveraging the performance improvements mentioned in the issue."

The intended behavior involves updating any initialization and configuration scripts to be compatible with MathJax 3.0, as per the new setup and modular structure described in [MathJax's upgrade documentation](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/v2.html#upgrading-from-v2-to-v3). This includes changing how MathJax scripts are included in the generated pages, ensuring any configuration passed to MathJax is done so according to the new format, and if MathJax 3.0 introduces new features or deprecates old ones, adjusting the Sphinx extension to reflect these changes. The primary goal is to maintain existing functionality for Sphinx users while integrating the improvements MathJax 3.0 offers, such as increased load speed and modularity.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: \n  - File: `sphinx/ext/mathjax.py` (specifically related to the use of `add_js_file`)\n  - The usage of `add_js_file` within this file to include MathJax scripts in the generated documentation will need to be revisited. The intended behavior post-upgrade should ensure that MathJax 3.0's JavaScript files are correctly referenced and loaded in the output, respecting the new file structure and initialization requirements of MathJax 3.0. This may involve dynamically loading certain JavaScript modules based on the documentation's needs or configuring the MathJax script loader to use the new modular loading system.\n\nThe resolution of the issue requires a careful review and update of these code portions to ensure full compatibility with MathJax 3.0, aiming to leverage the performance and usability enhancements it brings, without disrupting the existing functionality provided by the Sphinx MathJax extension."
