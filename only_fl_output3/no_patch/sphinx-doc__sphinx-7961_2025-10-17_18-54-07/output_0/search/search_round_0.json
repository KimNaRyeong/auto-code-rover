It would be great to get this into the Sphinx MathJax extension.\nThe [MathJax upgrading docs](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/v2.html#upgrading-from-v2-to-v3) suggest that it will not be trivial to upgrade, but it may be worth it given the performance and modularity improvements.

        "content": "To tackle the issue of upgrading MathJax to version 3.0 within the Sphinx MathJax extension, we need comprehensive context about the current integration. Particularly, we need to understand how MathJax is initialized and configured, as the upgrade from version 2 to 3 involves significant changes in initialization and configuration syntax. Let's proceed with the following API calls to gain the necessary insights:\n\n1. Search for any class named `MathJax` which might encapsulate the integration configuration or usage within the Sphinx project:\n   ```\n   search_class(\"MathJax\")\n   ```\n\n2. Given that Sphinx extensions have a structured way of organizing code, there's likely a specific file that handles the MathJax extension. We'll start by looking for a file named something like `mathjax.py` or similar, and inspect classes or methods there. The MathJax configuration could be defined in a class constructor or a setup method within that file:\n   ```\n   search_code(\"MathJax\")\n   ```\n\n3. Since the issue mentions an \"extension,\" we should also look for any Sphinx extension initialization code snippet that mentions MathJax, which might give us the registration or setup point in the Sphinx lifecycle. A common pattern in Sphinx is to use `add_js_file` or similar methods for adding external JavaScript resources. This might have changed for MathJax 3.0, so identifying this is crucial:\n   ```\n   search_code(\"add_js_file\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches are aimed at gathering enough information to understand where and how MathJax is configured and initialized in the current Sphinx project setup, which will inform the necessary changes to upgrade to MathJax 3.0."
