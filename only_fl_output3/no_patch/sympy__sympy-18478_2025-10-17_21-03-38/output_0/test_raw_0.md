To create a `reproducer.py` script that accomplishes what you've described, I'll provide you with a template that executes the expressions and checks their outcomes against the expected behavior regarding SymPy's handling of limits/substitutions involving infinity (`oo`). As requested, this script will use the provided function to print a stack trace if an `AssertionError` occurs, indicating the presence of the issue.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_substitutions():
    from sympy import Symbol, cos, exp, oo
    
    x = Symbol('x')

    # Test 1
    result1 = (x + cos(x)).subs(x, oo)
    # Expected: oo
    try:
        assert result1 == oo, f"Expected oo, got {result1}"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise
    
    # Test 2
    result2 = (exp(x) + cos(x)).subs(x, oo)
    # Expected: Should not be AccumBounds ideally for consistency but currently it might be.
    try:
        # This is tricky because we're asserting based on what might be considered inconsistent behavior.
        # For now, asserting it doesn't equal oo to demonstrate the difference/error. In a fixed state, change as needed.
        assert result2 != oo, f"Expected not oo (due to current behavior), got {result2}"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

def main():
    try:
        test_substitutions()
    except AssertionError:
        exit(1)  # Exit with non-zero to indicate failure/reproduction of the issue
    else:
        print("All tests passed successfully!")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script reproduces the behavior as described: evaluating expressions `(x+cos(x)).subs(x,oo)` and `(exp(x)+cos(x)).subs(x,oo)` under the assumption that the former incorrectly evaluates to `oo`, and the latter deviates from this by potentially producing `AccumBounds`, signaling an inconsistent handling within SymPy. The assertion logic, especially for the second test, is premised on illustrating the issue at hand and would require adjustment if SymPy's behavior changes or to more accurately reflect expectations regarding the handling of infinity in such expressions.
