Specifically, it should ensure that `exp(oo)` evaluates to infinity and correctly handle cases like `cos(oo)` by potentially returning an indeterminate form or `AccumBounds` to reflect mathematical accuracy. This ensures that the behavior of `.subs(x, oo)` remains consistent across different types of expressions, preserving the expected mathematical properties when dealing with infinity."

        "intended_behavior": "This method, likely called by `subs` for handling specific substitution cases, should include logic or checks to accurately reflect the behavior of functions at infinity. If a function's limit at infinity behaves in a specific way (diverges or becomes indeterminate), `_eval_subs` should account for this, either by simplifying the expression in a manner consistent with mathematical principles or by returning results that reflect the indeterminate nature (e.g., using `AccumBounds` for `cos(oo)`). This ensures that substitution involving infinity is treated with the nuance required by different mathematical functions."
