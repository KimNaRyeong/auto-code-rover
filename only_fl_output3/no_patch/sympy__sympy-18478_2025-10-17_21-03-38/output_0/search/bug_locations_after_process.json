Specifically, it should ensure that `exp(oo)` evaluates to infinity and correctly handle cases like `cos(oo)` by potentially returning an indeterminate form or `AccumBounds` to reflect mathematical accuracy. This ensures that the behavior of `.subs(x, oo)` remains consistent across different types of expressions, preserving the expected mathematical properties when dealing with infinity."
