To better align with your request for a script that accurately reproduces the issue and handles its detection through assertions—raising an `AssertionError` when the inconsistency you've described is observed—let's craft a more targeted approach in our `reproducer.py`. This script will focus on evaluating the expressions `(x + cos(x)).subs(x, oo)` and `(exp(x) + cos(x)).subs(x, oo)`, comparing their outputs to expected behaviors based on Sympy's documentation and typical mathematical interpretation of such limits.

```python
import sys
from sympy import Symbol, cos, exp, oo

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    x = Symbol('x')

    # Evaluation of expressions with x substituted by infinity (oo)
    result1 = (x + cos(x)).subs(x, oo)
    result2 = (exp(x) + cos(x)).subs(x, oo)

    try:
        # Asserting that the substitution results match expected outcomes
        assert result1 == oo, f"Expected (x + cos(x)).subs(x, oo) to be oo, but got {result1}"
        assert result2.has(oo), f"Expected (exp(x) + cos(x)).subs(x, oo) to contain oo, but got {result2}"

        # If the code reaches this point, the issue is considered fixed or not present
        print("All tests passed successfully!")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating success/no issue

    except AssertionError as e:
        # Printing stack trace for debugging purposes
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Indicating that the reproduction of the issue was successful
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 indicating failure/issue reproduced

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script specifically targets the discrepancy you mentioned: the first expression should theoretically yield infinity (`oo`), recognizing that the cosine of infinity is not determinate but considering `x` going to infinity overwhelms that indeterminacy, resulting in infinity. The second case, combining an exponential term expected to dominate and lead to infinity with the cosine term, should logically also result in infinity or an expression containing infinity in its evaluation. Here, an assertion is directly testing these conditions.

It raises an `AssertionError` if the outcomes do not match these expectations, signifying the presence of the issue. The script exits with code 0 only if the issue is not observed, aligning with your requirements for handling the reproduction and reporting of this problem.
