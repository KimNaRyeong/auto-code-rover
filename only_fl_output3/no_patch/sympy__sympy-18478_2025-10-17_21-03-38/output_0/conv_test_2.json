        "content": "Based on your feedback, let's adjust the approach with further clarification of how this script should handle the issue. If the earlier script didn't reproduce the issue due to incorrect assertions or expectations, we need to refine how we test these substitutions.\n\nSince the issue is about the inconsistency between the results of substitutions involving `oo` (infinity) with arithmetic operations mixed with trigonometric and exponential functions, the script should carefully check these conditions to ensure they align with expected behaviors or confirmed bugs.\n\nI'll rewrite the script focusing on this aspect\u2014particularly highlighting when behavior doesn't match expected mathematical properties or documented SymPy behaviors. The misunderstanding seems to revolve around the expected result of substituting `oo` into these expressions, so let's explicitly check for what we would normally expect based on mathematical principles, acknowledging that these might highlight a consistency issue or a misunderstanding of the API.\n\n```python\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef test_substitutions():\n    from sympy import Symbol, cos, exp, oo, AccumBounds\n    \n    x = Symbol('x')\n\n    # Test 1: Checking substitution of infinity in an expression with a trigonometric function\n    result1 = (x + cos(x)).subs(x, oo)\n    try:\n        # Expect this to be oo since cos(x) is bounded and shouldn't affect the limit\n        assert result1 == oo, f\"Incorrect evaluation: Expected oo, got {result1}\"\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise\n    \n    # Test 2: Checking substitution of infinity in an expression with an exponential component\n    result2 = (exp(x) + cos(x)).subs(x, oo)\n    try:\n        # Here we're checking for a specific type of result (maybe AccumBounds or oo) acknowledging the problematic output\n        assert result2 != AccumBounds(-oo, oo), f\"Unexpected evaluation: Expected not AccumBounds, got {result2}\"\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        test_substitutions()\n    except AssertionError:\n        print(\"Test failed: Issue reproduced\")\n        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate failure/reproduction of the issue\n    else:\n        print(\"All tests passed successfully!\")\n        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate no issue was found\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis version attempts to clarify expectations regarding the substitution results and adjusts the assertion in test 2 to reflect a more nuanced understanding of what might be considered inconsistent or unexpected behavior. It's essential to note that interpretations of mathematical infinity and its handling in symbolic computation software like SymPy can be complex and not always intuitive, which could contribute to discrepancies in expected vs. actual behavior."
