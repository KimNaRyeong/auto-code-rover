        "intended_behavior": "The `switch_backend` function is key in handling the transition between different backends. To resolve the issue, an enhancement allowing for a softer transition specifically when moving from a GUI backend to an inline backend (and vice versa) could be integrated. This enhancement should preserve the capability to close figures when necessary (to avoid resource leaks or conflicts) but provide a mechanism or flag to keep GUI windows open if desired by the user. For instance, adding a parameter to `switch_backend` like `close_gui_figures=True` by default, which if set to `False`, would skip closing figures opened in GUI backends. This way, the existing functionality is preserved, and the user is given control over the behavior during backend switches within a Jupyter Notebook environment."

        "intended_behavior": "The documentation and behavior of `ioff` and `ion` (toggle interactive mode off and on) should explicitly address or manage the impact of these calls on GUI windows, especially in concert with backend switches. Although not directly buggy, enhancing the documentation and possibly the behavior of these methods to support a scenario like the mentioned bug could improve user experience. This could include checking the current backend and adjusting the behavior or providing warnings when an action (like toggling interactive mode or switching backends) might unexpectedly close or preserve GUI windows depending on the target backend."
