This script tries to encapsulate the desired behavior in a standalone Python file. It utilizes the `contextmanager` to attempt switching back and forth between the Qt5Agg backend and the original backend (which could be `inline` if run in an IPython environment or any other backend). 

The script checks for the presence of figure windows after exiting the `window` context, assuming that if the issue persists (i.e., Qt5Agg figures are prematurely closed when switching back to `inline`), no figures will be found, and an `AssertionError` will be raised. Otherwise, it indicates the issue has been fixed.

This reproducer script, however, may not fully capture the interactive elements or the specifics of a Jupyter notebook environment, but it attempts to recreate the issue in a simplified form suitable for a basic Python interpreter environment.
