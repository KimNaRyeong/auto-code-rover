This makes it very difficult to switch cleanly between backends within a notebook. The two mediocre workarounds I can see are:\r\n - always specify the backend before plotting (since you can't automatically \"switch back\")\r\n - use `plt.show(block=True)` and switch back to `inline` after the user is done with the GUI figure. This has the downside of locking the Notebook execution while the figure is live.\r\n\r\n**Code for reproduction**\r\n\r\nThe linked gist shows what I'd like to accomplish which is a context manager that enables matplotlib plotting in a GUI window from within a Notebook that is otherwise using the `inline` backend. Basically I want the notebook to use inline (for a variety of reasons), but I occasionally wish I could interact with the data in a separate figure. \r\nhttps://gist.github.com/flutefreak7/65d824358122360911e2d4c43085007a\r\n\r\nAs a side note, easy switching between `inline` and `notebook`/`widget` backends would also scratch part of this itch, but the interactive notebook backends still don't enable full screen usage or easily throwing a plot on another monitor. `ipyvolume` has full screen figured out, so that seems doable.\r\n\r\nHere's the context manager I wish worked:\r\n```python\r\n# Paste your code here\r\n@contextmanager\r\ndef window(block=False):\r\n    %matplotlib qt5\r\n    plt.ioff()\r\n    yield\r\n    plt.show()\r\n    # The switch back to inline closes the qt5 plot\r\n    plt.ion()\r\n    %matplotlib inline\r\n\r\nwith window():\r\n    plt.plot([1, 3, 2])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Actual outcome**\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the above code is that a plot window flashes into existence for a split second, then is closed when the `%matplotlib inline` call is processed.\r\n\r\n**Expected outcome**\r\n\r\nIt would be great if plots created with the qt5 backend could stay visible while other plots with the inline backend were also being created.  If use `%gui qt` (to establish a reliable event loop) and create a bunch of Qt windows by other means, they live concurrently with the Notebook as long as the kernel is alive. I'd like matplotlib GUI figures to be able to live on regardless of the current backend.\r\n\r\n**Matplotlib version**\r\n<!--Please specify your platform and versions of the relevant libraries you are using:-->\r\n  * Operating system:\r\n  * Matplotlib version: 3.1.1\r\n  * Matplotlib backend (`print(matplotlib.get_backend())`): `inline` and `qt5agg`\r\n  * Python version: 3.7.3\r\n  * Jupyter version (if applicable):\r\n```\r\njupyter                           1.0.0\r\njupyter-client                    5.3.4\r\njupyter-console                   6.0.0\r\njupyter-contrib-core              0.3.3\r\njupyter-contrib-nbextensions      0.5.1\r\njupyter-core                      4.6.0\r\njupyter-highlight-selected-word   0.2.0\r\njupyter-latex-envs                1.4.6\r\njupyter-nbextensions-configurator 0.4.1\r\njupyterlab                        1.0.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--Please tell us how you installed matplotlib and python e.g., from source, pip, conda-->\r\n<!--If you installed from conda, please specify which channel you used if not the default-->\r\n\r\n\n"

        "content": "Given the previous feedback, it seems the issue couldn't be reproduced due to environment constraints, notably running in a headless mode, which is common in continuous integration environments, cloud services, or when graphical interfaces are not available. This suggests that an environment capable of supporting Qt5 backend must be available for the issue to be reproduced correctly.\n\nConsidering the requirement to run on environments where a graphical backend may not be initially available, it's crucial to adapt the reproducer considering these limitations. However, without an active GUI session (like an active desktop environment), testing GUI functionalities of Matplotlib backends directly is inherently challenging and may not be feasible.\n\nStill, I'll provide a revised version of the reproducer with the intention to avoid backend incompatibilities. It's worth noting, though, that to genuinely capture and reproduce GUI-related issues, running the script in an environment with a display available (like a local machine with a graphical desktop environment) is essential. For genuine GUI-based testing, consider manual testing or using virtual frame buffers like `xvfb` in headless environments.\n\nThe modified script here will try to switch backends and will handle exceptions more gracefully. It might not directly reproduce the graphical window's closing issue but will check for backend compatibility issues:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Utility function for printing stack trace\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\n# Trying to switch backends with exception handling\ntry:\n    # Initial check to verify backend compatibility\n    original_backend = plt.get_backend()\n    plt.switch_backend('Qt5Agg')\n    plt.switch_backend(original_backend)  # Switch back to original_backend\n    \n    # Display success if no exceptions were raised\n    print(\"Backend switching was successful, no immediate issues detected.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print_stacktrace(e)\n```\n\nThis script incorporates feedback to better handle backend switching and provides feedback on compatibility issues through exception handling. Before attempting to run it, make sure your environment has the necessary GUI capabilities or graphical backend support for a more accurate reproduction of the issue. Running in headless environments will inherently have limitations on testing graphical output generically."
