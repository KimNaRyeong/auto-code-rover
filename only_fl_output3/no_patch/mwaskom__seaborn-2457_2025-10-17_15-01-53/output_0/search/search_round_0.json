Identify where the `lineplot` function is defined or handled within the codebase. This entails finding the file and class, if applicable, where `lineplot` is implemented.\n2. Investigate how the `ci` parameter is currently being processed in the `lineplot` function to understand why it's ignoring `ci=None`.\n3. Understand the error handling or warning mechanism in place to implement the required warning when `ci=None` is encountered.\n\nLet's start by finding the implementation or handling of the `lineplot` function and explore the handling of the `ci` parameter:\n\n- `search_method(\"lineplot\")`: This will help us locate where the `lineplot` function is defined or used.\n- `search_code(\"ci=None\")`: To find occurrences where `ci=None` is handled or mentioned, providing insight into the current handling logic."
