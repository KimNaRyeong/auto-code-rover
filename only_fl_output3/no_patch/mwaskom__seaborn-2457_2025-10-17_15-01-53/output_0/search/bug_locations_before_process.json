        "intended_behavior": "Inside the `lineplot` method, when `ci=None` is passed as an argument, it should issue a user warning indicating that the use of `ci` is deprecated and that `errorbar=None` should be used instead to explicitly remove error bars. This behavior preserves the functionality of disabling error bars while transitioning users to the new parameter. Implement or ensure that the `_deprecate_ci` function (referred in line 618) not only handles the parameter transformation but also emits a clear deprecation warning when `ci=None`. This warning should guide the user on how to use `errorbar=None` directly for future calls. Ensure that after the deprecation warning, the internal logic transforms or interprets `ci=None` to mean `errorbar=None` effectively removing error bars from the plot. This transformation needs to be handled in a way that does not disrupt existing functionality for users who haven't switched to the new parameter system."
