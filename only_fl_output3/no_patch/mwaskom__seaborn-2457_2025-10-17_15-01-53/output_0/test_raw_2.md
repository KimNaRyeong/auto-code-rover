Given the context of the previous script failing due to a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `matplotlib`, it seems there was a misunderstanding about the requirements for running the code, particularly concerning environment setup with necessary dependencies. For the sake of clarity, and to ensure the environment has the required packages, I will include a more precise version of the `reproducer.py` script with additional comments on ensuring the environment is correctly set up before running the script.

However, it's important to note that the script itself cannot resolve module dependencies. The correct execution of this script presumes an environment where necessary packages (`seaborn` and `matplotlib`, which is a seaborn dependency) are already installed.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    try:
        # Ensure seaborn is available in the environment
        import seaborn as sns
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        # Execute the lineplot code that should cause the issue
        sns.lineplot(x=[1, 1, 2, 2], y=[1, 2, 3, 4], ci=None)
        plt.close('all')  # Prevent the plot from rendering in script mode
        
        # If the script reaches this line without a warning, the failure to handle ci=None is confirmed
        raise AssertionError("Seaborn did not handle 'ci=None' as expected.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        # AssertionError is expected if the issue is being reproduced correctly
        print("AssertionError caught: ", e)
        # If the AssertionError was raised, we do not want to print further stacktrace and consider the behavior as issue present
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        # Any other exception is unexpected; print its stacktrace
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

**Environment Setup:**
To run this script successfully, ensure you have an environment with `seaborn` and `matplotlib` installed. This can typically be achieved via pip:

```
pip install seaborn matplotlib
```

Alternatively, if you use `conda`, you might prefer:

```
conda install seaborn matplotlib
```

Use one of the above commands according to your environment setup preference to ensure the required packages are installed before running the `reproducer.py` script.
