        "intended_behavior": "The `translate_url` method is responsible for translating a URL into a specified language if a translated version exists. To resolve the issue related to incorrect URL creation when optional named groups are missing:\n- This method should be enhanced to more gracefully handle URL patterns with optional parameters. Specifically, when reversing URLs (`reverse` call in line 175), it should check whether all required parameters for the target URL are provided or if any optional parameters can be omitted without compromising the URL construction.\n- During the URL reversal process, if an optional parameter is missing, instead of failing or producing incorrect URLs, `translate_url` should proceed with the reversal using the available parameters, accounting for the fact that some parameters (now identified as optional) may not be necessary for a successful URL reversal.\n- Preserve the functionality that returns the original URL if no translated version is found or if the URL reversal process fails due to missing required parameters.\n- Care should be taken to ensure that these modifications do not affect the handling of URLs that do not use optional parameters, maintaining the existing functionality and performance for those cases."
