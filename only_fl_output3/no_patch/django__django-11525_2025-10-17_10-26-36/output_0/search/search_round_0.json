This issue just arose on a project I've been working on, and it goes as follows:\nOur MANAGERS setting was set like so:\nMANAGERS = ['one@example.com', 'two@example.com']\nAnd after calling mail_managers, the result was:\nsmtplib.SMTPRecipientsRefused: {'=?utf-8?q?h?=': (550, b'5.1.1 <=?utf-8?q?h?=>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table'), '=?utf-8?q?u?=': (550, b'5.1.1 <=?utf-8?q?u?=>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table')}\nAfter some investigation it became clear that this setting was in the improper format, but that was only because of \u200bthis StackOverflow post. It would be nice if Django failed early if this setting was detected but improperly set, rather than waiting until the consequences become apparent.\nThank you,\nKevin\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue described, we need to understand the implementation details of `mail_admins()` and `mail_managers()` functions, including how they interact with the `MANAGERS` setting. It's crucial to identify where the current behavior allows improperly formatted `MANAGERS` settings to pass through, and how we could introduce validation steps to raise exceptions early. We will use API calls to explore the relevant parts of the codebase:\n\n1. Search for the `mail_admins` method to understand its current implementation and see if there's an apparent point where the validation can be added.\n2. Search for the `mail_managers` method for the same reasons as above.\n3. Search for the code snippet `MANAGERS =` to find references in the documentation or code comments that specify the expected format. This might give us insight into where the format is assumed or parsed.\n4. Search for the usage of the `MANAGERS` setting, which might not be directly in the `mail_admins()` or `mail_managers()` methods but could affect how these methods interpret the setting.\n\nLet's make the API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"mail_admins\")`\n- `search_method(\"mail_managers\")`\n- `search_code(\"MANAGERS =\")`"
