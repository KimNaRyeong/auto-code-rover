This issue just arose on a project I've been working on, and it goes as follows:\nOur MANAGERS setting was set like so:\nMANAGERS = ['one@example.com', 'two@example.com']\nAnd after calling mail_managers, the result was:\nsmtplib.SMTPRecipientsRefused: {'=?utf-8?q?h?=': (550, b'5.1.1 <=?utf-8?q?h?=>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table'), '=?utf-8?q?u?=': (550, b'5.1.1 <=?utf-8?q?u?=>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table')}\nAfter some investigation it became clear that this setting was in the improper format, but that was only because of \u200bthis StackOverflow post. It would be nice if Django failed early if this setting was detected but improperly set, rather than waiting until the consequences become apparent.\nThank you,\nKevin\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### `mail_admins` and `mail_managers` Method Implementation\n\nThe collected context shows the implementation of both `mail_admins` and `mail_managers` functions located in `django/core/mail/__init__.py`. These functions are intended to send emails to the admins and managers, respectively, as defined by the `ADMINS` and `MANAGERS` settings in Django. Noticeably, the format for `ADMINS` and `MANAGERS` expected by these methods is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the name and email address. However, the issue submitted indicates the use of a simple list of email addresses, which is incompatible with the expected format. This discrepancy leads to runtime errors when attempting to send emails, as the SMTP server cannot parse the improperly formatted recipient addresses.\n\n1. **`mail_admins` and `mail_managers` Functionality**: These methods compile an email message using Django\u2019s email handling features, particularly the `EmailMultiAlternatives` class, and send it to the admins or managers. They retrieve email addresses from the `ADMINS` or `MANAGERS` setting, attaching an HTML alternative if provided.\n\n2. **Relationship to the Bug**: The bug occurs because there's no early validation to ensure `ADMINS` and `MANAGERS` settings are in the correct format. The code implicitly assumes the settings are correctly formatted (a list of tuples), and proceeds to iterate over them to extract email addresses. This leads to exceptions at runtime when the email backend cannot find valid recipient addresses, as seen in the error message shared in the bug report.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: Ideally, to prevent the bug, both `mail_admins` and `mail_managers` functions (or a procedure they both depend upon) should validate the format of the `ADMINS` and `MANAGERS` settings before attempting to send an email. If the settings do not match the expected format, a more descriptive error or warning should be raised early, informing the developer of the misconfiguration, rather than allowing the operation to fail at the SMTP level with a generic and confusing error message.\n\n#### `MANAGERS = ADMINS` Snippet in `django/conf/global_settings.py`\n\nThis code snippet indicates that, by default, the `MANAGERS` setting is equal to the `ADMINS` setting. This implies that any validation or adjustments made to how the `ADMINS` setting is processed or validated would likely affect `MANAGERS` as well, given that they are intended to be structured similarly.\n\n1. **Global Settings Relation to Issue**: This snippet backs up the assertion that `MANAGERS` and `ADMINS` are structurally intended to be the same. It doesn't immediately contribute to solving the issue but emphasizes the need for consistent validation logic that applies to both settings.\n\n### Moving Forward\n\nGiven this context, the next steps would involve drafting a validation function or logic that can precede email dispatch processes in both `mail_admins` and `mail_managers` functions. This validation should:\n\n- Check whether the `ADMINS` and `MANAGERS` settings are in the expected list-of-tuples format.\n- Raise a descriptive exception if the settings are not correctly formatted, ideally before any attempt is made to send an email.\n\nCreating this patch would involve modifying the existing functions to include a validation step or incorporating this validation into the Django setting loading mechanism, ensuring that any issues are caught early in the development process or upon deployment configuration, rather than at runtime during email dispatch."

If the format is incorrect, raise a meaningful `ImproperlyConfigured` exception to clearly indicate the misconfiguration. Preserve the existing functionality of sending an email to all defined admins if the setting is properly configured.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/core/mail/__init__.py`\n  - **Method:** `mail_managers`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Implement similar validation for the `MANAGERS` setting as described for `mail_admins`. Before attempting to send an email, check that `MANAGERS` is a list of tuples with the correct structure. If not, raise an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception. Continue with emailing managers if the setting is correct, maintaining the original email sending functionality.\n\nThese changes will ensure that misconfigurations in both `ADMINS` and `MANAGERS` are caught early, providing developers with clear guidance on how to correct their settings and thus preventing runtime errors during mail dispatching."
