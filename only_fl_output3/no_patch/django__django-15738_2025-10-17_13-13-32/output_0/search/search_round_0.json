After that change the field from foreign key to many to many field, then do a makemigrations and then migrate.\nBut in this way I have 2 migrations instead of one.\nI added attachment with this project, download it and then do makemigrations and then migrate to see this error.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the migration issue effectively, we need to gather information on the specific models affected, their relationships, and how they are currently set up in the codebase. The models in question are `Authors`, `DataSet`, `Project`, and `ProjectDataSet`. The main issue revolves around changing a ForeignKey to a ManyToMany field and dealing with the `unique_together` constraint. \n\nBased on the information provided in the issue description, I will perform the following API searches to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the Authors class**: We'll look into how the `Authors` model is defined to better understand its current state and relationships.\n    - `search_class(\"Authors\")`\n\n2. **Search for the DataSet class**: This will provide insight into how `DataSet` objects are related to other models.\n    - `search_class(\"DataSet\")`\n\n3. **Search for the Project class**: As the `Project` class contains a ManyToMany field related to `DataSet` through `ProjectDataSet`, it's important to see its current setup.\n    - `search_class(\"Project\")`\n\n4. **Search for the ProjectDataSet class**: Since this model acts as a through model for the ManyToMany relationship, it's critical to review its structure and constraints.\n    - `search_class(\"ProjectDataSet\")`\n\n5. **Search for the method managing migrations**: This is to understand how migrations are being handled in relation to the issue, specifically if there's any custom migration logic.\n    - `search_method(\"makemigrations\")`\n    - `search_method(\"migrate\")`\n\nGiven the complexity of the issue, especially around migrating a ForeignKey to a ManyToManyField and handling the `unique_together` constraints properly, these searches aim to provide a comprehensive view of the models and migration methods involved."
