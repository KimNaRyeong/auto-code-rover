        "content": "Here is an issue:\n\nhandle Decimal in json encoder\nThe `simplejson` removal (#3555) decreased the flask encoding capabilities as the built-in `json` doesn't cover cases like `Decimal` types. The solution seems to be: overwrite the flask app encoder with `JSONEnconder` from `simplejson`, but this incorporates a problem for users that relies on both `Decimal` and `datetimes` as `simplejon` doesn't handle `datetimes`, while flask encoder does. The solution I found is to build a custom encoder that tests if the value is `Decimal` and gives it to `simplejson`, otherwise, handles it with the default flask app encoder. My suggestion is to incorporate a simple test in the flask encoder to add `Decimal` coverage, that would remove any residual dependency on `simplejson`. The str(decimal) was taken from: [simplejson/encoder.py#L511](https://github.com/simplejson/simplejson/blob/8bef979ad8272cbc2903970f4b9992f603d50973/simplejson/encoder.py#L511)  \r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom flask import json as fjson\r\nfrom flask.json import JSONEncoder\r\nimport simplejson as sjson\r\nimport decimal\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\nrdatetime = datetime.strptime('1/1/2008 1:30 PM', '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M %p')\r\nrdecimal = decimal.Decimal(10)\r\n\r\nobj = {'datetime':rdatetime,'decimal':rdecimal}\r\n\r\nfjson.dumps(obj) #Doesn't work because of decimal\r\nsjson.dumps(obj) #Doesn't work because of datetimes\r\n```  \r\nThe custom encoder:  \r\n```python\r\nclass CustomJSONEncoder(JSONEncoder):\r\n    '''\r\n    Add Decimal coverage\r\n    '''\r\n    def default(self, o):\r\n        if isinstance(o, decimal.Decimal):\r\n            return str(o)\r\n        return super().default(o)\r\n\r\napp.json_encoder = CustomJSONEncoder\r\n```  \r\n\r\nThe expected behavior is to work with both `Decimal` and `datetimes`  as it used to work on Flask version 1.1.2\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\n\r\n- Python version: 3.8.10\r\n- Flask version: 2.0.1 and 1.1.2\r\n- Simplejson(Optional) version: 3.17.2\r\n\n"

It will also check for the success case after introducing a custom encoder, aiming to exit with code 0 only if the issue is resolved (meaning it can serialize both types without throwing an error).\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\nimport decimal\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\nclass CustomJSONEncoder(Flask.json_encoder):\n    def default(self, obj):\n        if isinstance(obj, decimal.Decimal):\n            return str(obj)\n        return super().default(obj)\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['TESTING'] = True\napp.json_encoder = CustomJSONEncoder\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    rdatetime = datetime.strptime('1/1/2008 1:30 PM', '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M %p')\n    rdecimal = decimal.Decimal('10.1')\n    try:\n        response = jsonify(datetime=rdatetime, decimal=rdecimal)\n        return response\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    with app.test_client() as client:\n        response = client.get(\"/\")\n        try:\n            # This will confirm if the response can be successfully returned without error\n            assert response.status_code == 200, \"Issue with handling Decimal or DateTime\"\n            # It must also confirm that the Decimal has been converted as expected\n            # For a more thorough test, you'd compare the actual response content, but that requires parsing the JSON and handling potential errors\n            print(\"Test passed: Custom encoder handles Decimal and DateTime types correctly.\")\n            exit(0) # Exit with code 0 to indicate the test was successful\n        except AssertionError as e:\n            print_stacktrace(e)\n            exit(1) # Exit with code 1 to indicate failure to handle the issue\n```\n\nThis script does the following:\n\n1. Creates a Flask application with a custom JSON encoder capable of handling `decimal.Decimal` by converting it to a string.\n2. Defines a single route that returns a JSON response containing both `datetime` and `decimal.Decimal` objects to test serialization.\n3. Uses Flask's test client to make a request to that route, checking if the response is successfully returned with a status code 200 without raising exceptions.\n4. Assertions are used to directly validate conditions, with exceptions being properly handled to output tracebacks for debugging purposes.\n5. The script attempts to exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed (i.e., it can serialize both `datetime` and `Decimal` objects without errors) or with code 1 if the issue is present.\n\nThis approach ensures clarity on whether the issue is reproduced based on the presence of an `AssertionError` and enables detailed error output through the `print_stacktrace` function, facilitating debugging of the serialization process in Flask."
