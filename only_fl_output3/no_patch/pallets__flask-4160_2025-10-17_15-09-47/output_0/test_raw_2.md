To create a script that would accurately reproduce the issue described and abide by the given structure, including the stack trace printing function for clearer error tracing, follow this enhanced version. This example will try to serialize `datetime` and `Decimal` objects using both the Flask default and custom JSON encoders to replicate and verify the problem, then print the stack trace if serialization fails.

```python
# reproducer.py
import json
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import decimal
from datetime import datetime

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class CustomJSONEncoder(json.JSONEncoder):
    def default(self, o):
        if isinstance(o, decimal.Decimal):
            return str(o)
        return super().default(o)

def main():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.json_encoder = CustomJSONEncoder  # Override the default encoder

    rdatetime = datetime.strptime('1/1/2008 1:30 PM', '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M %p')
    rdecimal = decimal.Decimal('10.1')
    obj = {'datetime': rdatetime, 'decimal': rdecimal}

    # Try serializing with the default Flask JSON encoder
    try:
        jsonify(obj)
        # The issue was not reproduced using Flask's jsonify,
        # but let's see if it happens when directly using Flask's overridden encoder.
        json.dumps(obj, cls=app.json_encoder)
        print('The issue has been fixed.')
        exit(0)
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print('\nAttempting with custom JSON encoder directly...')
        # Directly using custom encoder to demonstrate it can handle the issue
        try:
            print(json.dumps(obj, cls=CustomJSONEncoder))
            print('Custom JSON encoder can handle the issue as expected.')
            exit(1)  # Exit code 1 to show the issue was present but handled by custom logic.
        except Exception as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note, before executing the script, ensure that Flask is installed in your Python environment, as the error message you received previously indicates it was not found. This script does the following:

1. Attempts to serialize a dictionary containing both a `datetime` object and a `decimal.Decimal` object using Flask's `jsonify` method, which would, by default, use Flask's JSON encoder.
2. If serialization fails due to Flask's inability to natively handle `decimal.Decimal`, the script catches this `TypeError` and prints the stack trace.
3. After catching the first error, it tries to serialize the same object using a custom JSON encoder defined in the script (`CustomJSONEncoder`) that can handle `decimal.Decimal` by converting it to a string. If this succeeds, it demonstrates how the custom encoder can be a workaround for the problem.
4. The script exits with code 0 if no error is encountered when using Flask's overridden JSON encoder, signaling the issue is fixed. Otherwise, it exits with code 1 after demonstrating that the custom encoder can handle the serialization, indicating the issue is present but can be mitigated with custom logic.
