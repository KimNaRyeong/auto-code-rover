        "content": "The results provide a broad overview of where deletion-related logic and signal handling reside within the codebase. Let's analyze the key findings against the issue description and questions to determine our next steps.\n\n### Analysis of `delete` Method Results\n- **Files of Interest**: The references in `django/db/models/deletion.py`, `django/db/models/base.py`, and `django/db/models/query.py` appear most relevant to the issue. These files likely contain core deletion logic for individual model instances and querysets.\n  - **Intended Behavior**: These files should include mechanisms that trigger deletion operations. The issue suggests enhancing these operations so that they include context regarding the origin of the deletion call\u2014whether from an individual model instance or a queryset.\n\n### Analysis of `pre_delete` and `post_delete` Signal Results\n- **Files of Interest**: The signals seem to be defined or used primarily in `django/db/models/deletion.py` and `django/db/models/signals.py`. Signals are Django's way of allowing decoupled applications to get notified when certain actions occur. \n  - **Intended Behavior**: According to the issue, listeners of these signals should be able to discern the deletion's origin. This implies modifications not just in the signal emission process but potentially in signal definition to carry additional context.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\nGiven the direct relevance of the identified files to the deletion process and signal handling, we should dive deeper into:\n1. **Deletion Logic**: It's crucial to understand how these deletions are currently being processed in `django/db/models/deletion.py`, `django/db/models/base.py`, and `django/db/models/query.py`. Specifically, how deletions are handled differently or similarly within model instances vs. querysets.\n2. **Signal Handling**: Signal dispatching and handling mechanisms should be reviewed in `django/db/models/deletion.py` and `django/db/models/signals.py`. We must understand how signals are currently including (or lacking) context about the deletion source.\n\n### Proposed API Calls for Further Context\nTo devise a solution, it's essential to obtain more detailed code context about the implementation of deletion methods and signal dispatching. Therefore, the following API calls are proposed:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"delete\", \"django/db/models/base.py\")`: To examine how individual model deletions are handled.\n- `search_method_in_file(\"delete\", \"django/db/models/query.py\")`: To understand queryset deletions.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"pre_delete.send\", \"django/db/models/deletion.py\")`: Providing insights into how the `pre_delete` signal is being dispatched during the deletion process.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"post_delete.send\", \"django/db/models/deletion.py\")`: Similarly, to observe how `post_delete` signals are dispatched, potentially pinpointing areas for enhancement with additional context."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

This could involve modifying how pre/post delete signals are emitted from this method, including additional information about the deletion source.\n  \n- **Location 2**: File: `django/db/models/query.py`, Class: `QuerySet`, Method: `delete`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Similarly, the `delete` method on the `QuerySet` class needs to be enhanced to provide context about its call\u2014specifically, that the deletion is initiated by a queryset operation. This involves passing additional details when emitting pre/post delete signals, such as indicating the queryset from which the deletion originated, along with the models involved in the queryset.\n  \n- **Location 3**: File: `django/db/models/signals.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Depending on the requirements for conveying the deletion source context (direct model instance deletion or queryset-based deletion), it might be necessary to adjust how `pre_delete` and `post_delete` signals are defined or the data they can carry. This could involve extending the signal framework to allow passing additional data (like a source identifier) to signal receivers, ensuring that listeners can discern the deletion context. This may also necessitate adjustments in signal sender mechanisms to transmit this added information."
