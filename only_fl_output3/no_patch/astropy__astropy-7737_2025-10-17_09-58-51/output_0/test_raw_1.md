Given the feedback, it seems there was a misunderstanding about the actual issue or its reproduction related to the execution environment. If `numpy` and `astropy` are not installed in your environment, or if there was an issue specifically related to these modules not being recognized, that needs to be addressed first. Ensure `numpy` and `astropy` are installed in your Python environment.

Assuming that your environment has `numpy` and `astropy` correctly installed, here's a revised `reproducer.py` script aimed at accurately reproducing the reported issue. This script will explicitly check for the `nan` return value from `biweight_location` when it should ideally return the median value for a constant array.

```python
import numpy as np
from astropy.stats import biweight_location

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    # Using a constant array to trigger the scenario
    constant_array = np.ones(4)
    result = biweight_location(constant_array)
    # Checking if the result is not a number (nan)
    assert not np.isnan(result), "Error: biweight_location returned nan for a constant array"
    # If no assertion error, that means the issue did not occur, thus exiting with 0
    print(f"Success: The test did not reproduce the issue, returned {result} instead of nan.")
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    # Explicitly raising the error to make the script exit with a non-zero exit code if the issue is reproduced
    raise SystemExit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    # Handling unexpected exceptions
    raise SystemExit(1)

```

Be sure to run this script in an environment where `numpy` and `astropy` are already installed to accurately reproduce the issue mentioned. If the modules are missing, you would need to install them using `pip install numpy astropy` before running the script. This script incorporates the feedback and correctly assumes that `numpy` and `astropy` need to be installed for successful execution.
