If `numpy` and `astropy` are not installed in your environment, or if there was an issue specifically related to these modules not being recognized, that needs to be addressed first. Ensure `numpy` and `astropy` are installed in your Python environment.\n\nAssuming that your environment has `numpy` and `astropy` correctly installed, here's a revised `reproducer.py` script aimed at accurately reproducing the reported issue. This script will explicitly check for the `nan` return value from `biweight_location` when it should ideally return the median value for a constant array.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom astropy.stats import biweight_location\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ntry:\n    # Using a constant array to trigger the scenario\n    constant_array = np.ones(4)\n    result = biweight_location(constant_array)\n    # Checking if the result is not a number (nan)\n    assert not np.isnan(result), \"Error: biweight_location returned nan for a constant array\"\n    # If no assertion error, that means the issue did not occur, thus exiting with 0\n    print(f\"Success: The test did not reproduce the issue, returned {result} instead of nan.\")\nexcept AssertionError as e:\n    print_stacktrace(e)\n    # Explicitly raising the error to make the script exit with a non-zero exit code if the issue is reproduced\n    raise SystemExit(1)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print_stacktrace(e)\n    # Handling unexpected exceptions\n    raise SystemExit(1)\n\n```\n\nBe sure to run this script in an environment where `numpy` and `astropy` are already installed to accurately reproduce the issue mentioned. If the modules are missing, you would need to install them using `pip install numpy astropy` before running the script. This script incorporates the feedback and correctly assumes that `numpy` and `astropy` need to be installed for successful execution."
