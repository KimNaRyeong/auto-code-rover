Based on your request, here's a revised version of the standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` incorporating the provided function to print a stack trace more clearly. This script aims to reproduce the issue where `biweight_location` returns `nan` for a constant array, contrary to the expected behavior.

```python
import numpy as np
from astropy.stats import biweight_location

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    result = biweight_location(np.ones(4))
    assert result == 1, f"Expected 1, got {result}"
    print("Test passed: `biweight_location` returned the expected value for a constant array.")
except AssertionError as error:
    print_stacktrace(error)
    raise SystemExit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate failure due to the assertion.
except Exception as error:
    print_stacktrace(error)
    raise SystemExit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate an unexpected error occurred.

# If test passes without exceptions, exit with code 0.
```

This script explicitly checks for the expected behavior of the `biweight_location` function with a constant array input, asserting that the result should be `1` instead of `nan`. In the case of failure (i.e., if the result does not meet expectations), it prints a detailed stack trace of the raised `AssertionError` using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. If any other unexpected exception occurs, it catches and prints a stack trace for that as well before exiting with code 1. If the issue is fixed and the test passes as expected, it will print a success message and exit with code 0.
