This Python script is designed to reproduce the reported issue where the `biweight_location` returns `nan` for an array with zero variance, which should ideally return the median of the array instead. The script first calls the `biweight_location` function from the `astropy.stats` module with a constant array as input. It then asserts that the result should not be `nan`. If the assertion fails, which means the issue is present, it prints a stack traceback for more insights, then exits with code `1` indicating failure. If the issue is fixed and `biweight_location` returns the correct value, the script will print a success message and exit with code `0`.
