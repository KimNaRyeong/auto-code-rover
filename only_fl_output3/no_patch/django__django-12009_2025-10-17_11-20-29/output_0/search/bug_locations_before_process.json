        "intended_behavior": "The method itself is not buggy, but its usage context needs reconsideration due to the redundant scripts launching it. The intended behavior here should not change; instead, the project should ensure only a single, standardized way to invoke this functionality to maintain clarity and reduce redundancy. This would likely necessitate changes outside this method, specifically in how the scripts are installed and packaged (`setup.py` or equivalent), ensuring only one entry point (`/usr/bin/django-admin` preferably, for its more modern approach using `pkg_resources`) is used to maintain existing functionality, per Django's design philosophy and user experience consistency.\n\nGiven that the resolution involves packaging and script installation rather than changes to the Django core functionalities directly, the actionable fix revolves around how Django is installed and made available to end-users. Refining or adjusting the installation process to only include one script for command-line management tasks, while ensuring that any decision respects backward compatibility and clear migration paths for users accustomed to either script, is crucial."
