385 def simplify(expr, ratio=1.7, measure=count_ops, fu=False):
386     """
387     Simplifies the given expression.
388 
389     Simplification is not a well defined term and the exact strategies
390     this function tries can change in the future versions of SymPy. If
391     your algorithm relies on "simplification" (whatever it is), try to
392     determine what you need exactly  -  is it powsimp()?, radsimp()?,
393     together()?, logcombine()?, or something else? And use this particular
394     function directly, because those are well defined and thus your algorithm
395     will be robust.
396 
397     Nonetheless, especially for interactive use, or when you don't know
398     anything about the structure of the expression, simplify() tries to apply
399     intelligent heuristics to make the input expression "simpler".  For
400     example:
401 
402     >>> from sympy import simplify, cos, sin
403     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
404     >>> a = (x + x**2)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)
405     >>> a
406     (x**2 + x)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)
407     >>> simplify(a)
408     x + 1
409 
410     Note that we could have obtained the same result by using specific
411     simplification functions:
412 
413     >>> from sympy import trigsimp, cancel
414     >>> trigsimp(a)
415     (x**2 + x)/x
416     >>> cancel(_)
417     x + 1
418 
419     In some cases, applying :func:`simplify` may actually result in some more
420     complicated expression. The default ``ratio=1.7`` prevents more extreme
421     cases: if (result length)/(input length) > ratio, then input is returned
422     unmodified.  The ``measure`` parameter lets you specify the function used
423     to determine how complex an expression is.  The function should take a
424     single argument as an expression and return a number such that if
425     expression ``a`` is more complex than expression ``b``, then
426     ``measure(a) > measure(b)``.  The default measure function is
427     :func:`count_ops`, which returns the total number of operations in the
428     expression.
429 
430     For example, if ``ratio=1``, ``simplify`` output can't be longer
431     than input.
432 
433     ::
434 
435         >>> from sympy import sqrt, simplify, count_ops, oo
436         >>> root = 1/(sqrt(2)+3)
437 
438     Since ``simplify(root)`` would result in a slightly longer expression,
439     root is returned unchanged instead::
440 
441        >>> simplify(root, ratio=1) == root
442        True
443 
444     If ``ratio=oo``, simplify will be applied anyway::
445 
446         >>> count_ops(simplify(root, ratio=oo)) > count_ops(root)
447         True
448 
449     Note that the shortest expression is not necessary the simplest, so
450     setting ``ratio`` to 1 may not be a good idea.
451     Heuristically, the default value ``ratio=1.7`` seems like a reasonable
452     choice.
453 
454     You can easily define your own measure function based on what you feel
455     should represent the "size" or "complexity" of the input expression.  Note
456     that some choices, such as ``lambda expr: len(str(expr))`` may appear to be
457     good metrics, but have other problems (in this case, the measure function
458     may slow down simplify too much for very large expressions).  If you don't
459     know what a good metric would be, the default, ``count_ops``, is a good
460     one.
461 
462     For example:
463 
464     >>> from sympy import symbols, log
465     >>> a, b = symbols('a b', positive=True)
466     >>> g = log(a) + log(b) + log(a)*log(1/b)
467     >>> h = simplify(g)
468     >>> h
469     log(a*b**(-log(a) + 1))
470     >>> count_ops(g)
471     8
472     >>> count_ops(h)
473     5
474 
475     So you can see that ``h`` is simpler than ``g`` using the count_ops metric.
476     However, we may not like how ``simplify`` (in this case, using
477     ``logcombine``) has created the ``b**(log(1/a) + 1)`` term.  A simple way
478     to reduce this would be to give more weight to powers as operations in
479     ``count_ops``.  We can do this by using the ``visual=True`` option:
480 
481     >>> print(count_ops(g, visual=True))
482     2*ADD + DIV + 4*LOG + MUL
483     >>> print(count_ops(h, visual=True))
484     2*LOG + MUL + POW + SUB
485 
486     >>> from sympy import Symbol, S
487     >>> def my_measure(expr):
488     ...     POW = Symbol('POW')
489     ...     # Discourage powers by giving POW a weight of 10
490     ...     count = count_ops(expr, visual=True).subs(POW, 10)
491     ...     # Every other operation gets a weight of 1 (the default)
492     ...     count = count.replace(Symbol, type(S.One))
493     ...     return count
494     >>> my_measure(g)
495     8
496     >>> my_measure(h)
497     14
498     >>> 15./8 > 1.7 # 1.7 is the default ratio
499     True
500     >>> simplify(g, measure=my_measure)
501     -log(a)*log(b) + log(a) + log(b)
502 
503     Note that because ``simplify()`` internally tries many different
504     simplification strategies and then compares them using the measure
505     function, we get a completely different result that is still different
506     from the input expression by doing this.

457     good metrics, but have other problems (in this case, the measure function
458     may slow down simplify too much for very large expressions).  If you don't
459     know what a good metric would be, the default, ``count_ops``, is a good
460     one.
461 
462     For example:
463 
464     >>> from sympy import symbols, log
465     >>> a, b = symbols('a b', positive=True)
466     >>> g = log(a) + log(b) + log(a)*log(1/b)
467     >>> h = simplify(g)
468     >>> h
469     log(a*b**(-log(a) + 1))
470     >>> count_ops(g)
471     8
472     >>> count_ops(h)
473     5
474 
475     So you can see that ``h`` is simpler than ``g`` using the count_ops metric.
476     However, we may not like how ``simplify`` (in this case, using
477     ``logcombine``) has created the ``b**(log(1/a) + 1)`` term.  A simple way
478     to reduce this would be to give more weight to powers as operations in
479     ``count_ops``.  We can do this by using the ``visual=True`` option:
480 
481     >>> print(count_ops(g, visual=True))
482     2*ADD + DIV + 4*LOG + MUL
483     >>> print(count_ops(h, visual=True))
484     2*LOG + MUL + POW + SUB
485 
486     >>> from sympy import Symbol, S
487     >>> def my_measure(expr):
488     ...     POW = Symbol('POW')
489     ...     # Discourage powers by giving POW a weight of 10
490     ...     count = count_ops(expr, visual=True).subs(POW, 10)
491     ...     # Every other operation gets a weight of 1 (the default)
492     ...     count = count.replace(Symbol, type(S.One))
493     ...     return count
494     >>> my_measure(g)
495     8
496     >>> my_measure(h)
497     14
498     >>> 15./8 > 1.7 # 1.7 is the default ratio
499     True
500     >>> simplify(g, measure=my_measure)
501     -log(a)*log(b) + log(a) + log(b)
502 
503     Note that because ``simplify()`` internally tries many different
504     simplification strategies and then compares them using the measure
505     function, we get a completely different result that is still different
506     from the input expression by doing this.

</code><intended_behavior>The intended behavior is to enhance the `simplify` method by integrating an optional recursive simplification mechanism. This mechanism should invoke the `simplify` function on its own result for a specified number of recursive steps (`max_rec_steps`), but only when it's likely to further reduce the complexity of the expression. The existing functionality of the `simplify` method must be preserved, ensuring that when `max_rec_steps` is not explicitly provided (or provided as 0), the function behaves as it currently does, without attempting recursive simplification. The addition should include a safe-guard mechanism to prevent infinite recursion and excessive computation, perhaps using a combination of the `measure` function to detect no further simplification improvement and `max_rec_steps` as a hard limit for recursion depth.</intended_behavior>]
