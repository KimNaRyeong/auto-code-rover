        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior is to enhance the `simplify` method by integrating an optional recursive simplification mechanism. This mechanism should invoke the `simplify` function on its own result for a specified number of recursive steps (`max_rec_steps`), but only when it's likely to further reduce the complexity of the expression. The existing functionality of the `simplify` method must be preserved, ensuring that when `max_rec_steps` is not explicitly provided (or provided as 0), the function behaves as it currently does, without attempting recursive simplification. The addition should include a safe-guard mechanism to prevent infinite recursion and excessive computation, perhaps using a combination of the `measure` function to detect no further simplification improvement and `max_rec_steps` as a hard limit for recursion depth."
