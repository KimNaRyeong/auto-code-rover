Full script is attached in the .zip file:\n[simplify_last_step.zip](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/files/76131/simplify_last_step.zip)\n---\nI've been using Sympy to compute Laplacian in different geometrical coordinates system. This usually creates extremelly long expressions and simplify usually does a great job. However, I've come against one particular case where simplify does most of the job but doesn't perform the ultimate simplification step.\nI've reduced the problem set getting rid of all of the Derivative terms. The initial\nexpression is still huge (675 ops!):\n![initial_expression](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072960/a0c94034-b0b6-11e5-8626-90608bf70b84.png)\nA first call to `simplify` sucessfully reduces it to :\n![simplify](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072961/b681be7e-b0b6-11e5-9ddd-e5d077329773.png)\nWhich is great (23 ops), but somehow frustrating as we can factorize it a little more. If I apply `simplify` again, then I get the expression I wanted (7 ops):\n![simplify_bis](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072964/d2760f7c-b0b6-11e5-9562-37d4d32c9b88.png)\n---\nIf simplify worked perfectly, `simplify(simplify(expr))` shouldn't yield a different result from `simplify(expr)`\nFrom my understanding of how simplify works, it successively tries different simplification strategies  and compares them. In that case, the order of the different strategies matters. In my particular case, the strategy than eventually did the final factorisation step may have been called to early.\nI fixed that calling simplify again. We could fix it applying an optional recursive mode at the end of the simplify function:\n``` python\ndef simplify(expr, ratio=1.7, measure=count_ops, fu=False, max_rec_steps=0):\n\"\"\"\nSimplifies the given expression.\nInput\n========\nmax_rec_steps: int\nif >0, simplified is applied recursively with a maximum of 'max_rec_steps'\ntimes.\n(...)\n\"\"\"\n(...)\nif measure(expr) > ratio*measure(original_expr):\nexpr = original_expr\nif max_rec_steps>0 and measure(expr)<measure(original_expr):\nsexpr = simplify(expr, ratio, measure, fu, max_rec_steps=max_rec_steps-1)\nexpr = shorter(expr,sexpr)\nreturn expr\n```\nI can make the pull request if that helps.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given the issue's focus on the `simplify` function not performing the ultimate simplification step on a specific expression and the suggestion for a recursive mode enhancement, it is crucial to analyze the implementation of `simplify` within the SymPy library. The fact that `simplify` resides in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` (from the search results) indicates that this file is likely the primary location of the simplification logic relevant to the issue. The other instances of `simplify` methods across various modules could relate to specialized simplifications in different mathematical contexts (e.g., matrices, vectors, boolean algebra), but our primary interest is in the general purpose `simplify` function, which seems to be the one in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`.\n\nConsidering the necessary context to devise a solution:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `simplify` method in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` likely serves as the general simplification function for expressions in SymPy. This function should attempt various strategies to reduce the complexity of mathematical expressions, making them easier to interpret or further manipulate.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Since the bug involves the `simplify` function not executing the final step of simplification for a given expression, the implementation within `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` is directly related to the issue. Understanding how `simplify` is implemented, especially the logic governing its strategy selection and execution order, is crucial for identifying why the last simplification step is not reached in some cases.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior, as suggested by the user, would be for the `simplify` function to optionally perform recursive simplification steps if it detects that further simplification could yield a more simplified form of the expression beyond the initial pass. This means, after a simplification step, the function would check if applying itself again would reduce the expression's complexity further and repeat this process up to a specified number of times or until no further simplification is possible.\n\nTo address the issue and considering the user's solution, it seems necessary to understand the current structure and logic of the `simplify` function. This understanding will help in identifying an appropriate insertion point and method for implementing a recursive simplification option. To further this, one should examine the specific implementation details of the `simplify` function within `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`.\n\nThe next logical step would be to get the implementation details of the `simplify` method from `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`:\n\n- search_method_in_file(\"simplify\", \"sympy/simplify/simplify.py\")"

Given the issue, the intended enhancement involves adding a recursive simplification option. This means incorporating a check at the end of the `simplify` method to see if further simplification is possible by reapplying itself to the result. If so, it should repeat this process, possibly controlled by a new parameter `max_rec_steps` indicating the maximum number of recursive steps allowed. This enhancement should preserve the method's existing functionality when `max_rec_steps` is set to 0 (or is not provided, assuming the default value implies no recursive simplification). The modification should ensure that the recursion does not degrade performance on expressions that do not benefit from recursive simplification and carefully manage the increased computation cost associated with additional simplification passes."
