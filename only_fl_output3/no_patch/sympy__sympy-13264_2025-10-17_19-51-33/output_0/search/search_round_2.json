Full script is attached in the .zip file:\n[simplify_last_step.zip](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/files/76131/simplify_last_step.zip)\n---\nI've been using Sympy to compute Laplacian in different geometrical coordinates system. This usually creates extremelly long expressions and simplify usually does a great job. However, I've come against one particular case where simplify does most of the job but doesn't perform the ultimate simplification step.\nI've reduced the problem set getting rid of all of the Derivative terms. The initial\nexpression is still huge (675 ops!):\n![initial_expression](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072960/a0c94034-b0b6-11e5-8626-90608bf70b84.png)\nA first call to `simplify` sucessfully reduces it to :\n![simplify](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072961/b681be7e-b0b6-11e5-9ddd-e5d077329773.png)\nWhich is great (23 ops), but somehow frustrating as we can factorize it a little more. If I apply `simplify` again, then I get the expression I wanted (7 ops):\n![simplify_bis](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16088743/12072964/d2760f7c-b0b6-11e5-9562-37d4d32c9b88.png)\n---\nIf simplify worked perfectly, `simplify(simplify(expr))` shouldn't yield a different result from `simplify(expr)`\nFrom my understanding of how simplify works, it successively tries different simplification strategies  and compares them. In that case, the order of the different strategies matters. In my particular case, the strategy than eventually did the final factorisation step may have been called to early.\nI fixed that calling simplify again. We could fix it applying an optional recursive mode at the end of the simplify function:\n``` python\ndef simplify(expr, ratio=1.7, measure=count_ops, fu=False, max_rec_steps=0):\n\"\"\"\nSimplifies the given expression.\nInput\n========\nmax_rec_steps: int\nif >0, simplified is applied recursively with a maximum of 'max_rec_steps'\ntimes.\n(...)\n\"\"\"\n(...)\nif measure(expr) > ratio*measure(original_expr):\nexpr = original_expr\nif max_rec_steps>0 and measure(expr)<measure(original_expr):\nsexpr = simplify(expr, ratio, measure, fu, max_rec_steps=max_rec_steps-1)\nexpr = shorter(expr,sexpr)\nreturn expr\n```\nI can make the pull request if that helps.\n</issue>"

The fact that `simplify` resides in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` (from the search results) indicates that this file is likely the primary location of the simplification logic relevant to the issue. The other instances of `simplify` methods across various modules could relate to specialized simplifications in different mathematical contexts (e.g., matrices, vectors, boolean algebra), but our primary interest is in the general purpose `simplify` function, which seems to be the one in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`.\n\nConsidering the necessary context to devise a solution:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `simplify` method in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` likely serves as the general simplification function for expressions in SymPy. This function should attempt various strategies to reduce the complexity of mathematical expressions, making them easier to interpret or further manipulate.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Since the bug involves the `simplify` function not executing the final step of simplification for a given expression, the implementation within `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` is directly related to the issue. Understanding how `simplify` is implemented, especially the logic governing its strategy selection and execution order, is crucial for identifying why the last simplification step is not reached in some cases.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior, as suggested by the user, would be for the `simplify` function to optionally perform recursive simplification steps if it detects that further simplification could yield a more simplified form of the expression beyond the initial pass. This means, after a simplification step, the function would check if applying itself again would reduce the expression's complexity further and repeat this process up to a specified number of times or until no further simplification is possible.\n\nTo address the issue and considering the user's solution, it seems necessary to understand the current structure and logic of the `simplify` function. This understanding will help in identifying an appropriate insertion point and method for implementing a recursive simplification option. To further this, one should examine the specific implementation details of the `simplify` function within `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`.\n\nThe next logical step would be to get the implementation details of the `simplify` method from `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`:\n\n- search_method_in_file(\"simplify\", \"sympy/simplify/simplify.py\")"

If so, it should repeat this process, possibly controlled by a new parameter `max_rec_steps` indicating the maximum number of recursive steps allowed. This enhancement should preserve the method's existing functionality when `max_rec_steps` is set to 0 (or is not provided, assuming the default value implies no recursive simplification).

If\n391     your algorithm relies on \"simplification\" (whatever it is), try to\n392     determine what you need exactly  -  is it powsimp()?, radsimp()?,\n393     together()?, logcombine()?, or something else? And use this particular\n394     function directly, because those are well defined and thus your algorithm\n395     will be robust.\n396 \n397     Nonetheless, especially for interactive use, or when you don't know\n398     anything about the structure of the expression, simplify() tries to apply\n399     intelligent heuristics to make the input expression \"simpler\".  For\n400     example:\n401 \n402     >>> from sympy import simplify, cos, sin\n403     >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n404     >>> a = (x + x**2)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n405     >>> a\n406     (x**2 + x)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n407     >>> simplify(a)\n408     x + 1\n409 \n410     Note that we could have obtained the same result by using specific\n411     simplification functions:\n412 \n413     >>> from sympy import trigsimp, cancel\n414     >>> trigsimp(a)\n415     (x**2 + x)/x\n416     >>> cancel(_)\n417     x + 1\n418 \n419     In some cases, applying :func:`simplify` may actually result in some more\n420     complicated expression. The default ``ratio=1.7`` prevents more extreme\n421     cases: if (result length)/(input length) > ratio, then input is returned\n422     unmodified.  The ``measure`` parameter lets you specify the function used\n423     to determine how complex an expression is.  The function should take a\n424     single argument as an expression and return a number such that if\n425     expression ``a`` is more complex than expression ``b``, then\n426     ``measure(a) > measure(b)``.  The default measure function is\n427     :func:`count_ops`, which returns the total number of operations in the\n428     expression.\n429 \n430     For example, if ``ratio=1``, ``simplify`` output can't be longer\n431     than input.\n432 \n433     ::\n434 \n435         >>> from sympy import sqrt, simplify, count_ops, oo\n436         >>> root = 1/(sqrt(2)+3)\n437 \n438     Since ``simplify(root)`` would result in a slightly longer expression,\n439     root is returned unchanged instead::\n440 \n441        >>> simplify(root, ratio=1) == root\n442        True\n443 \n444     If ``ratio=oo``, simplify will be applied anyway::\n445 \n446         >>> count_ops(simplify(root, ratio=oo)) > count_ops(root)\n447         True\n448 \n449     Note that the shortest expression is not necessary the simplest, so\n450     setting ``ratio`` to 1 may not be a good idea.\n451     Heuristically, the default value ``ratio=1.7`` seems like a reasonable\n452     choice.\n453 \n454     You can easily define your own measure function based on what you feel\n455     should represent the \"size\" or \"complexity\" of the input expression.  Note\n456     that some choices, such as ``lambda expr: len(str(expr))`` may appear to be\n457     good metrics, but have other problems (in this case, the measure function\n458     may slow down simplify too much for very large expressions).  If you don't\n459     know what a good metric would be, the default, ``count_ops``, is a good\n460     one.\n461 \n462     For example:\n463 \n464     >>> from sympy import symbols, log\n465     >>> a, b = symbols('a b', positive=True)\n466     >>> g = log(a) + log(b) + log(a)*log(1/b)\n467     >>> h = simplify(g)\n468     >>> h\n469     log(a*b**(-log(a) + 1))\n470     >>> count_ops(g)\n471     8\n472     >>> count_ops(h)\n473     5\n474 \n475     So you can see that ``h`` is simpler than ``g`` using the count_ops metric.\n476     However, we may not like how ``simplify`` (in this case, using\n477     ``logcombine``) has created the ``b**(log(1/a) + 1)`` term.  A simple way\n478     to reduce this would be to give more weight to powers as operations in\n479     ``count_ops``.  We can do this by using the ``visual=True`` option:\n480 \n481     >>> print(count_ops(g, visual=True))\n482     2*ADD + DIV + 4*LOG + MUL\n483     >>> print(count_ops(h, visual=True))\n484     2*LOG + MUL + POW + SUB\n485 \n486     >>> from sympy import Symbol, S\n487     >>> def my_measure(expr):\n488     ...     POW = Symbol('POW')\n489     ...     # Discourage powers by giving POW a weight of 10\n490     ...     count = count_ops(expr, visual=True).subs(POW, 10)\n491     ...     # Every other operation gets a weight of 1 (the default)\n492     ...     count = count.replace(Symbol, type(S.One))\n493     ...     return count\n494     >>> my_measure(g)\n495     8\n496     >>> my_measure(h)\n497     14\n498     >>> 15./8 > 1.7 # 1.7 is the default ratio\n499     True\n500     >>> simplify(g, measure=my_measure)\n501     -log(a)*log(b) + log(a) + log(b)\n502 \n503     Note that because ``simplify()`` internally tries many different\n504     simplification strategies and then compares them using the measure\n505     function, we get a completely different result that is still different\n506     from the input expression by doing this.\n507     \"\"\"\n508     expr = sympify(expr)\n509 \n510     try:\n511         return expr._eval_simplify(ratio=ratio, measure=measure)\n512     except AttributeError:\n513         pass\n514 \n515     original_expr = expr = signsimp(expr)\n516 \n517     from sympy.simplify.hyperexpand import hyperexpand\n518     from sympy.functions.special.bessel import BesselBase\n519     from sympy import Sum, Product\n520 \n521     if not isinstance(expr, Basic) or not expr.args:  # XXX: temporary hack\n522         return expr\n523 \n524     if not isinstance(expr, (Add, Mul, Pow, ExpBase)):\n525         if isinstance(expr, Function) and hasattr(expr, \"inverse\"):\n526             if len(expr.args) == 1 and len(expr.args[0].args) == 1 and \\\n527                isinstance(expr.args[0], expr.inverse(argindex=1)):\n528                 return simplify(expr.args[0].args[0], ratio=ratio,\n529                                 measure=measure, fu=fu)\n530         return expr.func(*[simplify(x, ratio=ratio, measure=measure, fu=fu)\n531                          for x in expr.args])\n532 \n533     # TODO: Apply different strategies, considering expression pattern:\n534     # is it a purely rational function?

This function is designed to apply a series of simplification strategies to an expression to reduce its complexity without altering its mathematical equivalence. Below is the analysis based on the given code snippet and the issue description:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `simplify` function attempts multiple general and specialized simplification strategies on a given symbolic expression. It uses heuristics and operations such as `cancel`, `powsimp`, `trigsimp`, `expand_log`, and several others to reduce the expression to a simpler form. It also considers a measure of the expression's complexity (`measure`) and a ratio (`ratio`) to determine whether the simplified result should be returned or if the original expression is simpler according to the defined metrics.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue arises from the `simplify` function not applying an apparently accessible further simplification step in certain cases. The reported bug suggests that calling `simplify` on its own result can lead to an even simpler form than obtained from a single call. This situation suggests that the function's current implementation might not be exhaustively exploring all possible simplification paths or sequences of simplification strategies that could lead to a minimal expression form.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - To address the reported issue, the intended enhancement to the `simplify` function would involve incorporating a mechanism to optionally apply itself recursively a specified number of times (`max_rec_steps`) if it's determined that doing so could result in further simplification. This enhancement would allow `simplify` to re-evaluate its resulting expression to see if additional simplification strategies could be effectively applied. This feature should be optional and controlled through the function's parameters to avoid unnecessary computational overhead in cases where recursive simplification may not be beneficial. Essentially, the function would try simplifying an expression, and if enabled and deemed potentially beneficial according to its `measure` function, it would attempt further simplification passes up to `max_rec_steps`.\n\nThe code snippet provided does not include a parameter or functionality for recursively applying simplification strategies. Introducing this capability would involve modifications to allow the function to keep track of and limit recursion depth (to prevent infinite loops and to manage computational resource usage effectively) while ensuring that additional simplification steps are undertaken if and only if they are likely to produce a simpler expression by some metric."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

This mechanism should invoke the `simplify` function on its own result for a specified number of recursive steps (`max_rec_steps`), but only when it's likely to further reduce the complexity of the expression. The existing functionality of the `simplify` method must be preserved, ensuring that when `max_rec_steps` is not explicitly provided (or provided as 0), the function behaves as it currently does, without attempting recursive simplification. The addition should include a safe-guard mechanism to prevent infinite recursion and excessive computation, perhaps using a combination of the `measure` function to detect no further simplification improvement and `max_rec_steps` as a hard limit for recursion depth.\n\nThis enhancement would provide a more powerful and flexible simplification tool within the SymPy library, potentially reducing the need for users to manually reapply the `simplify` function to obtain simpler forms of expressions. It would also directly address the issue reported, where certain expressions can be further simplified beyond the current capabilities of a single `simplify` function call."
