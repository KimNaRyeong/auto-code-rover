        "content": "<issue>slugify() doesn't return a valid slug for \"\u0130\".\nDescription\nWhile working on an international project, we discovered that the turkish/azerbaijani letter \u0130 can not be properly processed when SlugField and slugify are run with allow_unicode=True.\nThe project itself runs with Django 2.2.6 and Wagtail 2.6.2. I first talked about this in the Wagtail Support Channel and while researching further, discovered that this is a Django/Python related issue. This was tested on Python 3.6 and on Python 3.7.\n(quick shoutout to Matt Wescott @gasmanic of Wagtail Fame for being a sparing partner in this)\nThere is a rather detailed analysis (README) in a git repo I created \u200bhttps://github.com/originell/django-wagtail-turkish-i - it was also the basis for my initial call for help in wagtail's support channel. Meanwhile I have extended it with a Django-only project, as to be a 100% sure this has nothing to do with Wagtail.\nI was not able to find anything similar in trac. While I encourage whoever is reading this to actually read the README in the git repo, I want to honor your time and will try to provide a more concise version of the bug here.\nExplanation\nmodels.py\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.utils.text import slugify\nclass Page(models.Model):\ntitle = models.CharField(max_length=255)\nslug = models.SlugField(allow_unicode=True)\ndef __str__(self):\nreturn self.title\nUsing this in a shell/test like a (Model)Form might:\nfrom django.utils.text import slugify\npage = Page(title=\"Hello \u0130stanbul\")\npage.slug = slugify(page.title, allow_unicode=True)\npage.full_clean()\nfull_clean() then raises\ndjango.core.exceptions.ValidationError: {'slug': Enter a valid 'slug' consisting of Unicode letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens.?}\nWhy is that?\nslugify does the following internally:\nre.sub(r'[^\\w\\s-]', '', value).strip().lower()\nThing is, Python's .lower() of the \u0130 in \u0130stanbul looks like this:\n>>> [unicodedata.name(character) for character in '\u0130'.lower()]\n['LATIN SMALL LETTER I', 'COMBINING DOT ABOVE']\nSo, while slugify() finishes, the result is then passed into SlugField which uses the slug_unicode_re (^[-\\w]+\\Z). However, the Combining Dot Above is not a valid \\w:\n>>> [(character, unicodedata.name(character), slug_unicode_re.match(character)) for character in '\u0130'.lower()]\n[\n('i', 'LATIN SMALL LETTER I', <re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='i'>),\n# EUREKA!!\n('\u0307', 'COMBINING DOT ABOVE', None)\n]\nSo that's why the ValidationError is raised.\nProposed Solution\nThe culprit seems to be the order in which lower() is called in slugify. The assumption that the lowercase version of a re.sub-ed string is still a valid slug_unicode_re, does not seem to hold true.\nHence, instead of doing this in slugify()\nre.sub(r'[^\\w\\s-]', '', value).strip().lower()\nIt might be better to do it like this\nre.sub(r'[^\\w\\s-]', '', value.lower()).strip()\nIs Python the actual culprit?\nYeah it might be. Matt (@gasmanic) urged me to also take a look if Python might be doing this wrong.\nThe \u0130 is the Latin Capital Letter I with Dot Above. It's codepoint is U+0130 According to the chart for the Latin Extended-A set (\u200bhttps://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0100.pdf), it's lowercase version is U+0069.\nU+0069 lives in the C0 Controls and Basic Latin set (\u200bhttps://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf). Lo and behold: it is the Latin small letter I. So a latin lowercase i.\nDoes this really mean that Python is doing something weird here by adding the Combining dot above? Honestly, I can't imagine that and I am probably missing an important thing here because my view is too naive.\n---\nI hope this shorter explanation makes sense. If it does not, please try to read through the detailed analysis in the repo (\u200bhttps://github.com/originell/django-wagtail-turkish-i/blob/master/README.md). If that also does not make a ton of sense, let me know.\nIn any case, thank you for taking the time to read this bug report. Looking forward to feedback and thoughts. I am happy to oblige in any capacity necessary.\n</issue>"

Thus, it's not relevant to the bug.\n\n2. **`slugify` Method (django/template/defaultfilters.py and django/utils/text.py):**\n   - The `slugify` method is found in two places: `django/template/defaultfilters.py` and `django/utils/text.py`. The implementation in `django/utils/text.py` is particularly relevant as it includes the `allow_unicode` parameter, which directly relates to the issue at hand. This method aims to normalize strings into slugs by stripping non-alphanumeric characters, converting spaces (and similar characters) to hyphens, and lowercasing the result.\n   - The relationship to the bug lies in how `slugify` manages the `allow_unicode` parameter. With `allow_unicode=True`, the method is supposed to handle Unicode characters, including special cases such as the Turkish \"\u0130\", appropriately. However, the issue describes that \"\u0130\" is incorrectly processed, suggesting a flaw in either the normalization (`unicodedata.normalize`) process or the regular expression used for cleaning up the slug value.\n   - The intended behavior of this part of the code, given the issue, would be to correctly handle the lowercase conversion of \"\u0130\" to \"i\" without leaving a trailing combining character (like the \"combining dot above\") which makes it invalid as a slug part for URLs.\n\nGiven the information from the issue and the results from the API calls, we might need to delve deeper into how Unicode characters are handled in the normalization process (`unicodedata.normalize`) and whether or not Django's slugify function accurately accounts for edge cases such as \"\u0130\". Since the project mentions a detailed README with an analysis, this would typically be a good place to look for further context. However, within our simulation, we should consider additional API calls that might shed light on the underlying issue:\n\n- Since searching for `slug = models.SlugField(allow_unicode=True)` did not yield results, examining how `SlugField` is implemented or used in the project might require direct analysis of Django's model fields.\n- The issue might benefit from searching the Django project's use of `unicodedata.normalize` or even examining the Unicode standard's recommendations for case conversions that preserve semantics across different languages, which might not be directly searchable with the given API.\n\nAt this point, further steps would typically involve reviewing Django's issue tracker and documentation on Unicode handling, as well as Python's documentation for the `unicodedata` module, to ensure that the handling of special Unicode cases like \"\u0130\" matches expected behaviors."

When `allow_unicode=True`, the method ideally needs to either explicitly address common edge cases like the Turkish \"\u0130\", or improve its normalization strategy so that it can automatically handle such cases without manual intervention. This might involve adjusting the order or method of character normalization and slug generation to ensure that all characters are properly converted to their lowercase forms, and any language-specific modifications (like removing combining marks that make the character invalid in a URL context) are applied. The existing functionality, which works well for a wide range of Unicode characters, must be preserved, but enhanced to correctly slugify specific edge cases presented by characters like the Turkish \"\u0130\".\n\nThis solution ensures that the `slugify` function remains compatible with existing uses while improving its handling of international characters in a way that is consistent with user expectations and the principles of Unicode normalization."
