        "intended_behavior": "The `slugify` method should correctly handle the conversion of \"\u0130\" to \"i\" without producing an invalid slug part. When `allow_unicode=True`, the method ideally needs to either explicitly address common edge cases like the Turkish \"\u0130\", or improve its normalization strategy so that it can automatically handle such cases without manual intervention. This might involve adjusting the order or method of character normalization and slug generation to ensure that all characters are properly converted to their lowercase forms, and any language-specific modifications (like removing combining marks that make the character invalid in a URL context) are applied. The existing functionality, which works well for a wide range of Unicode characters, must be preserved, but enhanced to correctly slugify specific edge cases presented by characters like the Turkish \"\u0130\"."
