The method should accurately subtract the numeric elements that fall within the interval range, while preserving all symbolic elements and any numeric elements outside the interval range. This behavior is consistent with the mathematical definition of set complement, particularly when the sets involved include a mix of symbolic elements (which do not have an inherent numeric value within the context of intervals) and numeric elements.
