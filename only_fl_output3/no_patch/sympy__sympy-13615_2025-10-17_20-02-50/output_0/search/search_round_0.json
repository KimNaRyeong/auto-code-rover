Let's proceed with the following API calls to gather this necessary information:\n\n1. **Search for the `Complement` function implementation**: Since the issue is directly related to how `Complement` behaves with a mixture of symbols and numbers, it's crucial to see the code responsible for its operation.\n    - `search_method(\"Complement\")`\n\n2. **Get more information on the `FiniteSet` class**: Understanding the internal workings of `FiniteSet` may provide insight into how it handles different types of elements (symbols and numerics) within sets.\n    - `search_class(\"FiniteSet\")`\n\n3. **Examine the `Interval` class**: Since `Interval` instances are part of the operation that leads to the incorrect output, knowing how intervals are defined and used could be helpful.\n    - `search_class(\"Interval\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide sufficient context to start investigating the issue."
