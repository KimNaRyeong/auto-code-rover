        "intended_behavior": "The `_complement` method within the `FiniteSet` class needs to be revised to ensure it correctly handles instances where the `FiniteSet` contains both symbolic and numeric elements, and the complement operation involves an `Interval`. The method should accurately subtract the numeric elements that fall within the interval range, while preserving all symbolic elements and any numeric elements outside the interval range. This behavior is consistent with the mathematical definition of set complement, particularly when the sets involved include a mix of symbolic elements (which do not have an inherent numeric value within the context of intervals) and numeric elements. The fix should ensure that the complement operation returns a set that includes all symbolic elements from the original `FiniteSet` when complemented with any `Interval`, including numeric elements only when they do not intersect with the interval."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to the `FiniteSet` `_complement` method, the `Interval` class's `_complement` method also requires refinement to handle operations involving a `FiniteSet` with a mix of symbolic and numeric elements. The method should ensure that when an `Interval` is complemented with a `FiniteSet`, the result appropriately includes all symbolic elements from the `FiniteSet` that are not numerically quantifiable within the bounds of the `Interval`. This approach would maintain mathematical integrity by recognizing that symbolic elements do not directly participate in the numeric comparison operations that define intervals. A careful implementation is needed to distinguish between numeric and symbolic elements while performing the complement operation, ensuring that symbolic elements are consistently preserved in the result."
