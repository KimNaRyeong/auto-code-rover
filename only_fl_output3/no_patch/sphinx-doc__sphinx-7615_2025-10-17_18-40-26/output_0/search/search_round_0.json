In pure Docutils, they are renderer properly according with RST spec.\n**To Reproduce**\nThe following snippet demonstrantes buggy rendering.\n```\nTwo \\\\\nThree \\\\\\\nFour \\\\\\\\\nFive \\\\\\\\\\\nSix \\\\\\\\\\\\\n```\n**Expected behavior**\nTwo backslashes should be rendered as `\\`. Three still as `\\`. Four and five as `\\\\`. Six as `\\\\\\` and so on. This is how it works in Docutils.\n**Screenshots**\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/383059/80948942-5cb29c00-8df3-11ea-8fe9-ca4bc390eef9.png)\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Linux\n- Python version: 3.6\n- Sphinx version: 3.0.2\n- Sphinx extensions:  none\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to Sphinx's handling of consecutive backslashes in RST documents, let's outline a strategy for using the provided search APIs:\n\n1. Since the issue likely pertains to the rendering process of text within Sphinx documentation, it's important to locate the part of the Sphinx codebase responsible for parsing and rendering RST text. We could start by looking for a class or method related to RST parsing or text rendering.\n\n2. The problem description involves the incorrect rendering of backslashes, which are often used in escape sequences. Methods or classes that handle escape sequences or text formatting in Sphinx could contain relevant code.\n\n3. Given the specific nature of the bug (handling of consecutive backslashes), searching directly for code snippets that process backslashes might yield immediate insights into where the bug might reside.\n\nBased on these considerations, let\u2019s make the following API calls:\n- `search_class(\"RSTParser\")` to find if there\u2019s a specific RST parser class in Sphinx which might be handling the parsing differently than Docutils.\n- `search_method(\"parse_text\")` as a broadly scoped search aiming to find methods responsible for parsing text where our issue could occur.\n- `search_code(r\"\\\\\")` to search for instances where backslash processing might be explicitly handled, potentially leading us directly to the problematic code segment."
