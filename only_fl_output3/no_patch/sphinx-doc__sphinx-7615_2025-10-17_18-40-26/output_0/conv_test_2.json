In pure Docutils, they are renderer properly according with RST spec.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nThe following snippet demonstrantes buggy rendering. \r\n```\r\nTwo \\\\\r\n\r\nThree \\\\\\\r\n\r\nFour \\\\\\\\\r\n\r\nFive \\\\\\\\\\\r\n\r\nSix \\\\\\\\\\\\\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nTwo backslashes should be rendered as `\\`. Three still as `\\`. Four and five as `\\\\`. Six as `\\\\\\` and so on. This is how it works in Docutils.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/383059/80948942-5cb29c00-8df3-11ea-8fe9-ca4bc390eef9.png)\r\n\r\n**Environment info**\r\n- OS: Linux\r\n- Python version: 3.6\r\n- Sphinx version: 3.0.2\r\n- Sphinx extensions:  none\n"

The primary tactic involves directly comparing the generated documentation with the expected backslash rendering outcome.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef create_sphinx_project():\n    os.makedirs(\"test_doc\", exist_ok=True)\n    with open(\"test_doc/conf.py\", \"w\") as f:\n        f.write(\"project = 'TestProject'\\n\")\n        f.write(\"extensions = []\\n\")\n    with open(\"test_doc/index.rst\", \"w\") as f:\n        f.write(\"\"\"\nWelcome to TestProject's documentation!\n========================================\n\nBackslashes\n-----------\n\n.. literalinclude:: test.txt\n\n\"\"\")\n    with open(\"test_doc/test.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n        f.write(\"\"\"\nTwo \\\\\n\nThree \\\\\\\n\nFour \\\\\\\\\n\nFive \\\\\\\\\\\n\nSix \\\\\\\\\\\\\n\"\"\")\n\ndef build_sphinx():\n    try:\n        subprocess.run(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'text', 'test_doc', 'test_doc/_build'], check=True)\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        sys.exit(1)\n\ndef verify_output():\n    expected_lines = [\n        \"Two \\\\\",\n        \"Three \\\\\",\n        \"Four \\\\\\\\\",\n        \"Five \\\\\\\\\",\n        \"Six \\\\\\\\\"\n    ]\n\n    output_file = \"test_doc/_build/index.txt\"\n    try:\n        with open(output_file, \"r\") as f:\n            lines = f.readlines()\n        \n        for expected, line in zip(expected_lines, lines[-5:]):  # Checking the last 5 lines for matching output\n            assert expected.strip() in line.strip(), f\"Expected '{expected}' found '{line.strip()}'\"\n            \n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error status if the issue is present\n\ndef cleanup():\n    subprocess.run(['rm', '-rf', 'test_doc'])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        create_sphinx_project()\n        build_sphinx()\n        verify_output()\n        print(\"Issue not found.

The `literalinclude` directive is used to directly include a text file's content within the Sphinx documentation, simulating the scenario where backslashes are included in documentation. \n\nThis revised script will:\n- Set up a minimal Sphinx project.\n- Include a text file with backslashes in various quantities to be rendered into the documentation.\n- Build the documentation using Sphinx.\n- Verify that the backslashes are rendered as expected by comparing the text output.\n- Use the given function to print stack traces if exceptions occur, allowing for detailed debugging information. \n\nPlease ensure Sphinx is installed in your current Python environment (`pip install sphinx`) before running the script. Also, adapt the script to match the specific configuration and Sphinx version you're using if necessary."
