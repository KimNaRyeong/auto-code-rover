We then have multiple Apps that talk to their own databases. Some share the same table names.\nWe have used this setup for a while, but after upgrading to Django 2.2 we're getting an error saying we're not allowed 2 apps, with 2 different models to have the same table names.\nIs this correct behavior? We've had to roll back to Django 2.0 for now.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To tackle the issue described, we'll first understand the context around how the models are defined in the `Base` app and one or more of the conflicting apps (`app2` is mentioned), and how they are configured to point to their respective databases. This involves looking into the model definitions that explicitly define the `db_table` attribute, as well as the Django database routing setup that might be in place to manage database operations across different apps targeting different databases.\n\nTherefore, the following API calls are necessary to start gathering the needed context:\n\n1. **Search for the conflicting models in the Base app**: Since the issue mentions a `Base` app with its model, we need to search for the model within this app that is causing the conflict. There wasn't a specific model name mentioned for the `Base` app, but it's referred to as `ModelName` in the error message context. Given this ambiguity, we'll prime our search for models within the \"Base\" context without specific file names.\n\n   - `search_class(\"ModelName\")`\n\n2. **Search for the conflicting models in the `app2`**: Similar to the base app, we are also interested in the conflicting model named `ModelName` within `app2`.\n\n   - `search_class(\"ModelName\")`\n\n3. **Search for database routing configurations**: Knowing how the database is routed for the different apps, especially for the `Base` app and `app2`, can provide insight into whether the configurations might contribute to this issue.\n\n   - `search_code(\"DATABASE_ROUTERS\")`\n\nBy analyzing the code snippets returned from these queries, it should be possible to ascertain how the models are defined in terms of their `db_table` attributes and gain insight into how database routing is set up, which might be contributing to or could help resolve the naming conflict."
