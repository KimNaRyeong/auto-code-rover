        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, `PyLinter` needs to incorporate logic to utilize `isinstance` checks for the categorization of checkers and reporters, in addition to any current methodology. Specifically, it should use abstract base classes defined with `ABCMeta` for these `isinstance` checks. This means modifying the `register_checker` method to validate checker classes against abstract checker interfaces using `isinstance`. Also, wherever checkers or reporters are processed or categorized, these `isinstance` checks need to be incorporated. This modification preserves the existing functionality of categorization while extending compatibility for plugin development and easing the transition away from the deprecated `__implements__` attribute."

        "intended_behavior": "This file likely needs updating or creation of new abstract classes for checker and reporter interfaces using `ABCMeta` from the `abc` module. These abstract classes will serve as the basis for the `isinstance` checks in `PyLinter`. This update is crucial for moving away from the deprecated `__implements__` system to a more standardized approach. Each interface should define abstract methods that are essential for their respective checkers or reporters, focusing on what methods a checker/reporter must implement to be compatible with `PyLinter`."
