        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### `__implements__` Usage in Checkers and Reporters\n\nThe search results for `__implements__` show it being used and referenced in a deprecated manner within `pylint/interfaces.py` and `pylint/pyreverse/inspector.py`. The comments suggest moving away from `__implements__` towards standard inheritance patterns, indicating a shift in how interfaces should be utilized within the codebase.\n\n1. **Functionality**: The existing code snippets use `__implements__` to check if objects implement certain interfaces, a pattern now considered deprecated.\n2. **Relation to Bug**: The issue mentions moving away from the non-standard use of `__implements__` towards a more standard approach using `ABCMeta` for type-checking. This directly addresses the need to refactor these parts of the code.\n3. **Intended Behavior**: After refactoring, instances should instead be checked for their compliance with interfaces through `isinstance` checks enabled by the use of `ABCMeta`, aligning with the deprecation warnings found.\n\n#### `PyLinter` Categorization of Checkers\n\nWhile the method `categorize_checkers` could not be found (indicating either it does not exist or is named differently), the search result for the `PyLinter` class reveals several methods related to checker management and registration, such as `register_checker` and `get_checkers`. This gives a glimpse into how `PyLinter` currently handles checkers and possibly reporters.\n\n1. **Functionality**: `PyLinter` manages checkers primarily through registration, and possibly through categorization internal processes not directly revealed by the method names.\n2. **Relation to Bug**: The issue suggests modifying this mechanism to use a more standard approach (via `ABCMeta` and `isinstance`) for better extensibility and compliance with Python's standard practices.\n3. **Intended Behavior**: `PyLinter` would need modifications to recognize checker and reporter classes based on their compliance with abstract base classes (using `ABCMeta`), potentially improving the way these components are dynamically recognized and managed.\n\n#### Use of `ABCMeta`\n\nThe snippets containing `ABCMeta` from various checker utility files indicate its current usage within the project but not necessarily in the context of checker/reporter categorization as described in the issue.\n\n1. **Functionality**: The current snippets show `ABCMeta` is already being used in various parts of the code, suggesting familiarity with abstract base classes within the project.\n2. **Relation to Bug**: These snippets serve as examples of `ABCMeta` use but do not directly address how checkers/reporters are categorized which is the core of the issue.\n3. **Intended Behavior**: Leveraging `ABCMeta` for checker/reporter interfaces would standardize how these components are defined and recognized, aligning with the direction suggested by the deprecation warning around `__implements__`. \n\n### Additional Context Needed\n\nGiven the analysis, additional context might be needed in the form of:\n- Specifics on how checkers/reporters are currently identified and categorized, since `categorize_checkers` wasn't found, requiring an alternative approach or more exploration into `PyLinter`'s methods.\n- Examples of checker/reporter classes to understand how they could transition from using `__implements__` to being defined with `ABCMeta`.\n\n**Suggested Next Steps**:\n- Dive deeper into the implementations of checkers/reporters to see how they are currently structured around `__implements__`.\n- Explore further into `PyLinter` or relevant parts of the codebase that handle the logical grouping or processing of checkers/reporters, potentially uncovering alternative mechanisms used for their management that were not captured by the initial search for `categorize_checkers`."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

        "content": "1. \n\n2. \n   - **Location 1**: File: `pylint/lint/pylinter.py`, Class: `PyLinter`\n     - **Intended Behavior**: To resolve the issue, `PyLinter` needs to incorporate logic to utilize `isinstance` checks for the categorization of checkers and reporters, in addition to any current methodology. Specifically, it should use abstract base classes defined with `ABCMeta` for these `isinstance` checks. This means modifying the `register_checker` method to validate checker classes against abstract checker interfaces using `isinstance`. Also, wherever checkers or reporters are processed or categorized, these `isinstance` checks need to be incorporated. This modification preserves the existing functionality of categorization while extending compatibility for plugin development and easing the transition away from the deprecated `__implements__` attribute.\n\n   - **Location 2**: File: `pylint/interfaces.py`\n     - **Intended Behavior**: This file likely needs updating or creation of new abstract classes for checker and reporter interfaces using `ABCMeta` from the `abc` module. These abstract classes will serve as the basis for the `isinstance` checks in `PyLinter`. This update is crucial for moving away from the deprecated `__implements__` system to a more standardized approach. Each interface should define abstract methods that are essential for their respective checkers or reporters, focusing on what methods a checker/reporter must implement to be compatible with `PyLinter`.\n\nThese modifications collectively address the issue's proposal: to replace the non-standard `__implements__` with a standardized interface check utilizing Python's `ABCMeta`. This enhancement should be implemented in a backward-compatible manner, ensuring that existing plugins using `__implements__` continue to work while encouraging the adoption of the new method."
