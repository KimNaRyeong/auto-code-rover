How checkers and reporters are defined, specifically looking at the `__implements__` attribute.\n3. Existing interfaces that would need changing to `ABCMeta` metaclass.\n\nTherefore, the necessary API calls would be:\n\n- `search_code(\"__implements__\")`: This will help find how the `__implements__` attribute is currently used in checkers and reporters.\n- `search_class(\"PyLinter\")`: To understand how the PyLinter class is structured and potentially find where it categorizes checkers.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"categorize_checkers\", \"PyLinter\")`: Assuming a method like `categorize_checkers` exists based on the issue description, this would help see how PyLinter currently processes checkers. If this method does not exist, the call might need adjustment based on the exact method names found in the PyLinter class.\n- `search_code(\"ABCMeta\")`: To check if there are already some uses of `ABCMeta` that can serve as a reference for making changes."
