        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to investigate how the `bar` and `barh` methods handle the `bottom` and `left` parameters, especially in the context of datetime objects. This would involve looking into the matplotlib codebase where these methods are defined and understanding the current handling mechanism for these parameters. Given this, the following API calls will help gather the necessary context to resolve the issue:\n\n- `search_method(\"bar\")`: This call aims to find where the `bar` method is defined in the matplotlib codebase. Since the issue describes a bug in how `bar` method treats datetime objects, knowing where this method is implemented will provide a starting point for our investigation.\n\n- `search_method(\"barh\")`: Similar to the `bar` method, this call will help identify where the `barh` method is defined. The bug description indicates that both `bar` and `barh` methods are affected, so understanding the implementation of `barh` is just as crucial.\n\n- `search_code(\"ax.bar\")`: By searching for code snippets that include `ax.bar`, we aim to find examples or instances in the codebase where the `bar` function is used. This might provide insights into how datetime parameters are currently being handled or examples of expected usage patterns.\n\n- `search_code(\"ax.barh\")`: Similar to the above, this search aims to find examples or instances of `ax.barh` usage in the codebase. Insights from these examples could highlight how datetime objects are supposed to interact with the `barh` method, pointing towards the potential gap in the implementation.\n\nThese searches will help us understand both how `bar` and `barh` are supposed to handle datetime objects according to current usage within the codebase and where potential modifications might be necessary to fix the reported bug."
