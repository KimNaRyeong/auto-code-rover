To accurately address the issue as described, wherein Sphinx does not inherit documentation for a class method that has been overridden in a subclass without an explicitly set docstring, we will modify the approach. Here, we'll simulate the Sphinx documentation generation process in the `reproducer.py` script.

This task involves using Sphinx programmatically to generate documentation for the given Python classes (`Parent` and `Child`) and then inspecting the generated documentation to verify if the `Child` class's method docstring is inherited from the `Parent` class's method. The script will assert the presence of the inherited docstring in the generated documentation, thereby reproducing the issue accurately if the assertion fails (i.e., if the documentation for `Child.method` isn't automatically inherited from `Parent.method`).

```python
import os
import sys
import sphinx.application
import sphinx.config
import sphinx.project
import sphinx.builders
import docutils.utils

def setup_sphinx(srcdir, confdir, outdir, doctreedir):
    """

    """
    confoverrides = {}
    status = sys.stdout
    warning = sys.stderr
    freshenv = True
    warningiserror = True
    tags = []

    app = sphinx.application.Sphinx(
        srcdir, confdir, outdir, doctreedir, "html",
        confoverrides, status, warning, freshenv,
        warningiserror, tags)
    return app

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)

    app = setup_sphinx(srcdir, confdir, outdir, doctreedir)

**Note**: Before running this script, ensure that your environment is properly set up for Sphinx, including having Sphinx installed (`pip install sphinx`) and accessible in your Python environment.

This script sets up a minimal Sphinx environment programmatically, mimics the generation of documentation for the specified module (`spam` with `Parent` and `Child` classes), and checks whether the documentation for `Child.method()` correctly includes the documentation from `Parent.method()`. If not, the assertion will fail, reproducing the described issue.
