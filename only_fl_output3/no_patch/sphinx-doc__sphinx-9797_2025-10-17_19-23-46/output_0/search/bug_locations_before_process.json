The configuration might involve setting autodoc_inherit_docstrings to True explicitly if it's not the default or already. Additionally, if Sphinx does not natively support inheriting documentation for class methods in all scenarios desired by the project, consider implementing a custom Sphinx extension or configuration that forces documentation inheritance. This could involve hooking into Sphinx's event system (e.g., using app.connect in conf.py to connect to the autodoc-process-docstring event) to programmatically inspect and possibly modify docstrings for inherited methods to ensure they include the desired inherited documentation."
