For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Given the inability to locate the specified files or configurations in the codebase based on the issue and the results of the API calls, we cannot pinpoint exact bug locations or provide an informed intended behavior without making assumptions. However, theoretically speaking, if we had been able to find the classes and the Sphinx configuration, the intended behavior would involve:\n\n- **Location 1:**\n    - **File:** This would typically be `src/spam.py`, assuming that's where the `Parent` and `Child` classes should be defined.\n    - **Class:** `Child`\n    - **Method:** `method`\n    - **Intended Behavior:** The overridden `method` in the `Child` class should automatically inherit the documentation from the `Parent` class's `method` unless explicitly redefined. This requires either configuration at the Sphinx level or a Python-level solution that explicitly checks and copies documentation for class methods when they are inherited. Since Sphinx `'autodoc'` does not do this by default for methods without explicit docstrings, a potential fix could be to enhance the `autodoc` extension or the project's use of it to ensure it checks for parent class documentation and applies it where missing in the child class.\n\nWithout precise file paths, class names, or method implementations, it's necessary to either locate the correct files and configurations via broader or revised search strategies or to review the project's use of Sphinx and Python's documentation inheritance features to identify the gap between current behavior and the issue's expectations."
