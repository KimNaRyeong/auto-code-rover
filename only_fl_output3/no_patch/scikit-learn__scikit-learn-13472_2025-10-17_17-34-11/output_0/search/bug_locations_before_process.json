        "intended_behavior": "This method's handling of the initial estimator's `fit` call should explicitly support passing `sample_weight` as an optional keyword argument. This adjustment ensures compatibility with estimators or pipelines that may expect `sample_weight` in their `fit` method signatures. The intended change should not affect the existing functionality for other initial estimators that do not use `sample_weight`. The code should conditionally include `sample_weight` in the `fit` parameters if it is not `None`, possibly by checking if the initial estimator's `fit` method accepts it, ensuring backward compatibility and adhering to the dynamic nature of potential initial estimators."
