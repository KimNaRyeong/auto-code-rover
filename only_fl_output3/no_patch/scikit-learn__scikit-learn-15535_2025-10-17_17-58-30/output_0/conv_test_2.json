        "content": "Certainly! To clarify, the prior example intended to demonstrate how to dynamically catch exceptions and print detailed tracebacks specifically in the context of a regression in input validation for clustering metrics within the sklearn package, specifically involving the `mutual_info_score` function.\n\nGiven the standard error from your last run, it appeared that there was an issue related to your Python environment, specifically a missing module within scikit-learn which indicates a potentially incomplete installation rather than the script itself failing to reproduce the intended issue.\n\nEnsuring you have a properly installed scikit-learn environment is crucial. The error message suggested running `python setup.py install` within the scikit-learn directory if you compiled from source or ensuring your installation matches your Python version and platform if you used a precompiled version.\n\nAssuming you've resolved environment and installation issues, below is a reiterated or clarified version of the `reproducer.py` script designed to raise an `AssertionError` when the regression issue is detected (i.e., input validation fails as described), and exit gracefully when the issue is fixed. It's structured to directly address your request including a concise and clear traceback function as you've specified.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics.cluster import mutual_info_score\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef run_test():\n    try:\n        # The case that previously worked in version 0.21.1 without warning\n        x = np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20).astype(object)\n        mutual_info_score(x, x)\n        # If no exception is raised, the script exits with code 0 indicating the issue is fixed\n        print(\"The test passed without exception, indicating the issue is fixed.\")\n        exit(0)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        # If an exception is caught, we raise an AssertionError indicating the issue is present\n        raise AssertionError(\"The issue with input validation of clustering metrics is still present.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    run_test()\n```\n\nThis script is ready to be placed in the root directory of a project for execution. It is specifically crafted to demonstrate the issue with `mutual_info_score` where passing object-dtyped numpy arrays triggers an exception, which should not occur. The handling for the scenario without `.astype(object)` that should work with a warning (not shown in this script) might require a different approach or further clarification on how to handle warnings in your context."
