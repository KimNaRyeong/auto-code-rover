This script attempts to reproduce the reported issue by first trying the problematic case where `.astype(object)` is used, which is expected to directly cause an exception if the regression exists, and second, by testing without `.astype(object)` to check if a warning is appropriately raised without causing a failure. The use of `print_stacktrace` function will ensure that any exceptions caught will have their stacktrace printed out detailing where the error occured.
