        "content": "To tackle the issue related to the `mutual_info_score` function within the `sklearn.metrics.cluster` module, the following API searches would be helpful to gather the required context for resolving the issue:\n\n1. Since the issue is with the `mutual_info_score` function, it is logical to start by searching for this method to understand its current implementation and any recent changes that might have introduced the regression. Therefore, an appropriate API call would be:\n    - `search_method(\"mutual_info_score\")`\n\n2. The issue mentions a change in behavior between versions, specifically related to how input validation handles `object` dtype arrays. As such, it would be useful to investigate how input validation is performed within the `mutual_info_score` function or any utility functions it relies on. This suggests looking into the code that performs input validation or any related utility methods that might contribute to the problem. Therefore, relevant API calls might include:\n    - `search_code(\"check_array\")`\n    - `search_code(\"as_float_array\")`\n\nThese searches aim to provide a comprehensive view of `mutual_info_score`'s implementation, particularly concerning input validation, and to reveal any utility functions that could be affecting its behavior when handling arrays of `object` dtype."
