        "intended_behavior": "The `mutual_info_score` method should correctly handle inputs of `dtype=object` without raising a `ValueError`. Given the function used to accept such input in version 0.21.1, it should either convert the `object` dtype inputs into a suitable numeric format for processing or, if conversion is not feasible, provide a clear and informative warning instead of throwing an error. The fix may involve adjusting pre-processing steps to ensure compatibility with non-numeric inputs or revisiting any changes made to input validation routines since version 0.21.1 that may have inadvertently restricted the flexibility of accepted data types.\n\nThis approach aims to restore the method's ability to accept a broader range of input types, as was the case in earlier versions, while maintaining or enhancing error messaging for better user guidance. The correction should ensure backward compatibility and preserve the utility's general functionality for diverse inputs."
