Given the instructions and the need for a script that accurately reproduces the issue discussed, creating `reproducer.py` with the given stack trace printing function and specific checks for the issue in question is straightforward. This script is designed to test the behavior of mutual information score computation from scikit-learn when given numpy arrays of object data type, reflecting the regression in input validation since version 0.21.1.

The script below aims to check whether the issue (where the function fails with a ValueError when the input is an object type) still persists. If the mutual information score functionality does not work as expected (raising an exception for object-typed inputs), it prints the stack trace of the exception. Conversely, if the code runs without issues, it signals that the problem might have been addressed in the version of scikit-learn being used.

Here is how the `reproducer.py` file would look:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.cluster import mutual_info_score

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        x = np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20).astype(object)
        mutual_info_score(x, x)
        print("No issues detected.")
        exit(0) # Exit with code 0 indicating no error
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Detected the issue with input validation of clustering metrics.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script directly addresses the request to produce an AssertionError when the issue is present and to exit cleanly when resolved. It also incorporates the stack trace printing function as provided. With this, you have a reliable method to reproduce the stated issue and validate its resolution across different versions of scikit-learn.
