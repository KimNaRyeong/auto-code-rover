This entails modifying the scheme validation or processing segment within this method to either recognize custom schemes or to follow a default, HTTP-like parameter handling process for schemes not explicitly recognized.

This could involve introducing a dynamically updatable registry of scheme-handling adapters or a default processing path for schemes that don't match any of the existing adapters but are intended to be treated as HTTP-like. This approach would preserve the method\u2019s current capability while extending its utility to cover custom schemes, thus ensuring that requests involving such schemes are not incorrectly processed or denied due to a lack of adapter match.\n\nThese changes aim to ensure the requests library can handle URLs with custom schemes appropriately, particularly in terms of parameter inclusion, without disrupting the handling of standard HTTP/HTTPS URLs.
