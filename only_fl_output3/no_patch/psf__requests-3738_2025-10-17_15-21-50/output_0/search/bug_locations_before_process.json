        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, prepare_url should be adjusted or extended to ensure parameters are correctly handled and appended to URLs with custom or unrecognized schemes. This entails modifying the scheme validation or processing segment within this method to either recognize custom schemes or to follow a default, HTTP-like parameter handling process for schemes not explicitly recognized. This behavior should maintain the existing functionality for known schemes (e.g., http, https) while providing a mechanism for custom schemes to be included in parameter handling logic."

        "intended_behavior": "The get_adapter method needs to be enhanced to provide a fallback option or a registration system for custom URL schemes, allowing such URLs to be processed similarly to HTTP/HTTPS schemes. This could involve introducing a dynamically updatable registry of scheme-handling adapters or a default processing path for schemes that don't match any of the existing adapters but are intended to be treated as HTTP-like. This approach would preserve the method\u2019s current capability while extending its utility to cover custom schemes, thus ensuring that requests involving such schemes are not incorrectly processed or denied due to a lack of adapter match."
