This may break some more benign uses such as `http+unix`, which wanted to add parameters to their URLs.\nWhile this is inline with our intended policies (we do not understand URLs that have schemes we don't know anything about), this, along with the IDNA behaviour in v2.12.{0,1} will probably have broken a whole bunch of people using these non-standard URL schemes.\nWe should consider whether Session objects should have a registry of places to look for URL preparation based on scheme. This will allow people to opt-in to the HTTP-like processing of URLs, as well as to register their own.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need context about how URLs and their parameters are handled within the project, especially with respect to the `requests` library. We're looking for how different URL schemes are understood and processed, and more specifically, changes in handling parameters in URLs with schemes that are not immediately recognizable by the library. The issue also mentions the possibility of introducing a registry for URL preparation based on scheme in `Session` objects, implying modifications or enhancements to the `Session` class and related URL handling mechanisms. Let's collect information relevant to these aspects:\n\n1. **Session Class Context**: Since the issue talks about the possibility of augmenting `Session` objects with a registry for URL preparation, we need to examine the current structure of the `Session` class.\n    - `search_class(class_name: \"Session\")`\n\n2. **Changes in URL Parameter Handling**: The exact mechanism or method(s) in the `requests` library where parameters are added to URLs needs to be identified. This is likely where the bug fix would be applied.\n    - `search_method(method_name: \"prepare_request\")`\n    - `search_method(method_name: \"add_params\")`  # This is a guess. There might not be a method named exactly like this, but it's worth checking for anything similar.\n\n3. **URL Scheme Handling**: Understanding how the library checks or parses URL schemes will give insight into where the oversight in parameter handling for unrecognized schemes occurred.\n    - `search_code(code_str: \"schemes\")`\n    - `search_code(code_str: \"url.lower().startswith('http')\")`  # This is to find code handling only HTTP/HTTPS schemes.\n\n4. **Registry Mechanism for URL Preparation**: Checking existing mechanisms or hooks that allow for processing based on URL scheme will give an indication of where new functionalities could be integrated.\n    - `search_method(method_name: \"get_adapter\")`\n\nThese searches aim to gather a broad context around the handling of URLs, sessions, and the introduction of a scheme registry within the `requests` library. This data will then aid in determining the best approach to resolve the issue while considering backward compatibility and future extensibility."
