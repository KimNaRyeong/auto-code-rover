This may break some more benign uses such as `http+unix`, which wanted to add parameters to their URLs.\nWhile this is inline with our intended policies (we do not understand URLs that have schemes we don't know anything about), this, along with the IDNA behaviour in v2.12.{0,1} will probably have broken a whole bunch of people using these non-standard URL schemes.\nWe should consider whether Session objects should have a registry of places to look for URL preparation based on scheme.

We're looking for how different URL schemes are understood and processed, and more specifically, changes in handling parameters in URLs with schemes that are not immediately recognizable by the library. The issue also mentions the possibility of introducing a registry for URL preparation based on scheme in `Session` objects, implying modifications or enhancements to the `Session` class and related URL handling mechanisms. Let's collect information relevant to these aspects:\n\n1. **Session Class Context**: Since the issue talks about the possibility of augmenting `Session` objects with a registry for URL preparation, we need to examine the current structure of the `Session` class.\n    - `search_class(class_name: \"Session\")`\n\n2. **Changes in URL Parameter Handling**: The exact mechanism or method(s) in the `requests` library where parameters are added to URLs needs to be identified.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides significant insight into how the `requests` library handles sessions, URL preparation, scheme recognition, and adapter assignment. Now, let's address the questions based on the gathered data.\n\n### 1. Session Class and prepare_request Method\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `Session` class in `requests/sessions.py` is a central part of the library, managing requests settings and contexts, such as headers, cookies, and proxies. Among its methods, `prepare_request` stands out as it constructs a `PreparedRequest` object from a `Request` instance, applying configurations from the `Session`. This involves merging cookies, setting authentication, choosing parameters, headers, and other request options.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nThe issue mentions that requests v2.12.2 does not add parameters to URLs with unrecognized schemes. The `prepare_request` function, part of the `Session` class, seems to be deeply involved in how parameters are handled. However, upon review, it is clear that `prepare_request` merges parameters from the session and the request correctly, suggesting the bug may not directly originate here.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nGiven the issue, the intended behavior would be to ensure that when a URL with an unrecognized scheme is processed, it still correctly incorporates query parameters, assuming it follows HTTP-like semantics. This suggests that the logic specific to URL scheme processing or the decision to include parameters based on the scheme might need to be revisited elsewhere.\n\n### 2. Scheme Recognition and get_adapter Method\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `get_adapter` method in the `Session` class determines which connection adapter to use based on the URL's scheme. Adapters are responsible for handling request sending and receiving, and each adapter could potentially handle different schemes.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nThe issue at hand is about the library not adding parameters for unrecognized URL schemes. The `get_adapter` method checks if a URL's scheme matches any of the registered adapters and throws an error if none match. This mechanism is possibly where unrecognized schemes are filtered out, which could relate to how parameters are handled for such URLs.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nIdeally, `get_adapter` or a related system should offer a way to register or recognize HTTP-like but non-standard URL schemes (such as `http+unix`) so that they too can have parameters added. It suggests the necessity of a more flexible scheme handling system or a mechanism to opt-in for HTTP-like processing for custom schemes.\n\n### Further Context Needed\n\nGiven the understanding that the direct handling of URL parameters in relation to URL schemes may not be fully encapsulated within the explored parts, we should look deeper into how schemes are recognized and validated throughout the request preparation and sending process. This could involve:\n\n1. **Further exploring `adapters.py`**: Since adapters are key to how requests are sent and how schemes are recognized, analyzing the adapter registration and lookup mechanism might provide insights into how to introduce a registry for custom URL scheme handling.\n   \n2. **Investigating scheme validation logic**: We need to understand where exactly the library decides whether or not to append parameters based on the scheme. Since the `url.lower().startswith('http')` search did not yield results, an alternative approach to reviewing `utils.py` and `models.py` where URLs are parsed and prepared might uncover this logic.\n\nThe issue suggests a need for a nuanced approach to managing \"unrecognized\" URL schemes, especially those meant to be treated similarly to HTTP/HTTPS. Thus, a refined investigation into how `requests` manages scheme recognition, adapter assignment, and parameter inclusion across these identified components is essential for forming a solution."

To resolve the issue, this method could be enhanced to include a fallback mechanism or a registration system for unrecognized schemes that are intended to be treated as HTTP-like. This way, it would not strictly reject or mishandle URLs with such schemes. Specifically, a registry within the `Session` class could be introduced where developers can register custom schemes as HTTP-like, and `get_adapter` would then check this registry if no direct match is found.

The goal would be ensuring parameters are appropriately attached to URLs regardless of the scheme, provided the scheme is registered or recognized as HTTP-like per the new system proposed. This would require a more nuanced check than currently presented, possibly before or during URL preparation, to ensure HTTP-like schemes, even if custom, don't lose their parameters. Without specific methods called out from the initial context, the action here is speculative but aims at the heart of the issue described.\n\nThese locations and intended behaviors focus on introducing flexibility and extensibility in handling custom or unrecognized schemes in a way that respects the library's design while addressing the issue at hand."

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\nThe search results offer valuable insights particularly from `requests/models.py` and `requests/sessions.py`, which are core to understanding how the `requests` library processes URLs and manages connection adapters for making HTTP requests.\n\n#### requests/models.py: prepare and prepare_url\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `prepare` method within `models.py` seems to be responsible for preparing a request for being sent over the network, which likely includes validating and encoding the URL, among other responsibilities.\n   - The `prepare_url` method appears to be directly involved in URL validation and preparation, likely including parsing and potentially modifying URLs before they are used in a request.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug**\n   - Given the bug report talks about requests not adding parameters to URLs with schemes it doesn't recognize, `prepare_url` is potentially a key location where the library determines how to process URLs based on their schema. This method could be where parameters are either included or excluded based on the perceived scheme.\n\n3. **Intended behavior**\n   - The intended behavior would enable the library to handle parameters for URLs with custom or less common schemes, akin to how it manages 'http' or 'https' schemes. This could mean adjusting how `prepare_url` parses and prepares URLs, enabling it to recognize custom schemes (or allow users to specify how such schemes should be treated), ensuring parameters are appropriately appended.\n\n#### requests/sessions.py: Adapters and get_adapter\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The references to adapters outside of functions indicate setup or configuration steps for how the `Session` class manages its connection adapters.\n   - The `__init__` function initializes `Session` objects, likely setting up default adapters among other settings.\n   - `get_adapter` retrieves the appropriate connection adapter for a given URL scheme, as seen from the previous context gather step.\n   - `close` might clean up resources associated with adapters.\n   - `mount` allows attaching a new adapter for a specific service or scheme, providing extensibility in how different URL schemes are handled.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug**\n   - The bug regarding not adding parameters to URLs with unrecognized schemes might involve how `get_adapter` determines the appropriate adapter based on a URL's scheme, which in turn could affect how URLs are processed and parameters are appended.\n   - The `mount` function\u2019s ability to add support for additional schemes suggests a potential pathway for fixing the bug, by allowing custom schemes to be treated similarly to first-class citizens like HTTP or HTTPS schemes.\n\n3. **Intended behavior**\n   - To address the issue, `get_adapter` and possibly other adapter-related logic could allow for more flexible handling of unrecognized schemes. This could involve a registry or a more sophisticated decision-making process that could default to handling unrecognized schemes in a manner similar to HTTP if configured by the user.\n   - The system could also provide hooks or an API for registering custom URL scheme handlers, including how to manage parameters for such schemes. This would naturally extend the utility of `mount` by making it part of the solution, enabling users to specify custom behavior for custom schemes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis underscores the need for the `requests` library to adopt a more flexible and extensible approach to handling URL schemes, with specific focus needed on URL preparation in `models.py` and adapter management in `sessions.py`. To resolve the bug while preserving existing functionality, the library would benefit from augmenting its scheme recognition and parameter handling logic to inclusively recognize and process non-standard but HTTP-like URL schemes."

This entails modifying the scheme validation or processing segment within this method to either recognize custom schemes or to follow a default, HTTP-like parameter handling process for schemes not explicitly recognized. This behavior should maintain the existing functionality for known schemes (e.g., http, https) while providing a mechanism for custom schemes to be included in parameter handling logic.\n  \n- **Bug Location 2**: \n  - **File**: `requests/sessions.py`\n  - **Method**: `get_adapter`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: The `get_adapter` method needs to be enhanced to provide a fallback option or a registration system for custom URL schemes, allowing such URLs to be processed similarly to HTTP/HTTPS schemes. This could involve introducing a dynamically updatable registry of scheme-handling adapters or a default processing path for schemes that don't match any of the existing adapters but are intended to be treated as HTTP-like. This approach would preserve the method\u2019s current capability while extending its utility to cover custom schemes, thus ensuring that requests involving such schemes are not incorrectly processed or denied due to a lack of adapter match.\n\nThese changes aim to ensure the requests library can handle URLs with custom schemes appropriately, particularly in terms of parameter inclusion, without disrupting the handling of standard HTTP/HTTPS URLs. This would address the issue by enabling the library to treat specified or recognized non-standard schemes as \u201cHTTP-like\u201d for the purpose of preparing and sending requests."
