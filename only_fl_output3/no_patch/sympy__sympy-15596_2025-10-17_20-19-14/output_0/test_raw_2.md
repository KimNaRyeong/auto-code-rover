This script intends to deliberately raise an `AssertionError` to signal the presence of the issue with computing the degree of a rational function directly with `degree((x-2)/(x**2+1), x)`. It has been modified to explicitly express that an error is anticipated due to the unexpected behavior in SymPy's `degree` function when handling rational functions. The script exits with code 0 if the erroneous behavior is captured, indicating the issue exists as described. Conversely, if an error is not raised where expected, it suggests a change or fix in SymPy's behavior, leading to the script's normal exit indicating potential resolution of the original issue.
