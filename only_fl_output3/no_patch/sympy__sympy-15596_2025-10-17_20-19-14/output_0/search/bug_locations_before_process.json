        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `degree` method to accurately handle rational functions. Specifically, the function should: Check if the input `f` is a division of two expressions, with both the numerator and the denominator being polynomials. This can be done by examining the structure of `f` and determining if it matches a rational function form. If `f` is identified as a rational function, compute the degree of both the numerator and the denominator separately. The degree of the rational function should be calculated as the degree of the numerator minus the degree of the denominator. This requires adjusting the logic within the `degree` function to not only convert inputs into polynomial form (as is currently done), but also to identify and correctly process rational functions. This modification should preserve the existing functionality for inputs that are not rational functions, ensuring that the degree function continues to work correctly for simple polynomials and other forms that it currently supports."
