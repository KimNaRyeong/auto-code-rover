This is because `polytools.py` is likely to contain general polynomial tools, including functions for computing degrees, which would be directly related to the issue at hand.\n\n   - **Relation to the Bug:** The use of the `degree` function on a rational function should ideally consider the numerator and denominator separately to compute the degree as the difference between the degree of the numerator and the degree of the denominator. The current behavior, as described in the issue, does not reflect this and may indicate that the handling of rational functions is either not implemented correctly or not considered in the `degree` function.\n\n   - **Intended Behavior:** The intended behavior for computing the degree of a rational function in mathematical terms is to compute the degree of the numerator minus the degree of the denominator. This should be considered when the `degree` function is called with a rational function as its argument.\n\n2. **Considering the Absence of Results from `search_code(\"degree((x-2)/(x**2+1), x)\")`:**\n\n   The absence of exact matches for the usage of `degree` with a rational function suggests that either this specific usage is not tested or the feature indeed might not have been considered in the implementation. This absence underscores the necessity to delve deeper into how rational functions are handled within the implementation of the `degree` function.\n\n**Next Steps based on Analysis:**\n\nTo gather more specific context around the implementation and potentially identify the cause of the issue or the place for improvement,\n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"degree\", \"sympy/polys/polytools.py\")`: This will help in identifying how `degree` is implemented in what appears to be the most relevant file, given the issue's context.\n\n2. Considering the importance of how rational functions are handled, it may also be useful to examine any mechanisms in place for handling operations on rational functions. However, based on the existing search results, the immediate next step focuses on exploring the implementation details of the `degree` method in `polytools.py`."

When a rational function (an instance of division of two polynomials) is passed to the `degree` function, it should compute the degree as the degree of the numerator polynomial minus the degree of the denominator polynomial. This behavior must be implemented in a way that preserves existing functionality for when the input is a single polynomial. Specifically, this improvement involves:\n     - Checking if the input to the `degree` function is a rational function.\n     - If so, separately compute the degrees of the numerator and denominator polynomials.\n     - Return the difference between these two degrees as the degree of the rational function.\n     \n     This ensures that the degree function can handle a wider variety of inputs correctly, in line with mathematical definitions, without affecting its current handling of singular polynomial inputs.\n"
