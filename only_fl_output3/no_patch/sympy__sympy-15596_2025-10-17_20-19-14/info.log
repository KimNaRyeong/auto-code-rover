When a rational function (an instance of division of two polynomials) is passed to the `degree` function, it should compute the degree as the degree of the numerator polynomial minus the degree of the denominator polynomial. This behavior must be implemented in a way that preserves existing functionality for when the input is a single polynomial. Specifically, this improvement involves: Checking if the input to the `degree` function is a rational function. If so, separately compute the degrees of the numerator and denominator polynomials. Return the difference between these two degrees as the degree of the rational function. This ensures that the degree function can handle a wider variety of inputs correctly, in line with mathematical definitions, without affecting its current handling of singular polynomial inputs."}]
