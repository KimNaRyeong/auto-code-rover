This implies that the method `execute_sql_flush` could be implemented in a backend-specific manner, which is why a direct search for the method in the `DatabaseOperations` class did not yield results. Each database backend (SQLite3, Oracle, Dummy, PostgreSQL, MySQL) might have its own implementation of this method, tailored to the specifics of the database engine.\n\n2. The failure to find the `execute_sql_flush` method directly within the `DatabaseOperations` class suggests two possibilities:\n   - The method might be defined with a slightly different signature than we're searching for, or it exists in a subclass specific to each database backend rather than in a base class.\n   - The method implementation could be dynamic or introduced in a way that makes it difficult to find through direct search.\n\n3. The failure to find instances of `execute_sql_flush(connection.alias, sql_flush)` usage in the codebase suggests that the description provided in the issue might have slightly incorrect details about how the method is called, or the codebase might have undergone changes.\n\nTo move forward, considering these points, we should:\n\n- Make targeted searches in each backend-specific operations file for the `execute_sql_flush` method because it's likely defined differently across backends due to database-specific constraints and needs.\n- Alternatively, given that direct search for usage scenarios of the method did not yield results, the method call might not directly use `connection.alias` as an argument in the form specified. It might be beneficial to relax the search criteria to find relevant method calls. \n\nLet's proceed with these API calls:\n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"execute_sql_flush\", \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/operations.py\")`\n2. `search_method_in_file(\"execute_sql_flush\", \"django/db/backends/oracle/operations.py\")`\n3. `search_method_in_file(\"execute_sql_flush\", \"django/db/backends/dummy/base.py\")`\n4. `search_method_in_file(\"execute_sql_flush\", \"django/db/backends/postgresql/operations.py\")`\n5. `search_method_in_file(\"execute_sql_flush\", \"django/db/backends/mysql/operations.py\")`\n\nThese calls will help us find how `execute_sql_flush` is defined and used in each backend, providing insight into the variations of its signature and usage, which will be crucial for addressing the issue."

Since we could not directly find the implementation details or usage instances of the `execute_sql_flush` method due to limitations in the search results provided, and given the general direction in which the issue description points us, here's an educated guess on the potential locations of the bug based on standard practices and the structure of Django's database backend system:\n\n- **Location 1:**\n  - **File:** `django/db/backends/sqlite3/operations.py`\n  - **Class:** `DatabaseOperations`\n  - **Method:** `execute_sql_flush`\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/db/backends/oracle/operations.py`\n  - **Class:** `DatabaseOperations`\n  - **Method:** `execute_sql_flush`\n- **Location 3:**\n  - **File:** `django/db/backends/postgresql/operations.py`\n  - **Class:** `DatabaseOperations`\n  - **Method:** `execute_sql_flush`\n- **Location 4:**\n  - **File:** `django/db/backends/mysql/operations.py`\n  - **Class:** `DatabaseOperations`\n  - **Method:** `execute_sql_flush`\n- **Location 5:**\n  - **File:** `django/db/backends/dummy/base.py`\n  - **Class:** `DatabaseOperations`\n  - **Method:** `execute_sql_flush`\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\n\nAt each of these locations, the `execute_sql_flush` method's signature should be modified to remove the `using` parameter. Instead of relying on this parameter being passed explicitly, the method should internally use `self.connection.alias` to determine which database connection alias is being used. This change aims to simplify the method signature by removing redundant information that can be derived from the method's object context (`self`).\n\nAfter making this change, it would also be necessary to update all internal usage of these methods across the Django project to match the new method signature. This would involve finding and altering direct calls to `execute_sql_flush` that currently specify a `using` argument, replacing these with calls that only pass the `sql_list` argument.\n\nThe overall goal of this change is to simplify the codebase by reducing the amount of redundant information passed to methods, making the internal API cleaner and easier to maintain."
