The signature variable in this function is expected to match (request, exception) for all handlers except for handler500 which is expected to have only (request). A positional argument, template_name is also present.\nWhile using class based views, we get two positional arguments (self, request) and then it recieves *args and * *kwargs. The check is permitting other handlers as the number of arguments coincidentally match.\nI suggest a fix in the _check_custom_error_handlers which first checks if the handler* are function based or class based, and then it preceed the check with the appropriate number of arguments.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, let's start with finding the function `_check_custom_error_handlers` in the Django codebase since the issue mentions this as the potential source of the bug. Furthermore, we need to understand how Django handles class-based views, specifically the `as_view()` method, to propose an appropriate fix. Let's also search for the class `MyView` to see if there's any specific implementation that might be relevant to the issue at hand.\n\nTherefore, I propose the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"_check_custom_error_handlers\")` to locate the method mentioned in the issue.\n2. `search_method(\"as_view\")` to get context on how class-based views are converted into callable views which Django can use in URL patterns.\n3. `search_class(\"MyView\")` to inspect the implementation of the custom view mentioned in the issue."
