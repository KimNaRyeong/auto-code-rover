        "intended_behavior": "This method should be enhanced to differentiate between function-based and class-based views when checking the number of expected arguments for custom error handlers, especially for `handler500`. Specifically, it needs to recognize when a handler is an instance of a class-based view returned by `as_view()` and adjust the validation logic to account for the implicit `self` argument in class methods as well as the flexibility of `*args` and `**kwargs`. This could involve introducing logic to inspect if the handler function is a bound method of a class and, if so, modify the argument expectation for `handler500` to appropriately validate against the realized view function signature which includes both `self` and `request`. The overall aim is to preserve the existing functionality for function-based handlers while correctly accommodating class-based views without raising a `SystemCheckError` for the `handler500` due to argument count mismatch."
