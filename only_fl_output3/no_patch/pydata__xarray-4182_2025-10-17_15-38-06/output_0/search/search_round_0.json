        "content": "To resolve the issue about expanding data and attributes in DataArray/Variable HTML representations by default, I will need to find where the HTML representations are generated and how the current expanding/collapsing logic is implemented. Based on the issue description:\n\n1. The HTML representation is for `DataArray` and `Variable`.\n2. There's mention of a \"nice repr for nested dask arrays,\" suggesting that `Dask` integration or handling might be involved.\n3. There's a reference to a specific pull request (`https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/3905`) which made the icons more \"manageably sized,\" indicating recent changes to the HTML repr.\n4. The images point to the use of expandable sections, likely controlled by JavaScript or HTML elements designed for interactive display.\n\nGiven this information, my searches will target:\n\n- The classes or methods that generate the HTML representation for `DataArray` and `Variable`.\n- Any specific methods that handle the toggling or default state of these expandable sections.\n\nHere are the relevant API calls I would make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"DataArray\")` - To find the class definition and location.\n2. `search_class(\"Variable\")` - As with DataArray, to find its class definition.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"_repr_html_\", \"DataArray\")` - Assuming `_repr_html_` is a common method name used in Python for generating HTML representations.\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"_repr_html_\", \"Variable\")` - Similar reason as for DataArray.\n5. `search_code(\"expandable section\")` - To look for code snippets responsible for handling expandable sections for attributes and data, given we don't have a clear method name or code reference.\n6. `search_code(\"_repr_html_\")` - To find any instances of HTML representation generation methods, in case they are defined outside the `DataArray` or `Variable` classes.\n\nThese searches should provide enough context about where and how the HTML representations are generated and how the expand/collapse functionality is currently implemented to move towards a solution."
