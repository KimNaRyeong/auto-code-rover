        "intended_behavior": "This file, likely containing the implementation or significant interactions with the Bell numbers, needs to ensure that `bell(n).limit(n, oo)` evaluates correctly to infinity (`oo`). The intended behavior involves adjusting the Bell number implementation or its limit evaluation logic so that it accurately represents the mathematical property of the Bell numbers as their argument approaches infinity. This may involve adding a special case for the limit operation when applied to Bell numbers to return `oo`, ensuring compatibility with the mathematical definition of Bell numbers growing without bound. Adjustments must preserve the existing functionalities for Bell numbers, including their evaluations for finite values of `n` and other operations that may involve them."
