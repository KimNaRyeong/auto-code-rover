This script defines a function to check if the limit of the Bell function as `n` approaches infinity is infinity (`oo` in SymPy). It uses an `assert` statement for this check. If the current behavior (which returns `bell(oo)`) is still present, the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print the stack trace of the issue using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. The script will exit with code 0 only if the issue is fixed, which means the check passes and "Test passed. The issue is fixed." is printed.
