        "content": "Analyzing the provided code snippets from the search API results, we can form a clearer picture of how Django's localization mechanism, particularly the `get_supported_language_variant` function, operates in relation to the reported issue.\n\n### LocaleMiddleware\n\nThe `LocaleMiddleware` class found in `django/middleware/locale.py` is designed to process requests and responses, likely setting or modifying the language used for each request based on certain criteria, though the specific methods like `process_request` and `process_response` were not provided in detail. This middleware plays a crucial role in determining the request's language and thus is directly involved in the issue.\n\n### get_supported_language_variant Function\n\nThe `get_supported_language_variant` from `django/utils/translation/trans_real.py` is the most relevant piece given our context. This function tries to match the language code from a request to the most suitable language variant available in the application's settings. The described logic is as follows:\n\n1. **Accepts a `lang_code` and an optional `strict` parameter:**\n   The function uses these inputs to either strictly or loosely match the language codes provided against supported ones. For our bug, `strict` defaults to `False`, allowing fallbacks.\n\n2. **Fallback Mechanism:**\n   It attempts to find a close match if the exact language variant isn't found, considering generic language codes (like `zh` from `zh-Hant`) and special fallbacks defined in `LANG_INFO`.\n\n3. **Lookup and Matching:**\n   The loop over `possible_lang_codes` checks if the code or its generic form is accepted and supported. If the exact or the generic form isn't supported and `strict` is False, it looks for any supported language that starts with the generic language code (e.g., `zh-`).\n\n### Relationship to the Bug\n\nThe core issue lies within the fallback and matching logic, where despite the existence of `zh-Hant-HK` in the `accept-language` header and presumably in the `settings.LANGUAGES`, the middleware selects `zh-hans` over `zh-hant`, indicating a potential oversight or bug in:\n\n- The prioritization of language variants,\n- Implementation of the fallback mechanism,\n- Or in the matching logic that might not adequately consider all potential matches or the order defined in `settings.LANGUAGES`.\n\n### Intended Behavior\n\nThe expected behavior, as per the issue description, would be for the `get_supported_language_variant` function to correctly recognize `zh-Hant-HK` and select the appropriate `zh-hant` variant when both `zh-hans` and `zh-hant` are present in `settings.LANGUAGES`, respecting their order of definition. The current logic seems to miss this aspect by either incorrectly matching or prioritizing the variants.\n\n### Next Steps for Resolution\n\nA closer examination or adjustment of how `get_supported_language_variant` handles fallbacks and matches language codes, considering the order in `settings.LANGUAGES` and perhaps a more refined approach to picking a variant when multiple choices exist, could be part of the solution. This would ensure more accurate and expected language selection behavior."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

The intended behavior would ensure that the order of languages defined in `settings.LANGUAGES` is respected. This may require either adjusting the logic within the current set of conditions that determine the best match or introducing an additional step or condition that considers the order of language preferences defined by the application. Specifically, the algorithm should better handle regional variants (`zh-Hant-HK` over `zh-Hans`) and give precedence according to the order defined in `settings.LANGUAGES`, without breaking the existing functionality for other language codes."
