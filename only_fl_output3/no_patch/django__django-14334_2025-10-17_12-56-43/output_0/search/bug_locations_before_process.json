The intended behavior would ensure that the order of languages defined in `settings.LANGUAGES` is respected. This may require either adjusting the logic within the current set of conditions that determine the best match or introducing an additional step or condition that considers the order of language preferences defined by the application. Specifically, the algorithm should better handle regional variants (`zh-Hant-HK` over `zh-Hans`) and give precedence according to the order defined in `settings.LANGUAGES`, without breaking the existing functionality for other language codes."
