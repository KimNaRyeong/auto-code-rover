        "intended_behavior": "The `generate_renamed_fields` method should robustly handle the scenario where both a model and its fields are renamed. Specifically, when accessing `self.to_state.models[app_label, old_model_name]`, the method must account for the possibility that `old_model_name` might have been renamed to a new model name in the `to_state`. To resolve the issue, the method should: \n- Before accessing model states by names, verify if the model name has been changed and use the updated name if so. This could involve enhancing the logic that tracks renamed models to ensure it correctly maps old model names to new ones throughout the method, especially before accessing `to_state.models`.\n- Implement a more comprehensive error handling around state accesses to gracefully handle missing models or fields, thereby avoiding abrupt crashes due to `KeyError`.\n- Ensure that when a model and a field within it are renamed simultaneously, these changes are accurately captured and handled in a coordinated manner, possibly by refining the logic that detects these renames so it maintains the correct association between old and new names in `self.to_state`.\n- The existing functionality, including the detection and operation generation for other types of changes (e.g., added or removed models and fields, altered fields, etc.), should remain unaffected while ensuring that the process does not crash due to unhandled rename scenarios."
