        "intended_behavior": "Before performing the `delete_multi` operation on cache keys, the method should iterate through each key and validate it using `self.validate_key(key)` to ensure the key's integrity and conformity to the backend's expectations.

        "intended_behavior": "The `get` method should call `self.validate_key(key)` prior to making the key with `self.make_key(key, version=version)` and attempting to retrieve the item from the cache.

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to the `get` method, `delete` must validate the cache key by invoking `self.validate_key(key)` before constructing the key for deletion. This key validation step ensures that only appropriate and valid keys are being removed from the cache, preventing any unintended deletions based on improper keys."

This ensures the operation is performed on a verified key, upholding the cache's integrity and security according to the backend's rules."
