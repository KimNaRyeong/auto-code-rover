        "intended_behavior": "The instantiation of `CommandParser` within the `execute` method should be modified to utilize the `self.prog_name` value for the `prog` argument instead of implicitly relying on the program name through the `usage` pattern. This ensures that the custom logic for determining `self.prog_name` in the `__init__` method of `ManagementUtility` is respected and used consistently, addressing environments where `sys.argv[0]` might not be accurate. The modification should look roughly as follows, adhering to the proposed solution in the issue:\n       parser = CommandParser(\n           prog=self.prog_name,\n           usage='%(prog)s subcommand [options] [args]',\n           add_help=False,\n           allow_abbrev=False\n       )\n       This change ensures that any manipulations or custom logic applied to `self.prog_name` are correctly reflected in the `CommandParser` instantiation, thereby preserving the existing functionality while also making the command parsing behavior more robust and adaptable to varied runtime environments."
