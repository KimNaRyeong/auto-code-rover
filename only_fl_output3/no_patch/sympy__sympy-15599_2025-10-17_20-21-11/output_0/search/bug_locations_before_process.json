        "intended_behavior": "This method should be enhanced to include logic that identifies and simplifies expressions like Mod(3*i, 2) to Mod(i, 2). Specifically, when the dividend is a product of an integer and a symbol (or another expression) and the divisor is an integer, the method should check if the integer part of the dividend can be factored out to simplify the expression, preserving the existing functionality for all other cases. This involves adding checks and conditions possibly before the more general handling to catch and simplify this and similar patterns."
