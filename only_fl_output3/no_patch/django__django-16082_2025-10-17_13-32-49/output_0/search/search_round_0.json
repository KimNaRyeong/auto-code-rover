        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue described, we need to understand how Django handles numeric expressions, especially when performing a MOD operation with mixed types (Decimal and Integer). Let's outline a strategy for using the search APIs to get relevant code and definitions:\n\n1. Since the issue mentions Django expressions and specifically the handling of MOD operations, we would likely find relevant code in classes or methods that deal with expressions, perhaps something like `Expression` or `Func`, and specifically those that handle mathematical or SQL expressions.\n2. The issue also highlights an inconsistency in type resolution for the result of a MOD operation. Hence, it would be beneficial to look for where Django defines the behavior for the MOD operator. There may be a specific method or class responsible for handling arithmetic operations, possibly named similarly to `Mod` or `ExpressionWrapper`.\n3. Finally, understanding how Django resolves output types for expressions (i.e., decides whether the result should be `Decimal` or `Integer`) will require finding the parts of the Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) that handle type casting or type resolution.\n\nBased on this strategy, we will make the following API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"Expression\")`: To get the definition or usage of a class likely involved in handling expressions.\n- `search_class(\"Func\")`: Since Django's `Func` class is commonly used for SQL functions, including those with arithmetic operations.\n- `search_method(\"resolve_expression\")`: To find how Django resolves expressions and their output types, which might give clues on handling mixed type operations.\n- `search_code(\"MOD\")`: This will help locate where the MOD operation is specifically handled or referenced within Django's ORM or expression handling code.\n\nThese calls should provide a broad starting point for identifying where the issue might be rooted and what parts of the codebase to focus on for a patch."
