        "intended_behavior": "The Mod class should be enhanced to explicitly handle and ensure the output type is a Decimal when any of the operands are of type Decimal. This adjustment might involve customizing the behavior of either the FixDecimalInputMixin or NumericOutputFieldMixin, or introducing new logic within the Mod class itself to check the types of the input operands and set the output_field accordingly. The ultimate goal is to maintain precision in cases where a Decimal is involved in the operation, adhering to the principle of least surprise for the user by preserving the precision expected from Decimal operations."
