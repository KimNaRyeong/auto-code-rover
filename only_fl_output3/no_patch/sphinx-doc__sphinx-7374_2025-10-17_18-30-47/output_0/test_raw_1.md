Unfortunately, my previous attempt didn't properly address the core issue and failed because it doesn't directly test the problem described, which is related to a specific change in the behavior of Sphinx concerning how anchors in Python documentation are generated.

Reproducing this issue in a standalone script implies an assumption that Sphinx is available in the environment where the script is run, and the script must check the generated HTML for anchor format directly. Understanding that my last script failed due to not verifying the Sphinx build output directory correctly, here is a revised attempt that focuses on checking whether Sphinx successfully generated the expected output before attempting access, and more directly addresses checking the anchor format in the generated documentation.

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_project(docs_dir, src_dir):
    # Ensure the directories exist
    os.makedirs(docs_dir, exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs(src_dir, exist_ok=True)

    # Create a minimal Sphinx configuration
    conf_py_content = """\
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../src'))
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',  # Automatically document code
]
project = 'Test Documentation'
master_doc = 'index'
"""
    index_rst_content = """\

   :caption: Contents:

    my_module_py_content = """\
def example_python_function(foo):
    \"\"\"This function does something.

    """
    pass
"""

    # Write files
    with open(os.path.join(docs_dir, "conf.py"), "w") as f:
        f.write(conf_py_content)
    with open(os.path.join(docs_dir, "index.rst"), "w") as f:
        f.write(index_rst_content)
    with open(os.path.join(src_dir, "my_module.py"), "w") as f:
        f.write(my_module_py_content)

def build_and_test_sphinx(docs_dir):
    build_dir = os.path.join(docs_dir, "_build")
    subprocess.run(["sphinx-build", "-b", "html", docs_dir, build_dir], check=True)
    # Check for anchor format in HTML
    with open(os.path.join(build_dir, "index.html"), "r") as f:
        contents = f.read()
        if "example_python_function" not in contents and "example-python-function" in contents:
            print("The issue is present: anchor contains dashes.")
        else:
            raise AssertionError("Test failed: The expected anchor format with dashes is not found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        docs_dir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "docs")
        src_dir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "src")
        setup_sphinx_project(docs_dir, src_dir)
        build_and_test_sphinx(docs_dir)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("Test passed: The issue is fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)
```

This script now correctly does the following:

- Sets up a minimal Sphinx project with a custom module and a function;
- Configures Sphinx for autodocumentation to ensure it will generate function documentation;
- Builds the Sphinx documentation;
- Attempts to verify the presence of the correct anchor format in the generated HTML;
- If it finds the anchor format has changed as described in the issue, it prints a specific message. Otherwise, it raises an AssertionError with a message indicating the expected condition was not met.

Please ensure Sphinx and its dependencies are installed in your environment before running this script. Adjustments may be necessary based on the specific behavior of the Sphinx version you are testing with, as well as other environmental factors.
