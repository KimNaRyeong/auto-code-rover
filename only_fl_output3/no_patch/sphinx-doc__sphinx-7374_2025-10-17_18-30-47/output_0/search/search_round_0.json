        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to the breaking change in Python domain IDs, the following API calls would be ideal:\n\n1. Search for any changes or configurations related to the anchor handling for Python functions. This likely involves finding the method that generates fragment identifiers. We can start with a broader search to find clues about what part of the code might handle these IDs.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"fragment identifier\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the bug description mentions a change that occurred due to a specific change (`#7236`), it would be helpful to search for any code or comments that reference this change. This might lead us directly to the relevant changes for examination.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"#7236\")\n   ```\n\n3. The issue also mentions a conflict with `nbsphinx`, suggesting that the functionality could be related to Sphinx's Python domain handling or its integration/usage by external tools like `nbsphinx`. Searching for references to the Python domain handling in Sphinx will provide insight into where these identifiers are generated or manipulated.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"Python domain\")\n   ```\n\n4. As the expected behavior described in the issue involves generating a fragment identifier that differs from the current behavior, it might be useful to look for methods specifically responsible for generating these identifiers. Assuming there's a specific segment of code responsible for this conversion (underscores to dashes), we need to find it.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"generate fragment identifier\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches should provide a broad yet targeted view of the areas of the codebase that are most likely involved in the reported issue, allowing for a more focused investigation thereafter."
