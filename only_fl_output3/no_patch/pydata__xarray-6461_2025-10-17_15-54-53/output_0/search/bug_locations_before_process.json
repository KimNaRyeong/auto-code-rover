        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the implementation needs to ensure that when keep_attrs=True is specified, the functionality correctly handles scenarios where the second argument is a scalar. Given the lack of attributes in scalar values, the intended behavior should be such that: - If the second argument is a scalar (which by itself cannot have attributes), and keep_attrs=True, the function should not attempt to access non-existent attributes; instead, it should either ignore the attribute-preserving logic for scalars or default to retaining the attributes of the first argument (which is an Xarray object). This logic would specifically need to be implemented in the code path that processes the keep_attrs parameter within the context of the where operation. - Preserve the existing functionality and ensure that if the input arguments can genuinely have attributes (like DataArray or Dataset), those attributes are preserved according to the current logic without breaking the execution. - The change must ensure that existing workflows where keep_attrs is either not specified or set to False remain unaffected. - Error messages or documentation might need updating to clarify the behavior when keep_attrs=True is used with scalar values to help guide users correctly."
