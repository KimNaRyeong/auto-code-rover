        "content": "To address the issue described, I will need to investigate the implementation details of the `where` function and how `keep_attrs` is handled within the Xarray library. Specifically, I want to look into the part of the codebase that threw the `IndexError` when `keep_attrs=True` is used with scalar inputs.\n\nGiven the traceback from the issue, it mentions a failure in handling `keep_attrs` when the `where` function is called, implicating the use of `apply_ufunc` and a lambda function designed to keep the attributes of the second argument. The error occurs around line 1812, according to the provided traceback.\n\nBased on this, I will need the code around the area that failed (around line 1812) to understand how attributes are being handled and to see the context in which `apply_ufunc` is called. Additionally, understanding the implementation of `apply_ufunc` might also be necessary since it's part of the execution flow where the error manifests.\n\nI will make the following API calls:\n\n1. `get_code_around_line(file_path, line_number, window_size)`: To get the context of the code around the line that fails. However, the file path is not provided, which needs to be determined. Typically, this functionality might be located in a file related to computation or utility functions in Xarray.\n\n2. `search_code(\"apply_ufunc\")`: To find files or locations where `apply_ufunc` is defined or used significantly, which might help in identifying the file path needed for the first call.\n\nLet's perform the second operation first to attempt to identify the file path:\n\n- `search_code(\"apply_ufunc\")`"
