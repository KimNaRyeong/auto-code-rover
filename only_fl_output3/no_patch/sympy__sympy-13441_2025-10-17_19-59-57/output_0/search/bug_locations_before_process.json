        "intended_behavior": "The method should aim to simplify the computation or the resulting expressions wherever possible to prevent generating overly complex expressions that exacerbate performance issues in subsequent operations like count_ops. This might involve integrating simplification steps if it doesn't significantly impact the correctness or intended use cases of the method. Additionally, consider algorithmic optimizations that specifically target large systems of equations, possibly including early determination of zero derivatives that could skip unnecessary computations."

        "intended_behavior": "This method should be optimized to handle large and complex expressions more efficiently. This could involve implementing more granular counting methods that better account for the structure of large expressions or introducing heuristic-based or approximate counting for certain types of expressions where an exact count is not strictly necessary. The focus should be on ensuring that count_ops can scale better with expression size without losing accuracy where it matters for the application. Techniques might include caching, divide-and-conquer strategies for expression trees, or special handling for repetitive patterns in expressions."
