This script is designed to reproduce an issue where the operation `count_ops` is suspected to be slow for large expressions within the context of using the `pydy` library, particularly when computing the Jacobian of a system's right-hand side (RHS) for a scenario like the n-link pendulum on a cart with n=4. The script asserts whether the operation takes an excessively long time by setting a generous threshold. Adjust the time threshold in the assertion as necessary to fit the performance expectations of your environment or according to the optimization goals of the codebase.
