Certainly! Here's how you can write a `reproducer.py` to attempt to reproduce the described issue of `count_ops` being slow for large expressions using the Python package `sympy` and `pydy`. This script assumes that the performance issue is related to `count_ops` method slowing down significantly for large expressions, and we're focusing on creating an environment that highlights this issue.

Please note, as your request specifically asks to trigger an `AssertionError` when the issue occurs and expects the script to exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed, this script will time the operation and raise an AssertionError if the operation takes too long. This behavior might be a bit inverse to typical expectations (normally, you'd expect a non-zero exit code on error), but it follows your instructions.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_test():
    from pydy.models import n_link_pendulum_on_cart
    sys = n_link_pendulum_on_cart(4)
    x_dot = sys.eom_method.rhs()

    try:
        import time
        start = time.time()
        x_dot.jacobian(sys.states)
        end = time.time()
        
        elapsed_time = end - start
        print(f"Jacobian computation time: {elapsed_time}")
        
        # Assert if the computation takes more than a threshold, indicating slowness.
        # 300 seconds (5 minutes) is used here as an arbitrary threshold for demonstration; adjust as necessary.
        assert elapsed_time < 300, f"Computation took too long: {elapsed_time} seconds"

    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An unexpected error occurred.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_test()
```

Since the actual computation time that is considered "slow" depends on the context of the issue, you may need to adjust the `assert elapsed_time < 300` line to reflect an appropriate threshold that you'd consider indicative of the issue.

**Important Reminder:**
- Make sure `pydy` and all required dependencies are properly installed in your environment.
- The time threshold (`300` seconds in the example) is arbitrary. The actual acceptable threshold for your use case may vary.
- This script strictly follows your instruction to raise an `AssertionError` when encountering the issue (slow performance) and prints a stack trace to help diagnose the problem.
- Adjusting the parameters within `n_link_pendulum_on_cart(4)` or the threshold may be necessary based on the specifics of the issue and the performance of the computing environment.
