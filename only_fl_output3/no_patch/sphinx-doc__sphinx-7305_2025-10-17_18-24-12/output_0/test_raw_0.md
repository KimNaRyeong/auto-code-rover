This script attempts to programmatically reproduce the reported Sphinx issue by creating a minimal Sphinx project environment, including a rst file with the specific content triggering the error, and running `sphinx-build` to build the documentation. The script checks for the specific error messages in the output of `sphinx-build`. If found, it confirms that the issue is successfully reproduced; otherwise, it raises an assertion error. Note that this script assumes you have Sphinx installed and configured properly in your environment. If the issue is not reproduced because it has been fixed in Sphinx, the assertion will fail, and the absence of the expected error message(s) will indicate that the problem has been resolved.
