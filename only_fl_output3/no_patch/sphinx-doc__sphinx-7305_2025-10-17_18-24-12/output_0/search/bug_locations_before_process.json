        "intended_behavior": "The method `handle_signature` should be enhanced to correctly parse and handle binary operations like `2**4` within argument lists of Python object signatures without falling back to `_pseudo_parse_arglist` or raising unnecessary warnings. This can likely be achieved by improving the `_parse_arglist` function or the mechanism that `_parse_arglist` uses to interpret binary operations in default values. The `handle_signature` method should thus preserve its existing functionality of parsing Python signatures, while also accurately recognizing and processing expressions with binary operations in them."

        "intended_behavior": "This function presumably attempts to parse argument lists for Python objects. However, given the bug, it appears unable to process argument lists containing binary operations (e.g., `a=2**4`). Thus, the intended behavior would be to update `_parse_arglist` to correctly parse expressions containing binary operations as default values in the argument lists. The enhancement should allow `_parse_arglist` to not only detect and interpret binary operations but also to integrate them correctly into the Sphinx documentation output, without resorting to warning logs for unhandled expressions."
