        "intended_behavior": "This method should be modified to ensure that only settings with uppercase names are allowed to be configured. The method could iterate over the options dictionary keys and check if each key is uppercase using isupper(). If a key is not in uppercase, the method could either skip setting that option with a warning or raise a configuration error, thereby preventing the setting of non-uppercase settings. This approach maintains the existing functionality for valid settings while disallowing settings that do not adhere to the documented requirement of being uppercase."
