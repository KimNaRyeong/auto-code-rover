        "content": "Given the feedback, it appears the initial attempt to reproduce the issue included an early call to `django.setup()` which is not necessary for this scenario and led to a configuration error. As the focus is on `settings.configure()` allowing non-uppercase settings, let's adjust the strategy:\n\n1. We will avoid calling `django.setup()` as it's not required for this issue's reproduction.\n2. We will directly call `settings.configure()` with non-uppercase settings, as the issue's description suggests.\n3. The script will handle the case more correctly without Django's full setup process interfering.\n\nHere's a revised version of the `reproducer.py`:\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\ndef main():\n    try:\n        import types\n        from django.conf import settings\n\n        # Configure settings with non-uppercase attributes.\n        settings.configure(types.SimpleNamespace(FOO=\"bar\"), BAZ=\"qux\")\n\n        # Check for uppercase setting as correctly configured.\n        assert hasattr(settings, 'FOO'), \"Uppercase setting FOO is missing.\"\n        # Try retrieving a non-uppercase setting, expecting an AttributeError.\n        try:\n            foo_value = settings.FOO\n        except AttributeError:\n            pass  # This is the expected behavior for uppercase settings.\n        else:\n            # If no AttributeError occurs, this means non-uppercase settings retrieval did not behave as expected.\n            assert False, \"Successfully retrieved an uppercase setting which is against expectations.\"\n        \n        # No exceptions mean the issue has been resolved.\n        print(\"No issue detected. Settings behaved as expected.\")\n\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        # If an AssertionError is caught, it means the test correctly detected the issue.\n        import sys\n        print(\"Issue detected.\", file=sys.stderr)\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating the script functioned as intended.\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        # For any other unexpected exception, print a custom stack trace.\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis revised script focuses strictly on `settings.configure()` allowing the configuration of non-uppercase settings and attempts to retrieve them, which is corrected to reflect expectations better and the aim of reproducing the specified issue."
