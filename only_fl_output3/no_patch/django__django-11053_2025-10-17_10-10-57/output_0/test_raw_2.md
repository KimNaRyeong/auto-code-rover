I understand now you want the script to specifically raise an `AssertionError` when the depicted issue of non-uppercase settings being allowed and retrieved occurs. Adjusting based on the description you provided, here's a corrected version of the standalone script `reproducer.py` designed to explicitly reproduce the issue you've described:

```python
# reproducer.py
def main():
    try:
        import types
        from django.conf import settings

        # Attempting to configure settings with non-uppercase keys, contrary to Django's expected behavior.
        settings.configure(types.SimpleNamespace(foo="bar"), baz="qux")

        # Access these settings to verify if the misconfiguration is allowed.
        foo_value = getattr(settings, 'foo', None)
        baz_value = getattr(settings, 'baz', None)

        # Both settings should not be retrievable if Django enforces uppercase-only settings as per its design.
        assert foo_value is None, "Non-uppercase setting 'foo' was retrieved when it should not be allowed."
        assert baz_value is None, "Non-uppercase setting 'baz' was retrieved when it should not be allowed."

        print("No issue detected. Non-uppercase settings were not retrieved, as expected.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        # If an AssertionError is raised, it indicates the issue is present because the script executed commands it shouldn't have successfully.
        print("Issue detected. Non-uppercase settings are allowed which contradicts Django's documentation and design.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(0)  # Use exit code 0 to indicate the script detected the issue as requested.

    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version ensures that an `AssertionError` will be raised (and caught) when `settings.configure()` improperly allows non-uppercase settings to be set and subsequently retrieved, aligning with the issue description. The script correctly identifies the presence of the issue by attempting to use non-uppercase settings, and uses the provided `print_stacktrace` function to display detailed error information when the issue is detected, meeting your requirement for clear error reporting.
