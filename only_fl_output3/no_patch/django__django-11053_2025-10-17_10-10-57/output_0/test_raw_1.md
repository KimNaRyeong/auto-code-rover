Given the feedback, it appears the initial attempt to reproduce the issue included an early call to `django.setup()` which is not necessary for this scenario and led to a configuration error. As the focus is on `settings.configure()` allowing non-uppercase settings, let's adjust the strategy:

1. We will avoid calling `django.setup()` as it's not required for this issue's reproduction.
2. We will directly call `settings.configure()` with non-uppercase settings, as the issue's description suggests.
3. The script will handle the case more correctly without Django's full setup process interfering.

Here's a revised version of the `reproducer.py`:

```python
# reproducer.py
def main():
    try:
        import types
        from django.conf import settings

        # Configure settings with non-uppercase attributes.
        settings.configure(types.SimpleNamespace(FOO="bar"), BAZ="qux")

        # Check for uppercase setting as correctly configured.
        assert hasattr(settings, 'FOO'), "Uppercase setting FOO is missing."
        # Try retrieving a non-uppercase setting, expecting an AttributeError.
        try:
            foo_value = settings.FOO
        except AttributeError:
            pass  # This is the expected behavior for uppercase settings.
        else:
            # If no AttributeError occurs, this means non-uppercase settings retrieval did not behave as expected.
            assert False, "Successfully retrieved an uppercase setting which is against expectations."
        
        # No exceptions mean the issue has been resolved.
        print("No issue detected. Settings behaved as expected.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        # If an AssertionError is caught, it means the test correctly detected the issue.
        import sys
        print("Issue detected.", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating the script functioned as intended.

    except Exception as e:
        # For any other unexpected exception, print a custom stack trace.
        print_stacktrace(e)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised script focuses strictly on `settings.configure()` allowing the configuration of non-uppercase settings and attempts to retrieve them, which is corrected to reflect expectations better and the aim of reproducing the specified issue.
