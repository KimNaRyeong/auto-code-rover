If we provide a CSS style to draw a border around a `<kbd>` element, so single keystrokes are displayed correctly, then in the second example we'd get a double border (borders around the child elements, and another border around the parent element).\nIf you want to have borders around single keystrokes, and only around the child `<kbd>` elements in compound keystrokes, as shown on the screenshot below, the only way is to differentiate the container and child `<kbd>` elements with a CSS class.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/698770/103331868-9091ae80-4ab3-11eb-980a-94743f279511.png)\n**Expected behavior**\nSingle keystrokes are fine as they are, no change needed:\n```html\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">A</kbd>\n```\nFor compound keystrokes, the container `<kbd>` element should be marked with a CSS class (e.g. `compound`) so it can be styled differently than the child `<kbd>` elements:\n```html\n<kbd class=\"kbd compound docutils literal notranslate\">\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">Shift</kbd>+\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">X</kbd>\n</kbd>\n```\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Windows\n- Python version: 3.9.1\n- Sphinx version: 3.4.0\n- Sphinx extensions: -\n- Extra tools: -\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how Sphinx handles the `:kbd:` role and subsequently generates the HTML code that lacks differentiation between compound and singular keystroke representations. Here's a plan for the API calls:\n\n1. **Identify the Sphinx extension or core component handling the `:kbd:` role**: Since Sphinx extensions can add or modify the behavior of roles, it's possible that an extension or a core Sphinx component is responsible for processing the `:kbd:` role and generating the HTML output. The description doesn't specify an extension, so we'll assume it's handled by a core component of Sphinx.\n\n2. **Find the code responsible for generating `<kbd>` HTML elements**: We need to identify the method or function that converts the `:kbd:` reStructuredText role into HTML. This function is likely responsible for adding the `class` attribute to the `<kbd>` elements.\n\nBased on these considerations, our first steps will involve searching for the class or method that processes the `:kbd:` role within Sphinx's code base. Since Sphinx is written in Python and follows a modular architecture, we can start by searching for methods that might be named or related to roles processing or specifically for handling the `:kbd:` role. Additionally, finding the method responsible for generating the `<kbd>` HTML tag will be crucial.\n\nAPI call strategy:\n- Search for the method or class responsible for handling roles, specifically `:kbd:` if Sphinx uses dedicated names or a generic roles processing method that could handle multiple types of roles.\n- Locate the part of Sphinx that generates HTML for roles, as this is likely where the class attribute is added to the `<kbd>` element.\n\nLet's begin with these API calls:\n1. `search_method(\"handle_role\")`: This is a generic attempt to find a method that could be responsible for handling roles like `:kbd:` in the Sphinx code base. The actual method name might differ, but this is an educated guess based on the functionality we're trying to find.\n2. `search_code(\":kbd:\")`: Search the entire codebase for references to `:kbd:`, which could lead us directly to relevant functions or classes without knowing their exact names. This might retrieve instances where the `:kbd:` role is registered or handled."
