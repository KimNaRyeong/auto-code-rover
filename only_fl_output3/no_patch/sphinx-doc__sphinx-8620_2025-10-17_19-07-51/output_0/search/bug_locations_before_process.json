        "intended_behavior": "Within the `KeyboardTransform` class, adjust the method responsible for generating the HTML for the `:kbd:` role so that it can differentiate between single keystrokes and compound keystrokes. For compound keystrokes (e.g., `Shift+X`), the container `<kbd>` element should be marked with an additional CSS class (suggested name: `compound`). This class does not need to be added to single keystroke elements or the individual child `<kbd>` elements within a compound keystroke. This enhancement will allow for specific styling of compound keystrokes without affecting the presentation of single keystrokes, thereby resolving the issue described. The existing functionality for handling single keystrokes and the initial generation of `<kbd>` elements must be preserved, with the only change being the conditional addition of a `compound` CSS class for compound keystrokes."
