If we provide a CSS style to draw a border around a `<kbd>` element, so single keystrokes are displayed correctly, then in the second example we'd get a double border (borders around the child elements, and another border around the parent element).\nIf you want to have borders around single keystrokes, and only around the child `<kbd>` elements in compound keystrokes, as shown on the screenshot below, the only way is to differentiate the container and child `<kbd>` elements with a CSS class.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/698770/103331868-9091ae80-4ab3-11eb-980a-94743f279511.png)\n**Expected behavior**\nSingle keystrokes are fine as they are, no change needed:\n```html\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">A</kbd>\n```\nFor compound keystrokes, the container `<kbd>` element should be marked with a CSS class (e.g. `compound`) so it can be styled differently than the child `<kbd>` elements:\n```html\n<kbd class=\"kbd compound docutils literal notranslate\">\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">Shift</kbd>+\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">X</kbd>\n</kbd>\n```\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Windows\n- Python version: 3.9.1\n- Sphinx version: 3.4.0\n- Sphinx extensions: -\n- Extra tools: -\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how Sphinx handles the `:kbd:` role and subsequently generates the HTML code that lacks differentiation between compound and singular keystroke representations. Here's a plan for the API calls:\n\n1. **Identify the Sphinx extension or core component handling the `:kbd:` role**: Since Sphinx extensions can add or modify the behavior of roles, it's possible that an extension or a core Sphinx component is responsible for processing the `:kbd:` role and generating the HTML output. The description doesn't specify an extension, so we'll assume it's handled by a core component of Sphinx.\n\n2. **Find the code responsible for generating `<kbd>` HTML elements**: We need to identify the method or function that converts the `:kbd:` reStructuredText role into HTML. This function is likely responsible for adding the `class` attribute to the `<kbd>` elements.\n\nBased on these considerations, our first steps will involve searching for the class or method that processes the `:kbd:` role within Sphinx's code base. Since Sphinx is written in Python and follows a modular architecture, we can start by searching for methods that might be named or related to roles processing or specifically for handling the `:kbd:` role. Additionally, finding the method responsible for generating the `<kbd>` HTML tag will be crucial.\n\nAPI call strategy:\n- Search for the method or class responsible for handling roles, specifically `:kbd:` if Sphinx uses dedicated names or a generic roles processing method that could handle multiple types of roles.\n- Locate the part of Sphinx that generates HTML for roles, as this is likely where the class attribute is added to the `<kbd>` element.\n\nLet's begin with these API calls:\n1. `search_method(\"handle_role\")`: This is a generic attempt to find a method that could be responsible for handling roles like `:kbd:` in the Sphinx code base. The actual method name might differ, but this is an educated guess based on the functionality we're trying to find.\n2. `search_code(\":kbd:\")`: Search the entire codebase for references to `:kbd:`, which could lead us directly to relevant functions or classes without knowing their exact names. This might retrieve instances where the `:kbd:` role is registered or handled."

The class `KeyboardTransform` in `sphinx/builders/html/transforms.py` is likely responsible for transforming the `:kbd:` role into its HTML representation. Here's an analysis based on the snippet and the questions posed:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `KeyboardTransform` class in `sphinx/builders/html/transforms.py` is specifically designed to handle the transformation of the `:kbd:` role in Sphinx documentation into a more detailed HTML form. While the snippet doesn't show the implementation, we can infer that its purpose is to parse the content within `:kbd:` and generate the corresponding `<kbd>` HTML elements.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - This class is directly related to the issue reported. The bug is about how Sphinx generates HTML for compound keystrokes using the `:kbd:` role without differentiating the container `<kbd>` element from its child elements. Since `KeyboardTransform` is responsible for this transformation, the logic within this class (or methods it calls) likely needs to be adjusted to include a separate CSS class for the container `<kbd>` elements as suggested in the issue.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be for `KeyboardTransform` to modify its HTML generation logic to add a distinct CSS class (e.g., `compound`) to the container `<kbd>` elements when rendering compound keystrokes. This way, developers can target container `<kbd>` elements and child `<kbd>` elements separately with CSS. The transformation should distinguish between single keystrokes, which remain unchanged, and compound keystrokes, which should have this additional class.\n\nThe next steps involve finding how `KeyboardTransform` generates the `<kbd>` elements specifically. This requires looking into the implementation details of this class. Thus, we should:\n- Look into the `KeyboardTransform` class to understand how it processes the `:kbd:` role and generates HTML. This involves finding methods within this class that are responsible for the HTML generation.\n- Understand the mechanism used to add CSS classes to the generated `<kbd>` elements.\n\nConsidering the above, the next logical API call is:\n- `search_class_in_file(\"KeyboardTransform\", \"sphinx/builders/html/transforms.py\")`: This will give us more insight into how `KeyboardTransform` is implemented, including any relevant methods that add CSS classes to `<kbd>` elements."

For compound keystrokes (e.g., `Shift+X`), the container `<kbd>` element should be marked with an additional CSS class (suggested name: `compound`). This class does not need to be added to single keystroke elements or the individual child `<kbd>` elements within a compound keystroke. This enhancement will allow for specific styling of compound keystrokes without affecting the presentation of single keystrokes, thereby resolving the issue described. The existing functionality for handling single keystrokes and the initial generation of `<kbd>` elements must be preserved, with the only change being the conditional addition of a `compound` CSS class for compound keystrokes."
