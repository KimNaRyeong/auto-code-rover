If we provide a CSS style to draw a border around a `<kbd>` element, so single keystrokes are displayed correctly, then in the second example we'd get a double border (borders around the child elements, and another border around the parent element).\r\n\r\nIf you want to have borders around single keystrokes, and only around the child `<kbd>` elements in compound keystrokes, as shown on the screenshot below, the only way is to differentiate the container and child `<kbd>` elements with a CSS class.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/698770/103331868-9091ae80-4ab3-11eb-980a-94743f279511.png)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSingle keystrokes are fine as they are, no change needed:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">A</kbd>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor compound keystrokes, the container `<kbd>` element should be marked with a CSS class (e.g. `compound`) so it can be styled differently than the child `<kbd>` elements:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<kbd class=\"kbd compound docutils literal notranslate\">\r\n  <kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">Shift</kbd>+\r\n  <kbd class=\"kbd docutils literal notranslate\">X</kbd>\r\n</kbd>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Environment info**\r\n- OS: Windows\r\n- Python version: 3.9.1\r\n- Sphinx version: 3.4.0\r\n- Sphinx extensions: -\r\n- Extra tools: -\r\n\r\n\n"
