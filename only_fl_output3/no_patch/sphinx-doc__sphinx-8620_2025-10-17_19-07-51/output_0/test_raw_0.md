Below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue described. This script simulates the environment and attempts to generate HTML similar to the one you mentioned, using Sphinx, to check if the generated `<kbd>` elements are marked correctly with a CSS class. Before running this script, ensure Sphinx is installed in your Python environment (`pip install sphinx`).

```python
import os
import subprocess
import shutil
from pathlib import Path

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_project():
    # Project setup
    project_dir = Path('temp_sphinx_project')
    if project_dir.exists():
        shutil.rmtree(project_dir)
    project_dir.mkdir()
    (project_dir / 'conf.py').write_text("""
project = 'Test Project'
master_doc = 'index'
html_theme = 'alabaster'
    """)
    index_rst_path = project_dir / 'index.rst'
    index_rst_path.write_text("""
.. kbd:: A

.. kbd:: Shift+X
    """)
    return project_dir

def build_sphinx_html(project_dir):
    subprocess.run(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', str(project_dir), str(project_dir / '_build')], check=True)

def verify_html_output(project_dir):
    html_file = project_dir / '_build' / 'index.html'
    html_content = html_file.read_text()
    if '<kbd class="kbd compound docutils literal notranslate">' not in html_content:
        raise AssertionError("Compound <kbd> element is not marked with a 'compound' class.")

def main():
    try:
        project_dir = setup_sphinx_project()
        build_sphinx_html(project_dir)
        verify_html_output(project_dir)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    finally:
        # Clean up
        shutil.rmtree(project_dir)

    print("The issue is not reproduced, the output is as expected.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script will:
1. Setup a minimal Sphinx project in a temporary directory.
2. Write an `index.rst` document that includes the `:kbd:` roles with single and compound keystrokes.
3. Build the project into HTML using Sphinx.
4. Verify if the generated HTML marks the container `<kbd>` element with a `compound` class as expected by parsing the HTML content.
5. It uses the provided function `print_stacktrace` to print detailed errors if any checks fail, and cleans up the temporary project directory afterwards.

Please note, for this to work:
- Sphinx must be installed in your environment.
- The script assumes that it has permission to create and delete directories in its execution path.
