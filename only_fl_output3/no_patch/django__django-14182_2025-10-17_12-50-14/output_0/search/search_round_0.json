        "content": "To address the issue of adding support for a precision argument to the `Round` function in Django, which entails enhancing Django's `Round` function to accept a precision argument for rounding numbers, it's necessary to understand how the `Round` function is implemented within the Django framework and how custom functions like `Round` are typically defined and used with database backends. Here are the API calls that would help gather the requisite context:\n\n1. **Search for the `Round` Function**: This will reveal where the `Round` function is defined and used within Django. Since the issue description mentions it as a function rather than a method in a specific class, we'll start by searching the entire codebase for this function.\n    ```python\n    search_method(\"Round\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Search for the `Func` Class**: Since the issue description implies that the user workaround involves extending the `Func` class, understanding how `Func` is defined and used in Django is crucial. This should give us insight into how functions like `Round` are structured.\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"Func\")\n    ```\n\n3. **Search Code Snippet for Custom `Round` Implementation**: The issue description provides a small snippet showing how a custom `Round` function was implemented by extending the `Func` class. Searching this snippet in the codebase can help locate similar custom implementations or usages of `Func` that could inform the proper enhancement of `Round` to support precision.\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"class Round(Func):\\nfunction = 'ROUND'\\narity = 2\")\n    ```\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive understanding of where and how `Round` is implemented and extended in Django, as well as offer insights into the structure and usage of database function wrappers like `Func`. This information will be pivotal for crafting a patch that integrates precision support into the built-in `Round` function."
