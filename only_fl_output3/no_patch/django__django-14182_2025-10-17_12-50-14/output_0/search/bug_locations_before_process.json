        "intended_behavior": "Modify or extend the `as_sql` method within the `Func` class to specifically recognize and correctly handle the `Round` function with an optional precision argument. The method should construct and return SQL syntax that incorporates the precision argument for rounding operations where required. This involves:\n  - Identifying when the `Round` function is being used by inspecting the `function` attribute of the `Func` class instance.\n  - Adjusting the SQL generation logic to include the precision argument in the SQL function call if it is provided. This adjustment must be compatible across all supported databases, requiring conditional handling based on the `connection.vendor` attribute to accommodate differences in SQL syntax for specifying rounding precision.\n  - Ensuring that existing functionalities and usages of the `Func` class and its `as_sql` method remain unaffected when the `Round` function is not involved or when a precision argument is not provided."
