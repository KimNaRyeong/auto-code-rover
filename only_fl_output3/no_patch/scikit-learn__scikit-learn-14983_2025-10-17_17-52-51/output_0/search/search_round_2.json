Both classes inherit from a parent class `_RepeatedSplits`.\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe code snippets provided are the constructor (`__init__`) methods of the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes. These methods are responsible for initializing new instances of these classes with the given parameters: `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`. Notably, the constructors indicate that both classes are customized for repeated cross-validation folds, with defaults for 5 splits and 10 repeats, and an optional `random_state` to control the randomness of the split.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nBased on the problem description, the bug relates to the `__repr__` method, which is not explicitly defined in the snippet provided for either class. This suggests that the bug's source is likely in how Python's default representation method is overridden, either in these classes or in their parent class `_RepeatedSplits`. The default `__repr__` implementation in Python does not automatically provide a detailed string representation of the class instance, which explains the generic object representation seen in the actual results.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior for both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes is to provide a more informative string representation when invoking Python's built-in `repr()` function. This representation should include the class name and the values of its significant attributes (`n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`) in a readable format. This is a clear indication that we need to either find or define a custom `__repr__` method for these classes that adheres to the expected output.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next logical step is to investigate the `_RepeatedSplits` parent class since both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` inherit from it, and it's a likely place for a shared `__repr__` method to be defined. If no such method exists, the investigation could help understand where to best implement this method to correct the issue.\n\nI will issue the following API call:\n- `search_class(\"_RepeatedSplits\")`"

This method should return a string that accurately represents the state of a `RepeatedKFold` instance, including the class name and the values of `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`. The method's implementation should ensure that it matches the expected results format: `RepeatedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)`.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `sklearn/model_selection/_split.py`\n  - **Class:** `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Similar to `RepeatedKFold`, a `__repr__` method needs to be implemented for the `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` class. This method would function to provide a string representation of an instance, detailing `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state` in a coherent and readable format. This matches the expected output of `RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)`.\n\nIn both cases, should there already be a `__repr__` method present in the parent class `_RepeatedSplits` that is not functioning as expected (or if it is missing altogether), the fix might rather involve modifying or implementing it there to ensure the derived classes inherit the correct behavior. However, explicit overrides in each class may be considered to address their specific representation if necessary or to maintain independence between class implementations."

This class is defined within the same file, `sklearn/model_selection/_split.py`, and includes a constructor (`__init__`), a `split` method, and a `get_n_splits` method.\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `_RepeatedSplits` class serves as an abstract base class (due to the use of `ABCMeta`) for creating repeated splits of the data in cross-validation. The constructor initializes the object with parameters such as `cv` for the cross-validation splitting strategy, `n_repeats` defining how many times cross-validation should be repeated, and `random_state` for controlling the randomness of the splits. The methods `split` and `get_n_splits` provide the functionality for splitting datasets and getting the number of splits, respectively. These methods are essential for performing the actual cross-validation.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nSince the `_RepeatedSplits` class is the parent of both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`, it is a critical location for understanding how these derived classes might inherit or should override the `__repr__` method to fix the bug. The absence of a `__repr__` method in the provided class definition suggests that the derived classes do not have an overridden `__repr__` method provided by this base class, thus falling back to Python\u2019s default representation method (which leads to the undescriptive output).\n\nGiven this setup, the bug\u2019s source appears to be the lack of an appropriately customized `__repr__` method within this inheritance hierarchy that specifically addresses the requirements for a more descriptive string representation of class instances.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior at this part of the code, specifically the `_RepeatedSplits` base class, would likely involve implementing a generic `__repr__` method that could serve both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes or any other derived class. This method should dynamically reflect the class name and the specifics of the initialized parameters (focusing on those shared across child classes, such as `n_repeats` and `random_state`). Ideally, the implementation should be sufficiently generic to automatically support any future subclasses of `_RepeatedSplits` without requiring modifications while allowing for easy overriding in subclasses should they have additional parameters to display.\n\nThe absence of a relevant `__repr__` method here confirms that either a generic implementation is needed in `_RepeatedSplits` or specific overrides are required in each of the subclasses to ensure the detailed and correct representation of the instances as described in the issue. Given the analysis, it might be advisable to implement or modify the `__repr__` function in the `_RepeatedSplits` class unless there's a strong reason to implement it individually in each subclass to cater to unique parameters not shared among them."

This `__repr__` method should be designed to automatically adapt to instances of any subclass, providing a clear, accurate representation without requiring subclasses to override the method unless they have unique attributes. For example, the method could use `self.__class__.__name__` to dynamically insert the class name into the string. The output format should closely resemble the proposed format, matching the expectations set in the issue description: `ClassName(n_splits=X, n_repeats=Y, random_state=Z)`. This solution offers a central fix that benefits both the direct subclasses mentioned in the issue and any future subclasses of `_RepeatedSplits`.\n\nImplementing this change would provide a standardized way to represent instances of these classes, directly addressing the reported bug by ensuring that the actual string representations for `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` match the expected results, thereby improving clarity and ease of debugging for users of the sklearn library."
