        "intended_behavior": "Implement a `__repr__` method within the `_RepeatedSplits` class that dynamically constructs a string representation of instances, including the class name and the initialized parameters (such as `n_repeats` and `random_state`). This `__repr__` method should be designed to automatically adapt to instances of any subclass, providing a clear, accurate representation without requiring subclasses to override the method unless they have unique attributes. For example, the method could use `self.__class__.__name__` to dynamically insert the class name into the string. The output format should closely resemble the proposed format, matching the expectations set in the issue description: `ClassName(n_splits=X, n_repeats=Y, random_state=Z)`. This solution offers a central fix that benefits both the direct subclasses mentioned in the issue and any future subclasses of `_RepeatedSplits`."
