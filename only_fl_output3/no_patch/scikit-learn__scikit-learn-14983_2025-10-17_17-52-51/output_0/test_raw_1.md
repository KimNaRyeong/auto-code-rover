The error message you encountered doesn't relate directly to the issue outlined regarding the `__repr__` of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`. Instead, it indicates a problem with building or importing `scikit-learn`. Ensuring `scikit-learn` is correctly installed and compiled is necessary before any attempt to reproduce the `__repr__` issue.

Given your request for a revised script that aims to reproduce the original `__repr__` issue, I'll provide a corrected version. This script should work assuming `scikit-learn` is properly installed. However, the error encountered needs to be addressed by installing `scikit-learn` properly, typically through `pip install scikit-learn` or fixing the build process if you're installing from source.

Let's focus on reproducing the `__repr__` issue with your specified code block in place for traceback:

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedKFold, RepeatedStratifiedKFold

    rkf = RepeatedKFold()
    rskf = RepeatedStratifiedKFold()
    
    try:
        assert repr(rkf) == "RepeatedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)", f"Incorrect __repr__ for RepeatedKFold: {repr(rkf)}"
        assert repr(rskf) == "RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)", f"Incorrect __repr__ for RepeatedStratifiedKFold: {repr(rskf)}"
        print("No issues detected.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script attempts to verify the `__repr__` strings of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`. If they don't match the expected output, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints a detailed stack trace. Note: this script assumes that you've resolved any installation or build issues with `scikit-learn`. If the problem with importing `scikit-learn` persists, please ensure the library is correctly installed and try again.
