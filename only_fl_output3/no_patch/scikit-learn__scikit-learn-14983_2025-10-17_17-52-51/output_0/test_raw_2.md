Given the specified requirements and function to print stack traces, I've constructed a Python script that should correctly attempt to reproduce the issue regarding the incorrect `__repr__` string of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` from scikit-learn. When the issue is present, the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print the relevant stack trace using the provided function. Otherwise, it will exit with code 0, indicating no issues found.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedKFold, RepeatedStratifiedKFold

    # Create instances of RepeatedKFold and RepeatedStratifiedKFold
    rkf = RepeatedKFold()
    rskf = RepeatedStratifiedKFold()

    # Expected __repr__ strings
    expected_rkf_repr = "RepeatedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)"
    expected_rskf_repr = "RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)"

    # Actual __repr__ strings
    actual_rkf_repr = repr(rkf)
    actual_rskf_repr = repr(rskf)

    try:
        # Assert that the actual __repr__ matches the expected __repr__
        assert actual_rkf_repr == expected_rkf_repr, f"Incorrect __repr__ for RepeatedKFold: {actual_rkf_repr}"
        assert actual_rskf_repr == expected_rskf_repr, f"Incorrect __repr__ for RepeatedStratifiedKFold: {actual_rskf_repr}"
        print("All repr strings are correct. No issue detected.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script checks whether the `__repr__` methods of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` return the expected strings. It utilizes `assert` statements to check for the correct representation of these objects. If the assertions fail (meaning the issue is present and the `__repr__` is not what is expected), the script raises an `AssertionError`, and then the `print_stacktrace` function prints a detailed stack trace to help diagnose the issue. 

Ensure that your Python environment has `scikit-learn` installed and is otherwise properly set up to execute this script successfully. This script assumes that the issue concerning the incorrect `__repr__` output exists; if the `scikit-learn` library has been updated to fix this issue, the script should exit with code 0, indicating no issues were found.
