Inspecting the globals and source code of `f` shows us why we get the result:\n```python\n>>> import inspect\n>>> print(inspect.getsource(f))\ndef _lambdifygenerated(A):\nreturn (I + A)\n>>> f.__globals__['I']\n1j\n```\nThe code printer prints `I`, which is currently being interpreted as a Python built-in complex number. The printer should support printing identity matrices, and signal an error for unsupported expressions that might be misinterpreted.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather context around how `lambdify` works, specifically how it deals with matrix expressions and the identity matrix. The globals inspection reveals that the identity matrix is being misinterpreted as a complex number (`1j`). This suggests we should focus on the `lambdify` function itself, the mechanism which translates symbolic expressions into numpy code, and how identity matrices are represented and interpreted in the codebase. Here are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. **Search for the `lambdify` function**: To understand how `lambdify` translates symbolic expressions into Python code that can operate on numpy arrays.\n   - `search_method(\"lambdify\")`\n\n2. **Search for the code responsible for handling the identity matrix**: Since the letter `I` is being interpreted as `1j`, it's likely there's a misinterpretation or mishandling of the symbol `I` within the code responsible for translating or printing expressions.\n   - `search_code(\"Identity\")`\n   - `search_code(\"I\")` \n\nThese calls aim to identify where the bug might be originating from regarding the handling of identity matrices and their translation into executable numpy code via `lambdify`."
