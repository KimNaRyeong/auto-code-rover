        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `lambdify` function to correctly interpret and convert `Identity` matrix symbols to the appropriate function call in the designated target numerical library, such as `numpy.eye(n)` for NumPy. This includes recognizing when the `Identity` function is part of the expression and ensuring that it is represented in a way compatible with the numerical library's expectations for an identity matrix. The change should preserve all existing functionality, only adding a new case handling for `Identity` matrices without affecting other symbols or functions being converted."
