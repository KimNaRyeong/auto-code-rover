This script is designed to reproduce the issue with displaying the LambertW function raised to a power in SymPy when used within a JupyterLab environment. However, the script runs outside of JupyterLab to conduct the test in a standalone manner. The script triggers the same code path but operates under the assumption that if the issue manifests in this context, it will validate the presence of the bug when run within JupyterLab.

The `AssertionError` indicates that the specific problem being tested for is present and unaddressed. The script uses a dedicated function, `print_stacktrace`, to detail the encountered exception, ensuring that developers or maintainers have clear insight into the error's nature and location. Exiting with code `0` when no issue is detected aligns with standard expectations for script execution outcomes, where a non-zero exit code typically signals an error or issue.
