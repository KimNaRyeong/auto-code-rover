Here's how you would structure the Python script `reproducer.py` to attempt reproduction of the issue according to the given instructions. This script will explicitly check for the exception type that indicates a failure specific to the issue described, ensuring that upon catching this exception, it understands the issue to be present. Conversely, it will interpret the absence of the exception (i.e., normal execution) as an indication that the issue might have been resolved.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import sympy as sp

    try:
        # Reproducing the interaction as it was described
        function = sp.Pow(sp.LambertW(2), 2)
        str(function)  # Attempt to convert to string should trigger display-related errors
        
        # If no errors occurred, the script will reach this point
        print("The issue may have been resolved; no errors encountered.")
    except Exception as e:
        if e.__class__.__name__ == "TypeError" and 'exp' in str(e):
            # If the specific error is caught, print the stack trace and exit gracefully
            print_stacktrace(e)
            print("Exiting with code 0; issue reproduced successfully.")
            exit(0)
        else:
            # If an unexpected error occurs, still print the stack trace but indicate it
            print_stacktrace(e)
            print("Exiting with code 1; encountered an unexpected issue.")
            exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script attempts to directly address the issue by:

- Generating the function that's known to cause the issue.
- Attempting to coerce the problematic function output to a string, as would be attempted during printing or displaying in Jupyter Lab (this act mimics the under-the-hood operations that might trigger the error in question).
- Expecting the very specific `TypeError` with reference to an `'exp'` keyword argument, based on the error stack provided.
- Using a clear and direct method of indicating the status of the reproduction attempt: printing a stack trace and exiting with code 0 when the specific issue is encountered, with other outcomes handled appropriately based on their context.
