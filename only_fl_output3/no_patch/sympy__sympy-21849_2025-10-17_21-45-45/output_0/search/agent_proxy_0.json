            "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to inspect several parts of the codebase relating to how Sympy handles the printing (specifically to LaTeX) of expressions involving the `LambertW` function and the handling of the `Pow` function. Given the traceback, our focus should be on the `LatexPrinter` class, especially on how it deals with functions and powers, and the specific handling of `LambertW` within this context.\n\nLet's start by investigating the following:\n\n1. The implementation of the `_print_Pow` method within the `LatexPrinter` class, since the error mentions that the `_print_LambertW` method got an unexpected keyword argument 'exp', which likely originates from a call within `_print_Pow`.\n2. The implementation of the `_print_LambertW` method within the `LatexPrinter` class to understand how it's meant to handle the `exp` argument or why it might be receiving this argument unexpectedly.\n3. The general handling of the `LambertW` function to see if there are specific instructions or methods related to its representation or evaluation that could be relevant to the issue.\n\nHere are the search API calls we'll make:\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_print_Pow\", \"LatexPrinter\")`: To get context on how powers are printed, especially regarding how it tries to pass the `exp` argument when dealing with function bases.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_print_LambertW\", \"LatexPrinter\")`: To understand the current handling of `LambertW` in LaTeX printing and why it might not accept an `exp` keyword argument.\n- `search_class(\"LatexPrinter\")`: To get a broader view of the `LatexPrinter` class which might clue us in on how it's structured to handle various types of expressions, including functions and their powers."
