Specifically, for the `LambertW` function, the method should avoid passing the `exp` argument directly and instead implement a way to correctly format the power operation in LaTeX. One approach could be checking if the base is an instance of `LambertW` (or any other function with similar constraints) and then handle the exponent separately in a manner that aligns with LaTeX standards without violating the method signatures of specific print functions like `_print_LambertW`. This preserves the existing functionality for other functions and cases while providing a tailored handling for `LambertW` and potentially similar future cases."

        "intended_behavior": "Although the `_print_LambertW` method is not directly at fault based on the existing implementation, considering a future-proofing approach, it may be beneficial to allow this method (and similarly implemented methods for other functions) to optionally handle an `exp` argument. This would not change the method's current handling but would add an optional pathway for dealing with exponentiation directly within the function's LaTeX representation. This adaptation would require a fallback or default behavior that ensures compatibility with the current usage while enabling new functionality where necessary. This method could, for example, provide a basic LaTeX exponentiation wrapping around its current output if `exp` is provided and is not trivial (e.g., an exponent of 1)."
