This script checks whether the use of `floatformat` with `'0.00'` and `Decimal('0.00')` as the input values throws a `ValueError` as specified in the issue when the second argument (precision) is set to 0. According to the description, both invocations should lead to a `ValueError` indicating a problem with handling precision values in that range. 

The `print_stacktrace` function will display an informative stack trace if an unexpected exception occurs during the execution of these calls. The script exits with code 1 if the issue is present (i.e., an `AssertionError` is raised either due to encountering the specific problem or any other unexpected error), and exits with code 0 indicating the issue was not reproduced, thus suggesting it may have been fixed.
