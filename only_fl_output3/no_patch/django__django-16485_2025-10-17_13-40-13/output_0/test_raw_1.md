Given your clarification, it looks like we need to adapt the script to intentionally reproduce the described issue and check if the exception is thrown as expected. This time, we expect to catch a `ValueError` raised because of the inappropriate precision (prec) argument value.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from decimal import Decimal
    from django.template.defaultfilters import floatformat
    try:
        # The test intentionally expects to catch ValueError for the precision issue.
        result_str = floatformat('0.00', 0)
        result_dec = floatformat(Decimal('0.00'), 0)

        # If the above lines did not raise an exception, it means the issue is potentially fixed.
        # This contradicts our purpose to reproduce; hence we assert False.
        # In a real-world scenario, reaching this point without an exception would mean the issue might be resolved.
        print("No exception was thrown for either test case, which might indicate the issue is resolved.")
        exit(0)

    except ValueError as ve:
        print("ValueError caught as expected:", str(ve))
        print_stacktrace(ve)
        raise AssertionError("Issue reproduced successfully: ValueError for invalid prec range.") from ve
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Unexpected error encountered.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError:
        exit(1)
```

Note: In this script, we adjusted the error handling to specifically look for a `ValueError` indicating a problem with the precision range, as described in your issue. If this exception is caught, it prints out a stack trace and exits with code `1`, signaling that the issue persists. If the operations complete without raising the expected `ValueError`, it could suggest the issue has been addressed in the Django version being used, and the script exits with code `0` indicating no issue was found.
