Given the information, here are the relevant API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"floatformat\")`: This will locate the `floatformat` method's implementations or references across the project to find out where the issue might originate.\n2. `search_code(\"floatformat('0.00', 0)\")`: By searching for this specific usage of `floatformat`, we can find any documentation or specific test cases related to this problem.\n3. `search_code(\"floatformat(Decimal('0.00'), 0)\")`: Similar to the previous call but specific to the `Decimal` usage to see if different paths are taken for string vs. `Decimal` inputs within the function."
