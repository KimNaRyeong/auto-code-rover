        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, we need to explore the relevant parts of the Django ORM (Object Relational Mapper) dealing with window expressions, conditional statements (`Case`, `When`), and annotations. The issue specifically mentions a regression introduced by a commit, implying that the bug might be located in the code handling these constructs. Therefore, I would focus on:\n\n1. Searching for the classes and methods responsible for handling window functions (`Window`, `Lag`) and conditional expressions (`Case`, `When`).\n2. Identifying the part of the ORM that allows for annotations in querysets, which is likely where the issue resides.\n\nGiven these considerations, I propose the following API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the `Window` class**: This will help us identify where window functions are processed.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"Window\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the `Case` class**: Since the issue involves conditional statements only in the `SELECT` clause, it's important to look into how `Case` expressions are handled.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"Case\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for methods related to `annotate`**: Since the issue occurs while using the `annotate` method, we should find its implementation.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_method(\"annotate\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Search for the method or class handling `NotSupportedError`**: This might give us insight into the conditions under which the error is raised.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_code(\"NotSupportedError\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches aim to map out the sections of the Django codebase that are likely involved in this issue, providing a foundation for further investigation and patch development."
