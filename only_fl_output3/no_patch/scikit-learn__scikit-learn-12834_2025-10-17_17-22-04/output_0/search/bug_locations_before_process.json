        "intended_behavior": "The `predict` method should be enhanced to correctly handle and predict with non-numeric dependent variables (DVs). This could involve internally converting non-numeric labels into a numeric representation for prediction and then mapping these back to the original labels for the output. The functionality must preserve the method's ability to accurately handle numeric DVs without alteration."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to `ForestClassifier`, for `ForestRegressor`, the method should not actually need modification for string DVs given it inherently deals with numeric predictions. However, ensuring consistency in processing and error messaging when encountering non-numeric DVs would be beneficial. This includes providing a clear error message when non-numeric DVs are used, guiding the user towards appropriate model choices or data transformation techniques for regression tasks."
