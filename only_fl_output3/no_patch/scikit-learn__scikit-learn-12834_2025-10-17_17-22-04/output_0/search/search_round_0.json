Passing string DVs returns the following error:\n`ValueError: could not convert string to float:`\nI'm going to take a stab at submitting a fix today, but I wanted to file an issue to document the problem in case I'm not able to finish a fix.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\nI wrote a test based on `ensemble/tests/test_forest:test_multioutput` which currently fails:\n```\ndef check_multioutput_string(name):\n# Check estimators on multi-output problems with string outputs.\nX_train = [[-2, -1], [-1, -1], [-1, -2], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1], [-2, 1],\n[-1, 1], [-1, 2], [2, -1], [1, -1], [1, -2]]\ny_train = [[\"red\", \"blue\"], [\"red\", \"blue\"], [\"red\", \"blue\"], [\"green\", \"green\"],\n[\"green\", \"green\"], [\"green\", \"green\"], [\"red\", \"purple\"],\n[\"red\", \"purple\"], [\"red\", \"purple\"], [\"green\", \"yellow\"],\n[\"green\", \"yellow\"], [\"green\", \"yellow\"]]\nX_test = [[-1, -1], [1, 1], [-1, 1], [1, -1]]\ny_test = [[\"red\", \"blue\"], [\"green\", \"green\"], [\"red\", \"purple\"], [\"green\", \"yellow\"]]\nest = FOREST_ESTIMATORS[name](random_state=0, bootstrap=False)\ny_pred = est.fit(X_train, y_train).predict(X_test)\nassert_array_almost_equal(y_pred, y_test)\nif name in FOREST_CLASSIFIERS:\nwith np.errstate(divide=\"ignore\"):\nproba = est.predict_proba(X_test)\nassert_equal(len(proba), 2)\nassert_equal(proba[0].shape, (4, 2))\nassert_equal(proba[1].shape, (4, 4))\nlog_proba = est.predict_log_proba(X_test)\nassert_equal(len(log_proba), 2)\nassert_equal(log_proba[0].shape, (4, 2))\nassert_equal(log_proba[1].shape, (4, 4))\n@pytest.mark.filterwarnings('ignore:The default value of n_estimators')\n@pytest.mark.parametrize('name', FOREST_CLASSIFIERS_REGRESSORS)\ndef test_multioutput_string(name):\ncheck_multioutput_string(name)\n```\n#### Expected Results\nNo error is thrown, can run `predict` for all ensemble multioutput models\n#### Actual Results\n`ValueError: could not convert string to float: <DV class>`\n#### Versions\nI replicated this error using the current master branch of sklearn (0.21.dev0).\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue described, we need to gather more context around the implementation of multioutput models, particularly ensemble models, and their handling of non-numeric dependent variables (DVs). Based on the description provided in the issue, the following API calls can help us get the necessary code context:\n\n1. Search for occurrences of the `FOREST_ESTIMATORS` variable or dictionary, as this seems to be central to selecting the estimator used in the test case. It's likely defined or imported in one of the ensemble-related files.\n   \n2. Search for the implementation of `predict`, `predict_proba`, and `predict_log_proba` methods for forest classifiers or regressors, since the issue occurs when these methods are called on models trained with string DVs.\n\n3. Given that `ensemble` and `test_forest` are mentioned, it's reasonable to assume that the error might arise from within the implementation of the forest estimators or their base classes. Searching how these estimators (likely from the `ensemble` module) are implemented will provide insight into why they might not support string DVs currently.\n\nTherefore, I suggest the following specific API calls:\n\n- `search_code(\"FOREST_ESTIMATORS\")` to find where and how `FOREST_ESTIMATORS` is defined or used.\n- `search_method(\"predict\")` in combination with `search_method(\"predict_proba\")` and `search_method(\"predict_log_proba\")` to locate these methods across the forest and ensemble classifiers.\n- `search_class(\"ForestClassifier\")` and `search_class(\"ForestRegressor\")` assuming these might be relevant class names based on common naming conventions in sklearn for ensemble methods."
