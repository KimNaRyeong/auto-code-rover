Given the feedback and requirements, here is a revised `reproducer.py` file designed to handle the issue of compatibility and exception handling as described. This version takes into account the necessity to properly reproduce the error related to `astropy` handling float32 representations of π/2:

```python
# reproducer.py
def main():
    from astropy.coordinates import Latitude
    import numpy as np

    def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
        import traceback
        import sys
        tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
        print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
        for frame in tb:
            line_number = frame.lineno
            code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
            print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
            print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

    lat = np.float32(np.pi/2)
    try:
        lat_obj = Latitude(lat, 'rad')
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Latitude validation failed for float32 representation of pi/2") from e

    # Verifying the obtained latitude is within acceptable bounds considering float32 representation
    expected_max = 90.0  # Degrees
    assert abs(lat_obj.degree - expected_max) < 1e-6, \
        f"Latitude value {lat_obj.degree} exceeds expected maximum {expected_max} considering float precision."

    print("Test passed. No issue detected.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script attempts to create a `Latitude` object with the `float32` representation of π/2 in radians. If the creation of the `Latitude` object fails due to the issue described, the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print the relevant stack trace. Additionally, this script includes an assertion to verify the created `Latitude` object has a degree value that does not deviate significantly from 90 degrees, considering the precision limits of `float32` representations. If the issue is fixed and the assertion is not triggered, the script prints "Test passed. No issue detected" and exits with code 0, indicating the problem is resolved in the environment where the script is run.
