        "intended_behavior": "The `_validate_angles` method should be adjusted to consider the precision difference that comes with using `np.float32`. As the current implementation strictly enforces bounds based on float64 precision, it inadvertently rejects values that are within acceptable tolerances for `np.float32` precision, especially values close to \u00b190\u00b0 (or \u00b1\\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) radians). To resolve the issue while preserving existing functionality for higher precision data types like `np.float64`, the method could include a tolerance factor in the comparison. This tolerance could be dynamically set based on the precision of the input angle's data type. For instance, when dealing with angles expressed as `np.float32`, the tolerance could allow a slight overshoot beyond \u00b190\u00b0 (or \u00b1\\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) radians) to accommodate the precision limit of `np.float32`. The adjustment must be such that it does not compromise the mathematical correctness for more precise data types like `np.float64`. An example adjustment could be introducing a small epsilon value that relaxes the boundary conditions, which could be set in relation to the unit of the angles being verified (degrees or radians). This modification needs to ensure that any introduced tolerance does not significantly alter the scientific accuracy of the computations for use cases that require precise spatial measurements and calculations."
