This script reproduces the reported issue by attempting to create a `Latitude` object with the `float32` representation of Ï€/2 in radians. If the issue is present, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints the stack trace as described. Otherwise, it simply prints "Test passed. No issue detected." indicating that the issue has been resolved or is not present in the environment where the script is run.
