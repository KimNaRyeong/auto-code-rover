Given the requirements and the previous attempt not accurately mimicking the setup due to Django configuration complexities, let's adjust the approach. The script should dynamically create models within an app contextually named with mixed-case to trigger the issue. Considering Django's requirement of an installed app, this script will simulate as much of the Django environment as possible within its execution context to provoke the identified migration error around the mixed-case app name issue.

Please ensure Django is installed in your environment and you are within a Django project directory or adjust the script to dynamically set up a Django project.

```python
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Attempt to configure Django for dynamic model creation.
def configure_django():
    from django.conf import settings
    settings.configure(
        DEBUG=True,
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': 'db.sqlite3',
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=(

            # Simulated app name with mixed-case to recreate the reported environment
            'DJ_RegLogin',
        ),
    )

    # Setup Django (only once).
    import django
    if not django.apps.apps.ready:
        django.setup()

def main():
    configure_django()
    from django.db import models

    # Define models dynamically to emulate the user scenario within Django's framework.
    class DJ_RegLogin_Category(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=100)

        class Meta:
            app_label = 'DJ_RegLogin'  # Define the custom app label

    class DJ_RegLogin_Content(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        category = models.ForeignKey(DJ_RegLogin_Category, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

        class Meta:
            app_label = 'DJ_RegLogin'  # Define the custom app label

    # Mimic the `makemigrations` command
    from django.core.management import call_command
    try:
        call_command('makemigrations', 'DJ_RegLogin', '--dry-run', verbosity=3)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with an error code if the issue arises

    print("The issue could not be reproduced. Exiting with code 0.")
    sys.exit(0)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

**Note:**
- This script assumes you are executing it within a Django project context. If not, please adjust the code to either create a new Django project dynamically or run it within an existing one.
- The dynamic addition of an app ('DJ_RegLogin') within `INSTALLED_APPS` is a superficial mimic to run the script without creating an actual Django app directory structure. This is to focus on reproducing the ForeignKey and mixed-case app name issue.
- Adjustments or additional dependencies (like creating `db.sqlite3` if it doesn't exist) may be required depending on your Django project's configuration.
- The script exits with code `0` if it does not reproduce the issue, signifying that the script completed without detecting the problem, and exits with code `1` if the issue is encountered, displaying the stack trace using `print_stacktrace`.
