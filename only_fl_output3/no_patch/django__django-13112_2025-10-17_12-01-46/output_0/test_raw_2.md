Given the task to write a standalone Python file that will reproduce the reported Django issue, the script below is an attempt to simulate the said Django migration error within a single executable Python file. This script will dynamically create a Django environment, attempt to mimic the problematic scenario, and then verify if the issue with the ForeignKey and mixed-case app name can be reproduced.

The script checks for the specific error occurrence and uses an assertion to determine if the issue is present. On encountering the issue, it will print the stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. Conversely, if the issue is resolved or not encountered, it will exit with code 0, indicating success.

Please note, this script assumes you have Django installed in your environment and that your current working directory is suitable for creating a temporary Django project structure for the purpose of this reproduction script.

```python
import os
import sys
from django.conf import settings
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

To execute this script:

1. Save it as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your Django project.
2. Ensure that Django is set up correctly and you're able to execute Django management commands.
3. Run `python3 reproducer.py`.

This script dynamically sets up a minimal Django environment, including the problematic models and app configuration, and attempts to run migrations to reproduce the described issue. If the issue is encountered, it should assert and print detailed information about the failure. If the script exits with code 0, it implies that the issue could not be reproduced under the conditions simulated by the script.
