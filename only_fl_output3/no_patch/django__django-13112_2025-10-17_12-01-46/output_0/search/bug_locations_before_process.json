Since Python and Django recognize app names as case-sensitive strings, consistency is key. The intended behavior here is to ensure that 'DJ_RegLogin' (or 'dj_reglogin', depending on the actual directory or app config name) is used consistently throughout the project. If the issue stems from Django not recognizing the app due to case sensitivity issues, ensuring that the name is correctly used in `INSTALLED_APPS` should resolve the migration crash. The functionality intended to be preserved here is Django's ability to recognize and include the specified app in project-wide operations like migrations, model registration, and admin panel inclusion."
