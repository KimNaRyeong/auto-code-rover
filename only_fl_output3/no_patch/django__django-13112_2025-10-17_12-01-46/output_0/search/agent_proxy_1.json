Since Python and Django recognize app names as case-sensitive strings, consistency is key. The intended behavior here is to ensure that 'DJ_RegLogin' (or 'dj_reglogin', depending on the actual directory or app config name) is used consistently throughout the project. If the issue stems from Django not recognizing the app due to case sensitivity issues, ensuring that the name is correctly used in `INSTALLED_APPS` should resolve the migration crash. The functionality intended to be preserved here is Django's ability to recognize and include the specified app in project-wide operations like migrations, model registration, and admin panel inclusion.\n\nGiven the provided context and results from the API calls, we aim to address the reported issue by focusing on the correct and consistent registration of the app in the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting in `settings.py`. This approach directly addresses the described error by ensuring that Django can recognize and load the app properly, thereby allowing migrations to run successfully."
