The tie-breaking rule needs to be consistent across models and transparent to users, possibly documented or controlled via a parameter."

        "intended_behavior": "The predict method should either leverage the same tie-breaking mechanism introduced in decision_function or ensure that its classification outcomes are derived in a way that is consistent with the decisions made by decision_function. This might involve directly referencing the tie-break logic or outcome from decision_function or ensuring that predict and decision_function both defer to a shared utility method that implements the tie-breaking. The intended correction is to ensure that the final class chosen reflects the decision function's output accurately, especially under conditions where decision_function_shape=\"ovr\" is used and ties may occur."
