        "content": "<issue>Alternative parallel execution frameworks in xarray\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?\nSince early on the project xarray has supported wrapping `dask.array` objects in a first-class manner. However recent work on flexible array wrapping has made it possible to wrap all sorts of array types (and with #6804 we should support wrapping any array that conforms to the [array API standard](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/index.html)).\nCurrently though the only way to parallelize array operations with xarray \"automatically\" is to use dask. (You could use [xarray-beam](https://github.com/google/xarray-beam) or other options too but they don't \"automatically\" generate the computation for you like dask does.)\nWhen dask is the only type of parallel framework exposing an array-like API then there is no need for flexibility, but now we have nascent projects like [cubed](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed) to consider too. @tomwhite\n### Describe the solution you'd like\nRefactor the internals so that dask is one option among many, and that any newer options can plug in in an extensible way.\nIn particular cubed deliberately uses the same API as `dask.array`, exposing:\n1) the methods needed to conform to the array API standard\n2) a `.chunk` and `.compute` method, which we could dispatch to\n3) dask-like functions to create computation graphs including [`blockwise`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/400dc9adcf21c8b468fce9f24e8d4b8cb9ef2f11/cubed/core/ops.py#L43), [`map_blocks`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/400dc9adcf21c8b468fce9f24e8d4b8cb9ef2f11/cubed/core/ops.py#L221), and [`rechunk`](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed/blob/main/cubed/primitive/rechunk.py)\nI would like to see xarray able to wrap any array-like object which offers this set of methods / functions, and call the corresponding version of that method for the correct library (i.e. dask vs cubed) automatically.\nThat way users could try different parallel execution frameworks simply via a switch like\n```python\nds.chunk(**chunk_pattern, manager=\"dask\")\n```\nand see which one works best for their particular problem.\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\nIf we leave it the way it is now then xarray will not be truly flexible in this respect.\nAny library can wrap (or subclass if they are really brave) xarray objects to provide parallelism but that's not the same level of flexibility.\n### Additional context\n[cubed repo](https://github.com/tomwhite/cubed)\n[PR](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/6804) about making xarray able to wrap objects conforming to the new [array API standard](https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/index.html)\ncc @shoyer @rabernat @dcherian @keewis\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue outlined, we will perform a series of API calls aimed at understanding the integration of dask arrays and the required modifications to support other parallel execution frameworks, like cubed, in a similar fashion. Given that the issue emphasizes on making xarray flexible enough to automatically parallelize array operations using alternatives to dask, we will look into the existing dask integration, the core xarray classes or methods involved with chunking and computing, and how extension for other frameworks can be introduced.\n\nLet's conduct the following API calls:\n1. Search for the class in xarray where dask arrays are handled or integrated, as it is likely central to implementing support for other array types like cubed. We expect `DataArray` or `Dataset` classes might be involved, but since the specific class name handling dask integration is not mentioned, we'll start by searching for methods and code snippets directly related to dask.\n   - `search_code(\"dask.array\")`\n\n2. Since the proposed solution involves refactoring internals to support an extensible way of handling parallel computation frameworks, it's important to find where `chunk` and `compute` methods are defined or used within the xarray project, as these are also mentioned as part of the cubed API.\n   - `search_method(\"chunk\")`\n   - `search_method(\"compute\")`\n\n3. Given cubed's aim to follow dask's API, focusing on `blockwise`, `map_blocks`, and `rechunk` methods, identification of similar methods in xarray that interact with dask could be pivotal in extending support to cubed. Finding these methods may help understand how to abstract their functionality to accommodate other libraries.\n   - `search_code(\"map_blocks\")`\n   - `search_code(\"blockwise\")`\n   - `search_code(\"rechunk\")`\n\n4. To fully comprehend and potentially modify how xarray decides which computation manager to use for tasks (currently, implicitly dask), it will be insightful to find any existing implementation logic that ties xarray operations specifically to dask. This might reside in configuration or setup code within xarray.\n   - `search_code(\"dask.config\")`\n\nThese selected API calls aim to uncover the necessary details about current dask integration points within xarray, areas where extensibility for adding other parallel execution frameworks like cubed can be introduced, and the overall architecture of parallel computations in xarray. This comprehensive approach will provide a foundation for designing a solution to the issue at hand."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insights into how `dask` is integrated within `xarray` and where the opportunities for extending support to other frameworks like `cubed` might exist. Let's examine the results concerning the raised questions.\n\n### Analysis of `dask.array` Usage\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The numerous appearances of `dask.array` across a variety of files suggest that `dask` is deeply integrated within `xarray` for parallel computation. Files like `xarray/core/dataarray.py`, `xarray/core/dataset.py`, and `xarray/core/_aggregations.py` indicate that `dask` functionalities are utilized for data manipulations, aggregation operations, and more.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  These integrations are directly related to the feature request, as they currently represent the hardcoded, singular method for parallel computations using `dask`. To address the issue, these are the aspects that need refactoring to allow for a more flexible backend system that could integrate with other array frameworks.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n  The intended behavior, post-refactoring, would involve abstracting the direct calls to `dask.array` and related operations to be more agnostic of the compute backend, allowing for similar calls to other compliant libraries like `cubed`.\n\n### Analysis of `chunk` and `compute` Methods\n- These methods are crucial for managing computation tasks in `dask` and other parallel computing frameworks. Their usage within `variable.py`, `dataarray.py`, and `dataset.py` highlights where `xarray` interfaces with `dask` to partition data for parallel processing and to trigger computations, respectively.\n\n### Analysis of `map_blocks`, `blockwise`, and `rechunk`\n- **map_blocks**: Present across several key components of `xarray`, this indicates areas where data is partitioned and operations are mapped over these partitions. This is a key extension point for supporting other backends like `cubed`.\n- **blockwise**: Used primarily in aggregation operations, suggesting another key pattern of use where parallel computations are structured.\n- **rechunk**: Indicates the handling of chunk sizes and arrangements, an area that would need flexibility for different backends' optimal performance.\n\n### Analysis of `dask.config`\n- The usage in `asv_bench/benchmarks/dataset_io.py` indicates `dask`'s configuration roles, possibly for performance tuning and operational parameters. This suggests a need for a generic configuration management system for any backend.\n\n### Conclusions and Next Steps\n1. **Refactor to Backend Agnostic Design**: Clearly, a significant step involves abstracting direct calls to `dask` and similar patterns, thereby defining an interface that can work with any array library following the agreed-upon standards (such as the array API and having `chunk`, `compute`, etc.).\n\n2. **Extend Configuration Management**: There's a need to generalize the configuration approach to support different backends beyond `dask`, allowing users to set parameters for `cubed` or others as easily.\n\n3. **Generalize Parallel Operations Handling**: Methods like `map_blocks`, `blockwise`, and `rechunk` should be abstracted such that the underlying operation can be executed by the selected backend seamlessly.\n\nTo move forward, identifying the interfaces and refactoring points that allow for the abstraction and modular integration of backends is crucial. Once these hotspots are determined, design patterns for flexible backend management and computation dispatching can be proposed and implemented."

The existing functionality for `dask` should be preserved, allowing for a seamless transition between backends without altering the user's experience.\n\n### Bug Location 2: \n- **File:** `xarray/core/dataset.py`\n- **Classes and Methods:** Similar to `DataArray`, any method that directly interacts with `dask.array` such as `chunk`, `compute`, and perhaps `map_blocks`.\n- **Intended Behavior:** Implement a backend-agnostic interface such that the Dataset class can operate with different parallel computing frameworks beyond `dask`. Maintain current `dask` functionalities and ensure new parallel backends can be introduced with minimal friction.\n\n### Bug Location 3:\n- **File:** `xarray/core/variable.py`\n- **Classes and Methods:** Methods like `chunk`, `rechunk`, and other `dask.array` related manipulations.\n- **Intended Behavior:** Adapt these methods to utilize a generalized computational backend system that decides at runtime which backend to use for operations, based on user configuration or data attributes. Ensure that the behavior for `dask` remains unaffected for current users.\n\n### Bug Location 4:\n- **File:** `xarray/core/computation.py`\n- **Classes and Methods:** In places where `blockwise` operations are defined and utilized.\n- **Intended Behavior:** Abstract the operation handling to be compatible with multiple array backends, enabling the support for `cubed` and other potential future backends. This might involve creating helper functions or classes responsible for executing backend-specific code.\n\n### General Enhancement:\nFor all the above modifications, an additional, overarching requirement is to develop a configuration system or utilize the existing one more extensively to facilitate easy switching and customization of the backend framework by the users. This might involve creating wrapper functions or classes that can abstract away the backend-specific code into a unified interface, preserving and extending the existing functionalities of `xarray` to be more inclusive of other array-processing libraries."
