        "intended_behavior": "The `score` computation within this method needs to be adjusted to handle cases where `centroid_distances` contain zeros, in order to avoid division by zero errors. A possible approach is to add a small epsilon value to the denominator to ensure it's never zero, or use `numpy.divide` with `where` parameter to selectively perform division only where `centroid_distances` is non-zero. This change should maintain the functionality of calculating the Davies-Bouldin score accurately while preventing runtime warnings or errors when encountering clusters located very close to each other (or at exactly the same location due to numerical rounding or clustering anomalies). Additionally, ensuring that `score[score == np.inf] = np.nan` effectively handles any infinite values resulting from the division could be a part of validating the score matrix before computing its mean."
