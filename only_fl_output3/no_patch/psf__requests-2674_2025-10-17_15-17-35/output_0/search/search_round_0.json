They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)\nThanks!\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue regarding `urllib3` exceptions passing through the `requests` API and being unhandled properly, we need to focus on understanding how the `requests` package interfaces with `urllib3`, how exceptions are currently captured and re-raised (if at all), and then identify potential locations in the codebase where enhancements or patches might be applied.\n\nGiven the specifics of the issue, the following actions seem pertinent:\n\n1. **Search for exceptions handling mechanism in `requests`.** This would include looking into how `requests` wraps or catches exceptions thrown by `urllib3`. Since exceptions are mentioned directly (e.g., `DecodeError`, `TimeoutError`), it is beneficial to understand where they might be getting handled, or slipping through.\n\n2. **Explore relevant classes and methods in `requests` where exception handling could be improved.** Given that `requests` is a high-level HTTP library, exception handling would likely occur in places where `requests` makes calls to `urllib3` or processes its responses.\n\nBased on the above considerations, we plan the following search queries:\n\n- Search the `requests` package for how it catches and wraps `urllib3` exceptions generally. This is to get a baseline understanding of the mechanism.\n  - `search_code(\"urllib3.exceptions\")`\n\n- Investigate specific classes or methods that are most likely involved in handling or re-raising `urllib3` exceptions. Given that no specific classes or methods are mentioned in the issue, we'll focus on general mechanisms first before narrowing down based on findings.\n  - `search_code(\"requests.exceptions\")` to see where `requests` defines its own exceptions and potentially wraps `urllib3` exceptions.\n\n- Since the user mentioned specific exception types passing through (`DecodeError`, `TimeoutError`), it's crucial to understand how these are currently handled or missed in the `requests` API.\n  - `search_code(\"DecodeError\")`\n  - `search_code(\"TimeoutError\")`\n\nThese searches aim to highlight where in the `requests` codebase urllib3 exceptions are being handled or where such exceptions could escape without being properly wrapped. The findings will guide the next steps for crafting a patch to address the issue."
