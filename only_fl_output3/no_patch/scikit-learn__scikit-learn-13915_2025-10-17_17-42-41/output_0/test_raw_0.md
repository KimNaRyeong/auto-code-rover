Ensure that you have the correct environment as defined by the original problem (python 3.5.4, 32-bit, with the specified dependencies) when running `reproducer.py`. This script attempts to perform the operations that trigger the reported issue. If the issue persists, it prints out the stack trace using `print_stacktrace` and raises an `AssertionError`. It will exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed, evidenced by successful execution without entering the exception block.
