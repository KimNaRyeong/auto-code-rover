        "intended_behavior": "The `_minor_reduce` function should correctly accommodate the dtype of `X.indptr` when it's `int64`, particularly on 32-bit systems. This involves ensuring that operations such as `reduceat` that use `X.indptr[major_index]` as indices do not result in a TypeError due to unsafe casting from `int64` to `int32`. A potential fix could involve checking the dtype of `indptr` and performing a safe conversion or adjustment if necessary before calling `reduceat`. The key is to preserve the functionality while preventing data type-related errors across different platforms (especially 32-bit systems). The solution should maintain the existing logic for calculating min and max values in sparse matrices but add a layer of dtype compatibility to ensure smooth operation on all platforms."
