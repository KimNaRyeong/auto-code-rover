I understand that you are seeking a corrected attempt to reproduce the described issue, following the previous guidelines and incorporating the feedback based on the test results. Given the error was not related to the original issue described but to an `AttributeError` associated with `np.unicode_` which is a separate problem, I'll focus on crafting a script tailored to specifically check for the `sum` with `min_count` functionality within `xarray`.

Let's ensure that the script specifically attempts to reproduce the original issue regarding `sum` with `min_count` on multi-dimensional data, avoiding unrelated errors:

```python
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_sum_with_min_count():
    try:
        da = xr.DataArray([[1., 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dims=["dim_0", "dim_1"])
        # Attempt to increase clarity and correctness in specifying dimensions in sum
        result = da.sum(dim=["dim_0", "dim_1"], min_count=1)
        # Adjust the assertion error for correct result validation
        expected = np.array(21.0)  # Sum of all the elements in the array
        np.testing.assert_allclose(result, expected, err_msg="The computed sum is incorrect")
        print("Issue is fixed")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exist with non-zero exit code if an AssertionError is caught
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An unexpected issue occurred")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_sum_with_min_count()
```

**Modifications**:

1. **Dimension specification in `DataArray`**:
   - Ensured that dimensions are explicitly specified in the `DataArray` creation to avoid any ambiguity regarding dimension names and operations.
   
2. **Assertion Method**:
   - For comparing results, especially when dealing with floating-point numbers, `np.testing.assert_allclose` is used instead of a simple `==` check to compare the expected and actual results. This is more appropriate for numerical results to avoid precision errors.
   
3. **Error Handling**:
   - Utilized systematic approach to catch and handle both `AssertionError` (which indicates the issue is not fixed or another assert-related problem) and general exceptions (`Exception`) to cover unexpected failures.
   
4. **Exit Behavior**:
   - The script exits with code 1 upon catching an `AssertionError` to indicate a test failure. Otherwise, the script should exit with code 0, signaling success (i.e., either the issue is fixed or an unexpected issue is not related to the `sum` with `min_count` function).

Please ensure all library dependencies (`xarray`, `numpy`) are correctly installed and the environment is properly configured to run this script successfully.
