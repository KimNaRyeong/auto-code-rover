Below is a standalone Python script, `reproducer.py`, designed to specifically reproduce the issue as requested. This script incorporates the function to print the stack trace for clear visibility of the issue when it occurs. The script will attempt to perform a multi-dimensional reduction using `sum` with `min_count` on an `xarray.DataArray`. If the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError`, and if fixed, it will exit with code 0.

```python
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        da = xr.DataArray([[1., 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dims=["dim_0", "dim_1"])
        result = da.sum(["dim_0", "dim_1"], min_count=1)
        # Intending to capture if the operation fails, as the expected behavior should not raise an exception.
        print("Successfully performed sum operation with min_count on multi-dimensional DataArray.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit code 0 indicates success (i.e., the issue is fixed or not present).
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate failure due to the presence of the issue.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Usage**: Place this script in the root directory of the project and execute it by running `python3 reproducer.py`.

- **If the issue is present**: The script attempts the operation that is expected to fail due to the issue, catching any exceptions raised. If the mentioned issue occurs (related to `sum` with `min_count` on an `xarray.DataArray` with more than one dimension), the script will print the stack trace using the provided function and exit with code 1.
- **If the issue is fixed**: No exception will be raised during the operation; hence, the script will print a success message and exit with code 0.

This approach allows for a clear distinction between the current problem state and a corrected state, aiding in pinpointing the issueâ€™s presence and facilitating verification of a future fix.
