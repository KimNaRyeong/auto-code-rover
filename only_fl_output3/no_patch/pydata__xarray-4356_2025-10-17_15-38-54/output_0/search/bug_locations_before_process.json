        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the implementation of `_maybe_null_out` in `nanops.py` needs to be adjusted to support `min_count` parameter for reductions that span more than one dimension. Instead of calculating the null mask based on `mask.shape[axis]` which only considers a single dimension, the code should calculate the product of the shapes of all specified axes for the reduction. This can be achieved by replacing `mask.shape[axis]` with `np.take(mask.shape, axis).prod()` as suggested. This change would allow for a correct assessment of available data points across multiple dimensions against the `min_count` threshold, enabling the function to properly handle cases where `min_count` should influence the nullification of the result without raising an error for multidimensional reductions. This adjustment should preserve the existing functionality when reducing over a single dimension, ensuring backward compatibility and extending the capability to handle multidimensional cases as per the feature request."
