        "content": "To address the issue and gather enough context for resolving it, I will need to perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. To understand how `sum` is implemented and how it interacts with `min_count` for more than one dimension, first, locate the `sum` method in the context of xarray's data structures, since it's likely part of either a `DataArray` or a specific method that handles reductions like `sum`.\n\n2. Given the specific mention of a logic error in `nanops.py` and a direct link, it's important to review the current implementation around the mentioned line to understand the current logic for handling `min_count`. This would involve looking up the code near the provided link address.\n\nTherefore, the API calls I will invoke are:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"sum\", \"core/dataarray.py\")`: This will help understand how the `sum` function is implemented within the `DataArray` class or if it's located in another module for reductions.\n- `get_code_around_line(\"core/nanops.py\", 35, 10)`: Since the issue specifically mentions a suggestion for a code change in `nanops.py` around line 35, getting the code around this line will help assess the applicability of the suggested fix.\n\nThese API calls are aimed to gather sufficient context around the implementation of the `sum` method and the handling of `min_count`, especially when reducing along multiple dimensions."
