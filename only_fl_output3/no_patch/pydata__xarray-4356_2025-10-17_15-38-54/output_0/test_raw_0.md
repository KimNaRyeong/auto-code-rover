This script is designed to check if the issue described (where `xarray`'s `.sum()` method with parameter `min_count` raises an error when used with more than one dimension) is present. If the issue is present, it captures the exception and prints a formatted stack trace using the provided function `print_stacktrace`. In case the issue has been resolved (meaning the operation completes successfully and returns the expected sum of 21), it prints "Issue is fixed" and exits with code 0 indicating success without issues. 

The assertion for the correct sum (21) is a simple check to ensure that not only does the operation complete without errors, but it also returns the correct result.
