        "intended_behavior": "The method currently ensures that if a migration that is being unapplied has replaced migrations (indicating it is a squashed migration), it records each of the replaced migrations as unapplied. The intended behavior should also include a mechanism to explicitly mark the squashed migration itself as unapplied in the migration history. This could be through ensuring that after all replaced migrations are recorded as unapplied, there is also a check to see if the squashed migration's record needs to be updated to reflect its new state adequately. This ensures that the squashed migration, once fully unapplied (and all its replaced migrations are marked as such), is itself marked unapplied, preserving the integrity of the migration history and consistent state of the database schema as expected by Django's migration framework."
