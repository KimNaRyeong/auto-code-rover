        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the `MigrationExecutor` class and related code snippets regarding squashed migrations, let's dive into understanding the relationship between the provided code and the reported issue.\n\n### MigrationExecutor Class Context\n\n#### `unapply_migration` Method\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**  \n   The `unapply_migration` method, located in `django/db/migrations/executor.py`, is responsible for reverting a migration. Notably, it handles migrations that have been replaced (indicated by the `migration.replaces` attribute) by recording the unapplication of each replaced migration individually.\n   \n2. **Relationship with the bug:**  \n   According to the issue description, when squashed migrations are unapplied and the original migrations (replaced migrations) are still around, these original migrations are correctly marked as unapplied, but the squashed migration itself is not. Considering this method deals with marking migrations as unapplied and has specific handling for replaced migrations, it's directly related to the bug.\n   \n3. **Intended behavior:**  \n   In addition to marking the replaced migrations as unapplied, the intended behavior should also ensure that the squashed migration is marked as unapplied. The current code is likely missing a step to consider the squashed migration's own unapplication status.\n\n#### `apply_migration` Method\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**  \n   The `apply_migration` method forwards a migration, applying changes to the database schema and recording the migration as applied unless it's executed in a \"fake\" mode. It also has a provision for `fake_initial`.\n   \n2. **Relationship with the bug:**  \n   While this method focuses on applying migrations, understanding how it records migrations as applied is crucial for addressing the inconsistency in how unapplied states are managed, especially for squashed migrations.\n   \n3. **Intended behavior:**  \n   The recording behavior of migrations being applied could hint at what might be missing or mismanaged when unapplying squashed migrations.\n\n### Squashed Migrations Code Snippets\n\nWe have references to squashed migrations across multiple files, including `loader.py`, `graph.py`, `executor.py`, and management commands like `squashmigrations.py` and `showmigrations.py`. These references are instrumental in understanding how squashed migrations are treated within Django's migration framework but require further detail to pinpoint the exact issue and solution approach.\n\nGiven the insights from the reviewed code segments, the crux of the issue seems to be within the `unapply_migration` logic of the `MigrationExecutor` class, where the squashed migration itself needs to be marked as unapplied correctly under specific conditions. The absence of clear handling of the squashed migration's unapplied status when its replaced migrations are marked as unapplied suggests the need for an additional step or modification in this logic.\n\nTo better understand how squashed migrations are identified and handled in detail, especially in relation to marking them as unapplied, further investigation into the snippets found within `django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py` and potentially `loader.py` (which might deal with loading and identifying migrations, including squashed migrations) is warranted."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

The intended behavior should also include a mechanism to explicitly mark the squashed migration itself as unapplied in the migration history. This could be through ensuring that after all replaced migrations are recorded as unapplied, there is also a check to see if the squashed migration's record needs to be updated to reflect its new state adequately. This ensures that the squashed migration, once fully unapplied (and all its replaced migrations are marked as such), is itself marked unapplied, preserving the integrity of the migration history and consistent state of the database schema as expected by Django's migration framework."
