        "content": "To address the issue regarding a squashed migration not being marked as unapplied when the replaced migration files are still around, we need to gather more context about the functionality related to migrations, specifically around how migrations are marked as applied or unapplied and how squashed migrations interact with this process.\n\nLet's start by gathering information about the following:\n\n1. The class that is likely responsible for managing migrations \u2013 the `MigrationExecutor`.\n2. Methods within that class or related functionalities that deal with unapplying migrations and marking migrations as applied or unapplied.\n3. Any code that specifically handles squashed migrations, as the issue is directly related to squashed migrations not being marked unapplied correctly.\n\nBased on these needs, we can make the following API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"MigrationExecutor\")`: To get general context or the location of the `MigrationExecutor` class.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"unapply_migration\", \"MigrationExecutor\")`: Assuming that a method like `unapply_migration` exists and is responsible for the logic of unapplying a migration.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"apply_migration\", \"MigrationExecutor\")`: To understand how migrations are typically marked as applied, which might contrast with how they are marked as unapplied.\n- `search_code(\"squashed migration\")`: To find references to squashed migrations handling in the codebase, which might not be limited to the `MigrationExecutor` class or might involve specific functions or methods. \n\nThese searches should give us a solid foundation of code context to start addressing the issue."
