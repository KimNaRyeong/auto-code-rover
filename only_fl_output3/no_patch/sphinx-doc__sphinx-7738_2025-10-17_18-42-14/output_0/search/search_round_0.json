        "content": "To address the issue described, I will perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the class in the codebase**: Given that the issue is centered around how Sphinx with autodoc and napoleon extensions handles attribute documentation in a specific class (`A`), we need to start by getting more context about this class. This will help us see if there are any specifics in its declaration or in its docstring that might play a role in the encountered issue.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"A\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the class in the specific file**: Since the issue mentions the class `A` is contained within `a.py`, it's useful to directly inspect this class in its specific context to ensure we're not missing any file-specific configurations or annotations.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class_in_file(\"A\", \"a.py\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for the specific use of the attribute in documentation**: The issue describes a problem with the way an attribute `hello_` is documented. It appears with an undesirable backslash in the rendered HTML. Inspecting the direct documentation syntax within the codebase that references this problematic attribute could provide insights into whether the issue arises from a documentation syntax error or if it's indeed a Sphinx-related problem.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code_in_file(\"Attributes\\n----------\\nhello_: int\", \"a.py\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches provide a focused approach to understand the problem better by inspecting the class where the issue occurs, the file containing the class, and how the attribute is documented within the source code."
