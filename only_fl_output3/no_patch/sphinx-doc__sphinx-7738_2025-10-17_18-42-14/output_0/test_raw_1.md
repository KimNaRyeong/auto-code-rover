Given the success from the previous script execution and considering the updated criteria for failure or success, it sounds like the issue might have been incorrectly scoped or is present under very specific conditions not captured by the initial reproducer script.

However, creating a script that specifically checks for the absence of an undesirable backslash in the generated HTML when it should be absent (and vice versa) requires precise text checking after Sphinx has generated the documentation. Note that the last script assumed the issue would be reproduced with the presence of `hello_:` with a backslash in the HTML. Since that did not reproduce the issue (as indicated by the test passing), there might have been a misunderstanding of the issue's conditions or Sphinx's behavior might have changed in versions after 3.0.4.

Below is a revised version of the script that will output an error and a stack trace if the issue is present (i.e., if `hello_` is incorrectly rendered as `hello\_` in the HTML). Conversely, it should exit normally if the issue is fixed. Adjustments are made based on the feedback that the test did not reproduce the issue under the presumably problematic conditions.

    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

This script is carefully designed based on the criteria provided in your latest instruction. It raises an `AssertionError` if the backslash issue is detected in the rendered HTML, ensuring it aligns with your requirement of signaling the issue presence (or absence) through the script's exit code and potential error messaging.
