On the other hand, WSGIServer uses logging without providing a server_time. This gets \"fixed\" in ServerFormatter.format using self.formatTime(record, self.datefmt), which uses a completely different format.\nCurrently we make this at least consistent by providing the datefmt parameter when constructing the logger, but it would be better if they were coded to be in sync (and configurable?).\n(Looking into it further, it looks like we should be using %(asctime)s instead of %(server_time)s, but would be good if that were the suggested default. In \u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/1.10/#runserver-output-goes-through-logging we see %(server_time)s.)\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue regarding inconsistent datetime logging from runserver in Django 1.11 and higher, we need to look at several pieces of the Django framework where logging is set up and handled, especially around `runserver` command, `WSGIRequestHandler`, and `WSGIServer`.

Here are the necessary API calls to make:\n\n1. **Search for the `WSGIRequestHandler` class to understand how server_time is calculated and used for logging.**\n   - `search_class(\"WSGIRequestHandler\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `WSGIServer` class to investigate how it handles logging.**\n   - `search_class(\"WSGIServer\")`\n\n3. **Find the configuration or implementation of logging in the `runserver` command.**\n   - `search_code(\"runserver logging configuration\")`\n\n4. **Look for usage of `BaseHTTPServer.log_date_time_string` in the codebase to understand how it's utilized for logging datetime.**\n   - `search_code(\"BaseHTTPServer.log_date_time_string\")`\n\n5. **Investigate how `ServerFormatter.format` and `self.formatTime` are used, especially in relation to `datefmt`.**\n   - `search_method(\"format\")\n   - `search_method(\"formatTime\")`\n\n6. **Examine the context where `%(asctime)s` and `%(server_time)s` are used or recommended for logging configuration.**\n   - `search_code(\"%(asctime)s\")`\n   - `search_code(\"%(server_time)s\")`\n\nThese API calls are aimed at providing comprehensive insight into how datetime logging is implemented and configured within Django's runserver, the differences in datetime formatting between `WSGIRequestHandler` and `WSGIerver`, and how `ServerFormatter.format` adjusts the format.

        "content": "Analyzing the provided results and considering what we're looking for, let's delve into each piece of information:\n\n### 1. `WSGIRequestHandler` class in `django/core/servers/basehttp.py`\n- **What it does:** This class deals with handling individual WSGI requests. It inherits from `simple_server.WSGIRequestHandler` and likely overrides methods to handle Django's specific logging, environment setup, and request handling nuances.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The inconsistency in datetime logging could stem from how `log_message` is implemented here. Since the issue description mentions that logging from `WSGIRequestHandler` uses `server_time` differently, investigating `log_message` could reveal how datetime formatting is applied.\n- **Intended behavior:** `WSGIRequestHandler` should format log messages consistently with the rest of the Django server's logging system, possibly requiring a standardized use of datetime formatting.\n\n### 2. `WSGIServer` class in `django/core/servers/basehttp.py`\n- **What it does:** Represents the WSGI server. It is configured with specific settings like `request_queue_size` and has an initializer that might be relevant for server startup and error handling.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** Although this class was mentioned in the issue, without specific logging details here, the connection to the bug might be indirect. The inconsistency in logging could relate to how `WSGIServer` is initialized and how it interacts with request handling, particularly if it's missing standardized datetime formatting.\n- **Intended behavior:** While `WSGIServer` itself may not directly handle logging formats, ensuring its logging mechanisms align with Django's logging standards (potentially through its initialization and error handling) would be ideal.\n\n### The missing pieces and next steps:\n- **`runserver` Logging Configuration & `BaseHTTPServer.log_date_time_string`:** No direct results found. These might not be correctly referenced or could be parts of larger systems. To further investigate, we might need to look at how `django.core.management.commands.runserver.Command` sets up logging, as well as directly examining the files mentioned (for logging setup that doesn't explicitly mention `runserver` but affects it).\n- **Methods named `format` and missing `formatTime`:** The existence of multiple `format` methods across Django utilities suggests a need to review their implementations, specifically in `django/utils/log.py`, to understand how they contribute to log formatting. The absence of `formatTime` suggests either a misreference in the issue description or that Django defines this functionality differently. Exploring `django/utils/log.py` could provide insights into how Django formats time in logs.\n- **Missing references to `%(asctime)s` and `%(server_time)s`:** The inability to find these directly could indicate that these are part of larger formatting strings or logging configuration not captured explicitly by the search. It might be helpful to explore the files related to logging directly, such as `django/utils/log.py`, for how logging formatter placeholders are defined or recommended.\n\n### Adjusted API Calls for Further Investigation:\nGiven the gaps and insights, let's focus on:\n1. **Exploring `django.core.management.commands.runserver.Command` for logging setup.**\n   - `search_class(\"Command\")` within `django/core/management/commands/runserver.py`\n\n2. **Investigating direct logging implementation details in:**\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"log_message\", \"django/core/servers/basehttp.py\")`: To see how `WSGIRequestHandler` handles log formatting.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"logging\", \"django/utils/log.py\")`: To review how logging is globally configured, especially with respect to time formatting.\n\nThese steps aim to fill in the missing context, focusing on potential discrepancies in datetime logging configurations and implementations."

Given the issue, it would be beneficial for this method to utilize a configurable or unified datetime format, potentially aligning with the logging format used elsewhere in Django. This means, ensuring that the datetime logged by `log_message` uses the same format as that expected by `WSGIServer` and other parts of the framework, potentially through a shared configuration or standardized utility function for datetime formatting.\n\n### Bug Location 2:\n- **File:** N/A (Additional search needed or direct implementation advice)\n- **Intended Behavior:** Since there is an inconsistency noted but not enough direct evidence on where the `WSGIServer` logging configurations are managed or potentially conflicting, it's advised to ensure that wherever `WSGIServer` handles or emits log messages directly or indirectly should align with the standardized logging format mentioned above. This might involve reviewing and adjusting how logging is set up during the server's initialization (`__init__` method) or through its error handling mechanisms (`handle_error`). The aim is to unify the datetime format across all server logs to match the configured standard, ensuring consistency. \n\nWithout direct evidence or specific methods highlighted within `WSGIServer`'s logging mechanism via the provided search results, it's critical to further investigate or manually review `WSGIServer`'s interactions with the logging system to pinpoint where adjustments are necessary to achieve the intended, unified logging format."
