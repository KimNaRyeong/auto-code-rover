On the other hand, WSGIServer uses logging without providing a server_time. This gets \"fixed\" in ServerFormatter.format using self.formatTime(record, self.datefmt), which uses a completely different format.\nCurrently we make this at least consistent by providing the datefmt parameter when constructing the logger, but it would be better if they were coded to be in sync (and configurable?).\n(Looking into it further, it looks like we should be using %(asctime)s instead of %(server_time)s, but would be good if that were the suggested default. In \u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/1.10/#runserver-output-goes-through-logging we see %(server_time)s.)\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue regarding inconsistent datetime logging from runserver in Django 1.11 and higher, we need to look at several pieces of the Django framework where logging is set up and handled, especially around `runserver` command, `WSGIRequestHandler`, and `WSGIServer`. Additionally, the configuration of log formatting, including usage of `%(asctime)s` and `%(server_time)s`, will be important to review. Here are the necessary API calls to make:\n\n1. **Search for the `WSGIRequestHandler` class to understand how server_time is calculated and used for logging.**\n   - `search_class(\"WSGIRequestHandler\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `WSGIServer` class to investigate how it handles logging.**\n   - `search_class(\"WSGIServer\")`\n\n3. **Find the configuration or implementation of logging in the `runserver` command.**\n   - `search_code(\"runserver logging configuration\")`\n\n4. **Look for usage of `BaseHTTPServer.log_date_time_string` in the codebase to understand how it's utilized for logging datetime.**\n   - `search_code(\"BaseHTTPServer.log_date_time_string\")`\n\n5. **Investigate how `ServerFormatter.format` and `self.formatTime` are used, especially in relation to `datefmt`.**\n   - `search_method(\"format\")\n   - `search_method(\"formatTime\")`\n\n6. **Examine the context where `%(asctime)s` and `%(server_time)s` are used or recommended for logging configuration.**\n   - `search_code(\"%(asctime)s\")`\n   - `search_code(\"%(server_time)s\")`\n\nThese API calls are aimed at providing comprehensive insight into how datetime logging is implemented and configured within Django's runserver, the differences in datetime formatting between `WSGIRequestHandler` and `WSGIerver`, and how `ServerFormatter.format` adjusts the format. This information will be crucial for devising a patch that ensures consistent datetime logging across the server."
