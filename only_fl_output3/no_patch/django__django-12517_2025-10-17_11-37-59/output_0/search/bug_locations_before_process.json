Given the issue, it would be beneficial for this method to utilize a configurable or unified datetime format, potentially aligning with the logging format used elsewhere in Django. This means, ensuring that the datetime logged by `log_message` uses the same format as that expected by `WSGIServer` and other parts of the framework, potentially through a shared configuration or standardized utility function for datetime formatting."

        "intended_behavior": "Since there is an inconsistency noted but not enough direct evidence on where the `WSGIServer` logging configurations are managed or potentially conflicting, it's advised to ensure that wherever `WSGIServer` handles or emits log messages directly or indirectly should align with the standardized logging format mentioned above. This might involve reviewing and adjusting how logging is set up during the server's initialization (`__init__` method) or through its error handling mechanisms (`handle_error`). The aim is to unify the datetime format across all server logs to match the configured standard, ensuring consistency. Without direct evidence or specific methods highlighted within `WSGIServer`'s logging mechanism via the provided search results, it's critical to further investigate or manually review `WSGIServer`'s interactions with the logging system to pinpoint where adjustments are necessary to achieve the intended, unified logging format."
