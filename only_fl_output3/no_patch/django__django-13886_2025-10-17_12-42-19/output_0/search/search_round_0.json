This is not straightforward because resolving expressions with non-existent throws FieldError, so we cannot just collect columns from Query._gen_cols().\nFollow up to #26167.\nI attached tests.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue regarding system checks for invalid model field names in functional indexes, we will need to investigate how system checks are currently implemented and how functional indexes are handled within the project. Based on the issue description, the following API calls seem relevant:\n\n1. Search for the implementation of system checks to see how they are currently handling model fields. This can help understand the framework into which the new checks for functional indexes must fit.\n   - `search_method(method_name: \"check\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions \"resolving expressions with non-existent throws FieldError,\" it implies there's a mechanism for resolving expressions that we need to understand. This might involve looking into how expressions are processed or validated within models or indexes.\n   - `search_method(method_name: \"resolve_expression\")`\n\n3. The reference to `Query._gen_cols()` suggests that this method is relevant to the issue, possibly in how columns are generated or inspected for validity in the context of functional indexes.\n   - `search_method(method_name: \"_gen_cols\")`\n\n4. It could also be beneficial to understand how functional indexes are defined or processed within the Meta class of a Django model, which might involve searching for how indexes are specified or processed in the Meta options.\n   - `search_code(code_str: \"Meta.indexes\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide sufficient context around how system checks are currently implemented, how expressions are resolved, how columns are generated for queries, and specifically how the project handles functional indexes within the `Meta` class. This information will be crucial for crafting a patch that addresses the issue effectively."
