To resolve the issue, the intended behavior here should include a preliminary step where functional indexes are validated for the existence of model fields referenced in their expressions. This validation step would involve implementing a new system check mechanism prior to this point to ensure that only valid field names are included in functional indexes. The existing functionality for generating SQL remains the same, but it will be preceded by an additional validation layer to catch invalid field references early in the process."

        "intended_behavior": "Implement a new method or class method that leverages expression resolving logic (similar to `resolve_expression`) and column extraction logic (insight from `_gen_cols`) to verify the validity of field references within expressions used in functional indexes. This check should be designed to run as part of Django's system check framework, ideally before models are loaded or migration commands are run. It would iterate over each model's Meta.indexes, identify functional indexes, and validate that each expression within these indexes correctly references existing model fields. This method should handle expressions intelligently to ensure that complex expressions (e.g., those using database functions) are also validated correctly, without producing false positives or negatives."
