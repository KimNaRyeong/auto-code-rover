This can help understand the framework into which the new checks for functional indexes must fit.\n   - `search_method(method_name: \"check\")`\n\n2.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insights into the current implementation and how it relates to the issue at hand, which concerns adding system checks for invalid model field names in functional indexes. Let's break down each part:\n\n### django/db/models/sql/query.py (_gen_cols method)\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `_gen_cols` method iterates over expressions (likely part of a query construction process) and yields `Col` instances directly or explores source expressions of non-`Col` objects recursively to yield `Col` instances contained within them. It seems to be a utility for extracting column references from a potentially complex expression structure.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Since the issue involves functional indexes which may include complex expressions, `_gen_cols` might be a relevant point for understanding how expressions within indexes could be validated. However, the method itself does not contain logic for validation or error handling regarding nonexistent fields, which is the core concern of the issue.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Although directly unrelated to implementing the new checks, understanding `_gen_cols` is crucial. Ideally, to address the issue, one might need to ensure that similar logic to recursively analyze expressions is in place in the system checks, to validate fields referenced in functional indexes.\n\n### django/db/models/expressions.py and django/db/models/indexes.py (resolve_expression)\nThese files likely contain implementations for resolving expressions, which could be involved in constructing queries or indexes.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - These implementations of `resolve_expression` methods are probably responsible for processing query expressions, including how they are transformed, combined, or interpreted for query execution.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Since resolving expressions is a central feature of functional indexes (which may use expressions extensively), understanding this mechanism is key. The bug's resolution may involve ensuring that expressions used in functional indexes are correctly checked for valid field references without throwing unexpected errors.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Ideally, `resolve_expression` or similar mechanisms should be leveraged or accounted for in the new system checks, ensuring expressions in functional indexes are validated for correct field references, possibly before getting to the point where a `FieldError` would be raised.\n\n### django/db/backends/base/schema.py (_model_indexes_sql method)\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - It compiles index SQL statements for a given model, including field indexes, index_together, and Meta.indexes. It filters out models that do not require such processing due to not being managed, being proxies, or being swapped out.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - This method's involvement in processing `Meta.indexes` directly ties it to the issue at hand, as it is the mechanism through which SQL statements for indexes (including functional indexes) are generated.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Although this method is more about SQL generation than validation, understanding its operation can inform the development of system checks. System checks for invalid model field names could potentially be invoked prior to this point in the process, ensuring that any errors are caught early on.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps in addressing the issue might involve looking closer at where system checks could ideally intercept and validate functional index definitions, using insights from how expressions are resolved and how column references are extracted for indexes."

Here are the bug locations and the intended behaviors for each to resolve the issue:\n\n### Bug Location 1:\n- **File:** django/db/models/sql/query.py\n- **Class:** Query\n- **Method:** _gen_cols\n- **Intended Behavior:**\n  - While this method in itself is not buggy, it provides an insight into how expressions are iterated over and columns are extracted. No modification is needed here, but this insight informs the implementation strategy for the checks. The intended behavior around _gen_cols remains the same, but understanding it helps in developing a new system check to validate model field names in functional indexes without directly modifying this method.\n\n### Bug Location 2:\n- **File:** django/db/backends/base/schema.py\n- **Class:** BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor\n- **Method:** _model_indexes_sql\n- **Intended Behavior:**\n  - This method generates SQL for model indexes including functional indexes. To resolve the issue, the intended behavior here should include a preliminary step where functional indexes are validated for the existence of model fields referenced in their expressions. This validation step would involve implementing a new system check mechanism prior to this point to ensure that only valid field names are included in functional indexes. The existing functionality for generating SQL remains the same, but it will be preceded by an additional validation layer to catch invalid field references early in the process.\n\n### New System Check Location:\n- **File:** Not specified but potentially in a file related to system checks, e.g., django/core/checks/model_checks.py or a new file dedicated to index checks.\n- **Class:** Not specified, potentially a new class for handling index-related checks or extending an existing one.\n- **Intended Behavior:**\n  - Implement a new method or class method that leverages expression resolving logic (similar to `resolve_expression`) and column extraction logic (insight from `_gen_cols`) to verify the validity of field references within expressions used in functional indexes. This check should be designed to run as part of Django's system check framework, ideally before models are loaded or migration commands are run. It would iterate over each model's Meta.indexes, identify functional indexes, and validate that each expression within these indexes correctly references existing model fields. This method should handle expressions intelligently to ensure that complex expressions (e.g., those using database functions) are also validated correctly, without producing false positives or negatives.\n\nTo sum up, while two current locations are recognized for insight rather than direct modification, the resolution involves introducing a new system check that leverages existing Django mechanisms for expression evaluation and column extraction to validate functional indexes robustly."
