You already saved many souls of people writing technical documentation and probably also beyond this audience.\nWe just observed a minor woe with Sphinx' linkchecker we wanted to share with you. We really like that the linkchecker is able to check anchors within HTML documents as contributed by @intgr on behalf of #842.\nWith kind regards,\nAndreas.\n---\n**Describe the bug**\nWe had the link [1] in our documentation, and, maybe after upgrading to more recent versions of Sphinx, the linkchecker suddenly started croaking on that. After changing it to [2], it worked again. When inspecting the source code of the respective HTML page, you can clearly see that the anchor name `#user-content-make-changes` defined by\n```html\n<a name=\"user-content-make-changes\"></a>\n<a id=\"user-content-make-changes\" class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"#make-changes\">\n```\nis technically correct. However, it apparently has worked before by referencing `#make-changes`. So, we are wondering if something changed on GitHub's reStructuredText renderer or even Browsers interpreting the HTML link anchors differently. When invoking those links [1,2] in the Browser, actually both work, including navigation to the appropriate place within the page. Funny, hm?\n[1] https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst#make-changes\n[2] https://github.com/crate/crate-docs-theme/blob/master/DEVELOP.rst#user-content-make-changes\n**Expected behavior**\nTechnically, from the perspective we know our way around HTML, the behavior is probably the right thing and correct.\nHowever, as we can see, something might have been changed on the HTML standard that Browsers are capable of interpreting different styles of defining link anchors. So, it might be worth to revisit this space and maybe improve the linkchecker implementation on those aspects.\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Linux\n- Python version: 3.9.2\n- Sphinx version: 3.5.2\n- Firefox: 86.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the obtained context from the API calls, let\u2019s delve into each piece of information:\n\n### `check_anchor` Function in `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py`\nThe `check_anchor` function is designed to check if an anchor exists within the HTML content of a response fetched from a URL. Here's how it functions:\n- It takes a response object and an anchor string as input.\n- Utilizes an instance of `AnchorCheckParser` (a parser we don't have direct info about yet) initialized with the anchor it's looking for.\n- Reads the response content in chunks, attempting to find the specified anchor within the HTML.\n- If the anchor is found (`parser.found` becomes True), it breaks the loop early to avoid unnecessary processing.\n\n#### Relationship to the Bug\nThe bug report details an issue where the linkchecker starts failing on anchors that previously worked, concerning GitHub-rendered reStructuredText documents. The `check_anchor` function's behavior is central to this issue since it directly involves searching for anchors within HTML data.\n- **Intended Behavior:** Ideally, this function should correctly identify anchors regardless of slight variations in their format caused by different rendering engines or changes in HTML standards. Specifically, it should handle anchors prefixed with `#user-content-` (GitHub's way of rendering anchors in markdown and reStructuredText files) the same way it handles the ones without this prefix.\n\n#### Possibilities for Improvement\nGiven the issue description, we need this function to be more flexible in recognizing anchor references that might have variations in nomenclature, specifically the `#user-content-` prefix used by GitHub.\n\n### `process_link` Method Across Various Sphinx Components\nAlthough we lack specific details on each `process_link` method found in the search, it's reasonable to infer that these methods have some role in link processing throughout Sphinx's various domains (e.g., Python, C, JavaScript documentation). These methods likely involve parsing, generating, or validating links within those specific contexts.\n\n#### Potential Connection to the Issue\nWhile the `process_link` methods themselves might not directly involve anchor checking, their existence across different domains in Sphinx points towards a broader system of link handling that might interact with or use functions like `check_anchor`. It suggests a complex link processing mechanism that could, depending on implementation details, impact how anchors are validated or processed.\n\n### Next Steps for Collecting Context\nGiven the insights and the direct relevance of the `check_anchor` function to the issue, it would be beneficial to focus on components related to this function, including:\n1. The `AnchorCheckParser` class, to understand how anchors are being parsed and identified within the HTML content.\n2. Any utility functions or configurations that `check_anchor` might rely on to deal with different types of anchors.\n\nHence, the next API calls should involve:\n- Searching for the `AnchorCheckParser` class to understand its parsing mechanism.\n- Looking for any configurations or helper functions used by `check_anchor` to handle variations in anchor formats.\n\nThese steps will provide better insight into how the linkchecker distinguishes and verifies anchors and might reveal how it can be improved to accommodate the nuances presented by GitHub-rendered reStructuredText documents."

Its purpose is to facilitate the search for a specific anchor within an HTML document. The class:\n- Is initialized with a `search_anchor` string, which is the target anchor it's looking for in the HTML content.\n- Has a method `handle_starttag`, which likely examines HTML start tags to identify if the current tag contains the target anchor. \n\n### Relationship to the Bug\nGiven the bug report details, the issue arises when checking anchors in GitHub-rendered reStructuredText documents. GitHub modifies anchor tags by adding a `user-content-` prefix, which may not be recognized by the current implementation of `AnchorCheckParser`. The `handle_starttag` method's role in identifying start tags makes it a pertinent area for addressing this issue, as it's where the presence of an anchor is detected. The class's reliance on a specific anchor format means that any variations, like those introduced by GitHub, could lead to failed checks, even if the anchor technically exists within the document.\n\n### Intended Behavior\nTo resolve the reported issue, the intended behavior of `AnchorCheckParser`, specifically within its `handle_starttag` method, might involve several adjustments:\n- **Normalization of Anchor IDs:** The parser should ideally normalize incoming anchor IDs. This could involve removing known prefixes (`user-content-`) before comparison, ensuring that anchors are recognized irrespective of modifications introduced by external platforms like GitHub.\n- **Preservation of Existing Functionality:** Any modifications to the `AnchorCheckParser` must ensure that anchors without the `user-content-` prefix are still recognized. This balance ensures that the change doesn't inadvertently break existing documentation that relies on the current anchor handling behavior.\n- **Flexibility in Handling Anchor Variants:** Beyond handling this specific `user-content-` prefix scenario, the parser should be designed to accommodate future variations more gracefully, possibly through a configuration option that allows for the specification of known prefixes to ignore or a more dynamic way of recognizing anchors based on their presence within the HTML content, rather than strict string matching.\n\nAddressing the issue within the `AnchorCheckParser` class aligns directly with the needed adjustments highlighted by the bug report, ensuring that the link checker remains a valuable tool for Sphinx users managing documentation on GitHub and other platforms."

This entails:\n    - Adjusting the `__init__` method to accept additional parameters or configurations that specify known anchor prefixes to normalize or ignore during the parsing process.\n    - Enhancing the `handle_starttag` method to implement this normalization. When an anchor is encountered, the method should strip known prefixes before comparison to the target anchor ID. This ensures that anchors rendered differently (e.g., by GitHub) are still detected as valid, without losing the general utility and accuracy of the link checker for documents hosted across various platforms.\n    - Ensuring that these modifications do not disrupt the original functionality of detecting anchors that do not have the `user-content-` prefix, therefore preserving the tool's reliability for Sphinx users irrespective of where their documents are hosted or how they are rendered.\n\nThis solution aims to make the link checker more robust and versatile, specifically in handling variations introduced by external platforms like GitHub, while still serving its core purpose effectively across all supported documentation projects."
