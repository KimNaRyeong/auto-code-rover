        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n### Sitemap Class Analysis\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `Sitemap` class in `django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py` is responsible for generating sitemap information. It includes methods for defining items to be included in the sitemap (`items`), their locations (`location`), and additional configurations such as `limit`, `protocol`, `i18n`, `languages`, `alternates`, and `x_default` properties. The `get_urls` method likely compiles the sitemap URLs.\n   \n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The presence of `i18n`, `languages`, and methods like `_items` and `_location` within the `Sitemap` class suggests it handles aspects of internationalization. Since the issue revolves around the integration of i18n features with sitemaps\u2014specifically, restricting certain items from appearing in the sitemap based on language\u2014this class is directly involved in addressing the bug.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Intended behavior would include generating sitemaps that can conditionally include or exclude items based on the language. This might involve extending the `Sitemap` class to better handle language-specific items or URLs, which might not have been translated or available in all languages.\n\n### Missing I18n, `generate_cartesian_product`, and `language_url_integration`\n\n1. **I18n Handling**: The non-existence of a specific `I18n` class and the mentioned methods (`generate_cartesian_product`, `language_url_integration`) means that i18n functionalities might be integrated within other classes or modules in a way not directly inferred by their names. It suggests that internationalization might be handled more implicitly or distributed across several components, possibly within the Django framework itself or through the project's conventions.\n\n2. **Next Steps for API Calls**:\n   Given the absence of direct hits for an `I18n` class and specific methods, the next steps could involve:\n   - Searching within the `Sitemap` class for methods directly manipulating or interacting with `i18n` and `languages` properties. This can help understand how i18n is currently integrated.\n   - Looking into Django\u2019s documentation or source code might be necessary to understand default behaviors and possible extensions.\n   - Searching for how URLs are assembled and optionally filtered based on language within the context of sitemaps.\n\n### Recommended Next API Calls\n\nTo better understand the integration of i18n within the Sitemap functionality and find potential places for the enhancement, consider:\n- **Exploring methods in the `Sitemap` class handling languages**:\n  ```plaintext\n  search_method_in_class(\"_languages\", \"Sitemap\")\n  search_method_in_class(\"get_urls\", \"Sitemap\")\n  ```\n- **Examining code for i18n handling that don't rely on class names** (as direct search did not yield results):\n  ```plaintext\n  search_code(\"i18n\")\n  search_code(\"languages\")\n  ```\n\nThe next steps involve diving deeper into how the `Sitemap` class interacts with language-specific data and URLs, which should shed light on how to conditionally display items per language in the sitemap, addressing the issue described."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

However, a deeper dive into how sitemap URLs are generated with respect to internationalization settings could provide more specificity in implementing the solution.\n\n2. **Where are bug locations**:\n\n   **Location 1**: File: `django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py`, Class: `Sitemap`.\n   \n   - **Intended Behavior**: The class should be enhanced to allow finer control over which items are included in the sitemap for each language. This involves adding a new method or adjusting existing methods (potentially `items` or `get_urls`) to filter out items not intended to be displayed for specific languages. This method could leverage the existing `i18n` and `languages` properties to determine which items to include based on their availability or relevance in each language. The goal is to enable customizable item-language associations while preserving the existing functionality for cases where this level of control is not necessary.\n\n   - **Preserving Existing Functionality**: The existing method for generating sitemap items and URLs must continue to function as they currently do when no language-specific filters are applied. The default behavior should remain a complete representation of items across all languages unless explicit configurations are made to limit this behavior.\n\nIn sum, the issue highlights the need to build upon the Sitemap class's current handling of internationalization to permit conditionally displaying items in the sitemap based on language. By carefully extending the functionality within `django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py`, developers can resolve the issue without disrupting the current implementations that rely on a broader, language-indifferent item representation."
