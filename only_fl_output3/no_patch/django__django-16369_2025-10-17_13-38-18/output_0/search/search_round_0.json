As the issue mentions \"the current implementation of Sitemap\", identifying classes responsible for sitemap generation will provide a starting point.\n\n   ```\n   search_class(\"Sitemap\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for i18n handling classes**: Since the issue involves the interaction between sitemap generation and i18n (internationalization), identifying classes responsible for i18n might reveal hooks or functionalities that are currently used or could be extended.\n\n   ```\n   search_class(\"I18n\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for methods showing current i18n and Sitemap integration**: To understand how languages and URLs are currently handled, particularly the cartesian product issue mentioned, it would help to identify relevant integration points or methods that combine sitemap generation with i18n.\n\n   ```\n   search_method(\"generate_cartesian_product\")\n   search_method(\"language_url_integration\")\n   ```\n\nThe chosen API calls aim to gather context on the main components involved in the issue: the Sitemap generation logic, i18n handling mechanisms, and their current integration points, if any. This collected information will assist in understanding the problem space before devising a solution for conditional item display based on language in the sitemap."
