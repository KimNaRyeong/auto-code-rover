        "intended_behavior": "Add a new method to this class, perhaps named `get_inline_formset_initial_data`, which would allow developers to specify initial data for inline formsets. This method should accept parameters similar to existing methods (e.g., `request`, `obj`, etc.) to provide contextually relevant initial data. The method should return a dictionary or a list of dictionaries with initial data corresponding to the inline formset's structure. This new method doesn't alter existing functionalities but adds a new hook for developers to customize inline formset initial data. The addition of this method would require careful integration with the `get_formset` method within the same class, ensuring that the initial data is correctly passed to formsets when they are instantiated. This enhancement would parallel the functionality provided by `get_changeform_initial_data` but specifically target the nuanced needs of inline formsets, providing a flexible interface for developers to inject custom initial values into inline formsets in the Django admin."
