        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context on several components of the Django framework that are mentioned. The main components we'll be focusing on are the `modelformset_factory` function, how `form_kwargs` are handled, and particularly how the `empty_form` property of a formset behaves with respect to `empty_permitted`. Given this, let's outline the API calls required to get the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the modelformset_factory usage**: Since `modelformset_factory` is a function that generates a formset class for a given model, we need to see its definition or any specialization of it within the project that might handle `form_kwargs` differently.\n   \n2. **Search for formset handling in the project**: This involves looking into the base formset class, likely something like `BaseFormSet` in Django, to understand how `empty_form` is instantiated and how `form_kwargs` are passed down to individual forms, especially the `empty_form`.\n\n3. **Search for handling of `empty_permitted` within forms**: Since the issue arises with the `empty_permitted` argument, it's crucial to see how this specific flag is used within the form base classes.\n\nHere are the API calls I will invoke:\n\n- `search_method(\"modelformset_factory\")`: This will help us understand if the project uses `modelformset_factory` directly from Django or if there's a custom implementation/modification involved that impacts `empty_permitted`.\n\n- `search_class(\"BaseFormSet\")`: Fetching context about the `BaseFormSet` class will provide insights into the instantiation of `empty_form` and possibly highlight where the issue with `empty_permitted` could be arising.\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"add_prefix\", \"BaseForm\")`: Since the handling of form prefixes might be related to how `empty_form` and normal forms distinguish their fields, and `empty_permitted` might interact with these components, understanding this method could give valuable context.\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"Form\")`: Understanding how the Form class's constructor handles `empty_permitted` and other `kwargs` can give us clues about where the bug might be and how to approach a fix.\n\nThese searches are intended to uncover the necessary code context surrounding the creation and manipulation of formsets and forms with respect to the `empty_permitted` parameter, directly addressing the components involved in the issue."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the API calls provides insights into key parts of the Django framework that are relevant to the issue described.\n\n### Analysis of `modelformset_factory` in `django/forms/models.py`\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n\n- The `modelformset_factory` function creates a formset class for a given Django model, allowing batch form processing based on the model. It configures the formset with various parameters such as the form class to use, the number of extra forms to display, whether deletion/ordering is allowed, and other customization options.\n\n**Relationship to the bug:**\n\n- Since `form_kwargs` are specified during the formset creation in the issue description, it's relevant to understand how the factory function handles these kwargs. However, the part of the code provided doesn't detail the handling of `form_kwargs` directly, pointing to the need to further investigate where and how `form_kwargs` are utilized, particularly for `empty_form`.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\n\n- Given the issue, the intended behavior would involve correct handling of `empty_permitted` in `form_kwargs`, without causing a crash when rendering the `empty_form`.\n\n### Analysis of `BaseFormSet` in `django/forms/formsets.py`\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n\n- `BaseFormSet` is the foundation for managing a collection of forms. It includes functionality for iterating over forms, managing form prefixes, accessing forms via their indexes, and handling the `empty_form` for adding new records.\n\n**Relationship to the bug:**\n\n- The `empty_form` property is explicitly mentioned in the issue. The part of the code related to the instantiation and handling of `empty_form` could be where `empty_permitted` should either be included or excluded in `form_kwargs`. However, the specific handling of `form_kwargs` for `empty_form` is not shown in the provided code snippet.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\n\n- The intended behavior would be for the `BaseFormSet` to correctly recognize and, if necessary, ignore `empty_permitted` for `empty_form`, preventing the KeyError when `empty_form` is rendered.\n\n### Analysis of `add_prefix` in `BaseForm`\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n\n- The `add_prefix` method in `BaseForm` is responsible for concatenating a form prefix to a field name, which is essential for distinguishing between form fields in a formset context.\n\n**Relationship to the bug:**\n\n- While `add_prefix` deals with field naming within a form or formset, it doesn't directly relate to the handling of `form_kwargs` or the `empty_permitted` parameter. Therefore, its connection to the bug is tangential, focusing more on how forms within a formset are identified.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\n\n- In the context of the issue, the method's behavior is correct as-is; the prefix management is not the source of the issue related to `empty_permitted`.\n\n### Further Steps and Adjusted Analysis Needs:\n\nGiven the missing direct insights into the handling of `form_kwargs` for individual forms and `empty_form` within a formset, additional API calls are required. Specifically, insights are needed into how `BaseFormSet` initializes forms and handles `form_kwargs`, particularly with `empty_form`.\n\nThus, an appropriate next step would be to investigate the `BaseFormSet`'s `__init__` and `_construct_form` methods, or similar points where `form_kwargs` are processed and passed to forms, to understand the handling and propagation of `empty_permitted`.\n\n**Additional API Calls Suggestion:**\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"BaseFormSet\")`: To find details on how formsets are initialized, specifically how `form_kwargs` are set.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_construct_form\", \"BaseFormSet\")`: To explore how individual forms, including `empty_form`, are constructed within a formset, which may reveal how `empty_permitted` is handled."

Hence, I suggest the following API calls for more context:\n\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"BaseFormSet\")`: To uncover how `form_kwargs` are handled during the initialization of a `BaseFormSet` instance.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"_construct_form\", \"BaseFormSet\")`: To understand the detailed process of how individual forms, including the `empty_form`, are constructed and how `form_kwargs` are applied during this process.\n\n2. **Bug Locations:**\n\n   With the information currently available, it's not possible to pinpoint the exact locations of the bugs due to the need for further context mentioned above. However, based on the issue description and the collected context so far, a hypothetical bug location related to the handling of `empty_permitted` for `empty_form` in formsets can be anticipated:\n\n   - **Location 1:** `File: django/forms/formsets.py`, `Class: BaseFormSet`, `Method: __init__`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** The initialization method should correctly process `form_kwargs` to either exclude `empty_permitted` for `empty_form` or handle it in a way that does not lead to crashes when `empty_form` is rendered. This may involve adjusting how `form_kwargs` are stored or passed to forms within the formset, ensuring compatibility with `empty_form`'s unique nature. The existing functionality for other forms within the formset should remain unaffected.\n\n   - **Location 2:** `File: django/forms/formsets.py`, `Class: BaseFormSet`, `Method: _construct_form`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** In constructing each form, including `empty_form`, this method should apply `form_kwargs` in a manner that respects the intended use of `empty_form`. This could mean conditionally modifying `form_kwargs` for `empty_form` to either remove or neutralize the `empty_permitted` flag. It's crucial that this adjustment does not alter the intended functionality of other forms in the formset or the handling of `form_kwargs` for those forms.\n\nWithout further specific details from the suggested API calls, these locations are speculative and aimed at addressing the described issue based on the current understanding of the problem."
