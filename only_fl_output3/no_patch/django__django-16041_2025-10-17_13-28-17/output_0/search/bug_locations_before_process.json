        "intended_behavior": "The `_construct_form` method should incorporate a logic to handle the `empty_permitted` flag with nuance, especially for the `empty_form`. A proposed fix would be a conditional check to determine if the current form being constructed is indeed the `empty_form` and, based on that, apply or ignore the `empty_permitted` flag from `form_kwargs`. This ensures that:\n\n1. For `empty_form`, `empty_permitted` can be explicitly set to True or False as per its unique requirement, likely ignoring the value in `form_kwargs` to avoid raising KeyErrors when `empty_permitted` is explicitly passed and is irrelevant for `empty_form`.\n\n2. For all other forms in the formset, the `empty_permitted` flag, if provided in `form_kwargs`, will be applied as intended, allowing for the expected flexibility in form validation without impacting the special case of `empty_form`.\n\nThis modification ensures that the original functionality is preserved for normal forms in the formset, while also addressing the issue of `empty_permitted` causing crashes with `empty_form`. The implementation might involve adjusting how `defaults` are set within `_construct_form`, specifically ensuring that the `empty_permitted` attribute is set appropriately based on whether the form at hand is `empty_form`."
