        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context on several components of the Django framework that are mentioned. The main components we'll be focusing on are the `modelformset_factory` function, how `form_kwargs` are handled, and particularly how the `empty_form` property of a formset behaves with respect to `empty_permitted`. Given this, let's outline the API calls required to get the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the modelformset_factory usage**: Since `modelformset_factory` is a function that generates a formset class for a given model, we need to see its definition or any specialization of it within the project that might handle `form_kwargs` differently.\n   \n2. **Search for formset handling in the project**: This involves looking into the base formset class, likely something like `BaseFormSet` in Django, to understand how `empty_form` is instantiated and how `form_kwargs` are passed down to individual forms, especially the `empty_form`.\n\n3. **Search for handling of `empty_permitted` within forms**: Since the issue arises with the `empty_permitted` argument, it's crucial to see how this specific flag is used within the form base classes.\n\nHere are the API calls I will invoke:\n\n- `search_method(\"modelformset_factory\")`: This will help us understand if the project uses `modelformset_factory` directly from Django or if there's a custom implementation/modification involved that impacts `empty_permitted`.\n\n- `search_class(\"BaseFormSet\")`: Fetching context about the `BaseFormSet` class will provide insights into the instantiation of `empty_form` and possibly highlight where the issue with `empty_permitted` could be arising.\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"add_prefix\", \"BaseForm\")`: Since the handling of form prefixes might be related to how `empty_form` and normal forms distinguish their fields, and `empty_permitted` might interact with these components, understanding this method could give valuable context.\n\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"Form\")`: Understanding how the Form class's constructor handles `empty_permitted` and other `kwargs` can give us clues about where the bug might be and how to approach a fix.\n\nThese searches are intended to uncover the necessary code context surrounding the creation and manipulation of formsets and forms with respect to the `empty_permitted` parameter, directly addressing the components involved in the issue."
