        "content": "To address this issue effectively and gather enough context to create a patch, let's perform several API calls. Specifically, we aim to understand how the `exp` function is implemented and interacted with the simplification routines such as `simplify` and `expand_complex`. Additionally, since the periodicity in the context of imaginary numbers is crucial here, any related functionality or utilities for handling periodicity should also be identified. Here are the search requests I'd start with:\n\n1. Search for the `exp` function implementation across the codebase.\n2. Search for the `simplify` function to understand how it simplifies expressions, especially involving the `exp` function.\n3. Search for the `expand_complex` function to see its implementation and how it treats the `exp` function expressions.\n4. Also, it might be useful to look for any utility method or class that deals with periodicity, as improving or fixing the `exp` simplification might involve calculations or checks related to periodic expressions.\n\nAPI calls:\n- `search_method(\"exp\")`\n- `search_method(\"simplify\")`\n- `search_method(\"expand_complex\")`\n- `search_code(\"periodicity\")`"
