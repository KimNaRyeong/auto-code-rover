        "intended_behavior": "The `exp` function's implementation should be enhanced to automatically recognize and simplify expressions based on their periodicity, particularly for cases involving purely imaginary numbers. When an expression like `exp(I*pi*n)`, where `n` is a rational number, is presented, the function should utilize the property `exp(I*pi*n) = exp(I*pi*(n mod 2))` to simplify the expression to its simplest form. This preserves the existing functionality while enabling `exp` to handle expressions according to its periodic nature automatically. This would involve mathematically checking if the argument is a multiple of `pi` and simplifying accordingly without changing any core functionalities for non-periodic arguments."

        "intended_behavior": "The `simplify` function should be modified to specifically check for and simplify expressions involving `exp` with purely imaginary arguments utilizing their periodicity. While `simplify` is a generic method meant to handle a wide array of simplifications, introducing a special case or improvement for recognizing and utilizing the periodic properties of `exp` when faced with purely imaginary numbers would resolve the issue. The anticipated behavior is that calling `simplify(exp(I*pi*n))` will return a simplified version according to `exp`'s periodic nature, ensuring that all such expressions are reduced to their simplest periodic equivalent."
