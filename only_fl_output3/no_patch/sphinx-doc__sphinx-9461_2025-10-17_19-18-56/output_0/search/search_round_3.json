However, `type(BaseClass.baseclass_class_property)` returns the type of the returned object, since essentially, a `@classmethod@property` ends up behaving like a class attribute. So Sphinx doesn't really have a chance to extract the docstring.\n**EDIT 2:** Seems like this will get fixed in python 3.10, cf. https://bugs.python.org/issue43682.\n> Static methods (`@staticmethod`) and class methods (`@classmethod`) now inherit the method attributes (`__module__`, `__name__`, `__qualname__`, `__doc__`, `__annotations__`) and have a new __wrapped__ attribute.\nI will try to test this with the beta release.\n-----\n### Describe the bug\n> Changed in version 3.9: Class methods can now wrap other descriptors such as property().\nThat is, since python version 3.9 we can write code like\n```python\nclass A:\n@classmethod\n@property\ndef f(cls):\n\"\"\"Some class property.\"\"\"\nreturn \"property\"\n```\nHowever, sphinx does not seem to document any such methods (regular `@property` decorated methods get documented just fine.)\n### How to Reproduce\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/randolf-scholz/sphinx_demo\ncd sphinx_demo/docs\nmake html\n# open _build/html/dummy_module.submodule.html\n```\nThe following methods were erroneously not documented:\n- `MetaClass.metaclass_class_property`\n- `MetaClass.metaclass_abstract_class_property`\n- `BaseClass.baseclass_class_property`\n- `BaseClass.baseclass_abstract_class_property`\n- `SubClass.subclass_class_property`\n- `SubClass.subclass_abstract_class_property`\n### Expected behavior\nMethods that are decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property` should be documented appropriately.\n### Your project\nhttps://github.com/randolf-scholz/sphinx_demo\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nUbuntu 20.04.2 LTS\n### Python version\n3.9.6\n### Sphinx version\n4.0.3\n### Sphinx extensions\nsphinx.ext.autodoc, sphinx.ext.autosummary\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

This means ensuring that such methods are accessible to Sphinx in a way that Sphinx recognizes them as properties with docstrings, rather than as plain class attributes or methods without documentation. The resolution would likely involve either adapting the way these methods are declared to make them more Sphinx-friendly or adjusting Sphinx configuration (or adding custom Sphinx extensions) to handle this specific pattern of method decoration.\n\nWithout concrete code locations or further context, a conceptual approach to resolving the issue could involve:\n- **Review and Adjust Decorator Usage**: Ensuring that the use of both `@classmethod` and `@property` decorators is consistent with Python 3.10 changes that allow better documentation extraction. Even in Python versions before 3.10, exploring alternative ways to achieve the same functionality that might be more documentation-friendly.\n- **Extend Sphinx**: Create or customize a Sphinx extension to properly handle and document methods that are decorated with `@classmethod` and `@property` together. This custom extension could explicitly check for this pattern and ensure the docstrings and other relevant method attributes are preserved and recognized by Sphinx during documentation generation.\n  \nThis analysis assumes the broader context of the problem\u2014specifically, how Sphinx interacts with complex Python decorators\u2014and suggests a generalized direction for a fix.

However, no direct results were found for the @classmethod and @property decorators used together, which was the core of the reported issue.\n\n### Analysis of Sphinx Extensions Usage:\n1. **`sphinx.ext.autodoc` and `sphinx.ext.autosummary`**\n   - **What they do:** These are fundamental Sphinx extensions used for automatically documenting Python modules. `autodoc` pulls in documentation from docstrings, whereas `autosummary` generates summary tables for modules, functions, classes, and methods.\n   - **Relationship to the bug:** Given that the issue is with Sphinx not documenting certain decorated methods, the configuration and usage of these extensions are likely areas where adjustments may need to be made to accommodate the @classmethod/@property combination.\n   - **Intended behavior in this context:** To ensure that methods decorated with both @classmethod and @property are correctly identified and documented by Sphinx. This might involve altering how `autodoc` processes such decorated methods or ensuring that `autosummary` correctly lists these methods.\n\n### Next Steps for Resolution:\n- **Examine `autodoc` Configuration:** The `doc/conf.py` file and the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file are likely starting points for understanding how `autodoc` is configured and possibly extended in this project. Adjustments here could directly address the documentation issue.\n- **Review `autosummary` Configuration and Usage:** Similarly, `doc/conf.py` and files within `sphinx/ext/autosummary/`, such as `__init__.py` and `generate.py`, could contain configurations or customizations impacting the generation of summaries, especially for decorated methods.\n- **Custom Sphinx Processing for Decorators:** Considering the indicated change in Python 3.10 regarding method attributes inheritance by @staticmethod and @classmethod (including @classmethod/@property combinations), there might be a need for a custom Sphinx extension or directive to handle these cases correctly in Python versions prior to 3.10, or to ensure compatibility if Sphinx\u2019s default behavior hasn\u2019t adapted to this Python change.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the specific usage of @classmethod and @property in conjunction wasn\u2019t directly identified in the search results, the relation of the bug to the Sphinx configuration and extension usage is evident. The next steps involve a deeper examination of the configurations of `sphinx.ext.autodoc` and `sphinx.ext.autosummary`, appreciating their roles in the documentation process, and then implementing necessary adjustments or extensions to resolve the documentation omission of methods with these Python decorators."

However, based on the context gathered and the nature of the issue, recommendations for potential locations to investigate and adjust can be made:\n\n### Potential Bug Location and Adjustments:\n\n- **File:** `doc/conf.py`\n  - **Description:** This file configures Sphinx for the project documentation. It likely contains settings for `sphinx.ext.autodoc` and `sphinx.ext.autosummary`, which might need adjustments to correctly document methods decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property`. \n  - **Intended Behavior:** Configure `autodoc` and possibly `autosummary` to recognize and properly document methods decorated with `@classmethod` and `@property`. This may involve setting `autodoc` flags to more aggressively document class attributes or using a custom Sphinx extension to correctly handle these decorators.\n\n- **File:** `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`\n  - **Description:** Given its numerous matches and its role in defining autodoc\u2019s behavior, this module might contain logic that affects how decorated methods are processed and documented.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Ensure that the logic within this module accounts for Python\u2019s changed behavior in 3.10 regarding attribute inheritance by `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`, which affects documentation. A patch here might explicitly handle or better recognize `@classmethod` combined with `@property`.\n\n### Conceptual Fix in Absence of Specific Class/Method Locations:\nSince the direct investigation did not yield specific classes or methods, the resolution should broadly aim to enhance Sphinx's handling of the described decorators. This might involve:\n\n- **Enhancing Sphinx Configuration:** Adjusting the `doc/conf.py` to include directives or extensions that can handle this specific use case.\n- **Custom Sphinx Extension:** Developing a custom Sphinx extension that correctly identifies and documents these methods. The extension would explicitly check for methods decorated both as `@classmethod` and `@property`, ensuring their documentation does not get omitted.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWithout direct access to or identification of specific buggy classes and methods, the approach must be to configure Sphinx to better handle the documentation of methods decorated with `@classmethod` and `@property`. This solution maintains the existing functionality while ensuring that the documentation reflects these methods appropriately."
