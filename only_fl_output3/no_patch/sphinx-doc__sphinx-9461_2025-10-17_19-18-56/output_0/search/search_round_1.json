However, `type(BaseClass.baseclass_class_property)` returns the type of the returned object, since essentially, a `@classmethod@property` ends up behaving like a class attribute. So Sphinx doesn't really have a chance to extract the docstring.\n**EDIT 2:** Seems like this will get fixed in python 3.10, cf. https://bugs.python.org/issue43682.\n> Static methods (`@staticmethod`) and class methods (`@classmethod`) now inherit the method attributes (`__module__`, `__name__`, `__qualname__`, `__doc__`, `__annotations__`) and have a new __wrapped__ attribute.\nI will try to test this with the beta release.\n-----\n### Describe the bug\n> Changed in version 3.9: Class methods can now wrap other descriptors such as property().\nThat is, since python version 3.9 we can write code like\n```python\nclass A:\n@classmethod\n@property\ndef f(cls):\n\"\"\"Some class property.\"\"\"\nreturn \"property\"\n```\nHowever, sphinx does not seem to document any such methods (regular `@property` decorated methods get documented just fine.)\n### How to Reproduce\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/randolf-scholz/sphinx_demo\ncd sphinx_demo/docs\nmake html\n# open _build/html/dummy_module.submodule.html\n```\nThe following methods were erroneously not documented:\n- `MetaClass.metaclass_class_property`\n- `MetaClass.metaclass_abstract_class_property`\n- `BaseClass.baseclass_class_property`\n- `BaseClass.baseclass_abstract_class_property`\n- `SubClass.subclass_class_property`\n- `SubClass.subclass_abstract_class_property`\n### Expected behavior\nMethods that are decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property` should be documented appropriately.\n### Your project\nhttps://github.com/randolf-scholz/sphinx_demo\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nUbuntu 20.04.2 LTS\n### Python version\n3.9.6\n### Sphinx version\n4.0.3\n### Sphinx extensions\nsphinx.ext.autodoc, sphinx.ext.autosummary\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

This suggests that either the names might not be exactly as stated in the issue, there could have been a mistake in querying, or the relevant code might be defined in a less direct or more dynamic way than can be found with simple name-based searches.\n\nTo adapt, I propose to perform a broader search that could capture the relevant classes and methods indirectly or locate where and how the `@classmethod` and `@property` decorators are being applied together, which is the core of the issue. Since the exact class names were not found, a logical next step is to explore the codebase more broadly for patterns or usage that match the described bug. To do so, I will:\n\n1. **Search for usage of `@classmethod` and `@property` together:** Since the issue revolves around methods decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property`, finding instances where these decorators are used together in the codebase might lead to the relevant sections of the code even if the class and method names are not directly matchable.\n\n2. **Explore Sphinx Configuration or Related Documentation Files:** There might be a custom configuration or extension in Sphinx causing this documentation issue, so searching for Sphinx-related configuration files or comments might provide clues.\n\nGiven the need to adjust strategy based on the results so far, my adjusted API calls will aim to capture the broader context of decorator usage and Sphinx configuration within the project:\n\n- `search_code(\"@classmethod\\n@property\")`\n- `search_code(\"sphinx.ext.autodoc\")`\n- `search_code(\"sphinx.ext.autosummary\")`\n\nThese searches are designed to identify:\n- **Any methods that might be using the decorators in the described problematic pattern.**\n- **How Sphinx is configured or extended in the project, which might shed light on why these decorated methods are not being documented appropriately.**\n\nLet's proceed with these searches to gather more context."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Given the lack of specific information and code details from the API search results, pointing out exact bug locations, files, classes, and methods is not feasible without further context. \n\nHowever, based on the issue description, the intended behavior that needs to be preserved or achieved is clear:\n\n- **Intended Behavior:** The code where `@classmethod` and `@property` are used together should allow Sphinx to document these methods correctly. This means ensuring that such methods are accessible to Sphinx in a way that Sphinx recognizes them as properties with docstrings, rather than as plain class attributes or methods without documentation. The resolution would likely involve either adapting the way these methods are declared to make them more Sphinx-friendly or adjusting Sphinx configuration (or adding custom Sphinx extensions) to handle this specific pattern of method decoration.\n\nWithout concrete code locations or further context, a conceptual approach to resolving the issue could involve:\n- **Review and Adjust Decorator Usage**: Ensuring that the use of both `@classmethod` and `@property` decorators is consistent with Python 3.10 changes that allow better documentation extraction. Even in Python versions before 3.10, exploring alternative ways to achieve the same functionality that might be more documentation-friendly.\n- **Extend Sphinx**: Create or customize a Sphinx extension to properly handle and document methods that are decorated with `@classmethod` and `@property` together. This custom extension could explicitly check for this pattern and ensure the docstrings and other relevant method attributes are preserved and recognized by Sphinx during documentation generation.\n  \nThis analysis assumes the broader context of the problem\u2014specifically, how Sphinx interacts with complex Python decorators\u2014and suggests a generalized direction for a fix. Actual implementation details would require more context from the project's codebase or further experimentation with Sphinx's documentation generation capabilities and Python's descriptor protocol."
