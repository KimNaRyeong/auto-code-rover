Certainly! Below is the `reproducer.py` script. This script simulates the described scenario by defining a class with class methods decorated with `@classmethod` and `@property`, attempting to access their documentation, and asserting whether the documentation is retrievable or not. If the documentation is not retrievable (as would be the case if the issue described is present), it will raise an `AssertionError` and print the stack trace. If the issue is fixed, it should exit with code 0 without any errors.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


class A:
    _class_property = "property"

    @classmethod
    @property
    def class_property(cls):
        """Some class property doc."""
        return cls._class_property


def check_documentation():
    expected_doc = "Some class property doc."
    actual_doc = A.class_property.__doc__

    assert actual_doc == expected_doc, f"Expected documentation '{expected_doc}' but got '{actual_doc}'."


def main():
    try:
        check_documentation()
        print("Issue fixed. Exiting with code 0.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Remember, when the script is run with a Python version where the issue described persists (before the fix in Python 3.10 according to the bug report), it is expected to raise an `AssertionError`. For Python versions where the issue is known to be fixed (Python 3.10 and later, according to the details provided), it should exit with code 0, indicating the issue is resolved.
