        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to focus on the involvement of the `makemessages` command and its interaction with locale formats, especially in relation to how it checks and parses the locale string `nl-nl-x-informal`. The `DjangoTranslation` class's method `to_locale` seems to correctly handle this conversion, while `makemessages` appears to misinterpret it. Given the description of the problem, the following API calls would be necessary to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. Use the `search_method` API call to locate where the `to_locale` method is defined across the Django codebase since it's correctly doing the locale translation.\n   \n2. Since `makemessages` is a management command, it's likely defined in a specific file. We'll use `search_code` to find where `makemessages` command is implemented by looking for its name or related comments in the codebase.\n\n3. As the issue specifically references a commit \"https://github.com/django/django/commit/f63f3cdf0969c23fd0c05de0f4a2a1df0cd5112e\" that introduced the behavior, it's critical to examine the changes made in this commit to understand the current handling of locales, especially for patterns like 'nl-nl-x-informal'. However, since direct access to the commit changes is not provided via the given APIs, we'll concentrate on the affected functions or validations in `makemessages` related to locale validation or name transformation.\n\nGiven these considerations, the API calls needed are:\n\n- `search_method(\"to_locale\")`\n- `search_code(\"makemessages\")`\n\nThese calls will help identify where in the codebase the relevant logic for `to_locale` method and `makemessages` command is defined, providing necessary context for addressing the mismatch issue."
