Given the instructions and the need to correct the execution pathway, let's adjust the `reproducer.py` script. This version will focus on preserving the dtypes in the output DataFrame from a transformer explicitly, and it will incorporate the specified function for printing the stack trace in case of an AssertionError. Here's the corrected script setup:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_preserve_dtypes():
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, chi2

    X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)
    X = X.astype(
        {
            "petal width (cm)": np.float16,
            "petal length (cm)": np.float16,
        }
    )
    X["cat"] = y.astype("category")

    selector = SelectKBest(chi2, k=3)
    
    X_out = selector.fit_transform(X, y)

    # Check if the output indeed returns a DataFrame when expected
    if not isinstance(X_out, pd.DataFrame):
        raise AssertionError("Output is not a DataFrame as expected.")

    try:
        # Checking if the dtype for a selected column that was originally float16 remains unchanged.
        # Please note, as of the current implementation, categorical columns or columns not selected
        # by SelectKBest will not be present in X_out.
        assert X_out.dtypes['petal width (cm)'] == np.float16, "Dtype for 'petal width (cm)' was not preserved"

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

    print("All checks passed successfully.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_preserve_dtypes()
```

This script will exit with code 1 upon encountering an issue related to dtype preservation, specifically if the selected `petal width (cm)` column does not maintain its original `np.float16` dtype after transformation with `SelectKBest`. If the types are preserved as expected, or if the function operates successfully without assertion errors, the script will not explicitly exit with code 0 due to Python's default behavior, but will print a success message indicating that all checks have passed.
