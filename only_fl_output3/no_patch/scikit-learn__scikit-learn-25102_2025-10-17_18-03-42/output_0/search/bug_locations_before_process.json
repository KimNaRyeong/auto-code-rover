This requires modifying this method to not only decide based on the configuration whether to wrap the data into a DataFrame but also to consider the dtypes of the original input for preservation. If dtype preservation is specified, the method should collect the dtypes of 'original_input' and ensure these are passed to '_wrap_in_pandas_container', enabling it to preserve these dtypes in the final output."
