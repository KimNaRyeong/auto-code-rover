Certainly, let's create a Python script named `reproducer.py` that follows your guidelines. This script will try to replicate the issue as you described, regarding the preservation of `dtypes` in DataFrame outputs by transformers, particularly when these transformers do not modify the input values. Here's a proposal for the script:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_preserve_dtypes():
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, chi2

    X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)
    # Change dtypes for a couple of columns and add a categorical column
    X = X.astype(
        {
            "petal width (cm)": np.float16,
            "petal length (cm)": np.float16,
        }
    )
    X["cat"] = y.astype("category")

    # Assuming set_output is a hypothetical function to configure output format
    selector = SelectKBest(chi2, k=2)
    try:
        selector.set_output(transform="pandas")  # This line might change based on actual API improvements
    except AttributeError:
        # For compatibility with current API versions where set_output might not exist
        pass
    
    try:
        X_out = selector.fit_transform(X, y)
        # Expected dtype preservation
        expected_dtypes = {
            "petal length (cm)": np.float16,
            "cat": "category"
        }

        for col, expected_dtype in expected_dtypes.items():
            actual_dtype = X_out.dtypes[col]
            assert actual_dtype == expected_dtype, f"Dtype for {col} was not preserved. Expected: {expected_dtype}, got: {actual_dtype}"
        print("Dtypes preserved as expected.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_preserve_dtypes()
```

This script attempts to perform a transformation using `SelectKBest` from `scikit-learn`, intending to preserve the data types of the original DataFrame columns (`np.float16` and `category`). The hypothetical `set_output` method call is included to illustrate the desired behavior, though it might not exist in the current API (as of version `1.2.dev0` mentioned). If the data types of the selected features are not preserved after the transformation, the test will fail, triggering an `AssertionError` and printing a stack trace.
