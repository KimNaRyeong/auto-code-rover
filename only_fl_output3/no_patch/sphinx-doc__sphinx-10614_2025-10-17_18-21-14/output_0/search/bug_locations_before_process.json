The fix should ensure that when an SVG diagram is embedded in a document not at the root level, the links within the SVG correctly consider the document's position in the directory structure to avoid resulting in 404 errors. This could involve modifying how the paths are calculated within this class, potentially introducing a new method to correctly calculate the relative paths based on the document embedding the SVG, or adjusting the existing logic to account for the embedding document's location."

If this file contributes to processing or embedding SVG content, it may need adjustments to correctly handle path resolution for links within SVGs. The specific method(s) responsible for this might need to be examined and modified to ensure that paths are correctly computed, taking the embedding document\u2019s location into account."
