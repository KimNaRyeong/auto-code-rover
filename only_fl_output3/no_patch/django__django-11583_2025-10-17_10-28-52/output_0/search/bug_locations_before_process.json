        "intended_behavior": "To address the issue of \"ValueError: embedded null byte,\" the `snapshot_files` method needs to be enhanced to preemptively detect and appropriately handle file paths that contain null bytes before attempting operations like `file.stat().st_mtime`. Since Python's os and pathlib modules do not support paths with null bytes, adding a validation step to filter out or manage such paths could prevent this error from occurring. The enhancement should maintain the functionality of watching for file changes without crashing due to invalid file paths. This could involve logging a warning about the problematic path and skipping it or attempting to sanitize the path if possible. The key is to ensure that the auto-reloader continues to function smoothly even when encountering problematic file paths, without deviating from its primary role of tracking file modifications for the purpose of reloading."
