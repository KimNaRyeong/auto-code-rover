Certainly! Based on the requirement to reproduce an issue specifically focused on in-place addition of `xarray.DataArray` elements that are not aligned due to different coordinate orders, I'll provide a Python script that attempts to perform this in-place addition, catches any errors, and then uses the `print_stacktrace` function to clearly outline where and why the issue occurs if not resolved. This tries to faithfully replicate the issue described:

```python
# reproducerer.py
import numpy as np
import xarray as xr
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    n = 5

    d1 = np.arange(n)
    np.random.shuffle(d1)
    A = xr.DataArray(np.ones(n), coords=[('dim', d1)])

    d2 = np.arange(n)
    np.random.shuffle(d2)
    B = xr.DataArray(np.ones(n), coords=[('dim', d2)])

    try:
        print("Attempting in-place addition...")
        A += B
        print("In-place addition succeeded.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script is set up to explicitly attempt the in-place addition operation that you described as problematic, with arrays `A` and `B` having their coordinates shuffled to ensure they're likely in different orders. The script will catch any exceptions thrown during this operation, invoke `print_stacktrace` to print details about the error, and exit with status code 1 to indicate the presence of the problem. 

If the operation succeeds without raising an exception, it prints a success message. This behavior ensures that the script exits with status code 0 only when the specific issue you described has been resolved, aligning with your requirement for a reproducer script.
