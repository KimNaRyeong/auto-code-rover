        "intended_behavior": "Given the error encountered during in-place addition when `DataArray` objects have differently ordered but otherwise identical dimensions, the intended behavior here should involve enhancing `merge_coordinates_without_align` to more gracefully handle or align such instances before merging. This could involve implementing a check or an alignment step that ensures that even if `DataArray` objects have differing orders of coordinates, they are first reordered or aligned in a manner that allows for in-place operations (like `+=`) to proceed without throwing a `MergeError`. This adjustment should respect the existing functionality to merge coordinates without alignment when necessary but provide an additional step for handling scenarios where in-place operations are involved, preserving data integrity and order."
