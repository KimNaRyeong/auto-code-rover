The issue description mentions an abnormal behavior when attempting to extract multiplicative elements from expressions, specifically when dealing with negative coefficients. The mention of `core/expr.py` suggests we look into this file for the `Mul` class or the `extract_multiplicatively` method itself. The mention of a commit by `@smichr` and the behavior of `.primitive()` method could also be important.\n\nGiven this, here are the API calls we should make to gather the required context:\n\n1. Search for the `Mul` class within `core/expr.py` to understand the implementation details of multiplication, especially in non-evaluated states.\n2. Search for the `extract_multiplicatively` method within the entire codebase since it's not explicitly mentioned where it's defined.\n3. Since the `.primitive()` method's behavior is highlighted as part of the problem, searching for the implementation of `primitive` might also provide valuable insights.\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class_in_file(\"Mul\", \"core/expr.py\")\nsearch_method(\"extract_multiplicatively\")\nsearch_method(\"primitive\")\n```"
