        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `extract_multiplicatively` method to ensure that it handles negative coefficients and factors correctly. This involves either adjusting the direct interaction with the `primitive` method within `extract_multiplicatively` or implementing a new logic that allows `extract_multiplicatively` to recognize and factor out negative terms effectively. The important aspect is to retain the method's ability to decompose expressions into multiplicative factors, whether the factors are positive or negative, without losing the generality of its application. The intended update should not disrupt the method's current handling of positive factors but should extend its capability to address scenarios involving negative numbers in a mathematically consistent manner."

        "intended_behavior": "While the `primitive` method itself may not be directly faulty regarding the issue at hand, a clarifying enhancement or documentation might be warranted about its interaction with negative coefficients, particularly in how this outcome is utilized by `extract_multiplicatively`. It's crucial that `primitive` continues to extract common factors correctly, but additional documentation or minor adjustments could be made to ensure its output is correctly interpreted or used by other methods when negative numbers are involved. This might include a footnote or a helper utility within `primitive` for handling negative extraction scenarios, ensuring that the positive rational extraction core functionality remains unaffected, but its usage in broader contexts is more intuitively understood."
