        "content": "Here is a standalone script named `reproducer.py` that demonstrates how to reproduce the issue regarding the incorrect LaTeX representation with unevaluated `Mul` in SymPy. This script checks if there is a missed `numbersep` between numbers when `latex(Mul(6, S.Half, evaluate=False))` is executed, causing it not to output as expected. It raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is present and prints a stack trace using the provided function. If the issue is resolved, the script should exit with code 0.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\n\ndef main():\n    from sympy import Mul, S\n    from sympy.printing.latex import latex\n\n    # Expected to see some form of separation (e.g., a space or cdot) between 6 and 1/2\n    expected_output = \"6 \\\\frac{1}{2}\"\n    actual_output = latex(Mul(6, S.Half, evaluate=False))\n    try:\n        # Checking if the actual LaTeX representation includes number separation\n        assert expected_output in actual_output, \"Incorrect LaTeX representation, missing number separation\"\n        print(\"Issue fixed!\")\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nTo run this script, save it as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project. Then, execute it by running `python3 reproducer.py` from a terminal or command prompt. The script will check if the LaTeX representation is incorrect due to missing number separation when `Mul` is unevaluated. If the issue is detected (indicating the problem is present), it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace of the problem. If the condition for the issue does not hold (meaning the problem might have been fixed or does not exist), you'll see \"Issue fixed!\" printed to the standard output and the script will exit with code 0."
