First, I need to find which file or class defines the `Mul` functionality as it is directly related to the issue. Thus, I will search for the `Mul` class.\n2. Since the problem is specifically related to latex representation, I assume there should be a method possibly named something related to latex, like `latex`, within the context of the `Mul` class or related to it globally. I'll need to search for this method as well.\n3. Finally, knowing the issue arises from a combination of `Mul` and `S.Half` without evaluation, it's likely the bug is in the handling of number separation in the latex output, so searching for a specific code snippet related to latex output generation in the context of `Mul` could be helpful.\n\nHere are my API calls based on the steps above:\n\n- search_class(\"Mul\")\n- search_method(\"latex\")"
