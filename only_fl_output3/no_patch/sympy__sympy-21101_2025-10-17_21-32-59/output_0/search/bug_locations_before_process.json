        "intended_behavior": "The `latex` function should be modified or ensure that within its call to `LatexPrinter(settings).doprint(expr)`, it accurately represents unevaluated `Mul` expressions with correct number separation in the LaTeX output. This means when a `Mul` expression with `evaluate=False` is passed, the LaTeX representation should include a space or a LaTeX-compatible symbol to visually separate the numbers involved in the multiplication. This change should preserve the function's ability to handle all other expressions as it currently does, only adding or modifying its behavior to handle the specific case of unevaluated `Mul` expressions better."
