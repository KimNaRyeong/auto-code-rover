        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` Class\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThe `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class in `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py` is responsible for generating and checking password reset tokens. It includes methods for creating a token, checking its validity, and generating a hash value that is used to secure the token. The `_make_hash_value` method is particularly important here as it combines user data and a timestamp to produce a unique hash used in token generation.\n\n**Relationship with the Bug**\n\nThe issue states that changing a user's email does not invalidate a previously issued password reset token. The `_make_hash_value` method does not include the user's email in its hash. It relies on the user's primary key, password, last login timestamp, and the token's timestamp for generating the hash. Since the email is not part of this hash, changing the email does not affect the validity of existing tokens.\n\n**Intended Behavior after Fix**\n\nTo fix the issue, the user's email should be incorporated into the hash value generated by `_make_hash_value`. This way, any change to the user's email would alter the hash value, making previously issued tokens invalid, as their hashes won't match when checked.\n\n#### 2. `AbstractBaseUser` Class\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\n\n`AbstractBaseUser` in `django/contrib/auth/base_user.py` serves as a base class for the Django user model. It includes basic user fields and methods, including password management, session authentication hash generation, and more. This class defines the skeleton of user authentication functionality in Django.\n\n**Relationship with the Bug**\n\nThe issue suggests that, since the `AbstractBaseUser` class does not enforce the presence of an email field (meaning users are not required to have an email), the password reset token generation mechanism (`PasswordResetTokenGenerator`) must be flexible enough to handle cases where a user object might not have an email. Therefore, simply adding an email to the hash without considering this flexibility could lead to problems in systems that use a custom user model without an email field.\n\n**Intended Behavior after Fix**\n\nThe solution needs to ensure that emails (if present) are included in the password reset token's hash in a way that respects the variability allowed by `AbstractBaseUser`. This might involve checking if an email field exists for the user and only including it in the hash if it does. This approach should maintain compatibility with custom user models that do not have an email field.\n\n#### Next Steps\n\nGiven these insights, the next step involves drafting a modification to the `_make_hash_value` method that includes the user's email in the hash if it exists. Additionally, considering a generic way to include crucial user fields in the hash generation process might be a step forward in making the Django authentication system more robust and flexible. To implement these changes, we'll need to look into how to safely incorporate the user's email into the hash and ensure that this solution adheres to Django's design philosophy of supporting custom user models."

However, given that not all user models are required to have an email field (as per the flexibility allowed by `AbstractBaseUser`), this addition must be done conditionally.\n\nThe method should first check if the user model has an attribute for an email. If an email attribute exists and has a value, this email should be included in the string that is hashed to generate the token. This ensures that any change to the user's email will result in a different hash value, thereby invalidating previously issued tokens when the email is changed.\n\n- **Existing Implementation:**\n\n```python\ndef _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):\n    login_timestamp = '' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)\n    return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(timestamp)\n```\n\n- **Proposed Change:**\n\n```python\ndef _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):\n    login_timestamp = '' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)\n    user_email = user.email if hasattr(user, 'email') else ''\n    return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + user_email + str(timestamp)\n```\n\nThis change ensures that:\n- The token becomes invalid once the user's email changes, addressing the reported issue by making the system more secure.\n- It retains compatibility with custom user models that might not include an email field, ensuring wide applicability and maintaining the system's existing functionality."
