        "intended_behavior": "The `_make_hash_value` method should be modified to include the user's email address in the hash value that it generates, alongside the user's primary key, the hashed password, and the timestamp. However, this addition must be done conditionally, ensuring compatibility with user models that may not have an email field. The update intends to invalidate tokens upon email change, enhancing security while maintaining functionality with custom user models."
