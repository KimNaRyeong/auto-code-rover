I suspect that there might be some inconsistencies in the type conversions here somehow.\nI've created a few testcase to illustrate the problem on current git main: \u200bhttps://github.com/matthijskooijman/django/commit/3470b98b42c39fd9a9a4e1443341f16780da7a98 and see below.\n@override_settings(DEBUG=True)\ndef test_00compare_field(self):\n\"\"\"Comparing a Case

I tried printing the QuerySet.query attribute first, but that seems to hide the quotes around the literal 0 in the query, so took me a while to realize what was happening. The numbers in the testcase names are to ensure the SQL queries are printed in a recognizable order.\nAll four testcases work on MySQL, there the 0 value is written in the query without the quotes, and the cast to NUMERIC is also missing.\nI suspect this issue is highly similar to #18247, and can a fix can probably build on the fix for that issue.\n</issue>"

It translates a set of conditions into the SQL `CASE` statement.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: The bug potentially involves how `Case` expressions that output `DecimalField` values are rendered to SQL for SQLite, possibly missing necessary casts or misformatting values.\n- **Intended behavior**: `Case` should produce a valid SQL expression that accurately reflects the conditional logic defined in Django, with type consistency for comparisons and calculations, especially for `DecimalField` types.\n\n### ExpressionWrapper: `django/db/models/expressions.py`\n- **What it does**: Wraps expressions, allowing one to specify the output field type explicitly. This is crucial for ensuring that the resulting SQL expression has the correct type, particularly for database backends with strict type checking.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: The issue might relate to how `ExpressionWrapper` handles or fails to handle the type conversion for `DecimalField` when used with SQLite, leading to mismatches in expected vs. actual values or types in SQL expressions.\n- **Intended behavior**: Ensure type consistency by correctly informing the database of the expected output type for any expression, including those involving decimals and conditional logic.\n\n### Value: `django/db/models/expressions.py`\n- **What it does**: Represents a fixed value within a query. This is useful for inserting constants into queries, which can then be compared or manipulated just like values sourced from the database.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: The usage of `Value` with `DecimalField` in the context of SQLite might be generating incorrect SQL, possibly due to type misrepresentation or incorrect casting.\n- **Intended behavior**: To inject literals into a query that are appropriately cast or treated according to their defined `output_field`, maintaining consistent operational behavior with values from the database.\n\n### Analysis of the Unfound Code References\nThe absence of direct references in the codebase for expressions like `output_field=models.fields.DecimalField`, `models.ExpressionWrapper`, and `models.Case` suggests that looking for them without the full module path or context may not yield results. Adjusting the search to include more of the context surrounding their use, perhaps by inspecting specific query construction mechanisms or the interaction between model fields and expressions more deeply, could be necessary.\n\n### Next Steps to Uncover More Context\nGiven the above analysis, it seems prudent to further explore:\n1. How queries involving `DecimalField` and expressions like `Case` or `ExpressionWrapper` are compiled into SQL for SQLite, focusing specifically on type casting and value comparison mechanisms.\n2. Possible differences in the handling of decimals in SQLite versus other databases supported by Django, considering Django's abstraction layer might not fully account for SQLite's type affinities and casting rules.\n\nTo get this further context, following steps might include:\n- Review the `get_db_prep_save` and `get_prep_value` methods within `DecimalField` for insights into the preparation and casting of decimal values.\n- Explore the `as_sql` methods of `Case` and `ExpressionWrapper` to understand how they formulate SQL expressions, particularly how output field types are incorporated or neglected.\n\nThese explorations could uncover specifics that would guide the formulation of a patch addressing the inconsistencies described in the issue."

The intended behavior is to preserve the decimal context of the values, such that when they're used in operations like comparisons within a `Case` statement or wrapped in an `ExpressionWrapper`, the SQL generated by Django maintains the appropriate type information. This will ensure that comparisons and operations involving `DecimalField` annotations behave as expected across all supported databases, including SQLite. \n\n### Bug Location 2:\n- **File**: `django/db/models/expressions.py`\n- **Class**: `Case`\n- **Method**: `as_sql`\n- **Intended Behavior**: Modify the `as_sql` method to include explicit type casting for `DecimalField` output within SQLite SQL generation. This adjustment ensures that `Case` expressions resulting in decimal values remain consistent in type, matching the explicit definitions within the Django model field. Specifically, it should prevent type misinterpretation in SQLite by either casting the output of `Case` statements to decimals as needed or by ensuring the output matches the declared field type.\n\n### Bug Location 3:\n- **File**: `django/db/models/expressions.py`\n- **Class**: `ExpressionWrapper`\n- **Method**: `as_sql`\n- **Intended Behavior**: The `as_sql` method should be revised to ensure that expressions wrapped by `ExpressionWrapper` with an output field of `DecimalField` are correctly handled when constructing SQL queries for SQLite. This means that any literal values or expressions that result in a decimal output should be explicitly cast to the appropriate type in the SQL query, preserving decimal accuracy and consistency with the type defined in the Django model.\n\nThese changes aim to address the core issue of inconsistent type handling and comparisons for `DecimalField` in SQLite, aligning the behavior with that observed in other database backends like MySQL, and maintaining the functionality of `DecimalField`, `Case`, and `ExpressionWrapper` across all supported databases."
