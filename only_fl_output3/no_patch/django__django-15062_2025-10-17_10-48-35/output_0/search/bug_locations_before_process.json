The intended behavior is to preserve the decimal context of the values, such that when they're used in operations like comparisons within a `Case` statement or wrapped in an `ExpressionWrapper`, the SQL generated by Django maintains the appropriate type information. This will ensure that comparisons and operations involving `DecimalField` annotations behave as expected across all supported databases, including SQLite."

This adjustment ensures that `Case` expressions resulting in decimal values remain consistent in type, matching the explicit definitions within the Django model field. Specifically, it should prevent type misinterpretation in SQLite by either casting the output of `Case` statements to decimals as needed or by ensuring the output matches the declared field type."

This means that any literal values or expressions that result in a decimal output should be explicitly cast to the appropriate type in the SQL query, preserving decimal accuracy and consistency with the type defined in the Django model."
