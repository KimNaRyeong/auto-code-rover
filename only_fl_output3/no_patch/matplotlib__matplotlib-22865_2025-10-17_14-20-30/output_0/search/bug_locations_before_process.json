        "intended_behavior": "The `Colorbar` class needs an adjustment or addition to its methods to ensure that when `drawedges=True` and `extend='both'` are set, the colorbar edges at the extremities are correctly drawn. This should be achieved without affecting the existing functionality for colorbars where `drawedges` is `False` or `extend` is not set to `'both'`. Specifically, the method responsible for drawing the colorbar (potentially during rendering or updating its appearance) should include logic to check the `extend` and `drawedges` properties. If both conditions are met, the method should ensure that edges at the beginning and end of the colorbar (including the extended parts) are drawn, thereby preserving the visual distinction between adjacent colors throughout the entire length of the colorbar, consistent with the standard behavior observed when `extend` is not used. This adjustment respects the purpose of `drawedges`, which is to enhance the visual segmentation of the colorbar, particularly useful in scenarios requiring precise demarcation between color ranges for interpretability."
