However, when the colorbar is extended using extend='both', the black lines at the extremities do not show up.\n### Code for reproduction\n```python\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.colors import from_levels_and_colors\nmy_cmap = mpl.cm.viridis\nbounds = np.arange(10)\nnb_colors = len(bounds) + 1\ncolors = my_cmap(np.linspace(100, 255, nb_colors).astype(int))\nmy_cmap, my_norm = from_levels_and_colors(bounds, colors, extend='both')\nplt.figure(figsize=(5, 1))\nax = plt.subplot(111)\ncbar = mpl.colorbar.ColorbarBase(ax, cmap=my_cmap, norm=my_norm, orientation='horizontal', drawedges=True)\nplt.subplots_adjust(left=0.05, bottom=0.4, right=0.95, top=0.9)\nplt.show()\n```\n### Actual outcome\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34058459/164254401-7516988d-1efb-4887-a631-de9a68357685.png)\n### Expected outcome\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34058459/164254881-92c167b7-aa13-4972-9955-48221b38b866.png)\n### Additional information\n_No response_\n### Operating system\n_No response_\n### Matplotlib Version\n3.5.1\n### Matplotlib Backend\n_No response_\n### Python version\n_No response_\n### Jupyter version\n_No response_\n### Installation\n_No response_\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the results of the initial search API calls and the issue described, it appears we need to adjust our approach to gather more specific and relevant context from the Matplotlib codebase.\n\nThe inability to find the `ColorbarBase` class directly and the absence of a `drawedges` method indicates that these components might be part of more complex structures or implemented with slightly different terminologies within the actual codebase. Given `ColorbarBase` is a fundamental class for constructing colorbars in Matplotlib, its details must exist but perhaps under more obfuscated or integrated forms within the library's architecture.\n\nThe instances of `\"extend='both'\"` across various files, particularly within tutorials and examples, suggest that this feature is widely used and demonstrated across different scenarios in Matplotlib. However, to address the bug, we need to focus not just on instances of its usage in examples but rather on its implementation details, which would likely reside within core library files responsible for colorbar generation and manipulation\u2014files like `contour.py` may give clues into the `extend` functionality as it might be used in the context of generating contour plots, which are closely related to colorbar functionalities.\n\nGiven the above considerations, here are the next steps to deepen our investigation:\n\n1. **Investigate Core Library Files:** Specifically, we should look into `lib/matplotlib/contour.py` since it might contain low-level implementations of the colorbar and its properties like `extend`. Learning how `extend` interacts with colorbar rendering could give insights into why edges are not being drawn at the extremities.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"extend='both'\", \"lib/matplotlib/contour.py\")`: This could help to understand the `extend` mechanism better within a file likely to deal with color rendering and plot structuring.\n\n2. **Reformulate Searches for `ColorbarBase` and `drawedges`:** Given the direct search did not yield results, it\u2019s possible that these functionalities are embedded within more generic methods or intrinsic properties of classes handling colorbar rendering.\n   - `search_code(\"ColorbarBase\")`: Since the class search failed, searching for code snippets mentioning `ColorbarBase` might reveal where it's instantiated or discussed.\n   - `search_code(\"drawedges=True\")`: Given `drawedges` didn't directly match a method, looking for its use case in code snippets may uncover how edges are processed in colorbars.\n\nThese actions are designed to dive deeper into how Matplotlib handles the specifics of the colorbar rendering, especially with features like `extend` and edge drawing, to pinpoint the cause of the bug described in the issue."
