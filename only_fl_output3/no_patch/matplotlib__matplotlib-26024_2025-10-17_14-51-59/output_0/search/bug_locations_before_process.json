        "intended_behavior": "This dictionary should be expanded to include mappings for the missing mathematical operators listed in the issue. Each entry should map a LaTeX command name to its corresponding Unicode code point. The update should carefully add the new symbols ensuring to not overwrite existing mappings or introduce errors in the syntax. The addition of new mappings should follow the existing structure, with LaTeX command names as keys and their Unicode hex codes as values. This enhancement preserves the dictionary's functionality of mapping LaTeX symbols to Unicode, enabling broader support for rendering mathematical operators in Matplotlib. The proposed updates should consider including only those symbols that are standard in LaTeX or are part of the AMS symbol set, to maintain focus on widely used mathematical notation."
