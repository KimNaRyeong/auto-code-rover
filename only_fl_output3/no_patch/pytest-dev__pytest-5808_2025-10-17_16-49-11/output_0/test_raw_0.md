Here's a Python script named `reproducer.py` that attempts to reproduce the issue as described. The script simulates the `pytest --pastebin` feature sending data to `bpaste.net` with the problematic `lexer=python3` setting. It then tries the operation with the `lexer=text` setting, which should not raise an error if the diagnosis about the lexer being the cause of the issue is correct. This script works under the assumption that the described behavior remains consistent.

```python
import urllib.request
import urllib.parse
import sys

# Function to print the stack trace of exceptions
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# This function attempts to post data to bpaste.net, raising an AssertionError if it fails with lexer=python3
def try_post_with_lexer(lexer):
    url = "https://bpaste.net"
    data = b'This is a test'
    values = {'lexer': lexer, 'code': data}
    data = urllib.parse.urlencode(values).encode('ascii')
    
    try:
        response = urllib.request.urlopen(url, data=data)
        # If we get here without an error, the request was successful; check for lexer=python3 failure
        if lexer == 'python3':
            raise AssertionError("Expected failure with lexer=python3 but succeeded")
    except urllib.error.HTTPError as e:
        if lexer == 'python3':
            # This is expected, print the HTTPError stack trace
            print_stacktrace(e)
        else:
            raise

def main():
    try:
        # First, try with lexer=python3, which is expected to fail
        try_post_with_lexer('python3')
        # Then, try with lexer=text, which is expected to succeed
        try_post_with_lexer('text')
        print("Issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(str(e))
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script fulfills your request by trying first with the setting that is known to fail (if the issue is still present), thereby raising an `AssertionError` and printing a stack trace for that situation. It then tries with a setting that should work, exiting with a `0` exit code if this replacement resolves the issue, effectively working around the described problematic behavior.
