        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need more insights into the implementation and usage of the `--pastebin` feature in the `pytest` codebase. Since the issue points to the `pastebin.py` file and concerns the HTTP error raised when attempting to paste using the `python3` lexer, we should begin by examining the relevant portions of code, as well as explore how pastebin functionality is integrated and utilized within `pytest`.\n\nGiven the information in the issue description, the following API calls will provide important context:\n\n1. To understand how the `--pastebin` option is implemented and possibly find a method that deals with submitting data to `bpaste.net`, let's inspect the related file mentioned in the issue:\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"src/_pytest/pastebin.py\", 68, 5)`\n\n2. Since the issue suggests changing the `lexer` from `python3` to `text`, we need to find where this parameter is set and look into the function or method responsible for making the HTTP request. The line numbers provided point us directly to such a code snippet, but understanding its context (e.g., method or class it belongs to) would help:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"lexer=python3\", \"src/_pytest/pastebin.py\")`\n\n3. The issue also implies that there's a fundamental mismatch between the content type being uploaded (console output of a `pytest` run) and the lexer specified. To potentially find discussions or validations related to this mismatch, examining how the content for pastebin is prepared might offer insights. However, with no specific method name provided, this step might involve a bit of guessing:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"create_new_paste\", \"src/_pytest/pastebin.py\")`\n   - Or a more general approach to understand how contents are handled before being submitted:\n     - `search_method_in_file(\"prepare_content\", \"src/_pytest/pastebin.py\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to gather necessary background on the implementation of the pastebin feature, specifically how data is prepared, validated, and submitted. Understanding this will allow for a more informed decision on how to adapt the feature to avoid HTTP 400 errors by possibly changing the `lexer` parameter or adjusting how contents are prepared and validated before submission."
