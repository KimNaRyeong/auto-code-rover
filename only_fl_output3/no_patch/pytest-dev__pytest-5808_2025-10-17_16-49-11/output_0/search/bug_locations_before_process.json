        "intended_behavior": "The primary intention behind changing the code within this method is to make the `--pastebin` feature more versatile and error-resistant, especially when handling non-Python content which constitutes the bulk of the `pytest` output. By adjusting the `lexer` parameter from `\"python3\"` to `\"text\"`, the method would cater to a broader range of content types without throwing HTTP 400 errors due to syntax incompatibilities when the paste service attempts to lex the content as Python code. This change aims to preserve the existing functionality of uploading test run outputs to a pastebin service, while also ensuring that arbitrary text output does not cause the request to fail."
