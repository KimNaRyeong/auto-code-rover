Based on your request, I'll adjust the approach to directly address the core issue described, aiming to reproduce the "HTTP Error 400: Bad Request" when submitting data to `bpaste.net` with `lexer=python3`. This revised script will specifically target the scenario outlined, attempting an HTTP POST with given data and then catching and handling the HTTP error to print a detailed stack trace.

```python
import urllib.request
import urllib.parse
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def post_to_pastebin(contents, lexer):
    url = "https://bpaste.net"
    values = {'lexer': lexer, 'code': contents}
    data = urllib.parse.urlencode(values).encode('utf-8')
    headers = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'}
    req = urllib.request.Request(url, data, headers)
    try:
        with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as response:
            result = response.read()
            print(f"Post successful with lexer={lexer}: {result[:60]}...")
            return True
    except urllib.error.HTTPError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

def main():
    test_lexer = 'python3'  # This is the lexer that is expected to cause issues
    # Example content that might cause the issue
    contents = "import os\n\nos.listdir('.')\n"
    
    success = post_to_pastebin(contents, test_lexer)
    if not success:
        raise AssertionError(f"Posting with lexer={test_lexer} should not fail but did.")
    else:
        # If posting with python3 fails as expected, we assert to indicate the issue is present.
        print("No AssertionError was raised; the expected issue might have been fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The `main` function in this script attempts to post a simple Python code snippet to `bpaste.net` using the `python3` lexer. According to the issue description, this action should trigger an `HTTPError` due to the bad request, which would be a direct reproduction of the issue at hand. If the post is successful, it indicates a potential resolution to the previously described problem or a misunderstanding of the issue's conditions. The script exits with code `0` only if the operation succeeds without raising an `AssertionError`, implying the original issue might have been fixed or is not reproducible under the provided conditions.
