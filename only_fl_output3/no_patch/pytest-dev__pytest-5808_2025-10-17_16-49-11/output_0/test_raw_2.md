Let's adjust the approach to accurately target reproducing the specific issue mentioned using Python, by directly trying to recreate the scenario where uploading data with the `lexer=python3` parameter to `bpaste.net` results in an `HTTPError: Bad Request`. We will modify the posting logic to closely reflect the issue presented, including attempting to read from a supposed 'data.txt' as outlined in the scenario. Since we cannot actually include `data.txt` here, ensure you create a `data.txt` with content that could potentially lead to a 400 error when posted with the lexer set to `python3`.

```python
import urllib.request
import urllib.error
import urllib.parse
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def post_to_pastebin(file_path, lexer='python3'):
    url = "https://bpaste.net"
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file_handle:
        code_content = file_handle.read().decode('utf-8')
        data = urllib.parse.urlencode({
            'lexer': lexer,
            'code': code_content,
        }).encode('utf-8')
        req = urllib.request.Request(url, data, headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'})
        try:
            with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as response:
                return True, response.read()
        except urllib.error.HTTPError as e:
            return False, e

def main():
    file_path = 'data.txt'  # Ensure data.txt exists and contains the contents mentioned in the issue
    success, result = post_to_pastebin(file_path, lexer='python3')
    if not success:
        print("Failed as expected with lexer=python3.")
        print_stacktrace(result)
        assert isinstance(result, urllib.error.HTTPError), "Expected HTTPError"
    else:
        print("Request succeeded unexpectedly. The issue might have been fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script attempts to reproduce the error by reading from a local `data.txt` (which you must provide based on the issue description). It sets the `lexer` parameter to `python3`, mirroring the problem scenario. An `AssertionError` is raised if the post unexpectedly succeeds, indicating that the issue might have been mitigated. Conversely, the script acknowledges the failure (as described in the original issue) when an `HTTPError: Bad Request` is encountered, and then it prints the stack trace for that exception. Remember, for this script to run as intended, you must create a `data.txt` file with appropriate content that could trigger the error when posted with the specific lexer setting.
