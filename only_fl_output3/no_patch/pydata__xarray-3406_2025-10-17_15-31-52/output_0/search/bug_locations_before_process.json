The method should check if there are any NaN values in the groupby object and adjust the index calculations accordingly to prevent out-of-bounds errors while preserving the existing data reordering functionality."

This could involve adjusting the concatenation logic to accommodate or omit NaN-influenced groups based on a coherent strategy that aligns with expected behaviors (similar to pandas), whilst maintaining the integrity of the operation."
