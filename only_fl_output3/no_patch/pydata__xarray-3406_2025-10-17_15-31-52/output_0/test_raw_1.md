I understand you're requesting the code for `reproducer.py` to be amended after an attempt that did not reproduce the desired IndexError due to an environment issue involving numpy and xarray compatibility. Given this, the updated request should remain the same, focusing on generating an `IndexError` to accurately reflect the originally described issue. The environment should match the dependencies more closely, especially versions of numpy and xarray that are known to work together without the AttributeError regarding `np.unicode_`. 

Assuming the versions mismatch led to an unexpected AttributeError, and focusing on replicating the IndexError involving groupby().apply() with NaNs, here's an adjusted version of `reproducer.py`:

```python
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def standardize(x):
    return (x - x.mean()) / x.std()

def main():
    ds = xr.Dataset()
    ds["variable"] = xr.DataArray(np.random.rand(4,3,5), 
                                   {"lat":np.arange(4), "lon":np.arange(3), "time":np.arange(5)}, 
                                   ("lat", "lon", "time"),
                                  )

    ds["id"] = xr.DataArray(np.arange(12.0).reshape((4,3)),
                             {"lat": np.arange(4), "lon":np.arange(3)},
                             ("lat", "lon"),
                            )

    ds["id"].values[0,0] = np.nan

    try:
        ds.groupby("id").apply(standardize)
        assert False, "Expected an IndexError due to NaN in groupby but it did not occur"
    except IndexError as e:
        print("IndexError as expected:", str(e))
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(0)  # Exiting with 0 as the correct exception was caught

    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with 1 as an unexpected error occurred

    print("Issue not present, exiting with code 0.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script assumes the IndexError is the *expected* outcome to prove the issue is reproducible. It correctly handles the scenario where if the IndexError is caught, it indicates the reproduced issue, and if any other exception or no exception is caught, it indicates either an unexpected state or that the issue may be resolved.
