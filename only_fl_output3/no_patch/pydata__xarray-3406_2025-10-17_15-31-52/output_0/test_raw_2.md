To address your request accurately, I'll create a `reproducer.py` that is designed to replicate the issue involving `groupby().apply()` on a variable with NaNs raising an `IndexError` in an Xarray dataset. This standalone script will attempt to replicate the issue and catch the `IndexError`. If the error is not raised due to a corrected behavior in future versions or a different environment setup, it will exit with code 0, indicating no error. Here's the `reproducer.py`:

```python
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def standardize(x):
    return (x - x.mean()) / x.std()

def main():
    ds = xr.Dataset()
    ds["variable"] = xr.DataArray(np.random.rand(4,3,5), 
                                  {"lat": np.arange(4), "lon": np.arange(3), "time": np.arange(5)}, 
                                  dims=("lat", "lon", "time"))

    ds["id"] = xr.DataArray(np.arange(12.0).reshape((4,3)),
                            {"lat": np.arange(4), "lon":np.arange(3)},
                            dims=("lat", "lon"))

    ds["id"].values[0,0] = np.nan

    try:
        ds.groupby("id").apply(standardize)
    except IndexError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with 1 because the issue is present and we've successfully reproduced it
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with 1 as an unexpected error occurred

    print("The issue related to groupby().apply() on variables with NaNs raising an IndexError seems to have been fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with 0 indicating that the issue could not be reproduced, implying a potential fix.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script includes the specific reproduction steps based on the problem description. It aims to cause an `IndexError` based on the operations described. If the exception is raised, it means the script successfully reproduces the issue, and the provided function `print_stacktrace` will output the traceback for the exception. If, due to any improvements or different behavior in the Xarray library, the error does not occur, the program exits cleanly, suggesting that the issue may no longer be present.
