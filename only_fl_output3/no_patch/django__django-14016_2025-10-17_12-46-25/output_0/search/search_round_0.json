        "content": "To resolve the issue mentioned, we need to get more context about the `Q` class and specifically how the `|` operator is implemented in Django. Following are the steps we should consider:\n\n1. Locate the `Q` class within the codebase to understand its structure and related methods.\n2. Find how the `|` operator is implemented for the `Q` object. This is likely done via the `__or__` method in Python.\n3. Since the issue mentions applying the `|` operator between `Q` objects and involves pickling problems, it's also beneficial to look at how Q objects handle serialization, which might involve methods related to pickling like `__getstate__` and `__setstate__`, or others involved in pickling.\n\nBased on these requirements, the API calls could be:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Q\")` - To locate the `Q` class within the Django codebase.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__or__\", \"Q\")` - To find the implementation of the `|` operator for `Q` objects.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__getstate__\", \"Q\")` - Optional, to see if custom pickling mechanisms are implemented in the `Q` class.\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"__setstate__\", \"Q\")` - Optional, as above but for restoring state.\n\nLet's invoke the necessary API calls to gather the required information:\n\n- `search_class(\"Q\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"__or__\", \"Q\")`"
