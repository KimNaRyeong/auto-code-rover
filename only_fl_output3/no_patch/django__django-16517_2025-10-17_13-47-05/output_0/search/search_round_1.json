The issue seems related to how Django's admin docs handle class-based view references in documentation comments, specifically with case sensitivity that leads to a 404 error. The `_get_view_func` method might play a crucial role in resolving the view function from a path that seems to inadvertently lower-case the path. Here are the API calls that will help us gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ViewDetailView\")` - This will help us find the definition and location of the `ViewDetailView` class that is mentioned as raising a 404 error.\n2. `search_method(\"_get_view_func\")` - We need to understand where this method is defined and how it processes the view paths. This information is critical since the issue seems to involve the path being transformed to lowercase.\n3. `get_code_around_line(\"django/contrib/admindocs/views.py\", 168, 10)` - Since the URL in the issue description points to a specific line in `views.py`, it's important to see the code around this line to understand more about the context of the issue."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides valuable insights into the issue related to the Django admin docs functionality, specifically with view and template names causing 404 errors due to mixed-case handling. Let's walk through the findings:\n\n### 1. ViewDetailView Class Context\n\nFrom the `ViewDetailView` class snippet in `django/contrib/admindocs/views.py`, we understand that this class is responsible for rendering details about a specific view, presumably for the Django admin documentation purposes. The `template_name` attribute specifies which template should be used to render the detailed view documentation.\n\n**Relation to the Bug:** The `ViewDetailView` class is directly implicated in the issue as the class raising the 404 error when attempting to document class-based views with case-sensitive paths. The issue likely stems from how this class retrieves and processes view function references.\n\n### 2. _get_view_func Method Context\n\nThe `_get_view_func` method is crucial for obtaining a view function based on its path. This method tries to resolve a view from the passed `view` argument, which could be a callable or a string path to a view. The resolution process attempts to import the view module and retrieve the view function. If the view's path includes a class name (which appears to be common in class-based views), the method makes further attempts to parse the module and class to import it correctly.\n\n**Intended Behaviour:** Ideally, this method should be able to accurately retrieve a view function regardless of how the view's path was specified (using mixed-case or not). It should account for class-based views, where the name might represent a class method or an attribute and handle them without causing a 404 error.\n\n**Relation to the Bug:** The bug description suggests that there's an issue with how view or template documentation paths are processed, leading to lower-casing of paths that should be case-sensitive. Given that `_get_view_func` handles the retrieval of views for documentation, a possible cause of the bug could be in this method's handling of case sensitivity. The code snippet doesn't explicitly show path lower-casing, but the process leading to the `getattr` call could be case-sensitive, leading to failures when the documented path uses mixed-case.\n\n### Summary\n\nGiven the provided context, it seems the issue arises from how the `_get_view_func` method within the `ViewDetailView` class handles resolution and importation of view functions based on their specified paths in the documentation comments. When the view path includes mixed-case letters, especially for class names in class-based views, the retrieval process may fail, likely due to case sensitivity issues, resulting in a 404 error. \n\n**Next Steps:** Given this analysis, the fix might require ensuring that the method accurately respects the case of each component in the view's path (module, class, and method names) throughout the resolution process. This could involve verifying the case sensitivity in parts of the method that parse and import module and class names, ensuring they match the actual case used in the view's documentation comment."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

The current mechanism might implicitly lowercase the view path or fail to match it accurately due to case differences. The intended behavior would involve adjusting the method to accurately parse and maintain the case of module, class, and possibly method names within the given view path. This could involve refining how `get_mod_func(view)` parses the view string and ensuring that any import and attribute retrieval operations (like `import_module(mod)` and `getattr(...)`) do not assume case-insensitivity unless explicitly documented. The primary goal is to preserve existing functionality while ensuring that case-sensitive paths, especially those referring to class names and methods in class-based views, are correctly resolved to their respective functions without causing a 404 error due to case mismatching. This entails careful handling of view paths to avoid unintentional lowercasing or incorrect case handling that could lead to mismatches in Django's dynamic view resolution process for admin documentation."
