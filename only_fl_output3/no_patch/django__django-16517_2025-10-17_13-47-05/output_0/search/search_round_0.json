        "content": "To better understand the context of the issue submitted, we need to gather more information about the `ViewDetailView` class and `_get_view_func` method, as these are directly mentioned in the description. The issue seems related to how Django's admin docs handle class-based view references in documentation comments, specifically with case sensitivity that leads to a 404 error. The `_get_view_func` method might play a crucial role in resolving the view function from a path that seems to inadvertently lower-case the path. Here are the API calls that will help us gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ViewDetailView\")` - This will help us find the definition and location of the `ViewDetailView` class that is mentioned as raising a 404 error.\n2. `search_method(\"_get_view_func\")` - We need to understand where this method is defined and how it processes the view paths. This information is critical since the issue seems to involve the path being transformed to lowercase.\n3. `get_code_around_line(\"django/contrib/admindocs/views.py\", 168, 10)` - Since the URL in the issue description points to a specific line in `views.py`, it's important to see the code around this line to understand more about the context of the issue."
