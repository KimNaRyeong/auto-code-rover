This enhancement would involve modifying the `write` method to incorporate `header_rows` into the table format, aligning the output with the user's expectations for reStructuredText documentation. The implementation should ensure that if `header_rows` is not provided, the class's behavior remains unchanged, preserving backward compatibility."

        "intended_behavior": "The `_get_writer` function may need adaptation to ensure that when an `RST` writer is initialized, the `header_rows` parameter is correctly passed and handled. This could involve ensuring that `header_rows` is included in the `writer_kwargs` or processing it appropriately for writers that support it, like the updated `RST` writer would. This change has to be done carefully to avoid affecting other writers that do not support `header_rows`, ensuring the function's versatility across different table formats."
