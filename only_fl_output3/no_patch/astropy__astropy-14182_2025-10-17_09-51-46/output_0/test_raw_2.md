Certainly! To create a `reproducer.py` script that attempts to reproduce the specified issue related to header rows in RestructuredText output with `astropy`, and prints a detailed stack trace upon failure, please find the structured script below. This script will try to execute the operation that is reportedly causing issues. If it encounters the mentioned problem (in this case, an inability to handle `header_rows` argument for RestructuredText format), it will print a stack trace for debugging purposes. Upon success, it should simply indicate the issue has been resolved.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_restructured_text_with_header_rows():
    from astropy.table import QTable
    import astropy.units as u
    import sys
    import io

    # Creating a QTable
    tbl = QTable({'wave': [350, 950]*u.nm, 'response': [0.7, 1.2]*u.count})

    # Attempting to write table in 'ascii.rst' format with header rows
    output = io.StringIO()
    try:
        # This is the line where the issue is expected to be reproduced
        tbl.write(output, format="ascii.rst", header_rows=["name", "unit"])
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Raising AssertionError when the issue is present
        raise AssertionError("Failed to write table with header rows in RestructuredText format.")
    else:
        print("Issue resolved: Successfully wrote table with header rows in RestructuredText format.")
        output.seek(0)
        print(output.read())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_restructured_text_with_header_rows()
        # Exiting with code 0 when the issue is fixed
        exit(0)
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        # Exiting with a non-zero code to indicate failure
        exit(1)
```

This script does the following:
1. It imports necessary modules and defines a function `print_stacktrace` to neatly print exceptions and their tracebacks.
2. In the `test_restructured_text_with_header_rows` function, it attempts to create and write a table using Astropy's QTable with the `ascii.rst` format, passing `header_rows` as an argumentâ€”a feature the issue points out as unsupported. 
3. If this operation fails with a `TypeError`, which is expected according to the issue description, the script prints the stack trace using `print_stacktrace` and exits with code 1. This indicates that the issue is still present.
4. If the operation succeeds (indicating the issue has been resolved), it prints a success message and exits with code 0.

This reproducible test case script is designed to clearly communicate whether the specific issue with handling `header_rows` in Astropy's RestructuredText output has been resolved or not.
