Here is a Python script named `reproducer.py` that you requested. This script attempts to perform the operations described in your issue. If the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError` and provide a detailed stack trace of where the error occurs. Conversely, if the script executes successfully (indicating the issue has been fixed), it will exit with code 0 without raising any errors.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_restructured_text_output_with_header_rows():
    from astropy.table import QTable
    import astropy.units as u
    import sys
    import io

    tbl = QTable({'wave': [350, 950] * u.nm, 'response': [0.7, 1.2] * u.count})

    # Working case: verify regular rst output
    output = io.StringIO()
    tbl.write(output, format="ascii.rst")
    rst_output = output.getvalue()
    assert "wave" in rst_output and "response" in rst_output, "Regular RST output failed"

    # Failing case: with header_rows argument
    try:
        output = io.StringIO()
        tbl.write(output, format="ascii.rst", header_rows=["name", "unit"])
        assert False, "The method unexpectedly succeeded, the issue may have been fixed."
    except TypeError as e:
        assert "unexpected keyword argument 'header_rows'" in str(e), \
            "The error does not match the expected failure."
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as e:
        assert False, f"An unexpected exception occurred: {e}"
        print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_restructured_text_output_with_header_rows()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    print("Test passed. No issues found.")
    exit(0)
```

This script checks:

1. Whether standard RestructuredText (RST) output works without specifying `header_rows`, which should work correctly.
2. Whether specifying `header_rows` with RST format raises the expected `TypeError` due to the unsupported argument.

If the issue has been addressed in a future release of the involved library (astropy in this case), and `header_rows` is handled correctly, the assertion about the method unexpectedly succeeding would trigger, indicating that the feature has been implemented.
