Given the new instructions and the provided function for printing stack traces, here is the revised `reproducer.py` file. This Python script attempts to reproduce the issue described, handling any errors appropriately to showcase where the issue lies. This version is adjusted for clarity in error output and includes the complete structure needed to execute as a standalone script.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_restructured_text_output_with_header_rows():
    from astropy.table import QTable
    import astropy.units as u
    import sys
    import io

    tbl = QTable({'wave': [350, 950] * u.nm, 'response': [0.7, 1.2] * u.count})

    # Try generating RST output with desired header_rows
    output = io.StringIO()  # Using StringIO to capture output instead of sys.stdout
    try:
        tbl.write(output, format="ascii.rst", header_rows=["name", "unit"])
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue reproducing: Failed to support header rows in RestructuredText output.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_restructured_text_output_with_header_rows()
        print("Test passed: Issue with header rows in RestructuredText output is fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(1)
```

This script focuses on directly targeting the error described by attempting the unsupported operation â€“ writing a table to RestructuredText with `header_rows` specified. The script catches any exception thrown during this operation, prints the stacktrace for clarity on the error encountered, and raises an `AssertionError` indicating if the issue can be reproduced. The final message or error output will inform whether the bug still exists or if it has been fixed (where the script would end gracefully if the issue is not present).
