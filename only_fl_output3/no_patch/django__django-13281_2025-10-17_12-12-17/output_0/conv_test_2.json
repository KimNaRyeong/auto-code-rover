It seems quite unexpected.\nWhat is the recommended way to clone a model instance? To date we have been using copy() in a similar fashion to the test without issue. deepcopy seems to work fine in >=2.0 but we haven\u2019t done too much testing yet.\nTest (placed in tests/model_fields/test_field_caching_change.py):\nimport copy\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom .models import Bar, Foo\nclass ForeignKeyCachingBehaviorTest(TestCase):\n\tdef test_copy(self):\n\t\tfoo1 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo1', d=1)\n\t\tfoo2 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo2', d=2)\n\t\tbar1 = Bar.objects.create(a=foo1, b='bar1')\n\t\tbar2 = copy.copy(bar1)\n\t\tbar2.pk = None\n\t\tbar2.a = foo2\n\t\t# bar2 points to foo2\n\t\tself.assertEqual(bar2.a, foo2)\n\t\tself.assertEqual(bar2.a.id, bar2.a_id)\n\t\t# bar1 is unchanged and must still point to foo1\n\t\t# These fail on Django >= 2.0\n\t\tself.assertEqual(bar1.a, foo1)\n\t\tself.assertEqual(bar1.a.id, bar1.a_id)\nand executed that via:\npython3.6 tests/runtests.py --parallel 1 model_fields\nIn \u200bhttps://groups.google.com/g/django-developers/c/QMhVPIqVVP4/m/mbezfaBEAwAJ Simon suggests:\n..... Model.copy should make sure to make a deep-copy of self._state now that fields are cached in self._state.fields_cache.\nwhich I will attempt to implement.\n"
