        "intended_behavior": "During a model instance's copy operation, Django should ensure that a deep copy of the model's `_state` is performed, especially the contents of `_state.fields_cache`. This deep copying should ensure that when a ForeignKey field is accessed on the copied instance, it doesn't inadvertently affect or reflect changes made to the original instance. This behavior will preserve the historical functionality seen in Django 1.11.x, where model instance copying via `copy.copy()` would not lead to shared state between the original and copied instances in terms of ForeignKey references."
