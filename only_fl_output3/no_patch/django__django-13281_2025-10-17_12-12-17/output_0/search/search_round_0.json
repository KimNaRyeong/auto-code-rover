It seems quite unexpected.\nWhat is the recommended way to clone a model instance? To date we have been using copy() in a similar fashion to the test without issue. deepcopy seems to work fine in >=2.0 but we haven\u2019t done too much testing yet.\nTest (placed in tests/model_fields/test_field_caching_change.py):\nimport copy\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom .models import Bar, Foo\nclass ForeignKeyCachingBehaviorTest(TestCase):\ndef test_copy(self):\nfoo1 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo1', d=1)\nfoo2 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo2', d=2)\nbar1 = Bar.objects.create(a=foo1, b='bar1')\nbar2 = copy.copy(bar1)\nbar2.pk = None\nbar2.a = foo2\n# bar2 points to foo2\nself.assertEqual(bar2.a, foo2)\nself.assertEqual(bar2.a.id, bar2.a_id)\n# bar1 is unchanged and must still point to foo1\n# These fail on Django >= 2.0\nself.assertEqual(bar1.a, foo1)\nself.assertEqual(bar1.a.id, bar1.a_id)\nand executed that via:\npython3.6 tests/runtests.py --parallel 1 model_fields\nIn \u200bhttps://groups.google.com/g/django-developers/c/QMhVPIqVVP4/m/mbezfaBEAwAJ Simon suggests:\n..... Model.copy should make sure to make a deep-copy of self._state now that fields are cached in self._state.fields_cache.\nwhich I will attempt to implement.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue related to foreign key (FK) field caching behavior change between versions of Django, I would suggest making the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `Bar` and `Foo` model classes which are referenced in the test case. These models' definitions are essential for understanding how the foreign keys are set up and could help us understand if any changes in Django's handling of such relationships might have affected the behavior observed.\n\n   - `search_class(\"Bar\")`\n   - `search_class(\"Foo\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a test case file (`tests/model_fields/test_field_caching_change.py`), locating the `TestCase` implementation and any setup or teardown methods within this specific file can provide insight into the testing environment setup and whether any relevant changes in Django 2.0+ would affect the test case's outcome.\n\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"ForeignKeyCachingBehaviorTest\", \"tests/model_fields/test_field_caching_change.py\")`\n\n3. The issue specifically references the `copy()` function's behavior, which indicates that the handling of copying model instances might have been affected by the mentioned commit. Any method or function directly handling copy operations within the Django model's lifecycle could be critical. Therefore, understanding how Django models handle copying internally could be useful.\n\n   - `search_method(\"copy\")`\n\n4. The commit `bfb746f983aa741afa3709794e70f1e0ab6040b5` mentioned could have made changes to model or state internals, affecting how fields are cached. Specifically looking into any changes in the model's internal state (`_state`) handling could offer insights into the root cause of the behavior change. As we may not explicitly search by commit in this interface, focusing on the model's state management can still be valuable.\n\n   - `search_code(\"_state\")`\n\nThese API calls should help us gather enough information on how FK fields are handled, how cloning of model instances is supposed to work in Django's ORM, and any relevant changes in the codebase that could have led to the described issue."
