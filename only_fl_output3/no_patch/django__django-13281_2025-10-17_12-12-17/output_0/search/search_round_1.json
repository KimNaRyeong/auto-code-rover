It seems quite unexpected.\nWhat is the recommended way to clone a model instance? To date we have been using copy() in a similar fashion to the test without issue. deepcopy seems to work fine in >=2.0 but we haven\u2019t done too much testing yet.\nTest (placed in tests/model_fields/test_field_caching_change.py):\nimport copy\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom .models import Bar, Foo\nclass ForeignKeyCachingBehaviorTest(TestCase):\ndef test_copy(self):\nfoo1 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo1', d=1)\nfoo2 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo2', d=2)\nbar1 = Bar.objects.create(a=foo1, b='bar1')\nbar2 = copy.copy(bar1)\nbar2.pk = None\nbar2.a = foo2\n# bar2 points to foo2\nself.assertEqual(bar2.a, foo2)\nself.assertEqual(bar2.a.id, bar2.a_id)\n# bar1 is unchanged and must still point to foo1\n# These fail on Django >= 2.0\nself.assertEqual(bar1.a, foo1)\nself.assertEqual(bar1.a.id, bar1.a_id)\nand executed that via:\npython3.6 tests/runtests.py --parallel 1 model_fields\nIn \u200bhttps://groups.google.com/g/django-developers/c/QMhVPIqVVP4/m/mbezfaBEAwAJ Simon suggests:\n..... Model.copy should make sure to make a deep-copy of self._state now that fields are cached in self._state.fields_cache.\nwhich I will attempt to implement.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the results from the API calls made, we have several pieces of context to consider, despite certain failures to retrieve specific classes and files directly mentioned in the issue. Here's a structured analysis:\n\n### 1. Not Finding `Bar` and `Foo` Classes\n- **Implication:** These classes might be part of a test setup that's either dynamically created, exists in a specific test dataset not accessible, or part of external applications not directly available in the Django project's own codebase. Without direct access to their definitions, we're missing context on how these models interact with Django's ORM layer, especially concerning ForeignKey relations and object copying/cloning.\n- **Action:** Investigate any documentation or general practices in Django regarding model cloning, especially around ForeignKey relations. This could involve looking into Django's model inheritance behavior and any cloning practices recommended by Django.\n\n### 2. Unsuccessful Retrieval of the Test Case File\n- **Implication:** This specific failure to retrieve the test case file suggests it could be either misplaced, misnamed, or part of external contributions/tests not yet merged into the main codebase at the time of the search.\n- **Action:** Since direct inspection of the test implementation isn't possible through the API, understanding general testing practices involving ForeignKey fields and cloning in Django becomes crucial. It's important to review test cases in Django's documentation or community forums for similar cloning scenarios.\n\n### 3. Methods Named `copy`\n- **Implication:** The `copy` method's occurrences within the Django codebase, especially in disparate modules, indicate its generalized use for duplicating instances of various types including requests, forms, data structures, and model expressions. This broad usage highlights the importance of understanding how `copy` interacts with model instances specifically.\n- **Action:** Given the issue's context with model instance copying, reviewing the implementation in `django/db/models/expressions.py` and `django/db/backends/base/base.py` might offer insights into how copying is handled at the ORM and database layer, potentially affecting field caching behavior.\n\n### 4. References to `_state`\n- **Implication:** The extensive references to `_state` across many files including `django/db/models/base.py` and related ORM management files suggest `_state` is a fundamental part of Django's model instance tracking, likely involving the cached state and possibly related to ForeignKey caching.\n- **Action:** Focus on how `_state` is manipulated in reaction to cloning operations. The `django/db/models/base.py` file is a prime candidate for further review, as it likely contains the implementation of model state management, which could be crucial for understanding the change in FK field caching behavior post-cloning.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\n1. **Deep Dive into Model State Management:** Since references to `_state` were found in critical model and ORM management files (e.g., `django/db/models/base.py`), examining how the cloning or copying process might alter a model's internal state or cache, especially focusing on ForeignKey relations, is key. We should review code related to model instance state management and identify any changes in how `_state` is copied.\n\n2. **Best Practices for Model Cloning:** With the specific issue in cloning model instances and retaining correct foreign key references, understanding Django's recommended practices or any recent guidance on cloning could mitigate the problem. This might not be directly available in the code but requires reviewing Django's documentation or discussions around model management improvements introduced in Django 2.0 and above.\n\nGiven these implications and actions, further investigation might require fetching specific sections of code identified (such as those involving `_state` handling in model instances) and documentation review outside of direct code analysis."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This deep copying should ensure that when a ForeignKey field is accessed on the copied instance, it doesn't inadvertently affect or reflect changes made to the original instance. This behavior will preserve the historical functionality seen in Django 1.11.x, where model instance copying via `copy.copy()` would not lead to shared state between the original and copied instances in terms of ForeignKey references.\n\nTo resolve the described issue, any code responsible for managing model instance copying should be carefully reviewed and possibly adjusted to ensure that a deep copy of `_state` is performed. This might involve updating Django's model `__deepcopy__` method or ensuring that any custom copying logic is aware of and correctly handles the specific nuances of Django model state management.\n\nThis solution aims to maintain the existing functionality across Django versions while addressing the behavior change introduced in specific commits affecting model copying behavior, especially concerning foreign key field caching."
