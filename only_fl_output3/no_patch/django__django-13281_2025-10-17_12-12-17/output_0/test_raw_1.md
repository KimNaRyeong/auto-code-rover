Given the feedback and the need to directly address the issue reproduction with a clearly defined outcome in the script execution, here's an improved version of the standalone `reproducer.py`. This version includes the necessary model setup, executes the problematic scenario, and utilizes the provided `print_stacktrace` function to display any exceptions if the test case represents the issue (i.e., fails as described).

```python
import os
import django
from django.db import models
from django.conf import settings
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

def setup_django_environment():
    settings.configure(
        DEBUG=True,
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': ':memory:',
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=('__main__',),
        USE_TZ=True,
    )
    django.setup()

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Define your models here
class Foo(models.Model):
    a = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    d = models.IntegerField()

class Bar(models.Model):
    a = models.ForeignKey(Foo, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    b = models.CharField(max_length=100)

def main():
    # Setup Django environment and models
    setup_django_environment()
    
    # Create the necessary tables
    execute_from_command_line(['manage.py', 'migrate'])

    # Your reproduction script starts here
    try:
        import copy
        # Create instances
        foo1 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo1', d=1)
        foo2 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo2', d=2)
        bar1 = Bar.objects.create(a=foo1, b='bar1')
        
        # Copy instance and modify foreign key
        bar2 = copy.copy(bar1)
        bar2.pk = None
        bar2.a = foo2
        bar2.save()
        
        # Check expectations
        assert bar2.a == foo2, "bar2 does not point to foo2 after change"
        assert bar2.a_id == foo2.pk, "bar2.a_id does not match foo2.pk"
        
        # Check that bar1 is unchanged and still points to foo1
        assert bar1.a == foo1, "bar1 does not point to foo1"
        assert bar1.a_id == foo1.pk, "bar1.a_id does not match foo1.pk"
        
        print("Issue not present, test passed.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script thoroughly establishes a Django environment in-memory for testing purposes, configures a simple model with a ForeignKey relationship, and then goes through the process of verifying the behavior as outlined in your issue description. Notably, it includes a condition to assert whether the issue is present based on the behavior change between Django 1.11.x and 2.x regarding ForeignKey field caching when copying model instances.

Remember, this script needs to run in an environment where Django is installed and is compatible with the versions in question (Django 1.11.x to 2.x). You can install Django via pip:

```sh
pip install "Django<3"
```

Adjust the Django version according to your test setup requirements.
