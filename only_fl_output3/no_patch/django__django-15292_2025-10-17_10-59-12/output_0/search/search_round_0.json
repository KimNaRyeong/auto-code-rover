        "content": "To address the issue described, which involves the incorrect view name reporting for Class-Based Views (CBVs) on the technical 404 debug page, we need to understand how the view name is generated and where it is being incorrectly formatted. I will use the information from the issue description to guide my search.\n\n1. **Search for the class `Http404View` within the project**: This will help us identify the file it is declared in, providing context on how CBVs are structured in the project.\n   - `search_class(\"Http404View\")`\n\n2. **Search for the commit mentioned in the regression**: The issue mentions a regression caused by a specific commit (`0c0b87725bbcffca3bc3a7a2c649995695a5ae3b`). If we can identify what changed related to the error handling or debug pages in this commit, it would be hugely beneficial. However, since I can't directly search for a commit in the provided APIs, I will look for code responsible for displaying the \"Raised by\" line in the debug pages.\n   - `search_code(\"Raised by:\")`\n\n3. **Search for methods involved in generating the \"Raised by\" information**: This could involve methods that format the class name or methods that handle the rendering of debug information on 404 pages.\n   - `search_method(\"get_view_name\")` (Hypothetical method name, assuming there's a method responsible for getting the view name for the debug page.)\n   - `search_method(\"handle_404\")` (Another hypothetical method name, related to handling 404 errors, which might be involved in deciding what information gets displayed on a debug page.)\n\nThe selected search queries aim to gather relevant context around how Class-Based Views are identified and presented in debug errors. Since we can't search the commit history or specific changes from a commit with the provided APIs, focusing on the end result and the components likely involved in displaying that result is the most effective approach with the tools at hand."
