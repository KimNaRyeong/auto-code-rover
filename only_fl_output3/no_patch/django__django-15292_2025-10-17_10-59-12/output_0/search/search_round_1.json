        "content": "The collected context provides essential information that can help us target the issue described. Let's analyze the result from the `get_view_name` method found in `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py`.\n\n### Analysis of `get_view_name` Function\n\n1. **Functionality**: This function derives the name of the view. If the `view_func` has an attribute `view_class`, it formats the name as `\"<module>.<class qualification name>\"`. Otherwise, it derives the module name and view name from the `view_func` itself, ensuring a fully qualified view name is returned in both scenarios.\n\n2. **Relation to the bug**: The bug report mentioned that the technical 404 debug page displayed incorrect view names for class-based views (CBVs). Instead of showing a clean class name (e.g., `view_tests.views.Http404View`), it was showing an extended version including class instantiation syntax (e.g., `view_tests.views.<class 'view_tests.views.Http404View'>`). This function is likely involved in formatting the class name that ends up being displayed on the debug page. Given the logic seen in the function, it correctly handles class-based views by accessing the `view_class` attribute, suggesting that the issue might not lie within this function directly but potentially in how it's used or in what context it's called.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: Given the issue at hand, the intended behavior of this function (or the system that utilizes it) would be to always return a clean, readable class name when dealing with CBVs. That means, for class-based views, it should return something akin to `view_tests.views.Http404View`, matching the second example given in the issue description. The current implementation seems designed to support this behavior, which indicates that the problem might be rooted in the difference between expected and actual utilization of this function in the 404 debug page generation process.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven the relationship between the `get_view_name` function and the bug, our analysis suggests a couple of steps forward:\n- **Trace where `get_view_name` is called in the process of generating the 404 debug page**: This could involve using `search_code_in_file` to see if and how `get_view_name` is invoked in files related to the 404 debug process or error handling.\n- **Review changes around debug page generation**: Since `search_code` for \"Raised by:\" didn't yield results, another strategy might be to explore code related to generating debug information or error pages more broadly. This entails identifying files or methods that handle error pages or debug information rendering and then inspecting those for improper use of `get_view_name` or similar functions.\n\nUnfortunately, we can't directly search for usage related to a specific commit or changes in file contents based on a commit hash. However, focusing on components related to error handling and debug page presentation might give us further insights. It might be beneficial to:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"get_view_name\", \"django/views/debug.py\")` - Hypothetical search assuming `debug.py` handles debug pages.\n- Explore other methods or functions related to error page rendering in Django's codebase if such files or method names are known."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

The analysis of the `get_view_name` function implies that it should work correctly for its intended purpose; therefore, the actual bug might not reside within this function but rather in how or where this function is used in the context of generating the technical 404 debug page.\n\n- **Intended Behavior**: The core issue revolves around ensuring that class-based views (CBVs) are correctly identified and displayed in the technical 404 debug pages. The resolution would involve ensuring that wherever the debug information for a 404 page is assembled, the view name for CBVs is correctly formatted. This would mean:\n    - When a CBV is passed to the part of the code responsible for generating the \"Raised by:\" section of the technical 404 debug page, it should correctly use or adapt the output from `get_view_name` or a similar mechanism to display a simplified, readable class name (e.g., `view_tests.views.Http404View`), not the instantiation syntax (`<class 'view_tests.views.Http404View'>`).\n    - This might involve adjusting how the view function or class is passed to the debug information renderer to ensure the correct name formatting is achieved or addressing any regression in how this formatting is applied, potentially reverting or modifying behavior introduced by the commit mentioned in the issue report.\n\nWithout direct references to the code handling the 404 debug page logic, or without identifiable excerpts that show misuse of the `get_view_name` function in this context, it's difficult to specify exact changes needed. It may require a closer examination of the changes introduced by the specific commit mentioned in the issue (`0c0b87725bbcffca3bc3a7a2c649995695a5ae3b`) to understand how these might have altered the behavior of CBV name rendering on debug pages."
