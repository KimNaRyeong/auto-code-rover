Here's an example:\n```python\nimport pytest\nclass TestFoo:\n# passes:\n@staticmethod\ndef test_staticmethod() -> None:\nfoo = 0\nassert foo < 3\n# warning: cannot collect 'test_staticmethod_inner' because it is not a function.\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [1, 2])\n@staticmethod\ndef test_staticmethod_inner(foo: int) -> None:\nassert foo < 3\n# passes:\n@staticmethod\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [1, 2])\ndef test_staticmethod_outer(foo: int) -> None:\nassert foo < 3\n# silently fails to run\n@classmethod\ndef test_classmethod(cls) -> None:\nfoo = 0\nassert foo < 3\n# warning: cannot collect 'test_classmethod_inner' because it is not a function.\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [1, 2])\n@classmethod\ndef test_classmethod_inner(cls, foo: int) -> None:\nassert foo < 3\n# silently fails to run\n@classmethod\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"foo\", [1, 2])\ndef test_classmethod_outer(cls, foo: int) -> None:\nassert foo < 3\n```\nThe most worrysome cases are `test_classmethod` and `test_classmethod_outer`, which are not discovered by pytest.

        "content": "To address the issue related to inconsistent support for `staticmethod` and `classmethod` in pytest discovery and running, especially with parameterized tests, we need to gather more information about where these methods are being used and how they are integrated within the test framework in the project. Here are the API calls that would be necessary to provide sufficient context for resolving the issue:\n\n1. Search for the `TestFoo` class to understand the general structure and any related pytest configurations or decorators that might be influencing test discovery and execution.\n    - `search_class(\"TestFoo\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions specific methods (`test_staticmethod`, `test_staticmethod_inner`, `test_staticmethod_outer`, `test_classmethod`, `test_classmethod_inner`, `test_classmethod_outer`) that are behaving inconsistently, it\u2019s important to gather more details about these methods to see how they are defined and potentially interact with pytest.\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"test_staticmethod\", \"TestFoo\")`\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"test_staticmethod_inner\", \"TestFoo\")`\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"test_staticmethod_outer\", \"TestFoo\")`\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"test_classmethod\", \"TestFoo\")`\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"test_classmethod_inner\", \"TestFoo\")`\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"test_classmethod_outer\", \"TestFoo\")`\n\n3. Given the mention of warnings related to the inability to collect certain tests because they are not recognized as functions, it would be helpful to search for the error messages in the codebase. This could indicate how pytest collection warnings are being handled or potentially ignored within the project setup.\n    - `search_code(\"cannot collect 'test_staticmethod_inner' because it is not a function\")`\n    - `search_code(\"cannot collect 'test_classmethod_inner' because it is not a function\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide comprehensive context around how `staticmethod` and `classmethod` tests are structured, discovered, and executed within the project, as well as any potential configurations or customizations that might be affecting their behavior."
