Given the details and the attempted reproduction, it seems that there was a misunderstanding or misalignment in the execution context. The initial response followed your instructions but it encountered a specific issue related to the scikit-learn installation rather than reproducing the intended `__len__` functionality issue.

Given this and aiming to strictly follow your instructions to reproduce the original issue with the `Pipeline` object not supporting `__len__` properly when expected, here is a corrected version of `reproducer.py`:

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    from sklearn import svm
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest
    from sklearn.feature_selection import f_regression
    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

    # generate some data to play with
    X, y = make_classification(n_informative=5, n_redundant=0, random_state=42)

    anova_filter = SelectKBest(f_regression, k=5)
    clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')
    pipe = Pipeline([('anova', anova_filter), ('svc', clf)])

    # This will raise an AssertionError if the issue is present, as expected behavior is to get len of pipe without error
    pipe_len = len(pipe)  # The intended usage scenario that should work without issues.
    assert pipe_len == 2, "Pipeline should implement __len__ correctly."

except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exit with error code 1 to indicate the AssertionError was raised due to the bug.
except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected error occurred.")
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exit with error code 1 to indicate an unexpected error occurred.

# If the script reaches this point, it means len(pipe) worked as expected without any error.
print("Success: No issue detected.")
exit(0)
```

This script correctly aligns with the goal of raising an `AssertionError` when the issue is present (i.e., if `len(pipe)` does not work as expected, indicating that the `Pipeline` object does not implement `__len__` correctly). If `len(pipe)` works as expected (meaning the `Pipeline` object correctly implements `__len__`), the script will print "Success: No issue detected." and exit with code 0.
