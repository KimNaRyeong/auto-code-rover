        "content": "To address the issue described, we should start by understanding how the `Pipeline` class is implemented and check if the `__len__` method is already implemented or if there's any related functionality that could be interfering with its proper operation. The issue indicates that attempting to use `len(pipe)` where `pipe` is an instance of `Pipeline` raises an error, so we need to gather more context on:\n\n1. The implementation of the `Pipeline` class to see if `__len__` is defined.\n2. The implementation of the `__len__` method within the `Pipeline` class, if it exists.\n3. Any overriding or related methods that might influence the behavior of `__len__` in this context.\n\nBased on these requirements, I will perform the following API calls to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Pipeline\")` - This will help us find where the `Pipeline` class is defined in the sklearn project.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"__len__\", \"Pipeline\")` - To check if the `__len__` method is implemented in the `Pipeline` class and gather details on its implementation."
