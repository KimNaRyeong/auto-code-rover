To address the problem where the issue did not reproduce as expected, a targeted `reproducer.py` can be crafted to specifically check for the implementation of the `__len__` method in a `Pipeline` instance. Given your requirements, the revised script will:

1. Attempt to use the `__len__` method of a `Pipeline`.
2. If `__len__` is not implemented, catch this specific issue and provide a clear stack trace.
3. Confirm the script exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed or properly handled.

Let's adjust the `reproducer.py` to focus specifically on capturing and demonstrating the issue related to the `__len__` method as described:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_pipeline_len():
    try:
        from sklearn import svm
        from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
        from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest
        from sklearn.feature_selection import f_regression
        from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

        # generate some data to play with
        X, y = make_classification(n_informative=5, n_redundant=0, random_state=42)

        anova_filter = SelectKBest(f_regression, k=5)
        clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')
        pipe = Pipeline([('anova', anova_filter), ('svc', clf)])

        # This line should execute without any issues if __len__ is implemented
        assert len(pipe) == 2, "Pipeline should implement __len__."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code since the AssertionError indicates the bug is present.

    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # An unexpected error indicates a problem beyond the scope of this test.

    # If the script reaches this point, the __len__ implementation is verified as present and correct.
    print("Success: The issue is fixed or not present.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_pipeline_len()
```

This script should produce a clear outcome regarding the presence of the issue:
- It successfully executes and exits with code 0 when `len(pipe)` works as expected, indicating the `Pipeline` correctly implements `__len__`.
- It prints a detailed stack trace and exits with code 1 if an `AssertionError` or any other unexpected exception occurs, highlighting the problem area directly.
