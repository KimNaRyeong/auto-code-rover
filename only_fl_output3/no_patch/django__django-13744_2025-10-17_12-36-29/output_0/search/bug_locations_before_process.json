This involves adding a deprecation warning that is triggered whenever an instance of `MemcachedCache` is initialized. The warning should inform users that `MemcachedCache` is deprecated as of Django 3.2 and will be removed in Django 4.1, advising users to switch to the `pymemcache` backend. This preserves the existing functionality for now while clearly communicating the future removal to developers. An example implementation might involve overriding the `__init__` method to include a call to the warnings module, specifically to emit a `RemovedInDjango41Warning` or a similarly purposed new warning if required by the project's deprecation policy."

If `RemovedInDjango41Warning` does not exist or if creating a new warning type is more appropriate (e.g., `DeprecatedInDjango32Warning` for marking things deprecated in Django 3.2 as opposed to removed in Django 4.1), define it here. The behavior of this warning should align with how Django typically notifies developers of deprecations, perhaps offering a more specific message that clearly states the deprecation version and the removal version."
