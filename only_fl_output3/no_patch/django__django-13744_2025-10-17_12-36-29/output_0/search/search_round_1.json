        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. **MemcachedCache Class Definition in `django/core/cache/backends/memcached.py`**\n\n- **What it does:** The `MemcachedCache` class extends `BaseMemcachedCache` and implements `__init__`, `get`, and `delete` methods that are specific for interfacing with a Memcached cache backend.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** This is the class that the issue explicitly asks to deprecate. It's directly related to the reported problem because the library `python-memcached` it relies on is no longer maintained, leading to difficulties in resolving issues.\n- **Intended behavior:** Considering the issue description, the intended behavior would be to mark this class as deprecated, guiding users towards alternatives, specifically to start using `pymemcache` as a backend.\n\n#### 2. **Occurrences of `MemcachedCache` in the Project**\n\n- **What it does:** The search for `MemcachedCache` inside the codebase likely indicates where this class is instantiated or referenced, which could include backend configurations, documentation, or tests.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** It's crucial to identify all places where `MemcachedCache` is used or referenced to effectively communicate the deprecation to developers. References might need to be updated or annotated with deprecation warnings.\n- **Intended behavior:** The code snippets that reference `MemcachedCache` will need to be analyzed to see if they should be updated immediately or marked in a way that signals the impending deprecation.\n\n#### 3. **Search for `@deprecated` Returning No Results**\n\n- **What it does:** This indicates the project might not use the `@deprecated` decorator or keyword in its deprecation processes.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** It shows that we might need to find an alternative standard or create a new one for marking deprecations within this project.\n- **Intended behavior:** We need to look into how Django signals deprecation to its developers and users. Given that the `@deprecated` search returned no results, we should consider using the project-specific way of deprecating features.\n\n#### 4. **Occurrences of `RemovedInDjango41Warning`**\n\n- **What it does:** This search result shows that `RemovedInDjango41Warning` is used across various parts of the Django codebase. It indicates the mechanism Django employs for deprecation warnings.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** Since `MemcachedCache` is to be deprecated in Django 3.2 with removal slated for Django 4.1, using or creating a similar warning specific to this deprecation could align with established practices.\n- **Intended behavior:** The intended behavior would be to apply a similar warning mechanism to the `MemcachedCache` class and its references, informing users of the deprecation timeline and recommending the transition to `pymemcache`.\n\n### Next Steps for More Context\n\nGiven the analysis above, it seems appropriate to further explore how `RemovedInDjango41Warning` is implemented and applied within the Django project. Specifically, we can:\n\n1. **Examine how `RemovedInDjango41Warning` is defined and used to mark other features as deprecated:**\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"RemovedInDjango41Warning\", \"django/utils/deprecation.py\")`\n\n2. **Review how deprecation warnings are documented or communicated within the project to ensure consistent application:**\n   - Since we noted deprecation warnings in various files, it may be beneficial to see an example of how such a warning is applied within those files to a class or method, guiding the implementation for `MemcachedCache`.\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"django/core/validators.py\", line_number=1, window_size=10)` (Assuming line numbers for `RemovedInDjango41Warning` references were provided)\n\nThese steps will help in crafting the correct approach to deprecating `MemcachedCache`, ensuring it's in line with Django's standard practices for deprecation."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This involves adding a deprecation warning that is triggered whenever an instance of `MemcachedCache` is initialized. The warning should inform users that `MemcachedCache` is deprecated as of Django 3.2 and will be removed in Django 4.1, advising users to switch to the `pymemcache` backend. This preserves the existing functionality for now while clearly communicating the future removal to developers. An example implementation might involve overriding the `__init__` method to include a call to the warnings module, specifically to emit a `RemovedInDjango41Warning` or a similarly purposed new warning if required by the project's deprecation policy.\n\n   - **Location 2:**\n     - **File:** `django/utils/deprecation.py` (Or another appropriate place if custom warning needs to be defined)\n     - **Intended Behavior:** Ensure that there is a `DeprecatedInDjango32Warning` or similar if not already existing. If `RemovedInDjango41Warning` does not exist or if creating a new warning type is more appropriate (e.g., `DeprecatedInDjango32Warning` for marking things deprecated in Django 3.2 as opposed to removed in Django 4.1), define it here. The behavior of this warning should align with how Django typically notifies developers of deprecations, perhaps offering a more specific message that clearly states the deprecation version and the removal version.\n\nThese locations are crucial for addressing the issue described. The first location directly tackles the deprecation of the `MemcachedCache` backend, while the second ensures that the project has a consistent and clear way to signal deprecation to its users, fitting within Django's overall approach to feature deprecation and removal notifications."
