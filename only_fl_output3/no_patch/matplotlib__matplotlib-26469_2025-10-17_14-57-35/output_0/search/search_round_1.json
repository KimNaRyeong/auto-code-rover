This was introduced in #2453; previously PdfPages behaved as if `keep_empty=True` (and this was left the default to maintain backcompat).\nIn fact, a pdf file with zero pages is simply not a valid pdf document.  See e.g. the pdf standard (https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf) p. 33: \"A PDF document consists of a collection of objects that together describe the appearance of *one or more pages*...\" (emphasis mine).  Or one can simply check that the empty file created by `PdfPages(\"/tmp/foo.pdf\").close()` is indeed deemed invalid (error-on-open) by at least Acrobat, mupdf, and xpdf.\nThus I propose to eventually stop generating such invalid files at all via switching the default value to `keep_empty=False` and eventually killing the kwarg (deprecation strategy TBD, perhaps warn (with a suppress_warning kwarg) if such a file would have been created, yada yada).\n(Apparently multipage support in mplcairo is getting used, and cairo cannot generate zero-page pdfs, so that's how I found out about this...)\n</issue>"

Here are the analyses based on the aforementioned questions:\n\n### Analysis of `PdfPages` in `backend_pdf.py` and `backend_pgf.py`:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n    Both versions of `PdfPages` serve as handlers for creating PDF files with matplotlib:\n    - The version in `backend_pdf.py` likely handles the creation of standard PDF files directly within matplotlib.\n    - The version in `backend_pgf.py` could support creating PDFs through PGF/TikZ, which is a LaTeX package.\n\n    Each class defines an `__init__` method that sets up the initial state of the `PdfPages` object, including whether empty PDF files should be kept or not via the `keep_empty=True` default argument.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n    The issue stems from the default behavior set by the `keep_empty=True` argument, which leads to saving invalid PDF files that contain no pages. Given the PDF specification and practical considerations highlighted in the issue description, such behavior is undesirable and not compliant with the standard, which requires PDFs to have one or more pages.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n    The intended behavior, according to the issue, is to change the default value of `keep_empty` to `False`, which effectively means that by default, empty PDFs (those with zero pages) should not be saved. This change should adhere to the PDF standard and the practical needs, ensuring that invalid PDF files are not created and saved unnecessarily.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis:\n\nGiven the initial context and analysis,\n- The first step is to prepare changes in both `backend_pdf.py` and `backend_pgf.py` files by setting the `keep_empty=False` in their `__init__` methods.\n- Additionally, since both files seem to handle the `keep_empty` logic in similar but distinct ways, further analysis of how each file handles closing or saving a PDF when `keep_empty=False` would be necessary. It's important to ensure that changes do not introduce unintended side effects, especially in contexts outside the scope of the given issue (e.g., PGF backend behavior).\n- Lastly, considering the mention of a deprecation strategy in the issue description, identifying where warnings or errors should be implemented when users are still relying on the old default (`keep_empty=True`) or explicitly setting it so would be critical. This could involve searching where `PdfPages` instances are created and how the `keep_empty` argument is handled.\n\nWhile the immediate course of action for code modification seems clear, developing a full deprecation strategy will require further planning, possibly including modifications to documentation, and mechanisms for warning users about the change in behavior."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This ensures that empty PDF files (with zero pages) are not created by default, adhering to the PDF standard and addressing practical user concerns. This change needs to be made carefully to ensure that existing functionality for users intentionally creating PDF files and expecting them to be saved regardless of content is preserved. A deprecation warning notifying users of the change in behavior when `keep_empty` is explicitly set to `True` should be considered to facilitate a smooth transition.\n\n    - **Location 2:**\n        - **File:** `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_pgf.py`\n        - **Class:** `PdfPages`\n        - **Method:** `__init__`\n        - **Intended Behavior:** Similarly, the default value of `keep_empty` should be changed to `False`. Because this file seems to cater to PGF/TikZ integration for PDF creation, it's essential to ensure that this change aligns with how PDFs are expected to be generated and manipulated in a LaTeX environment. The same considerations regarding deprecation warnings and preserving existing functionalities apply here as well.\n\nFor both locations, the solution involves not just changing a default parameter but also considering the broader impacts on the library's usability and ensuring users are guided through the transition. This includes updating documentation, potentially adding examples of handling edge cases, and clearly communicating the rationale and benefits of this change within the release notes or migration guides."
