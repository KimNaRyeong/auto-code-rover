This ensures that empty PDF files (with zero pages) are not created by default, adhering to the PDF standard and addressing practical user concerns. This change needs to be made carefully to ensure that existing functionality for users intentionally creating PDF files and expecting them to be saved regardless of content is preserved. A deprecation warning notifying users of the change in behavior when 'keep_empty' is explicitly set to True should be considered to facilitate a smooth transition."

Because this file seems to cater to PGF/TikZ integration for PDF creation, it's essential to ensure that this change aligns with how PDFs are expected to be generated and manipulated in a LaTeX environment. The same considerations regarding deprecation warnings and preserving existing functionalities apply here as well."
