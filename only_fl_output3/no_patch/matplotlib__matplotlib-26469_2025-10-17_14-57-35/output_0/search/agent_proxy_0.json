To find the initialization method of `PdfPages` where `keep_empty` might be set to its default value:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"PdfPages\")`\n\n3. To identify where `keep_empty` is checked before saving the file to disk, which could give insight into how the deprecation could be handled:\n   - `search_code(\"keep_empty\")`"
