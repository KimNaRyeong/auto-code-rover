Given the context and the requirement to accurately reproduce the issue with `keep_empty` parameter, let's refactor the Python script with more emphasis on directly addressing the core issue—whether an empty PdfPages object should generate a file by default—and handling deprecation warnings or changes. This version aims to consider the deprecation of `keep_empty` and the intention to assert failure when a file is generated with no content, directly indicating the issue is not fixed, and exit with code 0 when the issue is resolved, meaning it does not unnecessarily generate an empty PDF.

```python
import os
import sys
from matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf import PdfPages

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def verify_pdf_creation_behavior():
    target_file = "test_empty.pdf"
    try:
        # Attempting to use PdfPages with the intention to observe the effect of keep_empty parameter behavior.
        # Since keep_empty is deprecated, it's omitted to test the new default behavior.
        with PdfPages(target_file) as pdf:
            pass  # Not adding any content to the PDF.

        # The file should not exist if keep_empty=False is indeed the default behavior now.
        file_exists = os.path.exists(target_file)
        if file_exists:
            # If the file exists, it suggests the issue is present: empty PDFs are still being created.
            raise AssertionError("Empty PDF file was wrongly created; the issue is present.")
        else:
            # Correct behavior: no empty PDF file created, issue seems to be fixed.
            print("Issue seems to be fixed: Empty PDF file was not created by default.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit code 1 for failure to adhere to expected behavior.
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # General error exit code.
    finally:
        if os.path.exists(target_file):
            os.remove(target_file)  # Cleanup to remove any generated file.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    verify_pdf_creation_behavior()
```

This script takes a direct approach to check the outcome of using `PdfPages` without specifying `keep_empty` under the assumption it is or will be deprecated, to identify whether the default behavior aligns with generating valid PDF files (i.e., not creating a PDF when no pages are added). The `AssertionError` is used to indicate when the behavior does not meet the expected default, pointing towards the problem of creating empty PDFs that do not adhere to standards.
