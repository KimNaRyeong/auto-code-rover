To reproduce the described issue, you'll need a script that attempts to create a PDF file using matplotlib's `PdfPages` with no figures added to it, and then assesses whether this results in an invalid PDF file being created (due to `keep_empty=True` by default). To do this programmatically and automatically check for the presence of this issue, we can use a combination of creating an empty PDF and attempting to verify its validity.

However, it's worth noting that programmatically verifying the validity of a PDF file can be complex and may involve external libraries or tools not inherently available in Python's standard library or common packages like matplotlib. A straightforward reproducer can aim to create such a zero-page PDF and raise an `AssertionError` if the file exists, which suggests that `keep_empty=True` is indeed the default behavior (indicating the issue is present).

```python
import os
import sys
from matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf import PdfPages

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def verify_pdf_creation_behavior():
    target_file = "test_empty.pdf"
    try:
        with PdfPages(target_file, keep_empty=True) as pdf:
            # Intentionally add no figures to mimic the issue scenario
            pass

        # Check if the PDF file was created
        file_created = os.path.exists(target_file)
        # The assertion below checks if 'keep_empty=True' is indeed the default
        # behavior by asserting the file should NOT exist if the default changes
        # to 'keep_empty=False'
        assert file_created, "PDF file with zero pages should not be created."

        print("Issue present: PDF file was incorrectly created despite being empty.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        # If AssertionError is caught, it indicates the default behavior might have been changed correctly to 'keep_empty=False'
        print("Issue seems to be fixed: Empty PDF file was not created by default.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    finally:
        # Cleanup
        if os.path.exists(target_file):
            os.remove(target_file)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    verify_pdf_creation_behavior()
```

This script essentially does the following:
- Attempts to create an empty PDF file using `PdfPages`.
- Checks whether the file was created.
- If the file exists, it asserts an issue is present because it implies `keep_empty=True` by default.
- If an `AssertionError` is not raised, it suggests that the issue might have been fixed (i.e., `keep_empty=False` might be the new default).
- Uses a `try-except-finally` block to ensure proper cleanup and error handling/reporting.

Remember, the effectiveness of this reproducer in identifying the specific issue depends on the ability to assess file creation and does not delve into PDF content validation or the nuances of valid vs. invalid PDF files as per the PDF standard.
