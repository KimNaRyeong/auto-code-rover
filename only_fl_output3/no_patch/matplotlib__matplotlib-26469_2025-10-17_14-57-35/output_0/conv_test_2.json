This was introduced in #2453; previously PdfPages behaved as if `keep_empty=True` (and this was left the default to maintain backcompat).\r\n\r\nIn fact, a pdf file with zero pages is simply not a valid pdf document.  See e.g. the pdf standard (https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf) p. 33: \"A PDF document consists of a collection of objects that together describe the appearance of *one or more pages*...\" (emphasis mine).  Or one can simply check that the empty file created by `PdfPages(\"/tmp/foo.pdf\").close()` is indeed deemed invalid (error-on-open) by at least Acrobat, mupdf, and xpdf.\r\n\r\nThus I propose to eventually stop generating such invalid files at all via switching the default value to `keep_empty=False` and eventually killing the kwarg (deprecation strategy TBD, perhaps warn (with a suppress_warning kwarg) if such a file would have been created, yada yada).\r\n\r\n(Apparently multipage support in mplcairo is getting used, and cairo cannot generate zero-page pdfs, so that's how I found out about this...)\n"

This version aims to consider the deprecation of `keep_empty` and the intention to assert failure when a file is generated with no content, directly indicating the issue is not fixed, and exit with code 0 when the issue is resolved, meaning it does not unnecessarily generate an empty PDF.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nfrom matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf import PdfPages\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef verify_pdf_creation_behavior():\n    target_file = \"test_empty.pdf\"\n    try:\n        # Attempting to use PdfPages with the intention to observe the effect of keep_empty parameter behavior.\n        # Since keep_empty is deprecated, it's omitted to test the new default behavior.\n        with PdfPages(target_file) as pdf:\n            pass  # Not adding any content to the PDF.\n\n        # The file should not exist if keep_empty=False is indeed the default behavior now.\n        file_exists = os.path.exists(target_file)\n        if file_exists:\n            # If the file exists, it suggests the issue is present: empty PDFs are still being created.\n            raise AssertionError(\"Empty PDF file was wrongly created; the issue is present.\")\n        else:\n            # Correct behavior: no empty PDF file created, issue seems to be fixed.\n            print(\"Issue seems to be fixed: Empty PDF file was not created by default.\")\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        sys.exit(1)  # Exit code 1 for failure to adhere to expected behavior.\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        sys.exit(1)  # General error exit code.\n    finally:\n        if os.path.exists(target_file):\n            os.remove(target_file)  # Cleanup to remove any generated file.\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    verify_pdf_creation_behavior()\n```\n\nThis script takes a direct approach to check the outcome of using `PdfPages` without specifying `keep_empty` under the assumption it is or will be deprecated, to identify whether the default behavior aligns with generating valid PDF files (i.e., not creating a PDF when no pages are added). The `AssertionError` is used to indicate when the behavior does not meet the expected default, pointing towards the problem of creating empty PDFs that do not adhere to standards."
