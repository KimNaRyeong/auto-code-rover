        "intended_behavior": "Instead of immediately raising a ValueError when encountering nested relations within the condition of a FilteredRelation, the method needs to be adapted to parse and correctly handle these nested relations. The logic should be expanded to map nested relations into an appropriately structured JOIN clause that can be processed by the database. This will involve careful analysis and transformation of the query condition to ensure it respects the relational hierarchy and dependencies indicated by the nested relations. Furthermore, error handling should be refined to provide informative feedback on how to correctly structure nested conditions, rather than a blanket prohibition."

        "method": "as_sql",
        "intended_behavior": "To support the handling of nested relations in FilteredRelation's condition, as_sql must be capable of dynamically generating SQL that accurately represents the complex join conditions implied by nested relations. This entails the creation of multiple join paths as necessary, based on the depth and structure of the nested relations defined in condition. It must intelligently handle aliasing and ensure that the resulting SQL queries maintain correct referential integrity. The method should work in tandem with any changes made to add_filtered_relation to support the expanded functionality, ensuring that there is seamless processing from the condition definition to the actual SQL generation."
