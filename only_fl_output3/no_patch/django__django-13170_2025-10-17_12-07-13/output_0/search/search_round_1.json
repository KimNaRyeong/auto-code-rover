        "content": "Upon reviewing the results:\n\n### Analysis of `FilteredRelation` class in `django/db/models/query_utils.py`:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - It defines a class `FilteredRelation` which likely allows annotating a queryset with a filtered relation based on a condition. The constructor accepts a relation name and a condition, which is an instance of `Q()`.\n   - Methods like `__eq__`, `clone`, `resolve_expression`, and `as_sql` suggest it's designed to work seamlessly with Django's ORM, particularly in the construction of SQL queries from ORM expressions.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - This class is central to the issue. The bug report indicates a limitation in the `FilteredRelation`'s capacity to handle conditions with nested relations. The class design will need revision or enhancement to support this functionality.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Ideally, the `FilteredRelation` class should be capable of interpreting and translating nested relations specified in the `condition` argument into the corresponding SQL query. This would involve parsing nested `__` lookups and generating a valid SQL JOIN clause that reflects the desired filtering.\n\n### Analysis of `annotate` method in `django/db/models/query.py`:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `annotate` method allows adding extra data or aggregations to objects returned by a queryset. It validates the provided expressions and updates a queryset clone with the annotations.\n   - It handles both regular annotations and `FilteredRelation` instances differently, the former by adding annotations directly and the latter by calling `add_filtered_relation`.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The method's treatment of `FilteredRelation` instances is crucial. The error mentioned in the issue likely emerges from the interactions between `annotate` and the mechanisms that `add_filtered_relation` employs to handle the `FilteredRelation` instances, specifically, its inability to deal with nested attributes in conditions.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The `annotate` method, along with the underlying mechanisms it employs (e.g., `add_filtered_relation`), should be capable of accurately interpreting `FilteredRelation` instances with nested relations in their conditions. This entails correctly adding JOIN clauses or other necessary SQL to include the filtered relation based on nested attributes.\n\n### Next Steps for More Context:\nGiven the direct involvement of `FilteredRelation` and its interaction with `annotate`, it's clear the implementation and handling of conditions within these elements are where modifications are needed. However, since the search for an explicit message related to the limitation returned no results, it suggests the limitation might be undocumented in code or handled indirectly.\n\nTo get more context, specifically on how nested relations in conditions could be managed or why they currently result in a `ValueError`, further investigation into how `FilteredRelation`'s conditions are parsed and translated to SQL may be necessary. This could involve:\n\n- Searching for `add_filtered_relation` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` because the annotate's handling of `FilteredRelation` mentions directly calling this method.\n- Exploring how the `condition` parameter of `FilteredRelation` is used within `resolve_expression` and `as_sql` methods, which might reveal why nested relations aren't supported.\n\nThus, the following API calls would be useful:\n- search_method_in_file(\"add_filtered_relation\", \"django/db/models/sql/query.py\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"resolve_expression\", \"FilteredRelation\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"as_sql\", \"FilteredRelation\")"

This might involve modifying the way JOIN clauses are constructed or introducing new logic to handle deeper levels of nesting.\n  \n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/db/models/sql/query.py`\n  - **Method:** `add_filtered_relation`\n  \n  **Intended Behavior:**\n  - `add_filtered_relation` should be adapted to handle `FilteredRelation` instances that involve nested relations. This includes correctly interpreting the nested conditions and generating the appropriate JOIN clauses to satisfy these conditions.\n  - Preserve existing functionality for non-nested conditions to ensure backward compatibility.\n  - Implement new logic (if necessary) specifically aimed at accurately parsing and applying conditions that refer to nested relationships, ensuring that the final SQL query reflects the intended filtering.\n  \nThis analysis suggests that enhancing `FilteredRelation` to support nested relations requires modifications both in how it's initialized and interprets conditions, and in how these conditions are applied within a query, specifically through `add_filtered_relation`."
