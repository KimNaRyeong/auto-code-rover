I apologize for the confusion earlier. Let's correct the approach to ensure the script properly attempts to reproduce the stated issue and reacts accordingly. The revised script will still set up a minimal Django application but with a clarified mechanism for checking whether the issue exists, and it will leverage the provided `print_stacktrace` function correctly to print details when the issue persists.

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import sys
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import FilteredRelation, Q

# Define a minimal Django configuration
settings.configure(
    INSTALLED_APPS=[
        '__main__',  # This script will be its own Django app
    ],
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        },
    },
    USE_TZ=True,
)

django.setup()

# Define models to reproduce the issue
class Restaurant(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

class Pizza(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    restaurant = models.ForeignKey(Restaurant, related_name="pizzas", on_delete=models.CASCADE)

class Topping(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    pizza = models.ForeignKey(Pizza, related_name="toppings", on_delete=models.CASCADE)

# Utility function to print the stack trace.
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Attempt to use FilteredRelation in a way that would trigger the issue if not fixed
try:
    Restaurant.objects.annotate(
        pizzas_with_toppings_startswith_n=FilteredRelation(
            'pizzas__toppings',
            condition=Q(pizzas__toppings__name__startswith='n'),
        ),
    )
    print("No error occurred. The issue seems to be fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Corrected to exit with 0 to indicate the absence of the issue
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    assert e.__class__ is ValueError, "Expected a ValueError due to unsupported nested relations"
    assert "doesn't support nested relations" in str(e), "Error message mismatch"
    sys.exit(1)  # Maintains exiting with 1 but now signifies the proper handling and verification of the error
```

This version of `reproducer.py` attempts to use nested relations in a `FilteredRelation` and catches exceptions appropriately. The assertions are aligned to verify that the exact issue is encountered (a `ValueError` indicating the support issue with nested relations).

The script exits with code `1` when encountering the expected `ValueError`, specifically signaling the presence of the issue as described. An exit code of `0` indicates the issue has potentially been resolved, either due to not encountering an error or catching a different exception than anticipated.
