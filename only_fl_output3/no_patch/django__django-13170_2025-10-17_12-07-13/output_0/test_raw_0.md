Here's a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` designed as per your instructions. This script attempts to use Django's `FilteredRelation` functionality to simulate the scenario you described. When executed, it will assert the presence of the issue by expecting a `ValueError` when attempting to use nested relations within a `FilteredRelation`'s condition. If Django's behavior changes in the future to support nested relations in this context, the assertion should fail, indicating the issue has been addressed.

```python
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import FilteredRelation, Q

# Minimal Django setup
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=[
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',

class Restaurant(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)

class Pizza(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    restaurant = models.ForeignKey(Restaurant, related_name='pizzas', on_delete=models.CASCADE)

class Topping(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    pizza = models.ForeignKey(Pizza, related_name='toppings', on_delete=models.CASCADE)

# Function to print the stack trace
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_reproducer():
    try:
        # Attempt to filter on a nested relation
        Restaurant.objects.annotate(
            pizzas_with_toppings_startswith_n=FilteredRelation(
                'pizzas__toppings',
                condition=Q(pizzas__toppings__name__startswith='n'),
            ),
        )
        # If the previous line did not raise an error, assert failure (issue fixed)
        assert False, "Expected a ValueError for nested relations, but didn't get one."
    except ValueError as e:
        print("Issue detected as described.")
        print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "__main__")
    try:
        run_reproducer()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("The issue has potentially been fixed or the behavior has changed.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
```

This script makes use of in-line Django models and a minimal Django configuration for simplicity, allowing it to be executed in an isolated environment without needing a complete Django project setup. Please note that this script assumes Django is installed in the environment where it's being run. If not, Django can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install django
```

When you run `python3 reproduposer.py`, it should print a stack trace of the `ValueError` as described in your issue. If the Django team addresses this limitation and permits nested relations in `FilteredRelation` conditions, the script's assertion will fail, signaling that the behavior has been modified.
