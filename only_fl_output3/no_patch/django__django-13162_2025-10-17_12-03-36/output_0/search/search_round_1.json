For example:\n0003_merge_20160102_0304.py\nThis name is more opaque than necessary. When one reads it, it isn't immediately clear which migrations were merged. One must inspect the file to find that information.\nInstead, I suggest the default filename should be created by combining the files being merged. This way, it includes the information without requiring one to inspect the file. This information is also useful in the migrate command's output. As it is most likely to merge two migrations files, this should remain a reasonable length.\nFor example:\n0003_merge_0002_conflicting_second_0002_second.py\nIf preferable, we could decide to join the names in other ways too. For example, separate names by __ (two underscores) or exclude prefix numbers. To start, I'll go with the easiest approach unless there is strong preference for a different naming scheme.\n</issue>"

If the actual method name differs, this might need adjustment.\n3. `search_code(\"merge migration filename\")` - To find snippets directly related to how merge migration filenames are mentioned or generated, since it's possible that the logic or a hint to it could be commented or detailed in a seemingly unrelated part of the codebase.\n\nThese searches aim to triangulate the code responsible for the issue, giving us a starting point for proposing a solution."

This suggests multiple definitions of \"Migration\", likely tailored to specific functionalities within those contrib apps or for recording migration history.\n\n#### Related to the bug?\nAmong these files, the `django/db/migrations/migration.py` file stands out as potentially the most relevant to the issue. This file likely contains the core definitions and functionalities associated with migration operations, including how migrations (including merge migrations) are defined, executed, and possibly named.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nThe intended behavior of code in this file would ideally include methods or logic that define and handle attributes or aspects of migrations directly -- this might be where the naming logic for migrations, including merge migrations, can be modified to reflect a more informative pattern as suggested in the issue.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven the results, the initial guesses for method names like `generate_migration_filename` did not return results, suggesting the actual method name might differ or the logic for generating filenames is located within a method that serves a broader purpose or different naming convention. Similarly, searching for a specific code snippet using the string \"merge migration filename\" returned no results, indicating either that the naming logic is not explicitly commented with this string or that it resides in a place not directly searchable with that phrase.\n\nConsidering this, we need to dive deeper into the file identified as most likely to contain relevant code (`django/db/migrations/migration.py`) and perhaps also inspect how Django generates names for files upon merging migrations more broadly, if not confined to a single method with an easily guessable name.\n\n### Adjusted API Calls for More Context\n\n1. **Inspect Migration Related Code**: Since the direct method name or code snippet searches were unsuccessful, let's inspect the core migration handling file more closely.\n\n   - `search_code(\"merge\", \"django/db/migrations/migration.py\")` - This is to find any references to \"merge\" within the core migration file, which could include comments, method names, or even variables related to merging logic, potentially revealing how merge migration filenames are generated.\n\n2. **Broader Search for Merge Naming Logic**: Since the \"generate_migration_filename\" method was not found, and knowing Django's approach to handling migrations and operations, we might look into related operational or utility classes/methods that could be involved in naming.\n\n   - `search_class(\"MigrationAutodetector\")` - This class might be responsible for detecting changes that require migrations and possibly involved in naming migrations or handling merge migrations specifically.\n   - `search_method(\"merge_migrations\")` - To look for methods that explicitly handle the process of merging migrations, which might include or reference the logic for naming.\n\nThese adjusted searches aim to explore more deeply into the Django migration mechanism, potentially uncovering how merge migration filenames are generated and where changes could be implemented to address the issue described."

This method's name wasn't identified in the initial search, so it's assumed it might be part of a broader file operations or migration detection method.\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Modify this method to incorporate logic for generating filenames for merge migrations by concatenating the names of the migrations being merged, ensuring readability and immediate recognition of the merged entities from the filename alone. The behavior should maintain the option for easily parsing these filenames programmatically, preserving compatibility with existing mechanisms that parse or rely on migration filenames.\n\n- **Hypothetical Bug Location 2** (if applicable):\n  - **File**: Defined after more context is gathered, specifically if there's a utility or helper class/file dedicated to migrations filename generation.\n  - **Class/Method**: Specific class and method that handles utilities or helper functionalities, including filename generation for different types of migrations.\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Introduce or modify utilities to support the generation of more informative merge migration filenames, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with the current migration creation and application workflows.\n\nSince the exact locations and methods are based on assumptions without direct results from the initial queries, obtaining more context through the proposed searches is crucial for accurate identification and resolution of the issue."
