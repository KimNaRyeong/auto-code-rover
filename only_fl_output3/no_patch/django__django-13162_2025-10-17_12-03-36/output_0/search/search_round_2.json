For example:\n0003_merge_20160102_0304.py\nThis name is more opaque than necessary. When one reads it, it isn't immediately clear which migrations were merged. One must inspect the file to find that information.\nInstead, I suggest the default filename should be created by combining the files being merged. This way, it includes the information without requiring one to inspect the file. This information is also useful in the migrate command's output. As it is most likely to merge two migrations files, this should remain a reasonable length.\nFor example:\n0003_merge_0002_conflicting_second_0002_second.py\nIf preferable, we could decide to join the names in other ways too. For example, separate names by __ (two underscores) or exclude prefix numbers. To start, I'll go with the easiest approach unless there is strong preference for a different naming scheme.\n</issue>"

This suggests multiple definitions of \"Migration\", likely tailored to specific functionalities within those contrib apps or for recording migration history.\n\n#### Related to the bug?\nAmong these files, the `django/db/migrations/migration.py` file stands out as potentially the most relevant to the issue. This file likely contains the core definitions and functionalities associated with migration operations, including how migrations (including merge migrations) are defined, executed, and possibly named.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nThe intended behavior of code in this file would ideally include methods or logic that define and handle attributes or aspects of migrations directly -- this might be where the naming logic for migrations, including merge migrations, can be modified to reflect a more informative pattern as suggested in the issue.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven the results, the initial guesses for method names like `generate_migration_filename` did not return results, suggesting the actual method name might differ or the logic for generating filenames is located within a method that serves a broader purpose or different naming convention. Similarly, searching for a specific code snippet using the string \"merge migration filename\" returned no results, indicating either that the naming logic is not explicitly commented with this string or that it resides in a place not directly searchable with that phrase.\n\nConsidering this, we need to dive deeper into the file identified as most likely to contain relevant code (`django/db/migrations/migration.py`) and perhaps also inspect how Django generates names for files upon merging migrations more broadly, if not confined to a single method with an easily guessable name.\n\n### Adjusted API Calls for More Context\n\n1. **Inspect Migration Related Code**: Since the direct method name or code snippet searches were unsuccessful, let's inspect the core migration handling file more closely.\n\n   - `search_code(\"merge\", \"django/db/migrations/migration.py\")` - This is to find any references to \"merge\" within the core migration file, which could include comments, method names, or even variables related to merging logic, potentially revealing how merge migration filenames are generated.\n\n2. **Broader Search for Merge Naming Logic**: Since the \"generate_migration_filename\" method was not found, and knowing Django's approach to handling migrations and operations, we might look into related operational or utility classes/methods that could be involved in naming.\n\n   - `search_class(\"MigrationAutodetector\")` - This class might be responsible for detecting changes that require migrations and possibly involved in naming migrations or handling merge migrations specifically.\n   - `search_method(\"merge_migrations\")` - To look for methods that explicitly handle the process of merging migrations, which might include or reference the logic for naming.\n\nThese adjusted searches aim to explore more deeply into the Django migration mechanism, potentially uncovering how merge migration filenames are generated and where changes could be implemented to address the issue described."

This class is crucial for the Django migrations framework, as it:\n\n1. **Functionality**: Looks responsible for detecting changes between different states of applications and generating migration operations based on those changes. It handles a wide array of operations, including creating and deleting models, adding, renaming, and removing fields, and altering various attributes of models like indexes, constraints, and options.\n   \n2. **Relationship with the Bug**: Though the class does not explicitly mention merge migrations, its comprehensive role in identifying and acting upon changes suggests it could indirectly affect how merge migrations are named, especially if part of the migration generation process involves consolidating multiple migration actions into a single file. The absence of a direct reference to merge naming logic here suggests that the naming convention might be applied elsewhere, possibly at a higher level of command execution or within a utility function that specifically handles file naming conventions.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**: For the issue at hand, if the `MigrationAutodetector` class is involved in determining when a merge migration is necessary, its output might influence how the naming is eventually executed. The intended behavior would be ensuring that any logic for generating merge migration filenames\u2014whether directly within this class or triggered by its outputs\u2014should include a more descriptive naming scheme that incorporates information on what migrations are being merged.\n\nGiven the issue's description and the absence of specific \"merge\" handling within the `migration.py` and a method named \"merge_migrations`, one could infer that the logic for naming merge migrations isn't handled at the micro-operation level within migrations but perhaps at a broader level where migrations are being created, named, and applied.\n\n### Additional Context Needed\n\nGiven the above analysis, it's clear that more context is necessary to pinpoint exactly where merge migration filenames are determined. Since direct search for \"merge_migrations\" didn't yield results, and the inspection within `migration.py` failed to locate a \"merge\" reference, a more nuanced approach is needed. Here are the proposed steps for gathering more context:\n\n1. **Explore Migration Creation Command**: Since the issue relates to the filenames of generated migrations, examining the command or function responsible for actually creating migration files might be helpful. This could involve searching for the code that handles `makemigrations` command logic or similar.\n\n2. **Utility Functions for Filenames**: There might be utility functions dedicated to generating filenames for migrations, including merge migrations, which could be identified by searching for keywords relating to file creation, naming conventions, or specifically handling merge operations in a broader context than detected earlier.\n\nTo proceed with these steps, one might consider the following API calls for additional context, although they cannot be directly invoked here:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"makemigrations\", \"<relevant_file>\")`: To find references to how the `makemigrations` command is implemented.\n- `search_code(\"filename generation\")`: This very broad search might hit many unrelated results but could help identify any utility functions or classes dedicated to managing migration filenames.\n- `search_code(\"merge migration\")`: Since the direct method search was unfruitful, searching for occurrences of this specific phrase might highlight comments, documentation, or code logic involving the treatment of merge migrations specifically."
