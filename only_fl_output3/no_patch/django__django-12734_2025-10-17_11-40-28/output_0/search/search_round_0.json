        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about the classes, methods, and possibly migration files involved. Here are the API calls that would help in collecting the required information:\n\n1. **Search for the `Vulnerability` class**: Given that the issue is directly related to changes in the `Vulnerability` model, we first need to understand how this model is structured beyond the provided snippet. This information could include class methods and relationships which might be impacted by the field type alteration.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"Vulnerability\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the `AppVersion` class**: Since `Vulnerability` has a `ManyToMany` field pointing to `AppVersion`, we need to understand the structure and potential custom methods within the `AppVersion` model that could be relevant for the migration.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"AppVersion\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for migration-related methods**: The issue described involves a migration that did not update a related field as expected. Understanding how migrations are handled might give insight into why this particular case failed.\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"AlterField\")\n   search_method(\"migrate\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Search for the code snippet dealing with migrations where `AlterField` is used**, specifically for the `Vulnerability` model. This could provide a direct look at any custom migration logic that might be affecting the update process of the `ManyToMany` relationship.\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"migrations.AlterField(model_name='vulnerability'\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls aim to give a comprehensive overview of both the `Vulnerability` and `AppVersion` models, the relationship between them, and how alterations in model fields are managed during migrations. This data will be crucial for identifying the root cause of the issue and developing a solution."
