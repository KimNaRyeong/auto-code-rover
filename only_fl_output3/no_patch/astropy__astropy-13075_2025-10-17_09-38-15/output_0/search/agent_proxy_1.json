Thus, within the `Cosmology` class, the intended behavior involves adding a new method or modifying the existing `write` mechanism to support exporting Cosmology instances in an HTML format. This might not directly modify the `write` method itself but could involve enhancing the IO infrastructure (`CosmologyIO` might be a relevant context, if existing) to recognize and process a new `'html'` format. The steps would include:\n    - Registering the `'html'` format with the `write` mechanism, possibly by extending `UnifiedReadWriteMethod` or the relevant registry system that handles IO formats.\n    - Implementing a function that converts a cosmology instance to an HTML table, utilizing the `cosmology.io.table.to_table()` method (or creating a suitable alternative if not already available) to first convert the instance to a table format.\n    - Formatting the table data into HTML, ensuring mathematical expressions are correctly represented using MathJax. This might involve integrating or developing functionality to translate Cosmology parameters and their descriptions (including units) into MathJax-enabled HTML snippets.\n    - The method would then utilize `QTable.write(..., format='html')` or a similar mechanism tailored for producing the HTML output, considering the input from the user about integrating MathJax for better mathematical expression representation.\n    - Ensure that this new functionality aligns with existing APIs\u2019 design patterns and usability principles, including error handling, customizability (e.g., allowing users to specify additional HTML formatting options), and documentation.\n    - This addition must preserve the existing functionality and interfaces of the `Cosmology` class, ensuring that any new behavior is complementary and does not disrupt current users' workflows or expectations.\n    - Besides adding this method, it would be necessary to update the documentation to include this new format option, providing examples of its usage and output."
