Note: This script assumes the issue is present if there is a difference between the original and reset segments, leading to coarse lines. The comparison may need adjustment depending on how `matplotlib` represents and compares these segments internally. This is a basic approach to detect changes in segment definition which may not directly catch visual coarseness but assumes segment alteration leading to coarseness.
