Based on your instructions and correcting the approach to specifically target the issue described, I will write a standalone Python script that aims to reproduce the coarsening issue upon manipulating segments from a Matplotlib contour plot. The script will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, displaying a detailed stack trace for debugging purposes.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproducer():
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Create a test pattern
    x = np.linspace(-1.1, 1.1, 100)
    y = np.linspace(-1.1, 1.1, 100)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    Z = X**2 + Y**2

    plt.figure()
    c = plt.contour(X, Y, Z, levels=[1.0], colors="k")

    # Attempt to manipulate segments
    try:
        lc = c.collections[0]
        segments_before = lc.get_segments()  # Save original segments
        lc.set_segments(segments_before)
        segments_after = lc.get_segments()

        assert segments_before == segments_after, "Manipulating segments causes coarseness."

    except AttributeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

    plt.close('all')  # Ensure the plot is closed after the check

try:
    reproducer()
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exit with an error code to indicate issue presence
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exit with a general error code for any other issues
else:
    print("No issue detected.")
    exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate no issues were found

```

This script is designed to:

1. Setup a contour plot similary as previously intended.
2. Attempt to perform the `get_segments` and `set_segments` operations to simulate the reported issue.
3. Use an assertion to check if the segments before and after manipulation match. This is based on the expectation that `set_segments` with the same data shouldn't alter the appearance or data of the line collection if the issue is fixed.
4. Catch any `AttributeError` directly related to the `get_segments` and `set_segments` operations, printing a comprehensive stack trace if such an error occurs.
5. Catch any other exceptions, ensuring any form of exception is correctly handled and reported.

Execute this script with Python 3 to test for the described coarsening issue.
