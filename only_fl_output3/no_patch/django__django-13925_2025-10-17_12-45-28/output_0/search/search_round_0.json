        "content": "To address the issue effectively, I need to gather more context regarding the inheritance pattern of the models mentioned, as well as how primary keys are defined within them. I'll perform the following searches:\n\n1. Retrieve details about the `Entity` class, as it's mentioned as the ancestor class where the primary key is initially defined. This will give insight into how the primary key is specified, which might not be correctly inherited by descendant models in Django 3.2 alpha.\n    - `search_class(\"Entity\")`\n\n2. Since the `User` model is specifically mentioned as inheriting from `Entity` and is exhibiting the issue, I'll look into its definition. This should provide details on how it's attempting to inherit the primary key from `Entity`.\n    - `search_class(\"User\")`\n\n3. To understand how primary keys are typically defined within the affected models, it's crucial to inspect the AppConfig for one of the mentioned apps. The AppConfig might specify something relevant to the default auto field. Given `SpeedyCoreAccountsConfig` as an example, I'll search for its definition. This will show if and how `default_auto_field` is being set, which is crucial for understanding part of the warning message.\n    - `search_class(\"SpeedyCoreAccountsConfig\")`\n\n4. Since the issue might stem from a misconfiguration or a misunderstanding of Django's expectations for model inheritance and primary key specification, I'll search for an example of how primary keys are defined within the codebase. This code snippet represents a common pattern that might be present in these models.\n    - `search_code(\"primary_key=True\")`\n\nBy analyzing the details obtained from these searches, I should be able to understand the core of the problem and guide towards adjusting the model definitions or configuration to resolve the warnings related to `models.W042`."
