This script will attempt to reproduce the issue by fitting a `GridSearchCV` with a RandomForestClassifier on the Iris dataset and estimating the refit time by subtracting the sum of fit and score times from the total time taken by `fit()`. Since `GridSearchCV` currently does not provide a `refit_time_` attribute to directly access the time it took to refit the best found parameters on the full dataset, the script will attempt to access it and is expected to raise an `AttributeError`. The `AssertionError` is aimed to occur if the issue is unexpectedly fixed without updating the script, thereby implying a mismatch in expected behavior. Please note, this implementation assumes the absence of parallel execution (`n_jobs=1` or not set) for simplicity in estimating total fit time.
