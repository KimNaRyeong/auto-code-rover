This standalone python script named `reproducer.py` is carefully designed to follow your instructions. It checks for the existence of a `refit_time_` attribute in the `GridSearchCV` object after fitting. The logic is:

- If the `refit_time_` attribute does not exist, it raises an `AssertionError` and the script exits with code 1.
- If the script encounters any other type of exception, it also exits with code 1 but after printing the stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function.
- The script exits with code 0 if the `refit_time_` attribute is successfully accessed, indicating the feature request has been implemented.

This approach ensures that the script behaves as requested, demonstrating the issue's presence through its exit status and output.
