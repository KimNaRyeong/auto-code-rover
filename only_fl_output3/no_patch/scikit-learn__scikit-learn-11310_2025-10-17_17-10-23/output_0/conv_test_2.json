What I can so far do is retrieve the time it takes to fit and score each model:\r\n```\r\nimport sklearn.datasets\r\nimport sklearn.model_selection\r\nimport sklearn.ensemble\r\n\r\nX, y = sklearn.datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True)\r\n\r\nrs = sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV(\r\n    estimator=sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier(),\r\n    param_grid={'n_estimators': [2, 3, 4, 5]}\r\n)\r\nrs.fit(X, y)\r\nprint(rs.cv_results_['mean_fit_time'])\r\nprint(rs.cv_results_['mean_score_time'])\r\n```\r\nIn case I run this on a single core, I could time the whole search procedure and subtract the time it took to fit the single folds during hyperparameter optimization. Nevertheless, this isn't possible any more when setting `n_jobs != 1`.\r\n\r\nThus, it would be great to have an attribute `refit_time_` which is simply the time it took to refit the best model.\r\n\r\nUsecase: for [OpenML.org](https://openml.org) we want to support uploading the results of hyperparameter optimization, including the time it takes to do the hyperparameter optimization. \n"

        "content": "Given the guidelines and the task to demonstrate the absence of a feature (`refit_time_` attribute) and to properly handle and report any exceptions, below is an adjusted version of the `reproducer.py`. This script is designed to intentionally look for the `refit_time_` attribute in the `GridSearchCV` object after it has been fitted. Since this attribute does not exist (as of my last update), it should gracefully catch and report this specific issue through an `AssertionError`.\n\nPlease note, the initial description you provided describes a desired feature rather than a bug per se. Thus, the assertion logic here is crafted to affirm the absence of the feature, which means that the script will only exit with code 0 if the issue is resolved by adding this feature in a future version of scikit-learn.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\nimport time\nimport sklearn.datasets\nimport sklearn.model_selection\nimport sklearn.ensemble\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        X, y = sklearn.datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True)\n        \n        rs = sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV(\n            estimator=sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier(),\n            param_grid={'n_estimators': [2, 3, 4, 5]},\n            refit=True\n        )\n\n        rs.fit(X, y)\n        \n        # Expected failure here since 'refit_time_' does not exist\n        refit_time = getattr(rs, \"refit_time_\", None)\n        \n        # If 'refit_time_' does not exist, it would be None, causing the assertion to fail\n        assert refit_time is not None, \"Attribute 'refit_time_' does not exist.\"\n\n    except AssertionError as ae:\n        print_stacktrace(ae)\n        exit(1)  # Exiting with error since it confirms the absence of the attribute\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        exit(1)\n\n    exit(0)  # Exiting with 0 as the script shouldn't ideally reach this without error until fixed\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis script follows your guidelines, aiming to raise an `AssertionError` if the desired feature (the `refit_time_` attribute) is not present. It captures and prints a trace for this specific situation or any other unexpected error. For clarity and reliability, this reproducer ensures a straightforward method to validate future implementation against the issue described."
