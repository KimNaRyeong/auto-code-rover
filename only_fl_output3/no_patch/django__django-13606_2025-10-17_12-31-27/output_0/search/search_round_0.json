        "content": "To effectively gather the required context for the issue regarding the use of `NOT EXISTS` in place of `NOT IN` for excluding multi-valued relationships, we need to identify the relevant piece of code or method where this logic is implemented. Based on the description, I would start by retrieving information about the method `split_exclude` since it seems to be directly related to the operation described in the issue. Given that it might be part of a larger query manipulation framework, it would also be useful to identify which class this method belongs to, if not specified directly.\n\nLet's begin with the following API calls to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"split_exclude\")`: This will help us find references to the `split_exclude` method in the codebase, which is mentioned as containing the logic that we're aiming to update.\n\n2. `search_code(\"NOT IN (SELECT child.parent_id\")`: By searching for this specific code snippet, we can locate where in the codebase the current subquery logic, which we aim to replace with `NOT EXISTS`, is implemented. This might also lead us directly to files and methods where the problematic logic lives.\n\nThese initial steps should provide a clear starting point for understanding where the described issue is implemented in the codebase and provide a pathway toward crafting an appropriate patch."
