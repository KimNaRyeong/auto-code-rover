        "intended_behavior": "The `split_exclude` method should be refactored to use `WHERE NOT EXISTS` for constructing the exclusion subquery instead of using `NOT IN`. This change aims to enhance the performance by potentially enabling more efficient query execution plans and improving the handling of `NULL` values. The modification should ensure that the exclusion logic remains functionally equivalent, preserving the original intent of filtering out records based on the provided criteria while improving upon the method's implementation details for better database interaction. Specifically, the new implementation should craft a `WHERE NOT EXISTS` subquery that checks for the existence of records meeting the exclusion criteria without running into the pitfalls associated with `NOT IN`, such as suboptimal performance on certain database backends and unintuitive behavior with `NULL` values."
