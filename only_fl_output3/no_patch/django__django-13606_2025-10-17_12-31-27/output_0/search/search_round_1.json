It effectively constructs an SQL query using a `NOT IN` operation against a subquery to exclude certain records based on the filter criteria provided. The method also includes logic to handle `NULL` values correctly in the context of this subquery to avoid unintended behaviors.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The code snippet directly relates to the issue described in the bug report. The method uses the `NOT IN` SQL construct within a subquery to implement exclusions, which, as mentioned in the issue, can be problematic for some database query optimizers to handle efficiently. Moreover, handling of `NULL` values with `NOT IN` can lead to counterintuitive results, hence the recommendation to consider using `WHERE NOT EXISTS` for better performance and more straightforward null handling.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior, in light of the issue, would be to modify the `split_exclude` method to use `WHERE NOT EXISTS` instead of `NOT IN` for constructing the exclusion subquery. This change aims to improve the performance of the generated SQL by making it easier for database optimizers to process the query and by simplifying the handling of `NULL` values in the exclusion logic.\n\nBased on this analysis, there are two immediate courses of action to consider for addressing the issue:\n\n1. **Replace the `NOT IN` operation with `WHERE NOT EXISTS`:** Refactor `split_exclude` to use `WHERE NOT EXISTS` for exclusion subqueries instead of `NOT IN`. This involves altering the SQL generation logic within the method to construct a different type of subquery that achieves the same functional goal but in a more performance-optimized and null-safe manner.\n\n2. **Review related database handling logic:** Given that changing the query construction approach could have wide-ranging effects on how Django's ORM handles these relationships, it might be necessary to review and possibly adjust related database interaction logic to ensure compatibility and maintain overall stability.\n\nBefore making these changes, it would also be beneficial to perform additional searches related to handling exclusions in other parts of Django's ORM to ensure comprehensive coverage and to avoid regressing on existing functionality. This could involve looking into methods that interact with `split_exclude` or similar query construction utilities within Django's codebase."

This change aims to enhance the performance by potentially enabling more efficient query execution plans and improving the handling of `NULL` values. The modification should ensure that the exclusion logic remains functionally equivalent, preserving the original intent of filtering out records based on the provided criteria while improving upon the method's implementation details for better database interaction. Specifically, the new implementation should craft a `WHERE NOT EXISTS` subquery that checks for the existence of records meeting the exclusion criteria without running into the pitfalls associated with `NOT IN`, such as suboptimal performance on certain database backends and unintuitive behavior with `NULL` values."
