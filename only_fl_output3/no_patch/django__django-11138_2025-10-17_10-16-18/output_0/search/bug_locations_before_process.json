        "intended_behavior": "The code that constructs the SQL query for filtering dates in Django models with MySQL as backend needs to correctly account for the time zone specified in the TIME_ZONE setting for the database in DATABASES Django setting, especially when it matches the global TIME_ZONE setting or when USE_TZ is True. When both the application's time zone (global TIME_ZONE) and database's time zone (DATABASES[...]['TIME_ZONE']) are the same, there should be no need for converting time zones in the generated SQL (CONVERT_TZ usage should be conditional based on comparing these time zones). This adjustment would ensure that date and datetime filters in Django correctly leverage the intended time zone without unnecessary conversions, thereby eliminating the observed incorrect behavior. The precise implementation would involve checking the time zone settings for equivalency and skipping the CONVERT_TZ step if they match, ensuring that datetime comparisons in queries are accurately reflecting the input times without incorrect conversions."
