To create a standalone `reproducer.py` Python script that attempts to reproduce the issue with Django's `TIME_ZONE` setting and date lookup behavior on different databases, we'll stick with a similar approach as before but will provide a more generalized version of the previous answer. Since the first approach encountered setup issues related to missing MySQL support (`mysqlclient`), it's important to note that the script will assume a working Django project environment with `mysqlclient` and relevant database drivers installed. For SQLite and Oracle, adjustments according to their respective database configurations and driver requirements may be needed.

This script will not directly connect to a database; instead, it uses Django's ORM setup and models to demonstrate the issue. After defining the model, it will attempt to filter entries based on a datetime field's date part and assert whether the retrieval matches expectations. The script is designed to run in a Django project's root directory where `manage.py` is located.

Ensure you've configured your Django settings appropriately for your database backend (MySQL, SQLite, or Oracle) before running this script.

```python
# reproduducer.py
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
import datetime
from django.utils import timezone

os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'your_project.settings')
django.setup()

class MyModel(models.Model):
    my_datetime_field = models.DateTimeField()

    class Meta:
        app_label = 'your_app_label'  # Replace with your app label

# Function to print stack trace
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_test_data():
    # Make sure to adjust this part to use your actual time zone and model
    settings.TIME_ZONE = 'Europe/Paris'
    timezone.activate(settings.TIME_ZONE)

    dt = timezone.make_aware(datetime.datetime(2017, 7, 6, 20, 50))

    # Ensuring the model and database are in sync
    if not MyModel.objects.filter(my_datetime_field=dt).exists():
        MyModel.objects.create(my_datetime_field=dt)

def test_lookup():
    create_test_data()
    dt = timezone.make_aware(datetime.datetime(2017, 7, 6, 20, 50))
    # This should work based on the setup
    exists_normal = MyModel.objects.filter(my_datetime_field=dt).exists()
    # The problematic part
    exists_date_lookup = MyModel.objects.filter(my_datetime_field__date=dt.date()).exists()

    try:
        assert exists_normal == True, "Datetime exact match should pass."
        assert exists_date_lookup == True, "Date part lookup should pass."
        print("Test Passed: The issue could not be reproduced.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test_lookup()
```

Before running the script, make sure to:
- Replace `'your_project.settings'` with the path to your project's settings module.
- Replace `'your_app_label'` with the actual app label where your model is defined or should be logically associated with.

Keep in mind that the script is designed for demonstration purposes. The actual execution and results might vary based on your database setup, Django configuration, and the version of Django you are using.
