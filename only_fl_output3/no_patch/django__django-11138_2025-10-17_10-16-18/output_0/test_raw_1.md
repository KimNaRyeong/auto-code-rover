Given the constraints and the need to simulate an environment that interacts with a MySQL database, as well as Django setup, it's important to have a proper MySQL connection and the required Python package `mysqlclient` installed. This package is necessary for interfacing with MySQL from Django. However, it seems the earlier error occurred because `mysqlclient` was not installed, leading to a `ModuleNotFoundError`.

To rectify this, you must ensure `mysqlclient` is installed in your environment. This can be done by running `pip install mysqlclient`. Moreover, due to the nature of the described issue focusing on database timezone handling, it's crucial to have a MySQL database accessible with the timezone tables populated.

Considering the feedback, here's a revised version of the script that ensures to check for the database connection and attempts to reproduce the issue as initially described. Unfortunately, without adjusting the script to check for the presence of `mysqlclient` and a valid MySQL setup, we cannot directly address the failure caused by missing dependencies or configuration. Instead, the script assumes these prerequisites are met.

```python
# reproducer.py
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.utils import timezone

# Assuming mysqlclient is installed and a MySQL database is accessible
# Ensure to have the correct database credentials and the MySQL timezone tables populated

    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

        assert MyModel.objects.filter(my_datetime_field__date=dt.date()).exists(), "Date-only match should be found."

    except AssertionError as e:

```

To reiterate, this script assumes:
- The `mysqlclient` Python library is installed in your environment.
- You have access to a MySQL database with credentials specified in the script.
- The timezone tables in MySQL are populated (crucial for timezone conversions).

Please adjust the database credentials (`'NAME'`, `'USER'`, `'PASSWORD'`, `'HOST'`, and `'PORT'`) in the script to match your setup before running.
