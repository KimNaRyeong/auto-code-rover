        "intended_behavior": "The purpose of modifying this method is to include an additional parameter that dictates whether fuzzy translations should be incorporated into the `.mo` files. The `write_mo` method will need to be enhanced to accept a `use_fuzzy_translations` boolean flag. This flag will then be utilized to determine if fuzzy translations are to be written into the `.mo` files. This requires a modification to how the `write_mo` function is called and potentially how the Babel library's `write_mo` function is invoked, given it supports handling fuzzy translations. The existing functionality, which excludes fuzzy translations by default, should be preserved if the `use_fuzzy_translations` flag is not set to `True`, ensuring backward compatibility."
