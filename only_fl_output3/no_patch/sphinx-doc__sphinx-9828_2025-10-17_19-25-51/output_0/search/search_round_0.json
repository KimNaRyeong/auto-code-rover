The original source language is used instead of the translated language. Fuzzy translations are translations that in general need to be reviewed by a translator. For example all machine translations could be marked as fuzzy. It would be desirable to let the user decide whether to include these fuzzy translations in the generated documentation.\nProposed solution\n------------------\nAdd a new configuration parameter \"use_fuzzy_translations\".\nChange in line 72 of the file sphinx/sphinx/util/i18n.py\nwrite_mo(file_mo, po)\nto\nwrite_mo(file_mo, po, use_fuzzy_translations)\nWriting mo files with fuzzy translations is supported by the babel package, as can be seen in the documentation:\nhttp://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/api/messages/mofile.html\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary code context for resolving the issue related to adding support for fuzzy translations in Sphinx, the following search API calls would be appropriate:\n\n1. To check the current implementation of the `write_mo` function mentioned in the issue, as it's a crucial point for the proposed change:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"write_mo\", \"sphinx/util/i18n.py\")`\n\n2. To understand how the configuration parameter `use_fuzzy_translations` will integrate within the codebase, it would be helpful to look into where configurations are typically handled. Since there is no direct indication of how or where configurations are handled in the provided text, a reasonable assumption is to look in the same file for any signs of existing configuration handling to see how a new parameter could be added:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"config\", \"sphinx/util/i18n.py\")`\n\n3. Given that the change involves modifying a line of code around line 72, seeing more context around this line could help with understanding the scope and impact of the proposed change:\n   - `get_code_around_line(\"sphinx/util/i18n.py\", 72, 5)`\n\nThese API calls will give a good starting point to understanding how to implement the requested feature by providing insight into the current method implementation, potential integration with configuration handling, and the context of the targeted modification area."
