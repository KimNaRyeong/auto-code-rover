The original source language is used instead of the translated language. Fuzzy translations are translations that in general need to be reviewed by a translator. For example all machine translations could be marked as fuzzy. It would be desirable to let the user decide whether to include these fuzzy translations in the generated documentation.\nProposed solution\n------------------\nAdd a new configuration parameter \"use_fuzzy_translations\".\nChange in line 72 of the file sphinx/sphinx/util/i18n.py\nwrite_mo(file_mo, po)\nto\nwrite_mo(file_mo, po, use_fuzzy_translations)\nWriting mo files with fuzzy translations is supported by the babel package, as can be seen in the documentation:\nhttp://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/api/messages/mofile.html\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides valuable insights into the current implementation and how it relates to the issue at hand. Here's the breakdown based on the returned results:\n\n### 1. `write_mo` Function in `sphinx/util/i18n.py`\nThe `write_mo` function is clearly pivotal in the process of converting `.po` files into `.mo` files, which are then utilized for localization in the Sphinx documentation tool. From the provided code snippet, we understand that the `write_mo` method is part of a class, likely `CatalogInfo`, and is responsible for reading translations from a `.po` file and attempting to write them to a `.mo` file. This process involves handling and logging of exceptions but does not currently account for the configuration concerning fuzzy translations.\n\n#### Relationship with the Bug\nThe issue stems from this exact part of the code, where translations marked as \"fuzzy\" in the `.po` files are not being used to generate `.mo` files. Instead, the original source language is used. The absence of a mechanism to include or exclude fuzzy translations based on user preference is the core of the problem.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nThe intended behavior, as derived from the issue description, suggests modifying this `write_mo` implementation to accept a new parameter\u2014`use_fuzzy_translations`. This parameter should influence whether fuzzy translations are included in the `.mo` files, leveraging Babel's support for such functionality. This change implies the need for additional logic within the method to handle this option accordingly.\n\n### 2. `config` in `sphinx/util/i18n.py`\nThe search for \"config\" aimed to understand how configuration parameters are managed within the scope of localization in Sphinx. The findings indicate other methods (`get_image_filename_for_language` and `search_image_for_language`) that deal with localization and configuration in some manner, suggesting that there is a precedent for handling configurations in this module.\n\n#### Analysis\nGiven the issue's context, the handling of a new `use_fuzzy_translations` configuration parameter should be in line with how existing configurations are managed within the module. However, the provided snippets do not directly show how new configurations are defined or read within the context of the `write_mo` process.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo address the issue effectively, the following steps are needed:\n\n1. **Define the New Configuration Parameter**: It would be necessary to look into Sphinx's overall configuration management to understand how to introduce a new `use_fuzzy_translations` parameter. This could involve searching the broader codebase for configuration definition patterns or documentation.\n\n2. **Modify `write_mo` Implementation**: Based on the understanding of Babel's support for including fuzzy translations when writing `.mo` files, the `write_mo` method\u2019s implementation needs to be extended to accept a new parameter for deciding on the inclusion of fuzzy translations. The method will need to conditionally apply this preference in the translation handling process.\n\n3. **Integration Testing**: After implementing the new behavior, it's essential to conduct thorough testing to ensure that when `use_fuzzy_translations` is enabled, the `.mo` files indeed include the fuzzy translations, and when disabled, the behavior remains as is currently\u2014excluding them.\n\nGiven this analysis, further steps might include looking into the Sphinx configuration system more broadly if not familiar or reviewing Babel documentation to ensure the new functionality aligns with the capabilities of the underlying libraries Sphinx depends on."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

The `write_mo` method will need to be enhanced to accept a `use_fuzzy_translations` boolean flag. This flag will then be utilized to determine if fuzzy translations are to be written into the `.mo` files. This requires a modification to how the `write_mo` function is called and potentially how the Babel library's `write_mo` function is invoked, given it supports handling fuzzy translations. The existing functionality, which excludes fuzzy translations by default, should be preserved if the `use_fuzzy_translations` flag is not set to `True`, ensuring backward compatibility.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe key modification involves extending the `write_mo` method within the `CatalogInfo` class to support a new `use_fuzzy_translations` parameter that influences the inclusion of fuzzy translations in the generation of `.mo` files from `.po` files. This change will effectively address the issue by providing users the choice to include these translations, improving the flexibility and utility of the Sphinx localization process."
