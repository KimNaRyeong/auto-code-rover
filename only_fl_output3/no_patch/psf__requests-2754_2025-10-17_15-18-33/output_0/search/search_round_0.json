        "content": "<issue>.htaccesss redirect to non ASCII folder does not work\nHello,\nI have the following setup on a shared hoster:\n- Apache 2.2.15\n- A Japanese language .\u307f\u3093\u306a (.minna; xn--q9jyb4c) IDN domain.\n- A blog which is in the subfolder \u30d6\u30ed\u30b0 (blog)\n- A redirect in the .htaccess file like this: `Redirect /index.html /\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0/`\nSo I usually open the domain http://test.\u307f\u3093\u306a and the server redirects to http://test.\u307f\u3093\u306a/\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0. This works fine in Firefox etc.\nWith requests, I get the following error (Python 3.4 with Requests 2.7.0 on a Japanese Ubuntu 15.04):\n```\n'<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN\">\\n<html><head>\\n<title>404 Not Found</title>\\n</head><body>\\n<h1>Not Found</h1>\\n<p>The requested URL /\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x83\u00c2\\x96\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x83\u00c2\\xad\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x82\u00c2\u00b0/ was not found on this server.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<address>Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS) Server at test.xn--q9jyb4c Port 80</address>\\n</body></html>\\n'\n```\nSo I guess the request lib gets a redirect from a server with Japanese characters, but then fails to convert the characters correctly. If I do `requests.get(http://test.\u307f\u3093\u306a/\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0)` directly it works, only the redirect does not.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively and gather the required context, the following search API calls would be beneficial:\n\n1. Since the issue involves a `.htaccess` redirection to a folder with non-ASCII characters, it's essential to understand how the project handles URLs and redirections. However, `.htaccess` files are server configurations and not directly parsed or modified by Python code in most scenarios. Given the issue description, it appears the problem might not be directly with `.htaccess` but with how the Python `requests` library handles redirected URLs with non-ASCII characters. Therefore, no direct search for `.htaccess` handling within the Python project codebase seems necessary.\n\n2. The issue mentions an error occurring when using Python 3.4 with Requests 2.7.0 on a Japanese Ubuntu 15.04 system, indicating that the problem might be related to how the `requests` library is integrated or used within the project. Although modification to the `requests` library itself is unlikely to be within the scope of the project, searching for how this library is utilized could provide insights. Thus:\n   - `search_code(\"requests.get\")`\n   \n3. Given the error involves URL character encoding (\"...gets a redirect from a server with Japanese characters, but then fails to convert the characters correctly...\"), it would be useful to look for any custom URL encoding or handling functionality within the project.\n   - `search_code(\"url encode\")`\n   - `search_code(\"redirect\")`\n\n4. As the report mentions obtaining a 404 error after redirection, it would also be useful to search for any custom error handling or logging to see if there's an area in the code where encoding issues are either logged or mishandled.\n   - `search_code(\"404\")`\n   - `search_code(\"Not Found\")`\n\nThese searches aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how redirects and URL encodings are handled within the project, potentially uncovering the root cause of the issue or identifying where modifications might be needed."
