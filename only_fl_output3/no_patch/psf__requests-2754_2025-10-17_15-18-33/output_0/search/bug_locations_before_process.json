        "intended_behavior": "The method(s) involved in handling redirects need to ensure the correct encoding and decoding of URLs, especially those containing non-ASCII characters. When receiving a redirect response, the method should accurately encode the URL to its proper form before following the redirect. This is crucial for handling internationalized domain names and URLs that contain characters outside the ASCII range. Additionally, this behavior should be consistent across different environments and not lead to errors like 404 Not Found when the redirected URL is valid. The enhancement should be made while ensuring that the original functionality for handling ASCII-based URLs remains unaffected and that redirects are followed according to the HTTP standards and requests library's policies (like max redirects)."

If a redirection occurs, the method should verify and encode the URL's non-ASCII parts, like the path and query strings, ensuring that the request is directed to the correct resource. This behavior must preserve the functionality of being able to handle standard ASCII URLs and maintain compatibility with various web servers and encoding formats."
