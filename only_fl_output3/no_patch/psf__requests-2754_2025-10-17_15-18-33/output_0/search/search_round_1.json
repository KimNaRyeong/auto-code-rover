This works fine in Firefox etc.\nWith requests, I get the following error (Python 3.4 with Requests 2.7.0 on a Japanese Ubuntu 15.04):\n```\n'<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN\">\\n<html><head>\\n<title>404 Not Found</title>\\n</head><body>\\n<h1>Not Found</h1>\\n<p>The requested URL /\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x83\u00c2\\x96\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x83\u00c2\\xad\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x82\u00c2\u00b0/ was not found on this server.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<address>Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS) Server at test.xn--q9jyb4c Port 80</address>\\n</body></html>\\n'\n```\nSo I guess the request lib gets a redirect from a server with Japanese characters, but then fails to convert the characters correctly. If I do `requests.get(http://test.\u307f\u3093\u306a/\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0)` directly it works, only the redirect does not.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively and gather the required context, the following search API calls would be beneficial:\n\n1. Since the issue involves a `.htaccess` redirection to a folder with non-ASCII characters, it's essential to understand how the project handles URLs and redirections. However, `.htaccess` files are server configurations and not directly parsed or modified by Python code in most scenarios. Given the issue description, it appears the problem might not be directly with `.htaccess` but with how the Python `requests` library handles redirected URLs with non-ASCII characters. Therefore, no direct search for `.htaccess` handling within the Python project codebase seems necessary.\n\n2. The issue mentions an error occurring when using Python 3.4 with Requests 2.7.0 on a Japanese Ubuntu 15.04 system, indicating that the problem might be related to how the `requests` library is integrated or used within the project. Although modification to the `requests` library itself is unlikely to be within the scope of the project, searching for how this library is utilized could provide insights. Thus:\n   - `search_code(\"requests.get\")`\n   \n3. Given the error involves URL character encoding (\"...gets a redirect from a server with Japanese characters, but then fails to convert the characters correctly...\"), it would be useful to look for any custom URL encoding or handling functionality within the project.\n   - `search_code(\"url encode\")`\n   - `search_code(\"redirect\")`\n\n4. As the report mentions obtaining a 404 error after redirection, it would also be useful to search for any custom error handling or logging to see if there's an area in the code where encoding issues are either logged or mishandled.\n   - `search_code(\"404\")`\n   - `search_code(\"Not Found\")`\n\nThese searches aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how redirects and URL encodings are handled within the project, potentially uncovering the root cause of the issue or identifying where modifications might be needed."

        "content": "Let's analyze the collected context based on the results from the search API calls.\n\n### Analysis of `requests.get`\n\nThe snippet found in `requests/__init__.py` demonstrates the basic usage of the `requests.get` function for making a GET request to a specified URL. It shows how to import the `requests` module, make a request to 'https://www.python.org', and then access the response's status code and content.\n\n**Relationship to the bug**: This code snippet provides a basic understanding of using the `requests` library for making HTTP requests. The issue described involves the `requests` library failing to handle a redirect to a URL containing non-ASCII characters correctly, resulting in a 404 error. This snippet does not directly relate to the bug but establishes the context of how `requests.get` is used.\n\n**Intended behavior**: Ideally, when `requests.get` encounters a HTTP redirect, it should seamlessly follow the redirect and fetch the content from the new URL, even if the URL contains non-ASCII characters.\n\n### Analysis of `url encode` search result\n\nNo results were found for \"url encode,\" which suggests that the project might not contain explicit URL encoding handling or such code might not be tagged or commented with \"url encode.\"\n\n### Analysis of `redirect`\n\nThe search for \"redirect\" yielded 190 snippets across various files, most notably within `requests/sessions.py`, `requests/api.py`, and `requests/adapters.py`, among others. These files likely contain logic related to handling HTTP redirects.\n\n**Relationship to the bug**: The bug involves an issue with redirection; thus, the code within these files is highly relevant. The handling of redirects, especially with respect to encoding or decoding of URLs during the process, is central to resolving the issue. \n\n**Intended behavior**: The code responsible for handling redirects should correctly interpret, encode, or decode URLs containing non-ASCII characters to ensure users are correctly redirected to the intended destination without resulting in a 404 error.\n\n### Analysis of `404`\n\nThe search for \"404\" yielded results in several files, but the context in which \"404\" appears (like in `requests/status_codes.py` or character frequency files under `requests/packages/chardet/`) is probably not directly related to handling or generating 404 errors due to incorrect URL handling.\n\n### Analysis of `Not Found`\n\nThe snippet containing \"Not Found\" in `requests/models.py` relates to the textual reason for an HTTP status code. Here, it indicates that part of the response object includes a property for storing the reason for a status code like 404.\n\n**Relationship to the bug**: While this snippet does not directly address the bug, it highlights the structure of response objects in the `requests` library, which could be relevant when diagnosing or logging errors related to failed requests.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the issue and initial context analysis, next steps could include:\n- Exploring how `requests` handles redirects (`search_code_in_file(\"redirect\", \"requests/sessions.py\")`), focusing on encoding of the URL during the redirect process.\n- Examining error handling to understand how the library responds to and logs failed requests, specifically those resulting in a 404 status (`get_code_around_line(\"requests/models.py\", 581, 10)`).\n\nThese analyses aim to uncover how redirects are processed and how errors like a 404 from a redirected URL containing non-ASCII characters are handled and logged, which are both essential for addressing the original issue described."

Given the nature of the issue and the information we have so far, here are the bug location and the intended behavior suggestions:\n\n**Bug Location 1**: File: `requests/sessions.py`, Class: `Session`, Method: potentially methods involved in handling redirects like `resolve_redirects`. \n\n- **Intended Behavior**: The method(s) involved in handling redirects need to ensure the correct encoding and decoding of URLs, especially those containing non-ASCII characters. When receiving a redirect response, the method should accurately encode the URL to its proper form before following the redirect. This is crucial for handling internationalized domain names and URLs that contain characters outside the ASCII range. Additionally, this behavior should be consistent across different environments and not lead to errors like 404 Not Found when the redirected URL is valid. The enhancement should be made while ensuring that the original functionality for handling ASCII-based URLs remains unaffected and that redirects are followed according to the HTTP standards and `requests` library's policies (like max redirects).\n\n**Bug Location 2**: File: `requests/adapters.py`, Class and Method: Specific classes and methods that handle sending the request and processing the response. \n\n- **Intended Behavior**: This component should be capable of correctly encoding the redirected URL, ensuring that any non-ASCII characters are appropriately handled per the specifications of the URI and IRI standards, before the request is sent. If a redirection occurs, the method should verify and encode the URL's non-ASCII parts, like the path and query strings, ensuring that the request is directed to the correct resource. This behavior must preserve the functionality of being able to handle standard ASCII URLs and maintain compatibility with various web servers and encoding formats.\n\nThe identified locations for the bug are based on the parts of the code that are most likely to interact with the process described in the issue: handling HTTP redirects and ensuring the correct processing of URLs containing non-ASCII characters. The intended behavior aims at a solution that not only resolves the specific issue at hand but also maintains the broad usability and functionality of the `requests` library."
