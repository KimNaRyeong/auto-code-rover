Specifically, ensure that when creating a `BlackItem`, it is done in a way that either doesn't pass `path` argument where it's not expected or correctly uses the new mechanisms provided by Pytest for handling filesystem paths. This might involve updating the method to use `from_parent` correctly according to the latest Pytest guidelines for plugin development."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to the `pytest-black` plugin, update the `pytest_collect_file` method or equivalent in the `pytest-checkdocs` plugin to align with the current Pytest practices for item or collector node creation. The update should specifically address the correct handling of the `path` argument to avoid unexpected keyword argument errors. This includes ensuring compatibility with how Pytest expects plugins to create or register test items and collectors, potentially by fixing or enhancing the `from_parent` usage."
