        "intended_behavior": "The `eigenvals` method should include additional logic or checks to better handle complex symbolic expressions when computing eigenvalues, especially for cases that involve exponential functions or other expressions that the current implementation struggles with. This may involve enhancing the method to pre-process or simplify the matrix in a way that is more amenable to root finding without losing symbolic integrity or directly improving the interaction with `roots` to ensure it can handle the characteristic polynomial of symbolic matrices more reliably. The method should continue to work for numeric matrices without regressions."

        "method": "roots",
        "intended_behavior": "The `roots` method should be enhanced to improve its capability to find roots of characteristic polynomials derived from symbolic matrices, including those with expressions like `exp(x)`. This enhancement might involve incorporating more sophisticated algorithms for symbolic computation or improving the method's handling of various classes of polynomial expressions. The objective would be to ensure that `roots` can reliably return the full set of eigenvalues for a broader variety of symbolic matrices. This method should preserve its current functionality for existing use cases while extending its capabilities to cover the identified gap in handling complex symbolic expressions."
