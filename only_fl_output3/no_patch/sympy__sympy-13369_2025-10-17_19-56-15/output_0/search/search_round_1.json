The implementation of the `eigenvals` method to understand how it attempts to compute eigenvalues and why it might fail for a symbolic 3x3 matrix.\n2. The `roots` method used within `eigenvals` to see if the issue stems from how symbolic polynomial roots are identified or computed.\n3. The `charpoly` method, which is critical to both `eigenvals` and the direct approach using `solve` on the determinant of `(lam*eye(3) - M)` to identify if there is any known limitation or bug.\n4.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results provides insights into how the issue at hand could be resolved or better understood:\n\n### 1. Eigenvals Method (sympy/matrices/matrices.py)\n- **What it does:** The `eigenvals` method computes the eigenvalues of a matrix using the Berkowitz algorithm to derive the characteristic polynomial and then obtaining its roots.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The reported issue arises within this method because it fails to compute the eigenvalues for the provided symbolic matrix. The method attempts to simplify floats to rationals before computing roots, which suggests it may have trouble handling certain symbolic expressions or does not fully support all symbolic computations.\n- **Intended behavior:** The method should be able to find eigenvalues for both numeric and symbolic matrices efficiently. For symbolic matrices, particularly those involving complex expressions like `exp(x)`, it should offer reliable computation without having to rely on simplification or conversion to rational numbers unless absolutely necessary.\n\n### 2. Roots Method (sympy/polys/polyroots.py)\n- **What it does:** This method is responsible for finding the roots of polynomials. It is a key component in calculating the eigenvalues in `eigenvals` by finding the roots of the characteristic polynomial.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** Since `eigenvals` relies on `roots` to compute eigenvalues and it returns an empty set (`{}`) for the provided symbolic matrix, the bug might be stemming from this method's inability to handle the characteristic polynomial derived from the symbolic matrix, particularly when it includes e^x or other non-polynomial expressions.\n- **Intended behavior:** `roots` should ideally handle a wide range of polynomial expressions, including those with symbolic coefficients. It might need improvements or adjustments to better support complex symbolic expressions or ensure that the characteristic polynomial is presented in a form it can process.\n\n### 3. Charpoly Method (sympy/matrices/matrices.py)\n- **What it does:** Computes the characteristic polynomial of a matrix, which is critical for both the direct computation of eigenvalues using `solve` on the determinant and the computation performed by `eigenvals`.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** This method appears to work as intended, since the issue description indicates that using `solve` with the characteristic polynomial directly returns the correct eigenvalues. The issue might not lie with `charpoly` itself but with how the resulting polynomial is handled by `roots`.\n- **Intended behavior:** `charpoly` should output a polynomial that accurately represents the determinant of `(lambda*I - M)`, suitable for further analysis or root finding. Its correct functioning is crucial for any eigenvalue computation strategy.\n\n### 4. Solve Method (sympy/solvers/solvers.py)\n- **What it does:** A method for solving equations, capable of returning solutions for a variety of symbolic equations including polynomials.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** `solve` successfully computes the eigenvalues when directly applied to the characteristic polynomial, unlike `eigenvals`. This suggests that `solve` might be more robust or versatile in handling symbolic or complex expressions compared to the approach used within `eigenvals`.\n- **Intended behavior:** `solve` should provide accurate solutions for equations, including those derived from symbolic matrices' characteristic polynomials. Its successful application hints at alternative approaches or improvements that could be applied to `eigenvals` or `roots` to address the issue.\n\nGiven this analysis, the root cause of the issue seems to lie in the interaction between `eigenvals` (and indirectly `roots`) with the characteristic polynomial of symbolic matrices. The potential solution could involve enhancing the `roots` method to better support complex symbolic polynomials or adjusting the preprocessing in `eigenvals` to work around limitations in `roots`. Further exploration could focus on understanding the limitations of `roots` with symbolic expressions and investigating how `solve` manages these cases successfully."

This may involve enhancing the method to pre-process or simplify the matrix in a way that is more amenable to root finding without losing symbolic integrity or directly improving the interaction with `roots` to ensure it can handle the characteristic polynomial of symbolic matrices more reliably. The method should continue to work for numeric matrices without regressions. \n\n- **Bug Location 2:** File: sympy/polys/polyroots.py, Method: roots\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The `roots` method should be enhanced to improve its capability to find roots of characteristic polynomials derived from symbolic matrices, including those with expressions like `exp(x)`. This enhancement might involve incorporating more sophisticated algorithms for symbolic computation or improving the method's handling of various classes of polynomial expressions. The objective would be to ensure that `roots` can reliably return the full set of eigenvalues for a broader variety of symbolic matrices. This method should preserve its current functionality for existing use cases while extending its capabilities to cover the identified gap in handling complex symbolic expressions."
