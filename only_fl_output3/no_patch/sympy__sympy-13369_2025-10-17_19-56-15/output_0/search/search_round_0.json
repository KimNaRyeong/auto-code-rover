        "content": "To address the issue, we should first gather more context on the relevant parts of the project. Based on the problem description, we should look into several key areas:\n\n1. The implementation of the `eigenvals` method to understand how it attempts to compute eigenvalues and why it might fail for a symbolic 3x3 matrix.\n2. The `roots` method used within `eigenvals` to see if the issue stems from how symbolic polynomial roots are identified or computed.\n3. The `charpoly` method, which is critical to both `eigenvals` and the direct approach using `solve` on the determinant of `(lam*eye(3) - M)` to identify if there is any known limitation or bug.\n4. The implementation of `solve` when applied to the determinant of a symbolic matrix since this approach successfully returns the desired eigenvalues, providing a comparison point.\n\nGiven these areas of interest, the following API calls would be useful:\n\n- `search_method(\"eigenvals\")`: This will help us find where the `eigenvals` method is defined and how it's implemented.\n- `search_method(\"roots\")`: Since the issue indicates a failure in computing eigenvalues through polynomial roots, understanding its implementation could reveal limitations or bugs.\n- `search_method(\"charpoly\")`: To understand how the characteristic polynomial is computed, as it is successfully used with `solve` but fails with `roots`.\n- `search_method(\"solve\")`: Although `solve` is not directly part of the issue, seeing its usage or implementation details could provide insights into why it's able to handle the symbolic matrix when `eigenvals` cannot.\n\nThese searches should provide a broad context of how eigenvalue computation is approached within the project and highlight any discrepancies or limitations in the current implementation."
