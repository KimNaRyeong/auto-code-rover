Certainly! Based on your request, here's how you can create a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue you've mentioned. The script will attempt to compute the eigenvalues of a 3x3 symbolic matrix using SymPy's `.eigenvals()` method. If this attempt raises an exception (indicative of the issue being present), the script will print a detailed stack trace of the error and exit with code 0, as instructed. 

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import symbols, Matrix, exp, eye, det, solve

    # Define symbols
    x, lam = symbols('x lambda')
    # Define matrix M
    M = Matrix([[x, 0, 1], [x, 0, 2], [exp(x), 1, 0]])
    try:
        # Attempt to compute eigenvalues
        eigenvalues = M.eigenvals()
        # If an exception is not raised, check the result
        if not eigenvalues:
            raise AssertionError("Eigenvals method failed to return any eigenvalues.")
        print("Eigenvalues computed successfully. No issue found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # If an error is caught, it indicates the presence of the issue.
        raise AssertionError("Failed to compute eigenvalues with .eigenvals() method. Issue present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 if an error indicative of the issue is encountered
    # If no errors are encountered, it indicates that the issue has been resolved or does not exist.
    print("Script execution completed. No issues detected.")
    exit(0)
```

Ensure to place this script in the root directory of your project and run it with Python 3. If the issue is present, the script will catch it and print a detailed stack trace of the error, followed by exiting with code 0 as requested.
