        "intended_behavior": "Implement `__str__` and/or `__repr__` methods within the `Partition` class. These methods should override the current behavior inherited from `FiniteSet` to format the output in a more user-friendly manner. Instead of printing `Partition(FiniteSet(...))`, the method should simplify the representation to resemble native Python data structures like lists or sets (e.g., `Partition({1,2})` or `Partition([1,2])`). This method should dynamically respect the input format (whether the input was a list or a set) and preserve all existing functionalities including any set operations or combinatorial logic."
