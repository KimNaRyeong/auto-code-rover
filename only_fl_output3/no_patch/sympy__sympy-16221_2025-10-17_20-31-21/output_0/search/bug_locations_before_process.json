        "intended_behavior": "The `Printer` class should be enhanced to support the formatting and printing of matrices and arrays, specifically for Mathematica outputs. This enhancement could involve adding a new method or modifying an existing one (e.g., `_print` method if it exists) to detect and process Mathematica matrix and array structures. Identify when an expression represents a matrix or array. Utilize or extend Mathematica's notation for matrices and arrays to ensure they are printed in a recognizable and usable format within Mathematica. Preserve existing functionality for other types of expressions or data structures, ensuring that the introduction of matrix and array support does not interfere with the current capabilities of the `Printer` class."
