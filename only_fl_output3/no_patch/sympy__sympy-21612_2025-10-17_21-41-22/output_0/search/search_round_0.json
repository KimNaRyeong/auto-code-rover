Given the nature of the problem, it involves the `parse_latex` function which likely resides within a specific class dedicated to latex parsing in the Sympy library. \n\nBased on the problem description, the steps to follow include locating the `parse_latex` function, identifying the class it belongs to, and examining how fractions are parsed to rectify the missing brackets issue in the denominator.\n\nHere are the search API calls we can use to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. Search for the `parse_latex` function throughout the codebase to identify its location and the class it is associated with.\n2. Once the class containing `parse_latex` is identified, examine the code where fractions are handled to understand the logic applied for parsing and identify where the issue of missing brackets may arise.\n\nTo execute this plan, the first step involves the following API call:\n\n- `search_method(\"parse_latex\")`\n\nThis call is aimed at locating the `parse_latex` function within the codebase. Based on the outcome of this search, further calls may be necessary to investigate the class definition and the specific method or code block handling fraction parsing."
