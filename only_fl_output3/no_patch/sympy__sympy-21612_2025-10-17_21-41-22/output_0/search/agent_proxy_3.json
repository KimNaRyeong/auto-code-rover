To fully understand and approach the resolution of the issue with nested fraction parsing, it's evident that more context around the handling of additive relations and fractions specifically is necessary. Given that the conversion process starts with `convert_add` and potentially involves more detailed fraction handling mechanisms, the following search API call is required to uncover these underlying details:\n   - `search_method(\"convert_add\")`\n\nThis additional information is crucial for understanding how the conversion process treats fractions, particularly nested ones, which is central to the reported issue."
