Given your requirements and the scenario where the environment must be correctly set up to proceed without facing import issues related to `antlr4`, here's the standalone Python file `reproducer.py` rewritten in accordance with the instructions, including the appropriate function for printing detailed stack traces upon encountering errors.

This script explicitly attempts to reproduce the issue where a specific LaTeX expression is incorrectly parsed, leading to an assertion error when the actual parsed result does not match the expected one. If any exception is caught during this process, it prints a detailed traceback.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    from sympy import symbols
    from sympy.parsing.latex import parse_latex
    
    a, b, c = symbols('a b c')
    
    # LaTeX expression that when parsed, results in an incorrect structure due to missing brackets.
    latex_expression = "\\frac{\\frac{a^3+b}{c}}{\\frac{1}{c^2}}"
    
    # Parsing the LaTeX expression using SymPy
    parsed_expression = parse_latex(latex_expression)
    # Simplify the expression to ensure it matches the expected result.
    simplified_expression = parsed_expression.simplify()

    # Define the expected expression for comparison (correctly parsed and structured)
    expected_expression = ((a**3 + b)/c)/(1/c**2)
    
    # Assertion to verify if the parsed and simplified expression matches the expected result.
    assert simplified_expression == expected_expression, "Parsed expression does not match the expected output."
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exits with status code 1 if the AssertionError is raised, indicating the issue is present.
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # General error handling for any other exception.
else:
    print("Issue is fixed, exiting with code 0.")
    exit(0)  # Exits with status code 0 if no issues are found, indicating the problem has been resolved.
```

This revised script aims at addressing the task of checking whether the issue with LaTeX expression parsing and the structure of the produced mathematical expression in SymPy is as expected. It uses symbol definitions and an explicit comparison of the parsed expression against an expected result constructed through SymPy's own symbolic algebra capabilities.
