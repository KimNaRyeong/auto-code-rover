Given the previous attempt did not directly address the issue because the required package (`antlr4`) was not installed, and as your request suggests creating a standalone script without taking dependencies into account, I'll adjust the answer. However, it's crucial to understand that for the script to work, all necessary dependencies, including `antlr4`, should be properly installed. The script below includes comments on how to check for the presence of the `antlr4` package, though these checks will be commented out to keep the script focused on reproducing the parsing issue.

For accuracy, this revised script will follow your instructions and aim to reproduce the specific LaTeX parsing issue, assuming that all dependencies are installed. If you need to handle exceptions related to missing packages like `antlr4`, it's recommended to manage those dependencies through your project's setup or documentation.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    from sympy.parsing.latex import parse_latex
    
    # If necessary, verify antlr4 is installed. Uncomment the lines below to perform the check.
    # try:
    #     import antlr4
    # except ModuleNotFoundError as e:
    #     print("antlr4 package is missing. Please install it to proceed.")
    #     raise e
    
    parsed_expression = parse_latex("\\frac{\\frac{a^3+b}{c}}{\\frac{1}{c^2}}")
    # Convert the expression to a string format and adjust powers for direct comparison
    parsed_expression_str = str(parsed_expression).replace('**', '^')
    expected_expression = "((a^3 + b)/c)/(1/(c^2))"
    
    # Assertion to check if the parsed expression matches the expected expression
    assert parsed_expression_str == expected_expression, "Parsed expression does not match the expected output."
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exit with status code 1 indicating the issue is present.
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # General error handling.
else:
    print("Issue is fixed, exiting with code 0.")
    exit(0)
```

This script attempts to parse the given LaTeX string and compares the string representation of the parsed result with the expected result. The use of `str.replace` is to adjust the expression format for a fair comparison. Note that for the script to run correctly and reproduce the issue as initially reported, all dependencies, including `antlr4`, must be present in your environment.
