However, some third-party tools wrap the value in double quotation marks when wrapping HTTP requests (such as the filename of the file uploaded by PostmanCanary). This results in double quotes for the filename at the end of Django parsing.\nPostman request body:\n----------------------------677822685948106391633425\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"\u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\"; filename*=\"UTF-8''%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95.txt\"\nContent-Type: text/plain\ntest\n----------------------------677822685948106391633425--\ndjango got filename is \u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\" not \u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\nThis is not a bug of Django. But I suggest Django do some compatibility processing.\nCPython is also compatible with this situation.\n\u200bhttps://hg.python.org/cpython/file/default/Lib/test/test_email/test_headerregistry.py\n\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/12485\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue of supporting double quotes in `MultiPartParser` in Django, we should focus on getting information about the relevant parts of Django's codebase. Here are the API calls I'm planning to make, based on key elements mentioned in the issue:\n\n1. Locate the `MultiPartParser` class to see how it's currently implemented. Since the issue is directly related to this class, understanding its structure and methods is essential.\n   \n   `search_class(\"MultiPartParser\")`\n\n2. Find where `MultiPartParser` is parsing the filename from the content disposition header, as this is likely the spot requiring a patch. This could be part of a method within `MultiPartParser`.\n   \n   `search_method_in_class(\"parse\", \"MultiPartParser\")`\n\n3. Given the mention of compatibility handling similar to what CPython does in relation to double quotes in headers, it would be useful to inspect the mentioned CPython tests for reference. While we cannot directly call APIs into external projects like CPython, we can infer from the issue description that looking into Django's analogous test cases and parsing logic could provide insights on aligning Django's handling with CPython's approach.\n   \n   `search_code(\"Content-Disposition:\")`\n\n4. The pull request URL (`https://github.com/django/django/pull/12485`) is mentioned, which indicates there might have been attempts or discussions to address this issue or related ones. While I can't fetch content from GitHub via these API calls, identifying existing or similar changes around filename parsing in Django's repository can provide context. So, I will look for modifications or discussions around the handling of filename attributes in multi-part requests.\n   \n   `search_code(\"filename*=\")`\n\nBy executing these API calls, the goal is to collect the necessary code context around how `MultiPartParser` parses filenames and how it might currently mishandle filenames enclosed in double quotes, as well as identifying any existing approaches or discussions that have aimed to address similar issues."
