However, some third-party tools wrap the value in double quotation marks when wrapping HTTP requests (such as the filename of the file uploaded by PostmanCanary). This results in double quotes for the filename at the end of Django parsing.\nPostman request body:\n----------------------------677822685948106391633425\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"\u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\"; filename*=\"UTF-8''%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95.txt\"\nContent-Type: text/plain\ntest\n----------------------------677822685948106391633425--\ndjango got filename is \u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\" not \u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\nThis is not a bug of Django.

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue of supporting double quotes in `MultiPartParser` in Django, we should focus on getting information about the relevant parts of Django's codebase. Here are the API calls I'm planning to make, based on key elements mentioned in the issue:\n\n1. Locate the `MultiPartParser` class to see how it's currently implemented. Since the issue is directly related to this class, understanding its structure and methods is essential.\n   \n   `search_class(\"MultiPartParser\")`\n\n2. Find where `MultiPartParser` is parsing the filename from the content disposition header, as this is likely the spot requiring a patch. This could be part of a method within `MultiPartParser`.\n   \n   `search_method_in_class(\"parse\", \"MultiPartParser\")`\n\n3. Given the mention of compatibility handling similar to what CPython does in relation to double quotes in headers, it would be useful to inspect the mentioned CPython tests for reference. While we cannot directly call APIs into external projects like CPython, we can infer from the issue description that looking into Django's analogous test cases and parsing logic could provide insights on aligning Django's handling with CPython's approach.\n   \n   `search_code(\"Content-Disposition:\")`\n\n4. The pull request URL (`https://github.com/django/django/pull/12485`) is mentioned, which indicates there might have been attempts or discussions to address this issue or related ones. While I can't fetch content from GitHub via these API calls, identifying existing or similar changes around filename parsing in Django's repository can provide context. So, I will look for modifications or discussions around the handling of filename attributes in multi-part requests.\n   \n   `search_code(\"filename*=\")`\n\nBy executing these API calls, the goal is to collect the necessary code context around how `MultiPartParser` parses filenames and how it might currently mishandle filenames enclosed in double quotes, as well as identifying any existing approaches or discussions that have aimed to address similar issues."

Let's break down the information obtained from each search result:\n\n### django/http/multipartparser.py (`MultiPartParser` class and `parse` method)\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `MultiPartParser.parse` method is responsible for parsing POST data from a request into a `FILES` `MultiValueDict` and a `POST` `MultiValueDict`. It handles multipart/form-data parsing, which includes processing uploaded files and form fields. The method specifically identifies content-disposition headers to extract `field_name` and `file_name`, performs encoding adjustments, handles max upload limits, and delegates file handling to appropriate upload handlers.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue described pertains to the handling of filenames that come wrapped in double quotes, particularly when these filenames are encoded (such as `filename=\"\u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\"`). The parsing logic, as outlined around lines 209-214, extracts the filename from the content-disposition header but does not account for filenames enclosed in double quotes which are not being stripped correctly, leading Django to retain the trailing quote in the filename (`\u6d4b\u8bd5.txt\"`).\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Ideally, the parser should intelligently handle filenames enclosed in double quotes, removing these quotes after decoding the filename. This would ensure compatibility with clients that send quoted filenames and align with the behavior observed in other parts of Django and possibly referenced CPython handling.\n\n\n### django/http/response.py (`FileResponse.set_headers` method)\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - It constructs a `Content-Disposition` header, combining disposition type (e.g., in-line or attachment) with the filename. It handles both ASCII and non-ASCII filenames, using RFC 5987 encoding for non-ASCII filenames (`filename*=utf-8''...`).\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Although this code snippet deals with handling filenames for outgoing responses rather than parsing incoming filenames, it demonstrates Django's approach to encoding and specifying filenames in headers, respecting standard practices for ASCII and non-ASCII filenames. It suggests a familiarity within Django's codebase with the nuances of filename handling in HTTP headers.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - While not directly related to parsing incoming filenames, practices here could inform enhancements to `MultiPartParser` by ensuring sensitive handling of filename characters, including quotes.\n\n\n### django/http/multipartparser.py (`parse_header` function)\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - It contains logic for parsing headers with potential encoding specifications, as indicated by a name ending in `*` (e.g., `filename*=`), which follows the conventions for encoding extended parameters in headers.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - This snippet shows Django's existing awareness and handling of RFC 2231's encoding mechanism for parameters like `filename*=`. The mechanism Django uses here for parsing and decoding could be analogous to the desired handling for quoted filenames, indicating that the framework already employs sophisticated parsing techniques that might be extended or adapted to address the issue.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would include recognition and proper handling of double quotes around parameter values, ensuring that such quotes are not considered part of the filename. This could require enhancing the parsing logic to strip surrounding double quotes when detected around filename parameters.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems evident that the key to addressing the issue lies within enhancing the `MultiPartParser.parse` logic, specifically around lines 209-214, to ensure correct stripping of double quotes from filenames. Additionally, leveraging understanding from both the `set_headers` method in `response.py` and `parse_header` function could provide valuable insights into consistent and standard-compliant handling of filenames in headers."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

The existing functionality of handling filenames, including encoded and unencoded names, should be preserved. This adjustment ensures that filenames wrapped in double quotes by clients (as observed with some third-party tools like PostmanCanary) are correctly processed, removing the trailing quote that may currently be retained. The enhancement should maintain compatibility with RFC standards for Content-Disposition headers, aligning with Django's commitment to standards compliance and interoperability."
