        "method": "parse",
        "intended_behavior": "Within the `parse` method, specifically where it processes the `file_name` (around lines 209-214), the code should be enhanced to detect and strip double quotes surrounding the filename extracted from the `Content-Disposition` header. The existing functionality of handling filenames, including encoded and unencoded names, should be preserved. This adjustment ensures that filenames wrapped in double quotes by clients (as observed with some third-party tools like PostmanCanary) are correctly processed, removing the trailing quote that may currently be retained. The enhancement should maintain compatibility with RFC standards for Content-Disposition headers, aligning with Django's commitment to standards compliance and interoperability."
