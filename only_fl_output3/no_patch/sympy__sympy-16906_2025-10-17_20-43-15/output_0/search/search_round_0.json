        "content": "To get sufficient context to address the issue described, we should focus on finding how `OneMatrix` is currently implemented, especially in relation to its printing methods across different formats mentioned (str, pretty, and MathML presentation printing). Also, it's important to understand how `ZeroMatrix` and `Identity` matrices printing has been improved with Unicode double struck characters. Since `OneMatrix` is likely a class, and based on the issue, modifications in printing functions are needed, we would first search for the `OneMatrix` class, and then investigate the specific printing methods. Additionally, examining the `ZeroMatrix` and `Identity` classes might provide insights into implementing similar improvements for `OneMatrix`. Therefore, I will perform the following API calls:\n\n1. search_class(\"OneMatrix\")\n2. search_class(\"ZeroMatrix\")\n3. search_class(\"Identity\")\n4. search_method_in_class(\"str\", \"OneMatrix\")\n5. search_method_in_class(\"_print_Str\", \"OneMatrix\")\n6. search_method_in_class(\"pretty\", \"OneMatrix\")\n7. search_method_in_class(\"_print_Pretty\", \"OneMatrix\")\n8. search_method_in_class(\"mathml\", \"OneMatrix\")\n9. search_method_in_class(\"_print_MathML\", \"OneMatrix\")"
