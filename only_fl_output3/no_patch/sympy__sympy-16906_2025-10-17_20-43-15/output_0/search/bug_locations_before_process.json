        "intended_behavior": "Implement the methods for `str`, pretty, and MathML presentation printing. These methods will enable the `OneMatrix` class to be printed in a way that is consistent with the improvements made to the `ZeroMatrix` and `Identity` classes. Specifically, the `str` method should return a string representation of a `OneMatrix` instance, the pretty printing method should use unicode double struck characters, and the MathML presentation method should generate valid MathML for `OneMatrix` instances. This ensures that `OneMatrix` instances can be visually represented in text, pretty, and MathML formats correctly, improving code readability and usability in documentation or UIs presenting mathematical expressions."
