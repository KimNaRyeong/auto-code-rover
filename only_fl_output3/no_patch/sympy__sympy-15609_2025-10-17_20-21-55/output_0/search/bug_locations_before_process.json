The specific fix here should address the issue of double subscripts by perhaps introducing an intermediate representation or formatting step for subscript expressions to ensure they are unique and do not violate LaTeX syntax rules. The method must preserve the accuracy of mathematical expressions while ensuring the generated LaTeX code is compilable."

        "intended_behavior": "Given that the issue involves a summation representation (\\sum) as part of the matrix product indexing, this method should correctly handle the generation of summation symbols along with their indices in LaTeX format. The _print_Sum method needs to ensure that indices and their bounds are formatted so that they do not result in syntax errors like double subscripts. It may require adjusting how indexed variables are named or displayed in the summation context. The goal is to maintain mathematical integrity and notational clarity while providing LaTeX that renders correctly in all supported environments."
