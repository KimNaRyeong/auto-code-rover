Given the requirement to accurately reproduce and confirm the issue as described, the following `reproducer.py` file aims to ensure that the scenario where the double subscript issue arises is not just detected but also intelligibly handled, reflecting on the specified error condition for accurate verification. Please see the revision below:

```python
from sympy import symbols, MatrixSymbol, latex
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_latex_compilable():
    i, j, k = symbols("i j k")
    M = MatrixSymbol("M", k, k)
    N = MatrixSymbol("N", k, k)
    latex_str = latex((M*N)[i, j])

    # The issue was inaccurately checked in the previous script.
    # The correct condition to raise an AssertionError based on the described scenario:
    expected_issue_part = "_{_"
    if expected_issue_part in latex_str:
        raise AssertionError("Detected double subscript in LaTeX string, which is not compilable. Latex output: " + latex_str)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        check_latex_compilable()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exiting with non-zero to indicate failure
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Catching any other unexpected issue
    print("No issue detected, exiting with code 0.")
    sys.exit(0)
```

This corrected version of `reproducer.py` specifically looks for the pattern `_{{_` in the LaTeX output, which signals the existence of a double subscript error as described. When this specific pattern is present, the script throws an `AssertionError`, reflects it with a stack trace for clarity on where and why the check failed, and exits with a status code of `1` to indicate failure. Conversely, if the pattern is not found, indicating the absence of the reported issue, it will exit with a `0` status code, signaling success.
