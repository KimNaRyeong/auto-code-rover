We can replace this duplication with wider community developed version.\nhtml.escape() has been available since Python 3.2:\n\u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#html.escape\nThis function is also faster than Django's. As Python bug \u200bhttps://bugs.python.org/issue18020 concludes, using .replace() can be faster than .translate(). This function gets called numerous times when rendering templates. After making the change locally, I saw the following improvement:\nmaster:\n$ python -m timeit -s 'from django.utils.html import escape' 'escape(copyright)'\n50000 loops, best of 5: 4.03 usec per loop\nbranch:\n$ python -m timeit -s 'from django.utils.html import escape' 'escape(copyright)'\n100000 loops, best of 5: 2.45 usec per loop\nOne small concern, html.escape() converts ' to &#x27 rather than &#39. These values are functionally equivalent HTML, but I'll mention it as a backwards incompatible change as the literal text has changed\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given the search results, let's analyze the collected context and consider our next steps.\n\n### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n**1. Implementation of `django.utils.html.escape()`**\n\nThe found method `escape` within `django/utils/html.py` is defined as follows:\n\n```python\n@keep_lazy(str, SafeString)\ndef escape(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return the given text with ampersands, quotes and angle brackets encoded\n    for use in HTML.\n\n    Always escape input, even if it's already escaped and marked as such.\n    This may result in double-escaping. If this is a concern, use\n    conditional_escape() instead.\n    \"\"\"\n    return mark_safe(str(text).translate(_html_escapes))\n```\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \nThis function encodes given text for safe use in HTML by escaping ampersands, quotes, and angle brackets. It ensures the input is escaped regardless of its previous state, explicitly allowing for double-escaping as a feature, not a bug. It uses Python's `translate()` method for this, with presumably a predefined mapping of characters to escape sequences in `_html_escapes`.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**  \nThe issue calls for optimizing this function by replacing its body with the `html.escape()` from the standard library, which has been noted to be more efficient. There's a particular emphasis on performance improvement.\n\n- **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**  \nPost-modification, the function should continue to safely escape special HTML characters from the input text, but it will delegate the task to `html.escape()` rather than handling it internally with `.translate()`. The intended behavior in terms of output remains largely the same, with a side note on the conversion of `'` to `&#x27;` instead of `&#39;`, which is a minor discrepancy but noted as a potentially backwards incompatible change due to the different escaped output for a single quote.\n\n### Next Steps and Additional Context\n\nSince the direct search for usages of `django.utils.html.escape()` within the codebase didn't yield results, it's possible that the specific usage search was too narrow or the function is indirectly invoked in ways not captured by the query. Here are a couple of strategies to widen the exploratory net:\n\n1. **Search for indirect usages via template rendering or form processing mechanisms**, which are common areas where such an escape function would be critical. This would involve more generic searches for HTML escaping in these areas without directly naming the function.\n\n2. **Examine related utilities for HTML handling** to see if there are wrappers or related functions that call `escape()`, which might not have been captured due to dynamic invocation or through template tags.\n\nGiven the current context:\n\n- **Proposal for Next API Calls**:\n    1. Since we have the exact file location and understand the implementation of the `escape` function, further searching within the same file for related functions like `conditional_escape()` could be useful. This might offer insight into its interaction with `escape()` and any dependencies.\n        - `search_method_in_file(\"conditional_escape\", \"django/utils/html.py\")`\n    2. Look into the implementation or references of `mark_safe` to understand how the output of `escape` is further processed.\n        - `search_code(\"mark_safe\")`\n\nThese steps will help ensure that changing the implementation to use `html.escape()` will not disrupt Django's HTML handling ecosystem."

The intended behavior should continue to safely escape special HTML characters (`&, <, >, '`) for use in HTML content. While switching to `html.escape()`, it must be noted that the ASCII code for the apostrophe will change from `&#39;` to `&#x27;`. This change is technically backwards incompatible due to the difference in the escaped character sequence for an apostrophe, but functionally, it should not affect the rendered HTML since both references are valid and recognized as an escaped apostrophe in HTML. The update must ensure that any text passed to `escape` is processed through `html.escape()` and then marked safe using `mark_safe`, preserving the function's contract to return safely escapable text for HTML rendering. The performance improvement noted in the issue description should also be validated with similar or related benchmarks after the modification.  \n\nNo additional methods are deemed buggy, nor are there suggestions to add new methods based on the current understanding of the issue and the gathered context. The emphasis is on refactoring the existing `escape` method to achieve improved efficiency and maintainability by leveraging standard library functionalities."
