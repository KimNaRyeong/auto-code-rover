        "intended_behavior": "The `escape` function needs to be modified to utilize `html.escape()` from the Python standard library instead of its current implementation which uses the `str.translate()` method with `_html_escapes`. The intended behavior should continue to safely escape special HTML characters (`&, <, >, '`) for use in HTML content. While switching to `html.escape()`, it must be noted that the ASCII code for the apostrophe will change from `&#39;` to `&#x27;`. This change is technically backwards incompatible due to the difference in the escaped character sequence for an apostrophe, but functionally, it should not affect the rendered HTML since both references are valid and recognized as an escaped apostrophe in HTML. The update must ensure that any text passed to `escape` is processed through `html.escape()` and then marked safe using `mark_safe`, preserving the function's contract to return safely escapable text for HTML rendering. The performance improvement noted in the issue description should also be validated with similar or related benchmarks after the modification."
