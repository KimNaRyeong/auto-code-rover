We can replace this duplication with wider community developed version.\nhtml.escape() has been available since Python 3.2:\n\u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#html.escape\nThis function is also faster than Django's. As Python bug \u200bhttps://bugs.python.org/issue18020 concludes, using .replace() can be faster than .translate(). This function gets called numerous times when rendering templates. After making the change locally, I saw the following improvement:\nmaster:\n$ python -m timeit -s 'from django.utils.html import escape' 'escape(copyright)'\n50000 loops, best of 5: 4.03 usec per loop\nbranch:\n$ python -m timeit -s 'from django.utils.html import escape' 'escape(copyright)'\n100000 loops, best of 5: 2.45 usec per loop\nOne small concern, html.escape() converts ' to &#x27 rather than &#39. These values are functionally equivalent HTML, but I'll mention it as a backwards incompatible change as the literal text has changed\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about the implementation of `django.utils.html.escape()`. The goal is to find where this function is defined, understand its current implementation, and identify any potential usages or dependencies that might be affected by changing its implementation to use the Python standard library's `html.escape()`. Based on the information provided in the issue, the following API calls will help us achieve this:\n\n1. **Find the implementation of `django.utils.html.escape()`**: Since this function is a part of Django, and we know its module path, we can start by searching for this specific method to understand its current implementation.\n    - `search_method(\"escape\")`\n\n2. **Search for the file containing `django.utils.html.escape()`**: Knowing the exact file can be helpful for direct modification and reviewing any comments or specific implementations around that method.\n    - `search_code(\"def escape(\")`\n\n3. **Review the usage of `django.utils.html.escape()` throughout the Django project**: This will help us identify any specific parts of Django that rely heavily on this method, which may need careful consideration when making changes.\n    - `search_code(\"django.utils.html.escape(\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive overview of where and how `django.utils.html.escape()` is implemented and used. Understanding these aspects will be crucial for proposing a migration to `html.escape()` while ensuring compatibility and performance improvements throughout Django."
