        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue with the display of `SeqFormula()` in Jupyter notebooks, we need information related to the rendering and representation of sequence formulas in the Sympy library. Specifically, we should look into how `SeqFormula()` objects are converted to string or other formats for display purposes, including how brackets are handled. Based on the issue description, our focus is on finding out how the square brackets are escaped during rendering and how this can be adjusted.\n\nGiven this, here are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. **Search for the `SeqFormula` class**: This will help us find where the class is defined in the Sympy library. Given that `SeqFormula` is at the heart of the issue, understanding its implementation and associated methods for output rendering is crucial.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_class(\"SeqFormula\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the method(s) involved in rendering `SeqFormula`**: Since the issue involves how `SeqFormula` objects are converted to strings or representations for display, it's pertinent to find methods that might handle this. Likely candidates are methods related to string representation and LaTeX representation, as Jupyter notebooks use LaTeX for rendering mathematical expressions.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"__str__\", \"SeqFormula\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"__repr__\", \"SeqFormula\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"_latex\", \"SeqFormula\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for code related to rendering sequences**: Even if the methods in `SeqFormula` do not directly handle the formatting issue, there might be utility functions or rendering methods in the Sympy codebase dedicated to formatting sequence formulas for display. This could involve escaping characters or formatting sequences.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_code(\"SeqFormula\")\n   search_code(\"latex\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches are designed to give a comprehensive view of where and how the `SeqFormula` is handled for rendering purposes within the Sympy library, especially relating to Jupyter notebook outputs. This should provide enough context to understand the problem and guide potential fixes."
