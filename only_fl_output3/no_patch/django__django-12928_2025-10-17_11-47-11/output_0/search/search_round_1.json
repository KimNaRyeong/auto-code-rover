It turns out it's possible with just a few changes.\nBecause it's not really possible to configure the cached template loader I did have to base this patch on the fix for #25788. Enabling autoreloading for the cached template loader would work like this:\nTEMPLATES = [{\n'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',\n'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],\n'APP_DIRS': True\n'OPTIONS': {\n'cache_templates': True,\n'autoreload': DEBUG\n}\n}]\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, we have key insights into the project's configuration and handling of templates, especially in the context of the Django framework.\n\n### Analysis of `DjangoTemplates` Class\n\n#### django/template/backends/django.py\n- This file contains the `DjangoTemplates` class, which inherits from `BaseEngine`. It defines methods that are critical to template handling in Django, including initialization, fetching a template by name, and compiling templates from strings.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: This class is crucial for our issue, as any modifications to support autoreload behavior for cached templates likely involve changes in how templates are loaded or cached within this backend.\n- **Intended behavior**: Given the issue description, modifications here should enable the template backend to support conditional caching based on the `autoreload` setting, in addition to its existing functionalities.\n\n#### django/forms/renderers.py\n- This class also named `DjangoTemplates`, combines form rendering capabilities with the Django template engine.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: While related to template rendering, this particular usage is more specific to forms and might not be directly involved in the general template loading and caching mechanism targeted by the issue.\n- **Intended behavior**: Most likely, this file and class require no changes for implementing the described feature since the issue focuses on template loading and caching rather than form rendering.\n\n### Analysis of `TEMPLATES = []` in django/conf/global_settings.py\n- This code snippet shows the default `TEMPLATES` configuration as an empty list in Django's global settings.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: This setting is where users can define configurations for template engines, including options for caching and, potentially, autoreload. The issue implies extending this configuration to support autoreload functionality specifically for cached templates.\n- **Intended behavior**: To address the issue, we might consider ways to extend these settings or ensure that the Django template backend respects a new 'autoreload' option when set.\n\n### Cached Template Loader Not Found\n- The fact that a direct search for \"cached template loader\" did not yield results suggests that the cached template loader might be referred to differently within the codebase or that it's part of Django's default template loaders not explicitly modified in this project.\n- **Next steps**: To gather more context, we should search for where Django's default template caching mechanism is implemented or configured. This could involve searching for template cache settings or Django's default loaders to understand how they are extended or modified.\n\n### Additional API Calls to Make\nGiven the findings and remaining questions, the following API calls could provide further valuable context:\n\n1. **Search for Django's template caching mechanism by name or functionality**: Since \"cached template loader\" did not return results, searching for related terms can help. This could involve looking for \"template cache\" or \"loader\" configurations.\n   \n2. **Search for how template loaders are configured**, especially focusing on caching and potential points where autoreload functionality could be integrated or is already present but not documented.\n\n   `search_code(\"loaders\")`\n\n3. **Review Django's caching mechanism for templates specifically**, if such a term is explicitly named in the Django documentation or community discussions about template loading.\n\nBy gathering more context through these avenues, we will be better positioned to propose a solution for enabling autoreload with cached template loaders."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

If `autoreload` is `True`, the class should ensure templates are reloaded on change without needing to restart the server. This might involve checking template modification times before serving a cached version, or integrating with Django's existing autoreload mechanism, ensuring caching does not interfere with development changes. The existing functionality for template loading and rendering must be preserved, with the caching feature augmenting rather than replacing current capabilities.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File**: django/conf/global_settings.py\n  - **Description**: Although not exactly a \"bug\" per se, this file indicates where template settings are initially defined. Given the issue, there may need to be a documentation update or default settings adjustment to reflect the potential use of 'autoreload' within 'OPTIONS' for a template's settings.\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Ensure the documentation or template settings comments reflect the ability to configure 'autoreload' for cached templates. This may not involve changing the code per se but ensuring that developers are aware of how to use the new feature within their `TEMPLATES` setting."
