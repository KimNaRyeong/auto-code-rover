If `autoreload` is `True`, the class should ensure templates are reloaded on change without needing to restart the server. This might involve checking template modification times before serving a cached version, or integrating with Django's existing autoreload mechanism, ensuring caching does not interfere with development changes. The existing functionality for template loading and rendering must be preserved, with the caching feature augmenting rather than replacing current capabilities."
