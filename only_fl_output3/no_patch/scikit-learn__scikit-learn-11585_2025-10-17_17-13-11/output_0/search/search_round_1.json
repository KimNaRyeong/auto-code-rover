        "content": "<issue>SparsePCA incorrectly scales results in .transform()\n#### Description\nWhen using `SparsePCA`, the `transform()` method incorrectly scales the results based on the *number of rows* in the data matrix passed.\n#### Proposed Fix\nI am regrettably unable to do a pull request from where I sit. The issue is with this chunk of code, as of writing this at [line number 179 in sparse_pca.py](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/decomposition/sparse_pca.py#L179):\n```python\nU = ridge_regression(self.components_.T, X.T, ridge_alpha,\nsolver='cholesky')\ns = np.sqrt((U ** 2).sum(axis=0))\ns[s == 0] = 1\nU /= s\nreturn U\n```\nI honestly do not understand the details of the chosen implementation of SparsePCA. Depending on the objectives of the class, making use of the features as significant for unseen examples requires one of two modifications. Either (a) **learn** the scale factor `s` from the training data (i.e., make it an instance attribute like `.scale_factor_`), or (b) use `.mean(axis=0)` instead of `.sum(axis=0)` to remove the number-of-examples dependency.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```python\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import SparsePCA\nimport numpy as np\ndef get_data( count, seed ):\nnp.random.seed(seed)\ncol1 = np.random.random(count)\ncol2 = np.random.random(count)\ndata = np.hstack([ a[:,np.newaxis] for a in [\ncol1 + .01*np.random.random(count),\n-col1 + .01*np.random.random(count),\n2*col1 + col2 + .01*np.random.random(count),\ncol2 + .01*np.random.random(count),\n]])\nreturn data\ntrain = get_data(1000,1)\nspca = SparsePCA(max_iter=20)\nresults_train = spca.fit_transform( train )\ntest = get_data(10,1)\nresults_test = spca.transform( test )\nprint( \"Training statistics:\" )\nprint( \"  mean: %12.3f\" % results_train.mean() )\nprint( \"   max: %12.3f\" % results_train.max() )\nprint( \"   min: %12.3f\" % results_train.min() )\nprint( \"Testing statistics:\" )\nprint( \"  mean: %12.3f\" % results_test.mean() )\nprint( \"   max: %12.3f\" % results_test.max() )\nprint( \"   min: %12.3f\" % results_test.min() )\n```\nOutput:\n```\nTraining statistics:\nmean:       -0.009\nmax:        0.067\nmin:       -0.080\nTesting statistics:\nmean:       -0.107\nmax:        0.260\nmin:       -0.607\n```\n#### Expected Results\nThe test results min/max values are on the same scale as the training results.\n#### Actual Results\nThe test results min/max values are much larger than the training results, because fewer examples were used. It is trivial to repeat this process with various sizes of training and testing data to see the relationship.\n</issue>"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides the following insights regarding the `SparsePCA` class, its `transform` method, and the bug:\n\n### 1. SparsePCA Class Structure\nThe `SparsePCA` class inherits from `BaseEstimator` and `TransformerMixin`, suggesting it's designed to fit into the scikit-learn transformer framework. It is initialized with parameters that control the decomposition behavior, such as the number of components (`n_components`), regularization parameters (`alpha`, `ridge_alpha`), and algorithmic details (`max_iter`, `tol`, `method`). This structure indicates that `SparsePCA` is intended to perform dimensionality reduction on data while promoting sparsity in the computed components.\n\n### 2. transform Method\nThe `transform` method projects input data (`X`) onto the sparse components identified by `SparsePCA`. This transformation involves a least squares projection, potentially regularized by ridge regression (depending on the `ridge_alpha` parameter). The method's documentation notes that \"Sparse PCA components orthogonality is not enforced as in PCA,\" which necessitates a different approach to transformation, not merely a linear projection. This characteristic must be considered when addressing the scaling issue raised in the bug report.\n\n### 3. Relationship with the Bug\nThe segment of code around line 179, specifically between lines 181 and 185, computes the transformation. It uses ridge regression to project the data on the components, calculates a scaling factor `s` from the norm of these projections, and normalizes the projections by this scaling factor. The issue arises here: the calculation of `s` uses the sum of squared projections across components (`(U ** 2).sum(axis=0)`), which inherently scales with the number of samples. This behavior could lead to the observed discrepancy between training and testing data projections, as the scaling factor `s` becomes dependent on the dataset size.\n\n### 4. Intended Behavior\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior of the `transform` method should ensure that the scale of the projected data (`U`) does not depend on the number of input samples. Instead, it should maintain consistent scaling across different dataset sizes, making the projection scale-invariant to the input sample size. This consistency is crucial for ensuring that the transformed data behaves similarly in both training and testing scenarios, regardless of the dataset size.\n\n### Possible Solution\nTo address the issue, one could implement either of the proposed fixes:\n- **Learn the scale factor `s` from the training data** and store it as an instance attribute (e.g., `.scale_factor_`). This scale factor would then be applied to all subsequent transformations, ensuring consistency across different dataset sizes.\n- **Adjust the computation of `s`** to remove dependency on the number of samples. Using `.mean(axis=0)` instead of `.sum(axis=0)` when calculating `s` could achieve this, as the mean is inherently size-invariant.\n\nThe choice between these solutions depends on the desired behavior of `SparsePCA` and its alignment with the theoretical foundations of sparse PCA. The first approach seems more robust, as it captures scale information during training and consistently applies it, mirroring the typical use case of a fit/transform workflow in scikit-learn."

This could be achieved by either learning a scale factor from the training data or adjusting the calculation of the scale factor `s` to remove its dependency on the sample size.\n     - If the strategy is to learn the scale factor from the training data, a new instance attribute (e.g., `.scale_factor_`) should be introduced. This scale factor will be calculated during the fit process based on the training data and then applied during the transform process to both training and new unseen data, ensuring the scaling of components is consistent across different dataset sizes.\n     - Alternatively, if the strategy is to adjust the calculation of `s`, the code at line 183 in `sparse_pca.py` should be modified to calculate `s` using `.mean(axis=0)` instead of `.sum(axis=0)`. This change will make the scale calculation independent of the number of samples, thus aligning the transformed data's scale across varying sizes of input datasets.\n     - It's essential to preserve the existing functionality outside of the changes necessary to address the scaling issue, ensuring that `SparsePCA` continues to perform as expected for its primary tasks."
