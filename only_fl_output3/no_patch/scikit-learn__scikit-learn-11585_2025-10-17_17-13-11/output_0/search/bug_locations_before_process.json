        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the 'transform' method of the 'SparsePCA' class needs to ensure that the transformation of data is invariant to the number of samples in the dataset. This could be achieved by either learning a scale factor from the training data or adjusting the calculation of the scale factor 's' to remove its dependency on the sample size. If the strategy is to learn the scale factor from the training data, a new instance attribute (e.g., '.scale_factor_') should be introduced. This scale factor will be calculated during the fit process based on the training data and then applied during the transform process to both training and new unseen data, ensuring the scaling of components is consistent across different dataset sizes. Alternatively, if the strategy is to adjust the calculation of 's', the code at line 183 in 'sparse_pca.py' should be modified to calculate 's' using '.mean(axis=0)' instead of '.sum(axis=0)'. This change will make the scale calculation independent of the number of samples, thus aligning the transformed data's scale across varying sizes of input datasets. It's essential to preserve the existing functionality outside of the changes necessary to address the scaling issue, ensuring that 'SparsePCA' continues to perform as expected for its primary tasks."
