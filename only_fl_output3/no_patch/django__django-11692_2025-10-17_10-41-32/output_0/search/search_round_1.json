        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. Absence of `Document` Class\n\nThe search for the `Document` class returned no results. This suggests that either `Document` is dynamically defined or imported in such a way that it wasn't directly identified by the search API. It might also imply that `Document` is part of a third-party package or application not directly searchable with the provided APIs.\n\n**Next Steps:** Given we can't directly find the `Document` class, understanding its design or structure from the codebase isn't straightforward. However, we know it's likely a model given the context of the issue, which involves QuerySets and operations like `filter`. Without direct access, we'll focus on the components we can analyze - `Subquery`, `OuterRef`, and their usage within Django's ORM system.\n\n#### 2. `Subquery` and `OuterRef` Usage\n\nThe search results for `Subquery` and `OuterRef` highlight their significant presence in Django's ORM layer, including in `models`, `forms`, and the SQL compilation process. \n\n- **Subquery** and **OuterRef** are both found primarily within the expressions and SQL query formation parts of Django (`django/db/models/expressions.py`, `django/db/models/sql/query.py`), indicating they're fundamental to complex query constructions. Thus, these components likely play a critical role in enabling subqueries or references to outer query elements, which is at the heart of the reported issue.\n\n**Intended Behavior:** They are intended to enable queries that reference an outer query for nested subqueries. The issue suggests that when using `OuterRef` within a `Subquery` combined with `union` or `|`, Django throws an error, possibly due to how `union` or `|` operations are handled or constructed in the context of subqueries.\n\n#### 3. `.union()` Usage and The `|` Operator\n\nThe `union` operation is meant to combine the results of two or more queries into a single QuerySet, often used for set operations in SQL.\n\n- The presence of `.union(` in core query and migration files (`django/db/models/sql/query.py`, `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`) suggests its importance in query processing and auto-migration capabilities.\n\nThe `|` operator is generally used for bitwise operations but can be overloaded in Django for OR operations in QuerySets.\n\n- Its widespread usage across various parts of Django, including ORM and forms, indicates it's a versatile operator, possibly part of custom lookup or filtering operations beyond simple bitwise logic.\n\n**Relationship to Bug:** The issue arises when these operations (`union` or `|`) involve `Subquery` or `OuterRef`, suggesting that the internal handling of these compositions may not account for references to outer queries properly. This could point towards a limitation or bug in the abstraction layer that combines QuerySets or translates these operations into SQL.\n\n#### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nGiven the results and our analysis:\n\n- We should dive deeper into specific files where `Subquery` and `OuterRef` are extensively used, especially within `django/db/models/expressions.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, to understand their mechanics in detail.\n- It's also essential to review Django's documentation or source comments around these areas for any clues on intended behaviors or limitations with `union` and `|` operations.\n- Since direct manipulation or bug fixes in Django's core might be required, contributions upstream or workarounds within the app's code (that respects Django's ORMs limitations) would be the next steps.\n\nTo progress, I recommend making targeted API calls to analyze the specific usage and handling of `Subquery` and `OuterRef` within files like `django/db/models/expressions.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, paying special attention to any logic involving `union` or `|` operators. This can provide insights into why the issue is occurring and guide potential solutions."

The intended behavior should allow `union` to recognize and preserve outer references when combining queries, instead of raising an error. This requires ensuring that the SQL generated by the union operation is correctly formed when `Subquery` expressions involving `OuterRef` are used, potentially by tracking outer references and ensuring they're correctly represented in the final SQL.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/db/models/expressions.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** In the implementation of `Subquery` and possibly other related expressions, there should be clear handling or documentation of how these expressions can be used with `union` and `OR` (`|`) operations. If there's a limitation within the Django ORM that prevents the direct use of `OuterRef` in conjunction with `union`, then a workaround or clear guidelines should be provided. For example, enhancing the `Subquery` expression to internally handle or adapt to `union` directives in a way that the outer references do not lose their context or lead to SQL generation errors.\n\nThese locations and intended behaviors aim to address the inability to use `OuterRef` within `union` and the `|` operator in subqueries by ensuring that Django's ORM system can intelligently handle these complex query constructs. The resolution must preserve the existing functionality of the code, allowing for advanced query operations without introducing breaking changes to the ORM's behavior."
