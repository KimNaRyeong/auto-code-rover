        "content": "Given the description of the issue, it's clear that we need more context around how `OuterRef` and `Subquery` are used, particularly in conjunction with `union` or `|` (OR) operator within a QuerySet in Django. Specifically, we're dealing with operations on the `Document` model.\n\nHere are the API calls needed to gather sufficient context:\n\n1. Search for the `Document` class in the codebase to understand its structure and any custom methods that might relate to this issue. Since `Document` seems central to the issue, understanding its design will be crucial.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"Document\")\n   ```\n\n2. Given the issue description involves specific operations (`union` and `|`) on QuerySets of the `Document` model, we need to gather context on how these are generally handled in the project. It's also mentioned that applying an `order_by` clause throws an error, which suggests that the handling of QuerySets might have custom implementations or overrides in place. To find relevant implementations or usages of `Subquery` and `OuterRef`, especially where they are being used in a similar context (with `union` or `|`), the following search is necessary:\n   ```\n   search_code(\"Subquery\")\n   search_code(\"OuterRef\")\n   ```\n\n3. To get a broader context on how the union or OR operations are used within QuerySets across the project (not just in relation to `Document`), we'll search for code snippets that use either `union` or the `|` operator within QuerySets. This can give insight into whether there's a project-wide pattern or practice that either conflicts with or could influence the resolution of the issue at hand.\n   ```\n   search_code(\".union(\")\n   search_code(\" | \")\n   ```\n\nThese searches aim to provide a comprehensive view of the issue's context, focusing on the `Document` model's architecture, the use of `Subquery` and `OuterRef`, and the implementation of QuerySet operations (`union` and `|`). Understanding these elements is critical to proposing a solution."
