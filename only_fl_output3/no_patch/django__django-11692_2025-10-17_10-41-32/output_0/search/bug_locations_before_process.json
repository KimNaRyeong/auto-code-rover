The intended behavior should allow `union` to recognize and preserve outer references when combining queries, instead of raising an error. This requires ensuring that the SQL generated by the union operation is correctly formed when `Subquery` expressions involving `OuterRef` are used, potentially by tracking outer references and ensuring they're correctly represented in the final SQL."

If there's a limitation within the Django ORM that prevents the direct use of `OuterRef` in conjunction with `union`, then a workaround or clear guidelines should be provided. For example, enhancing the `Subquery` expression to internally handle or adapt to `union` directives in a way that the outer references do not lose their context or lead to SQL generation errors."
