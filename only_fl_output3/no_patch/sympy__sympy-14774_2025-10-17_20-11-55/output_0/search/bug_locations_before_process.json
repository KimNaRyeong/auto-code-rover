This change will ensure that when `inv_trig_style=\"full\"` is set by the user, all inverse trigonometric functions, including `acsc` and `asec`, are correctly prefixed with \"arc\" in their LaTeX representation. This update will preserve the existing functionality of rendering inverse trigonometric functions in LaTeX while extending full support for `acsc` and `asec`."
