What does this part of the code do?\n\n- **_print_Function method (around line 743 in `sympy/printing/latex.py`):** This section of the code deals with printing functions in the LaTeX format. It includes a mechanism to handle inverse trigonometric functions and styles setting (`inv_trig_style`) which controls how these functions are printed (`abbreviated`, `full`, or `power`). The `inv_trig_table` defines a list of inverse trigonometric functions that the printer recognizes for special formatting.\n\n- **latex function (definition found):** The `latex` function is the main interface that users interact with to convert SymPy expressions into LaTeX code. This function entails customization settings like `inv_trig_style`, which indicates how inverse trigonometric functions should be rendered in the LaTeX output. The customization settings passed to `latex` are eventually utilized by specific printer methods like `_print_Function`.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue stems from the `inv_trig_table` (Line 743) within the `_print_Function` method not including the `acsc` and `asec` functions. Consequently, when printing these functions with `inv_trig_style=\"full\"`, the expected behavior (prefixing the function name with \"arc\") does not occur because the functions aren't recognized as part of the `inv_trig_table`. This relationship highlights that the bug is directly related to the composition of `inv_trig_table` affecting how inverse trigonometric functions are rendered based on the `inv_trig_style` setting.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior would be for *all* inverse trigonometric functions, including `acsc` and `asec`, to be recognized and formatted according to the `inv_trig_style` setting. When the style is set to `full`, the function names should be prefixed with \"arc\", thus translating `acsc(x)` and `asec(x)` into `\\arccsc{x}` and `\\arcsec{x}`, respectively, in the LaTeX output. This behavior requires the `inv_trig_table` array to include all inverse trigonometric functions that SymPy supports, ensuring they are correctly handled by the `_print_Function` method.\n\nThe issue description outlines a straightforward patch to the problem: expanding the `inv_trig_table` list to include `acsc` and `asec`. This patch would bring the `_print_Function` method's handling of inverse trigonometric functions into alignment with the intended behavior as described, resolving the reported issue by ensuring that all such functions are formatted correctly in LaTeX output when `inv_trig_style=\"full\"` is specified."

This change will ensure that when `inv_trig_style=\"full\"` is set by the user, all inverse trigonometric functions, including `acsc` and `asec`, are correctly prefixed with \"arc\" in their LaTeX representation.
