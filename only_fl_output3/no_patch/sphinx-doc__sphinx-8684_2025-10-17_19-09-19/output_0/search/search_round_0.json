        "content": "To address the issue related to extending `:dedent:` for `code-block` and `literalinclude`, I need to collect relevant code snippets and method definitions. The feature request seems to pertain to a documentation or text processing tool, potentially sphinx or a similar tool that uses reStructuredText (rst). Given this context, I'll need to look for classes or methods related to parsing or rendering these directives (`code-block` and `literalinclude`). Since `dedent` is a concept borrowed from Python's `textwrap.dedent`, it's likely we're dealing with text processing functionalities. \n\nHere are my API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"dedent\")` - To find all instances of `dedent` method implementations, which could be directly modified or extended for this feature.\n\n2. `search_code(\":dedent:\")` - This will help locate where the `:dedent:` option is parsed or applied within code blocks or included literal files, giving context on where the changes need to be implemented.\n\n3. `search_code(\"code-block\")` - To find how `code-block` directives are handled.\n\n4. `search_code(\"literalinclude\")` - Similarly, to understand how `literalinclude` directives are processed.\n\nThese calls should help identify the relevant parts of the codebase where enhancements can be made to support the requested feature."
