Given this context, I'll need to look for classes or methods related to parsing or rendering these directives (`code-block` and `literalinclude`).

        "content": "Given the results from the API calls, let's analyze the collected context:\n\n### Analysis of the Results:\n\n1. **No direct findings for `dedent` method or `:dedent:` in the code**: \n   - This implies that the current implementation does not explicitly handle `:dedent:` as an identifiable feature or that it is possibly managed under different terminology within the code base. The absence of a direct match requires a closer look at where and how block-level operations, especially related to indentation, are conducted.\n\n2. **Code Blocks (`code-block`) in various files**:\n   - The presence of `code-block` in multiple components (`application.py`, `config.py`, `transforms`, `writers`, `domains`, `ext`, and more) suggests its wide usage across the project for handling code snippets in documentation.\n   - **Relationship to the issue**: Since the issue proposes extending `dedent` functionality for `code-block` and `literalinclude`, any component involved in parsing, rendering, or configuring these blocks could be relevant for implementing the suggested feature.\n   - **Intended behavior**: Ideally, these parts of the code should be adapted or extended to recognize and apply a \"full dedent\" operation when no explicit `:dedent:` value is provided, similar to Python's `textwrap.dedent` functionality.\n\n3. **LiteralInclude directive in `sphinx/directives/code.py`**:\n   - This file appears to be a central place where directives related to code, including `literalinclude`, are registered and possibly handled.\n   - **Relationship to the issue**: Given that `literalinclude` is specifically mentioned in the issue, its handling in `code.py` would be directly relevant to implementing the requested dedent functionality.\n   - **Intended behavior**: Modifications are likely needed here to ensure `literalinclude` directives can optionally dedent included code to the least indented line, mirroring the enhancement requested for `code-block`.\n\n### Conclusions:\n\n- The issue seems to suggest a functionality enhancement where block directives (`code-block` and `literalinclude`) automatically dedent their content to match the least indented line when no explicit dedentation level is specified by the user, akin to Python's `textwrap.dedent`.\n- Based on the search results, `sphinx/directives/code.py` is a crucial file for addressing the issue as it directly involves the registration and likely manipulation of these directives.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nGiven these insights, a more focused exploration is needed around how `literalinclude` (and implicitly `code-block`) directives process their content. More concrete steps would include:\n\n1. **Examining `sphinx/directives/code.py`**:\n   - To understand how the `LiteralInclude` and `CodeBlock` directives currently process content and where dedentation logic could be integrated.\n\n2. **Exploring how directives are configured**:\n   - Especially looking into `sphinx/config.py` and `sphinx/application.py`, to see if any configurations or settings could influence indentation handling.\n\n### Additional API Calls to Make:\n\n1. `search_class_in_file(\"LiteralInclude\", \"sphinx/directives/code.py\")` - To find the class definition and methods of `LiteralInclude` for closer examination.\n\n2. `search_class_in_file(\"CodeBlock\", \"sphinx/directives/code.py\")` - Similarly, to understand the handling of `CodeBlock` directives.\n\nThese steps will provide a more detailed understanding of how these directives handle content, laying the groundwork for developing a feature that aligns with the issue's proposal."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

The existing functionality to explicitly specify dedentation levels via the `:dedent:` option should be preserved.\n\n- **Location 2**: \n  - **File**: `sphinx/directives/code.py`\n  - **Class**: `CodeBlock`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Similar to `LiteralInclude`, the `CodeBlock` class must be extended to support automatic dedentation to the least indented line in the absence of a specified dedent level. This enhancement should not interfere with the current abilities to handle explicit `:dedent:` options or other directive configurations.\n\n**Justification and Approach**:\n\nGiven the issue's description, it's clear that the intended enhancement, aligning with Python's `textwrap.dedent` behavior, is to adjust the handling of indentation within `code-block` and `literalinclude` directives. \n\nThe rationale for choosing these classes (`LiteralInclude` and `CodeBlock`) within `sphinx/directives/code.py` is based on their direct association with the processing of respective directives. Assuming these classes handle the rendering and processing of content blocks, extending their functionality to include a default dedent behavior (whereby content is dedented to match the least indented line by default) would address the issue. \n\nThis approach maintains backward compatibility by ensuring that when a dedent level is explicitly specified, it takes precedence over the default behavior, thereby preserving existing functionality within these components."
