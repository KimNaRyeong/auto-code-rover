        "intended_behavior": "The `ExpressionWrapper` class should ensure that the `output_field` for combined expressions is preserved through all operations, specifically when the expressions involve different types of fields. This behavior must maintain existing functionality while also providing a way to correctly infer or set the `output_field` for complex expressions. Potentially, enhancing the `__init__` or introducing a new method to better handle or verify `output_field` in cases of combined expressions could rectify the regression. This includes the implementation of a robust mechanism for inferring the appropriate `output_field` based on the types of the fields involved in the expression if it is not explicitly provided."

If there is indeed a flaw in how these methods are handling expressions wrapped in `ExpressionWrapper`, particularly when it comes to recognizing and applying the `output_field`, fixing this would involve ensuring that the compiler accurately respects and utilizes the `output_field` information provided by such expressions, thus preventing the `FieldError` seen. This includes correctly handling complex expressions where fields of differing types are combined, ensuring they do not lose their explicit `output_field` specification through the query construction process."
