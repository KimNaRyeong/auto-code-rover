        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue regarding `ExpressionWrapper` losing `output_field` for combined expressions without an `output_field`, we need to explore related classes, methods, and code paths. Here are the specific API calls that would be useful:\n\n1. Explore the `ExpressionWrapper` class to understand its structure and any recent changes that may have affected its behavior:\n   - `search_class(\"ExpressionWrapper\")`\n\n2. Investigate how `ExpressionWrapper` resolves its `output_field`, particularly how it handles combined expressions and determines the `output_field` when it's not explicitly provided:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"output_field\", \"ExpressionWrapper\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"_resolve_output_field\", \"ExpressionWrapper\")`\n\n3. Since the issue mentions a regression when upgrading from Django 3.0.8 to Django 3.2, it might be beneficial to look into the `ExpressionWrapper`'s usage and behavior specifically within query compilation and execution:\n   - `search_method(\"as_sql\")`\n   - `search_class(\"FieldError\")`\n   - `search_method(\"select_format\")`\n\n4. The traceback mentions several key parts of Django's ORM where the problem manifests. Reviewing these could provide insight into how expressions are processed, especially changes between Django versions:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"pre_sql_setup\", \"django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\")`\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"get_group_by\", \"django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\")`\n   - `search_code(\"select_format\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to reveal how `ExpressionWrapper` interacts with Django's ORM, particularly in constructing queries with combined expressions. The insights from these calls should help in identifying the cause of the issue and formulating a potential patch."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results provides several insights into the operation of Django's query system, expressions framework, and potential location of the bug described in the issue. \n\n1. **ExpressionWrapper in expressions.py**: \n\n   - **What it does**: `ExpressionWrapper` serves as a wrapper for expressions, allowing you to specify the output field explicitly. It's a subclass of `Expression` and participates in Django\u2019s QuerySet operations to apply transformations or annotations to query results. The methods listed within the class like `__init__`, `as_sql`, and `get_group_by_cols` indicate its role in initializing, converting to SQL, and determining Group By columns for SQL queries. \n   \n   - **Relationship with the bug**: The issue describes a case where `ExpressionWrapper` loses its `output_field` when used with combined expressions. This information suggests we need to delve into how `ExpressionWrapper` handles `output_field` during SQL construction, especially in complex scenarios like division operations or when combined with aggregate functions.\n   \n   - **Intended behavior**: Ideally, `ExpressionWrapper` should preserve the `output_field` through all operations, ensuring the correct SQL type is generated for the result of the expression, regardless of its complexity or the use of combined expressions.\n\n2. **Absence of `output_field` and `_resolve_output_field` methods in `ExpressionWrapper`**:\n\n   - This absence indicates that these functionalities are either inherited without modification from a parent class or are dynamically resolved, possibly through the framework's field inference mechanisms. If the mechanism for resolving `output_field` is failing for combined expressions in Django 3.2, it suggests a potential alteration in inheritance or field resolution logic that previously worked in Django 3.0.8.\n   \n3. **as_sql method**:\n\n   - **What it does**: The `as_sql` method is crucial in translating Django ORM queries into SQL queries. The presence of this method across various components (expressions, compiler) indicates its central role in query generation.\n   \n   - **Relationship with the bug**: The bug description involves the generation of an SQL query through `ExpressionWrapper`, which would ultimately call the `as_sql` method. Any changes or peculiarities in how `as_sql` handles expressions, especially custom ones wrapped with `ExpressionWrapper`, could directly influence the bug.\n   \n4. **FieldError in exceptions.py**:\n\n   - **What it does**: `FieldError` is raised by Django when there is a problem with a model field, such as when an unresolved field name is used in a query, or, relevant to this case, when incompatible field types are combined without a clear `output_field`.\n   \n   - **Relationship with the bug**: The exception being triggered is a direct result of the issue faced. It is clear evidence that Django is unable to automatically resolve or infer the `output_field` for the resulting expression of combined fields of different types.\n   \n5. **select_format method and get_group_by in sql/compiler.py**:\n\n   - **What it does**: The `select_format` method likely formats select clauses for SQL queries, ensuring that the output matches the expected SQL syntax and types. The `get_group_by` method helps in constructing the `GROUP BY` clause of an SQL query, determining which columns are included based on the query's structure and requirements.\n   \n   - **Relationship with the bug and intended behavior**: These parts are crucial in the formation of complex SQL queries that involve expressions. They must cooperate correctly with `ExpressionWrapper` to ensure that `output_field` information is preserved and correctly applied in the final SQL query. Any discrepancy in handling the `output_field` especially in expressions that involve operations or combinations of fields, can lead to the described error.\n\nConsidering these insights, the next steps would potentially involve reviewing changes between Django 3.0.8 and 3.2 related to `ExpressionWrapper`, `as_sql`, and the field resolution logic to identify modifications that could have inadvertently led to this regression. Specifically, examining how `output_field` is determined when not explicitly set in an `ExpressionWrapper` involving combined expressions would be critical."

This behavior must maintain existing functionality while also providing a way to correctly infer or set the `output_field` for complex expressions. Potentially, enhancing the `__init__` or introducing a new method to better handle or verify `output_field` in cases of combined expressions could rectify the regression. This includes the implementation of a robust mechanism for inferring the appropriate `output_field` based on the types of the fields involved in the expression if it is not explicitly provided.\n\n**Bug Location 2**:\n   - **File**: `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`\n   - **Methods**: Potentially `get_group_by` or any method involved in constructing the SQL query from the `ExpressionWrapper`, particularly those that involve `output_field` handling.\n\n   - **Intended Behavior**: These methods in the SQL compiler should account for and correctly handle the `output_field` specified by `ExpressionWrapper`, ensuring that it is correctly applied in the SQL query, especially in the `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `SELECT` clauses. If there is indeed a flaw in how these methods are handling expressions wrapped in `ExpressionWrapper`, particularly when it comes to recognizing and applying the `output_field`, fixing this would involve ensuring that the compiler accurately respects and utilizes the `output_field` information provided by such expressions, thus preventing the `FieldError` seen. This includes correctly handling complex expressions where fields of differing types are combined, ensuring they do not lose their explicit `output_field` specification through the query construction process."
