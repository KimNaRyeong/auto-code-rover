        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue regarding `ExpressionWrapper` losing `output_field` for combined expressions without an `output_field`, we need to explore related classes, methods, and code paths. Here are the specific API calls that would be useful:\n\n1. Explore the `ExpressionWrapper` class to understand its structure and any recent changes that may have affected its behavior:\n   - `search_class(\"ExpressionWrapper\")`\n\n2. Investigate how `ExpressionWrapper` resolves its `output_field`, particularly how it handles combined expressions and determines the `output_field` when it's not explicitly provided:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"output_field\", \"ExpressionWrapper\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"_resolve_output_field\", \"ExpressionWrapper\")`\n\n3. Since the issue mentions a regression when upgrading from Django 3.0.8 to Django 3.2, it might be beneficial to look into the `ExpressionWrapper`'s usage and behavior specifically within query compilation and execution:\n   - `search_method(\"as_sql\")`\n   - `search_class(\"FieldError\")`\n   - `search_method(\"select_format\")`\n\n4. The traceback mentions several key parts of Django's ORM where the problem manifests. Reviewing these could provide insight into how expressions are processed, especially changes between Django versions:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"pre_sql_setup\", \"django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\")`\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"get_group_by\", \"django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\")`\n   - `search_code(\"select_format\")`\n\nThese API calls aim to reveal how `ExpressionWrapper` interacts with Django's ORM, particularly in constructing queries with combined expressions. The insights from these calls should help in identifying the cause of the issue and formulating a potential patch."
