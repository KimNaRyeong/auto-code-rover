Based on the new requirements and clarifications, here is a revised standalone Python script `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue as specified. This script follows the instructions, utilizing the provided function for clear stack trace printing. It aims to simulate a Django environment, execute the problematic query, and accordingly raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is observed while also providing a clear stack trace of the issue.

```python
"""
This script is intended to reproduce a Django ORM issue where ExpressionWrapper loses its output_field in combined expressions
without an explicit output_field, resulting in a FieldError when executed on Django version 3.2.

# Function to print Python stack traces as specified

        Mallets.objects.annotate(sheer=sheer, lacquer=lacquer).first()
        print("The issue did not occur with the current Django version.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue reproduced: ExpressionWrapper loses output_field for combined expression without an output_field.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating the script didn't encounter the expected issue (or it's been fixed).
    except AssertionError:
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 indicating the issue was reproduced.
```

This script sets up a minimal Django application with the necessary model definitions and performs an operation that's supposed to replicate the reported issue. It explicitly checks for the scenario which should lead to the `FieldError` due to `ExpressionWrapper` losing `output_field` information when combining expressions without an explicit `output_field` specified. If the issue is reproduced, the script exits with code 1 and prints the stack trace of the error, adhering to the requirements.
