Given the clarification, I'll provide an updated version of the `reproducer.py` that properly checks for the specific issue and ensures that an `AssertionError` is raised if the issue is present, and otherwise exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed, using the specified function to print stack trace:

```python
# reproducer.py

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    fig = plt.figure()
    subfigs = fig.subfigures(2, 1)
    axarr = subfigs[0].subplots(2, 2)
    try:
        plt.sca(axarr[0, 0])
    except Exception as e:
        # If any exception is caught, print the stack trace.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        if isinstance(e, TypeError) and "int() argument must be" in str(e):
            # If the specific TypeError related to the issue is caught, raise AssertionError to indicate failure.
            raise AssertionError("Issue reproduction failed: The expected TypeError was caught.")
        else:
            # If another type of error is caught, it means the test did not reproduce the expected issue correctly.
            print("An unexpected error occurred, which is not part of the reported issue. Please check the test setup.")
            exit(1)
    else:
        # If no error is raised, consider the issue might have been fixed or is not reproducible with this script.
        print("No error occurred. The issue might be fixed or not reproducible with this script.")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(1)
```

This script attempts to reproduce the issue by running the problematic code. It checks specifically for the `TypeError` related to using `plt.sca()` on an axes created with subfigures, as described in your issue report.

- If the expected `TypeError` is caught, it prints the detailed stack trace and raises an `AssertionError`, indicating the test successfully reproduced the issue.
- If any other exception is caught, it provides feedback that an unexpected error occurred, suggesting the test might not have accurately targeted the reported issue.
- If no exception is caught, the script prints a message suggesting the issue might have been fixed or is not reproducible with this setup, and then exits with code 0 to indicate success under these circumstances.
