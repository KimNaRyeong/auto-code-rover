This updated `reproducer.py` script is intended to reproduce the specific issue where using `plt.sca()` on an axes created with subfigures results in a TypeError. The script includes the appropriate checks to assert this specific error message. If the code executes without raising the expected `TypeError`, it assumes the issue is either fixed or not reproducible with the provided code snippet, resulting in a successful exit (`exit(0)`). If an unexpected error type is caught, it indicates a scenario different from the one targeted by this script, providing feedback for further investigation.
