When setting the current Axes and Figure, the method should verify if the given axes are part of a `SubFigure` and, if so, appropriately reference the parent figure of the `SubFigure`. This might involve adjusting the figure reference to ensure it\u2019s compatible with functions that are designed to work with `Figure` instances. The change must preserve the method\u2019s ability to handle axes associated with regular `Figure` objects."

        "intended_behavior": "This method should be modified to properly recognize and handle `SubFigure` objects passed as the `num` parameter. Instead of attempting to convert `SubFigure` directly to an int for identification, the method should detect the `SubFigure` type and use the parent figure's identifier or handle it in a way that allows the `SubFigure` and its content to be correctly managed. This adjustment needs to ensure that existing functionality for managing and referencing `Figure` objects based on integer or string identifiers remains intact."
