        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, let's perform the following search API calls based on the details provided in the bug report:\n\n1. Since the error arises in `pyplot.py` when attempting to use `plt.sca(axarr[0, 0])`, it is essential to understand how `plt.sca()` and `plt.figure()` functions are implemented within `pyplot.py`. This will help in understanding why `plt.sca()` does not accept an axes object from a subfigure.\n\n2. The error mentions a `TypeError` when trying to convert a `SubFigure` object to an int, which likely occurs within the `figure` function of `pyplot.py` based on the traceback. This suggests we need to look into the `figure` function to see how it processes its arguments.\n\n3. Since the use of subfigures seems to be relatively new or different compared to standard figures and axes, it will also be beneficial to look into how the `SubFigure` class is defined or used, especially how it differs from regular `Figure` objects in terms of members and methods.\n\nBased on these points, the search API calls to be made are:\n\n- search_method_in_file(\"sca\", \"matplotlib/pyplot.py\")\n- search_method_in_file(\"figure\", \"matplotlib/pyplot.py\")\n- search_class(\"SubFigure\")"
