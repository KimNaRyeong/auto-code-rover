Specifically there are two sides to the failure:\nwhile I can provide an until value (as a string, which is processed by parse_time) there is no mechanism to pass a for value if that's how I want to spell the input\nthe for value is always required and attempts to parse the (string) until value passed, which then errors since the input formats are very different\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather enough context to resolve the issue related to the `call_command()` failure when using mutually exclusive arguments with the same `dest`, I would like to make the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"BaseCommand\")`: This will provide context on the base class from which the problematic command class is inheriting. Understanding the base class is crucial for addressing issues in derived classes, especially when the issue is related to command line argument parsing or execution flow.\n\n2. `search_method(\"add_arguments\")`: Since the issue description highlights a problem within the `add_arguments` method, getting more examples or definitions of this method across the project may reveal common patterns or practices that could suggest a solution.\n\n3. `search_method(\"call_command\")`: Given that the core of the issue involves `call_command` not behaving as expected with mutually exclusive arguments, reviewing the implementation or usage of `call_command` can provide insights into why it fails under the described circumstances.\n\n4. `search_code(\"parse_duration_to_time\")`: Understanding how the `parse_duration_to_time` function works is essential since it's explicitly used as a type within the `add_arguments` method for one of the mutually exclusive options. It could give clues on how the parsing behaves and why it might fail when invoked through `call_command`.\n\n5. `search_code(\"parse_time\")`: Similarly, reviewing how `parse_time` is implemented will help understand the expected input format and how it processes the provided `until` argument, which seems to be part of the problem when parsing arguments passed to `call_command`.\n\nThese API calls are focused on understanding both the specific components identified in the issue and the broader system they interact with, which should collectively provide a comprehensive context for crafting a solution."
