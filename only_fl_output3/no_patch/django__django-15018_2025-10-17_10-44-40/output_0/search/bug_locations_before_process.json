The intended behavior should allow 'call_command' to distinguish between these arguments without confusion. A possible resolution could involve redesigning how these arguments are parsed or stored, potentially by using separate 'dest' names and then reconciling them within the 'handle' method based on which argument was actually provided. This would preserve the existing functionality of allowing either a direct timestamp or a duration to specify the time but would require changes in both 'add_arguments' and 'handle' to manage the adjusted argument parsing logic effectively."

        "intended_behavior": "While 'call_command' itself may not be 'buggy,' the issue indicates a potential limitation in its handling of command line arguments that map to the same 'dest'. To resolve the reported issue, enhancements or accommodations might be needed to better support such scenarios. This could involve implementing logic in 'call_command' to adequately handle the case where mutually exclusive arguments are provided with the same 'dest', ensuring that the parsing logic aligns more closely with how the Django command line parser treats these cases. However, this is a broader change and requires careful consideration to avoid breaking existing functionalities."
