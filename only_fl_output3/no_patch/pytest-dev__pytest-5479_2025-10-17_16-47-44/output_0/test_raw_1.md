Given the clarification, the original task aimed to reproduce an issue tied specifically to a Python 2 environment related behavior (issues with Unicode string handling in assertions) using `pytest.raises` within a Python 3 context. Since Python 3 handles Unicode differently (and more robustly) than Python 2, simply raising an `AssertionError` with a Unicode character in Python 3 won't reproduce the `UnicodeEncodeError` described.

However, the original question involves reproducing an issue with `pytest.raises` and Unicode string matching in assertions, which is a Python 2 specific issue and may not be directly applicable or reproducible in Python 3 due to improvements in Unicode handling. Still, attempting to honor your request to create a `reproducer.py` under Python 3, we have to simulate or mimic the conditions that might lead to an error or demonstrate the correct behavior where the issue would not occur due to Python 3's Unicode support. 

To align better with your instructions without deviating from technical accuracy or practicality, we can attempt a scenario where we encode Unicode manually to bytes, and then decode it back. This might not replicate the exact conditions but can serve to illustrate related handling in Python 3.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys
import pytest

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback    
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_function():
    with pytest.raises(AssertionError, match=u"\u2603".encode('utf-8').decode('utf-8')):
        assert False, u"\u2603"

try:
    # Execute the test function with pytest's exception handling
    test_function()
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicates handling the exception (and thus, not reproducing the exact Python 2 issue in Python 3 context)
```

This script now attempts to directly use `pytest.raises` with a Unicode match, encoded and then decoded to simulate dealing with Unicode explicitly, which in Python 3 would typically not cause an issue. However, note that the precise Python 2 issue related to `UnicodeEncodeError` due to Unicode characters in exception messages and matches is inherently resolved by Python 3's design and may not be representative of the Python 2-specific encoding issues being directly reproducible in a Python 3 environment.
