The original issue arises in Python 2 where the default string encoding does not support Unicode characters outside the ASCII range, hence the `UnicodeEncodeError` when trying to handle the `AssertionError` with a Unicode character in its message.\n\nIn the scenario where this script is to demonstrate the original problem (which requires Python 2 to reproduce accurately due to its handling of Unicode), running it with Python 3 instead should not raise the `UnicodeEncodeError`. The script is designed to catch any exception raised by the test function, print the stack trace of the exception, and exit with code 0 if an exception is caught, indicating that the script itself has handled exceptions gracefully regardless of the Python version."
