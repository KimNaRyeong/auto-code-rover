        "intended_behavior": "The `raises` function is intended to assert that a given block of code raises a specified exception. It also optionally checks whether the exception message matches a given regular expression, permitting the use of unicode characters within this `match` expression. To resolve the issue, the method must be capable of handling unicode characters in the `match` argument correctly under Python 2 environments. This handling might involve ensuring unicode strings are processed and compared as unicode rather than being coerced into ASCII, which leads to `UnicodeEncodeError`. \n\nA potential approach is to explicitly encode or decode strings within the `raises` method, making sure that operations on the exception message that involve the `match` parameter are unicode-safe. This could entail checking Python version and conditionally applying the necessary encoding/decoding only when running under Python 2:\n- Ensure the encoding of the `match` parameter and the exception message are compatible, explicitly working with unicode.\n- Use the `unicode_literals` import from `__future__` to ensure all string literals are unicode strings in Python 2.\n- Possibly, catch `UnicodeEncodeError` specifically during the match operation to provide a clearer error message or fallback to a safer comparison method.\n\nThe goal is to maintain the functionality of filtering out exception messages based on a specified pattern while supporting unicode patterns robustly across Python versions, especially in Python 2 where unicode handling is not automatic."
