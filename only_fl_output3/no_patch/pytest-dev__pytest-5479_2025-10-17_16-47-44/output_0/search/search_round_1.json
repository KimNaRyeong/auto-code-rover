        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides us with valuable insights into the issue and its surrounding codebase.\n\n### 1. Analysis of `raises` in `_pytest/python_api.py`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThis part of the code defines the `raises` function within pytest, which is a utility to assert that a certain block of code raises an expected exception. It can be used both as a context manager and in a legacy form where a callable is passed directly. The function allows matching a specific message within the raised exception by utilizing regular expressions through the `match` parameter.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nThe issue is directly related to the `raises` function. Specifically, it suggests there might be a problem when the `match` parameter is used with unicode strings, resulting in a `UnicodeEncodeError` under Python 2 environments. The bug appears when `pytest.raises` tries to handle or match the unicode string in the exception's message.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nThe intended behavior of this part of the code is to successfully compare the exception message against a pattern provided in the `match` parameter, including when that pattern includes unicode characters. This matching should work without errors across all supported Python versions, including Python 2, where unicode handling is less straightforward than in Python 3.\n\n### 2. UnicodeEncodeError Context\n\nThe search for code containing `UnicodeEncodeError` and `u'\\u2603'` yields different results.\n\n#### UnicodeEncodeError in the codebase\nWhile the search for the exact unicode character (`u'\\u2603'`) did not yield results, finding `UnicodeEncodeError` in various parts of the codebase, including testing and report generation modules, suggests that unicode handling and related errors have been considered or addressed in different contexts. This information implies that the handling of unicode characters and potential encoding issues are relevant across the pytest codebase.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nThe `UnicodeEncodeError` is directly related to the reported issue, as the error message indicates this is the type of exception raised. It suggests the bug results from pytest attempting to process or match unicode literals in an ASCII context, which Python 2 cannot handle by default.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nWherever `UnicodeEncodeError` is expected or caught, the intent is likely to manage or convert unicode characters effectively, so they are handled without causing errors. The presence of these errors in the context of the issue suggests a gap in this process when `match` is used with unicode patterns in `pytest.raises`.\n\n### 3. AssertionError, match=\n\nThe search results related to using `AssertionError` with the `match=` parameter give us examples of how `pytest.raises` is tested within its codebase, particularly verifying behavior when the match parameter is misunderstood or misused.\n\n#### Intended behavior \nThese snippets intend to showcase the correct usage of the `match` parameter, asserting that pytest correctly identifies patterns within exception messages. Given the issue, it implies that unicode matching should also work correctly and be part of the tested scenarios.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\n- The core of the issue lies in the handling of unicode patterns within `pytest.raises` under Python 2.\n- The relationship between the part of the code where `pytest.raises` is defined and the issue is direct, as it's where unicode matches should be correctly processed and compared.\n\nGiven the context:\n\n- We should further investigate how pytest encodes or decodes exception messages and the `match` parameter's value, especially under Python 2 environments. This could involve looking closer into the `_pytest._code.ExceptionInfo` class or related exception handling mechanisms that operate on the exception messages.\n- Additional API calls could include:\n  - `search_code(\"ExceptionInfo\")` to explore how exceptions are processed and stored.\n  - `search_method_in_file(\"compile\", \"src/_pytest/_code/source.py\")` to check if the handling of source code and error messages during execution could affect unicode processing."

It also optionally checks whether the exception message matches a given regular expression, permitting the use of unicode characters within this `match` expression. To resolve the issue, the method must be capable of handling unicode characters in the `match` argument correctly under Python 2 environments. This handling might involve ensuring unicode strings are processed and compared as unicode rather than being coerced into ASCII, which leads to `UnicodeEncodeError`. \n\n   A potential approach is to explicitly encode or decode strings within the `raises` method, making sure that operations on the exception message that involve the `match` parameter are unicode-safe. This could entail checking Python version and conditionally applying the necessary encoding/decoding only when running under Python 2:\n   - Ensure the encoding of the `match` parameter and the exception message are compatible, explicitly working with unicode.\n   - Use the `unicode_literals` import from `__future__` to ensure all string literals are unicode strings in Python 2.\n   - Possibly, catch `UnicodeEncodeError` specifically during the match operation to provide a clearer error message or fallback to a safer comparison method.\n\n   The goal is to maintain the functionality of filtering out exception messages based on a specified pattern while supporting unicode patterns robustly across Python versions, especially in Python 2 where unicode handling is not automatic."
