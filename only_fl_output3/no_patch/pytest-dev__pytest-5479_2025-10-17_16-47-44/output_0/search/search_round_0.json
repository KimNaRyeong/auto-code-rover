        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to making Unicode match assertions with `pytest.raises` in a Python 2 environment, I would perform the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `pytest.raises` function to understand how it processes the `match` parameter, especially how it deals with Unicode strings:\n   ```python\n   search_method('raises')\n   ```\n\n2. Since the issue occurs with a UnicodeEncodeError, it would be helpful to find out where Unicode strings are being encoded or handled within the pytest codebase. The error message points to an issue with converting a Unicode character to ASCII, which suggests that there's a specific place in the pytest code that does not correctly handle Unicode characters:\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"u'\\\\u2603'\")\n   search_code(\"UnicodeEncodeError\")\n   ```\n\n3. The error shows an `AssertionError` is expected to be caught by `pytest.raises`. It could be useful to see how `AssertionError` is being handled and how the `match` argument interacts with it:\n   ```python\n   search_code('AssertionError, match=')\n   ```\n\nThese API calls aim to find out how pytest handles Unicode characters in assertions and exceptions, where the UnicodeEncodeError might originate from in the context of handling Unicode strings, and how `AssertionError` match assertions are processed, especially in relation to Unicode strings."
