Given the specific requirements and the need to accurately reflect the behavior described in the example you provided, it seems there was a misunderstanding in my previous approach. If you're trying to reproduce an issue that arises when catching exceptions using `pytest.raises` with Unicode match assertions in Python 2, please note that Python 3 handles Unicode differently, essentially eliminating the particular type of `UnicodeEncodeError` seen in Python 2. However, given your scenario is executed under Python 3, here's a more accurate attempt to simulate a relevant test case, which may not directly reproduce the Python 2 issue but will adhere to Python 3 standards and the provided instructions.

Please note, this script assumes that `pytest` is installed in your Python environment. The original issue you've described arises from the Python 2 handling of Unicode, which can be intricate to replicate in Python 3 due to its improved Unicode support. Therefore, the script below will demonstrate how such an issue might be approached in Python 3, knowing that Python 3's Unicode handling will likely not trigger the same error.

```python
# reproducer.py
import pytest

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_u():
    try:
        with pytest.raises(AssertionError, match="\u2603"):
            assert False, "\u2603"
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 as per instructions

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_u()
```

This Python script will not raise a `UnicodeEncodeError` as described initially since Python 3 handles Unicode characters without the complications seen in Python 2. The use of `sys.exit(0)` is based on the condition that the script should exit with code 0 when the issue is resolved or accurately handled, which in the context of Python 3's Unicode handling, demonstrates that the issue as described (a `UnicodeEncodeError` from mismatched encodings) would not arise. 

Ensure `pytest` is installed in your Python environment before running this script:
```sh
pip install pytest
```

Running this script under Python 3 with `pytest` installed should execute without raising a `UnicodeEncodeError`, demonstrating the improved Unicode handling in Python 3 compared to Python 2.
