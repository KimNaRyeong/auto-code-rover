        "intended_behavior": "In the `send` method of the `Session` class, all instances of `socket.timeout` should be caught and re-raised as `requests.exceptions.Timeout`. This ensures that any timeout-related exceptions, regardless of their origin within the underlying network stack or `socket` library, are consistently handled as part of the `requests` library's public API. This change preserves the existing functionality by maintaining the method's overall behavior and purpose, which is to send a prepared request and return the response. The key improvement here is enhancing the robustness and predictability of exception handling related to timeouts. Specifically, adding a try-except block around the areas where `socket.timeout` might be raised (such as reading from or writing to a socket) and re-raising it as `requests.exceptions.Timeout` would achieve the intended behavior."
