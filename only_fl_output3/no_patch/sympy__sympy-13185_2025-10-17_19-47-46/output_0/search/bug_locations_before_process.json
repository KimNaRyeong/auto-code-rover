        "intended_behavior": "The `cse` method should ensure that when dealing with expressions involving `MatrixSymbol` indexing, the common subexpressions identified and replaced accurately consider the matrix structure and indexing behaviour. This means improving the algorithm to recognize and handle matrix element expressions correctly, ensuring that substitutions made do not erroneously simplify or alter the matrix relationships in the original expression. The fix should preserve the method's capability to perform common subexpression elimination on a variety of expressions while ensuring that matrix expressions, specifically those involving indexing, are optimized correctly without introducing misinterpretations or incorrect simplifications."

        "intended_behavior": "The `_eval_subs` method within the `MatrixSymbol` class should be reviewed and potentially modified to ensure that substitution operations involving matrix symbols and their indices are handled with complete accuracy, preserving the logical and mathematical integrity of matrix operations. Enhancements to this method should focus on ensuring that substitutions do not inadvertently change the meaning or outcome of matrix expressions, particularly in the context of optimization routines like `cse()`. The intention is to maintain existing functionalities while improving the handling of matrix-specific substitutions, facilitating a more intuitive and correct interaction with `cse()` and other optimization functions."
