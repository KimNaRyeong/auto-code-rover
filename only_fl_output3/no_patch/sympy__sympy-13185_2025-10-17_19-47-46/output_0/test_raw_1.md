Given the context and to address the issue properly with `sympy.MatrixElement` leading to an error in the previous iteration, I'll revise the Python script `reproducer.py` to accurately reproduce the initial problem and avoid using the wrong attribute.

```python
import sympy as sp


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def sub_in_matrixsymbols(exp, matrices):
    for matrix in matrices:
        for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):
            for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):
                name = "%s_%d_%d" % (matrix.name, i, j)
                sym = sp.symbols(name)
                exp = exp.subs(sym, matrix[i, j])
    return exp

def t44(name):
    return sp.Matrix(4, 4, lambda i, j: sp.symbols('%s_%d_%d' % (name, i, j)))

def main():
    try:
        a = t44("a")
        b = t44("b")
    
        e = a * b
    
        e2 = sub_in_matrixsymbols(e, [sp.MatrixSymbol("a", 4, 4), sp.MatrixSymbol("b", 4, 4)])
        cse_subs, cse_reduced = sp.cse(e2)
    
        subs_symbols = [sym for sym, _ in cse_subs]

        substrings_a = [str(sym) for sym in subs_symbols if "a" in str(sym)]
        substrings_b = [str(sym) for sym in subs_symbols if "b" in str(sym)]

        # Here is where we check if `x0` and `x2` appear in substrings, indicating they are treated as entire matrices
        assert "x0" not in substrings_a and "x2" not in substrings_b, "Failed: x0 or x2 are treated incorrectly as entire matrices."

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code if the assertion fails or any other exception occurs

    print("Test passed, exiting normally.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This script attempts to reproduce the initial issue accurately by focusing on whether the common subexpression elimination (CSE) procedure in SymPy handles `MatrixSymbol` indexing appropriately. It replaces matrix elements with symbolic representations, performs CSE, and then checks if entire matrices are incorrectly treated as single entities due to symbol naming or any misinterpretations.

If the script encounters the discussed issue, it will raise an exception, triggering the `print_stacktrace` function to display detailed trace information. Contrarily, if no problem exists within the concerned logic, it concludes a successful validation, printing a conforming message and exiting with code 0.
