This Python script, `reproducer.py`, is tailored to detect the specific issue described regarding the handling of `MatrixSymbol` indexing by the `cse()` function within the SymPy library. It looks for an unexpected handling of matrix elements, ensuring that the Common Subexpression Elimination process produces the correct number of substitutions and that each substitution is properly managed and does not improperly convert `MatrixSymbol`s to single symbols or incorrectly replace elements. 

Should any part of the process fail to meet the expectations - for instance, if the length of the substitutions differs from the expected or if any substitution is inaccurately a `MatrixElement` tied to incorrect indexing - the script will catch this as an error, raise an `AssertionError`, and provide a detailed stack trace for debugging.

If the script exits with code 0, this indicates that it did not detect the outlined issue, suggesting that the behavior may have been rectified or does not exist as described.
