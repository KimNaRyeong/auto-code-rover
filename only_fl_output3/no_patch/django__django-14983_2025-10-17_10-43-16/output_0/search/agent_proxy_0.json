            "content": "Given the description of the issue, which concerns the generation of improperly numbered migration files in Django when dealing with squashed migrations, we should focus our search on related Django classes, methods, or code snippets that could be at the core of this issue. Key elements from the issue include the `makemigrations` command and how Django handles migration file naming, specifically when there are squashed migrations.\n\nHere are the API calls we should consider to get more context:\n\n1. **Search for the class responsible for migrations**: Since the issue is related to generating migration files, it would be prudent to start by looking for the class that handles migrations. The `Migration` class is a likely candidate, as well as any class related to migration operations or generating migration files.\n    - `search_class(\"Migration\")`\n    - `search_class(\"MigrationAutodetector\")` (Assuming `MigrationAutodetector` could be a part of the migration process, given its likely role in detecting changes that require migrations.)\n\n2. **Search for the `makemigrations` command**: The `makemigrations` command is the direct subject of the issue, so identifying the method or class that defines this command will be crucial.\n    - `search_method(\"makemigrations\")`\n    - `search_class(\"MakemigrationsCommand\")` (Assuming a specific command class exists for `makemigrations`, following Django's command structure.)\n\n3. **Investigate how migration files are named**: The crux of the issue involves the naming convention of new migration files in the presence of squashed migrations. Therefore, searching for code or methods responsible for naming migration files is necessary.\n    - `search_method(\"generate_migration_name\")` (Assuming there is a method specifically for generating migration file names.)\n    - `search_code(\"squashed\")` (To see how the code identifies or marks squashed migrations, which might affect filename generation.)\n\nBy executing these searches, we should be able to gather enough context about how Django's migration system works, specifically in relation to generating and naming migration files in the presence of squashed migrations. This information will be pivotal for drafting a patch to address the issue described."
