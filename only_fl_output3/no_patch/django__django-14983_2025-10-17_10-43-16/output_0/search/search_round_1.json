        "content": "Given the description of the issue, which concerns the generation of improperly numbered migration files in Django when dealing with squashed migrations, we should focus our search on related Django classes, methods, or code snippets that could be at the core of this issue. Key elements from the issue include the `makemigrations` command and how Django handles migration file naming, specifically when there are squashed migrations.\n\nHere are the API calls we should consider to get more context:\n\n1. **Search for the class responsible for migrations**: Since the issue is related to generating migration files, it would be prudent to start by looking for the class that handles migrations. The `Migration` class is a likely candidate, as well as any class related to migration operations or generating migration files.\n    - `search_class(\"Migration\")`\n    - `search_class(\"MigrationAutodetector\")` (Assuming `MigrationAutodetector` could be a part of the migration process, given its likely role in detecting changes that require migrations.)\n\n2. **Search for the `makemigrations` command**: The `makemigrations` command is the direct subject of the issue, so identifying the method or class that defines this command will be crucial.\n    - `search_method(\"makemigrations\")`\n    - `search_class(\"MakemigrationsCommand\")` (Assuming a specific command class exists for `makemigrations`, following Django's command structure.)\n\n3. **Investigate how migration files are named**: The crux of the issue involves the naming convention of new migration files in the presence of squashed migrations. Therefore, searching for code or methods responsible for naming migration files is necessary.\n    - `search_method(\"generate_migration_name\")` (Assuming there is a method specifically for generating migration file names.)\n    - `search_code(\"squashed\")` (To see how the code identifies or marks squashed migrations, which might affect filename generation.)\n\nBy executing these searches, we should be able to gather enough context about how Django's migration system works, specifically in relation to generating and naming migration files in the presence of squashed migrations.

        "content": "Analyzing the context we've gathered, we can piece together a sense of how Django handles migrations, particularly in relation to the generation and management of squashed migrations, and identify areas that might be relevant to the bug concerning migration numbering.\n\n### Analysis of \"Migration\" and \"MigrationAutodetector\"\n\nThe `Migration` class appears in several files across the Django codebase, primarily within specific applications' `migrations` folders and the core migrations framework itself (`django/db/migrations/migration.py`). This widespread presence underscores the class's fundamental role in representing migration files within Django's ORM framework. However, without specific method details from these classes, we deduce their general purpose\u2014to define and apply schema changes or data migrations within an application.\n\nThe `MigrationAutodetector` class in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` is particularly intriguing since it contains methods that suggest it's responsible for identifying changes in the Django models that need to be reflected in new migration files. Methods like `changes`, `_detect_changes`, and `generate_added_fields` imply that this class plays a crucial role in determining what changes require migrations and potentially naming those migrations. Given the bug report's focus on migration numbering, especially when squashed migrations are present, the method `arrange_for_graph`, or possibly methods involved in adding operations (`add_operation`) and determining dependencies (`check_dependency`), might be indirectly related to how migrations are numbered, although the naming mechanism itself wasn't explicitly found.\n\n### Analysis of \"Squashed\" Context\n\nThe search for \"squashed\" yielded results in several files, notably including `django/db/migrations/loader.py`, `django/db/migrations/graph.py`, and command files related to migrations such as `squashmigrations`, `showmigrations`, and `migrate`. The appearance in `squashmigrations` is expected, as this command is directly responsible for creating squashed migrations. The presence of \"squashed\" related code in `loader.py` and `graph.py` might indicate these modules handle the loading and ordering of migration files, including recognizing which migrations have been squashed.\n\nThis suggests a relationship between squashed migrations and the project's issue: the mechanism that recognizes and orders migrations, potentially handled by the migration loader or graph, might not adequately account for the presence of both original and squashed migrations when numbering new migrations.\n\n### Intended Behavior\n\nGiven the issue's description, we would expect Django's migrations framework to:\n1. Recognize the presence of a squashed migration (`0001_squashed_0002_auto`) as a replacement for its constituent migrations (`0001_initial`, `0002_auto`).\n2. Correctly number new migrations starting after the highest numbered migration that has not been squashed or, if all have been squashed, after the squashed migration. This would mean generating `0003_auto...` instead of reverting back to `0002_auto...` when `0001` and `0002` are squashed into `0001_squashed...`.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the findings, further context could be helpful from the following areas:\n- Investigate the methods within `MigrationAutodetector` that might influence naming, particularly those that arrange migrations in sequence or deal with squashed migrations (`arrange_for_graph`).\n- Specific examination of how `django/db/migrations/loader.py` and `django/db/migrations/graph.py` manage squashed migrations.\n- Since the `generate_migration_name` method wasn't found, it might be useful to explore where and how migrations are actually being saved or added to the migrations directory, potentially in `django/db/migrations/migration.py` or within the migration commands found (`migrate`, `squashmigrations`).\n\nIt seems the next logical step would involve a deeper dive into how squashed migrations are processed and referenced during the migration generation process, directly in the files and methods that manage migration sequences and dependencies."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Given the absence of direct information on a specific method that handles migration naming, and considering the possible involvement of several components in the migration generation process, the following searches are proposed:\n\n    - `search_method_in_file(\"add_operation\", \"django/db/migrations/autodetector.py\")`\n    - `search_method_in_file(\"arrange_for_graph\", \"django/db/migrations/autodetector.py\")`\n    - `search_code_in_file(\"squashed\", \"django/db/migrations/loader.py\")`\n    - `search_code_in_file(\"squashed\", \"django/db/migrations/graph.py\")`\n\n2. **LEAVE THIS EMPTY**. \n\nGiven the complexity of Django's migration system and the potential for widespread impact of any changes, it's prudent to gather detailed insights into how migrations are generated, named, and ordered\u2014especially in cases involving squashed migrations\u2014before identifying specific bug locations and proposing changes. The additional context requested should help clarify these mechanisms and thus inform a targeted approach to resolving the issue."
