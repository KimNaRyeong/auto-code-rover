        "intended_behavior": "The method should be modified to ensure that when it sets the migration name (new_name) for a new migration, it accounts for the presence of squashed migrations in such a way that the numbering of migrations continues sequentially from the last applied (non-squashed or squashed) migration. Specifically, when determining next_number (lines 1278-1281), the logic should consider if the last migration in the app_label sequence is squashed and adjust the numbering accordingly. If a squashed migration was the last applied, the next migration number should logically follow the highest migration number included in the squashed migration (i.e., if 0001_squashed_0002 is the last, the next should be 0003_...). This ensures that even with squashed migrations, the migration numbering will proceed without reverting to previously used numbers, thus preserving the sequential integrity of migration files."
