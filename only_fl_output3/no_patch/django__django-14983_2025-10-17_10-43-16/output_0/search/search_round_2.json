Key elements from the issue include the `makemigrations` command and how Django handles migration file naming, specifically when there are squashed migrations.\n\nHere are the API calls we should consider to get more context:\n\n1. **Search for the class responsible for migrations**: Since the issue is related to generating migration files, it would be prudent to start by looking for the class that handles migrations. The `Migration` class is a likely candidate, as well as any class related to migration operations or generating migration files.\n    - `search_class(\"Migration\")`\n    - `search_class(\"MigrationAutodetector\")` (Assuming `MigrationAutodetector` could be a part of the migration process, given its likely role in detecting changes that require migrations.)\n\n2. **Search for the `makemigrations` command**: The `makemigrations` command is the direct subject of the issue, so identifying the method or class that defines this command will be crucial.\n    - `search_method(\"makemigrations\")`\n    - `search_class(\"MakemigrationsCommand\")` (Assuming a specific command class exists for `makemigrations`, following Django's command structure.)\n\n3. **Investigate how migration files are named**: The crux of the issue involves the naming convention of new migration files in the presence of squashed migrations. Therefore, searching for code or methods responsible for naming migration files is necessary.\n    - `search_method(\"generate_migration_name\")` (Assuming there is a method specifically for generating migration file names.)\n    - `search_code(\"squashed\")` (To see how the code identifies or marks squashed migrations, which might affect filename generation.)\n\nBy executing these searches, we should be able to gather enough context about how Django's migration system works, specifically in relation to generating and naming migration files in the presence of squashed migrations.

        "content": "Analyzing the context we've gathered, we can piece together a sense of how Django handles migrations, particularly in relation to the generation and management of squashed migrations, and identify areas that might be relevant to the bug concerning migration numbering.\n\n### Analysis of \"Migration\" and \"MigrationAutodetector\"\n\nThe `Migration` class appears in several files across the Django codebase, primarily within specific applications' `migrations` folders and the core migrations framework itself (`django/db/migrations/migration.py`). This widespread presence underscores the class's fundamental role in representing migration files within Django's ORM framework. However, without specific method details from these classes, we deduce their general purpose\u2014to define and apply schema changes or data migrations within an application.\n\nThe `MigrationAutodetector` class in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` is particularly intriguing since it contains methods that suggest it's responsible for identifying changes in the Django models that need to be reflected in new migration files. Methods like `changes`, `_detect_changes`, and `generate_added_fields` imply that this class plays a crucial role in determining what changes require migrations and potentially naming those migrations. Given the bug report's focus on migration numbering, especially when squashed migrations are present, the method `arrange_for_graph`, or possibly methods involved in adding operations (`add_operation`) and determining dependencies (`check_dependency`), might be indirectly related to how migrations are numbered, although the naming mechanism itself wasn't explicitly found.\n\n### Analysis of \"Squashed\" Context\n\nThe search for \"squashed\" yielded results in several files, notably including `django/db/migrations/loader.py`, `django/db/migrations/graph.py`, and command files related to migrations such as `squashmigrations`, `showmigrations`, and `migrate`. The appearance in `squashmigrations` is expected, as this command is directly responsible for creating squashed migrations. The presence of \"squashed\" related code in `loader.py` and `graph.py` might indicate these modules handle the loading and ordering of migration files, including recognizing which migrations have been squashed.\n\nThis suggests a relationship between squashed migrations and the project's issue: the mechanism that recognizes and orders migrations, potentially handled by the migration loader or graph, might not adequately account for the presence of both original and squashed migrations when numbering new migrations.\n\n### Intended Behavior\n\nGiven the issue's description, we would expect Django's migrations framework to:\n1. Recognize the presence of a squashed migration (`0001_squashed_0002_auto`) as a replacement for its constituent migrations (`0001_initial`, `0002_auto`).\n2. Correctly number new migrations starting after the highest numbered migration that has not been squashed or, if all have been squashed, after the squashed migration. This would mean generating `0003_auto...` instead of reverting back to `0002_auto...` when `0001` and `0002` are squashed into `0001_squashed...`.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the findings, further context could be helpful from the following areas:\n- Investigate the methods within `MigrationAutodetector` that might influence naming, particularly those that arrange migrations in sequence or deal with squashed migrations (`arrange_for_graph`).\n- Specific examination of how `django/db/migrations/loader.py` and `django/db/migrations/graph.py` manage squashed migrations.\n- Since the `generate_migration_name` method wasn't found, it might be useful to explore where and how migrations are actually being saved or added to the migrations directory, potentially in `django/db/migrations/migration.py` or within the migration commands found (`migrate`, `squashmigrations`).\n\nIt seems the next logical step would involve a deeper dive into how squashed migrations are processed and referenced during the migration generation process, directly in the files and methods that manage migration sequences and dependencies."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### `add_operation` in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\nThe `add_operation` method adds a new migration operation to the list of generated operations for an app. It allows for the operation to be added at the beginning or the end of the list based on the `beginning` parameter, and it also associates dependencies with the operation.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\nThis method plays a crucial role in constructing the list of migration operations that will eventually become part of the migration file. While it doesn't directly handle naming migrations, the order of operations and their dependencies set here could influence the overall migration chain, which indirectly relates to how migrations are named and numbered. However, this method itself may not be directly responsible for the misnumbering issue but is significant in understanding how migrations are structured.\n\n- **Intended behavior in relation to the bug?**\nThe intended behavior here should ensure that migration operations are correctly associated with their dependencies and ordered. However, to resolve the naming issue, we need to look further into how names are generated and dependencies are evaluated, which might not be fully covered in the scope of this method.\n\n#### `arrange_for_graph` in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\nThe `arrange_for_graph` method organizes the changes necessary for migrations to extend the migration graph from the leaf nodes for each app, assigning correct names and dependencies to ensure a proper sequence in the migration path. \n\n- **Relationship with the bug:**\nThis method is directly involved in naming migrations based on their position in the sequence (including dealing with initial migrations and subsequent numbers). It's here where new migrations receive their filenames, which includes determining the correct sequential number. This process is crucial to the report's issue: incorrect numbering of migrations in the presence of squashed migrations could stem from how this method calculates `next_number` and assigns names.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\nTo address the bug, this method should ensure that when calculating the `next_number` for a migration, it correctly accounts for both existing and squashed migrations, properly incrementing the sequence even when a squashed migration is present. It must ensure that a new migration following a squashed one continues from the highest existing migration number, not reverting to an earlier number due to misinterpretation of the existing migration landscape.\n\n#### Checking for Consistency in the Presence of Squashed Migrations (`loader.py` and `graph.py`)\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  - In `loader.py`, during consistency check (`check_consistent_history` method), the code checks for the presence of unapplied squashed migrations and whether all migrations it replaces have been applied.\n  - In `graph.py`, `DummyNode` represents a placeholder for a migration not present on disk, such as a removed squashed migration, indicating the system's awareness of squashed and possibly removed migrations in the migration graph.\n  \n- **Relationship with the bug:**\nThese components recognize and handle squashed migrations in some capacity, either by verifying their consistency in the migration history or representing their absence in the migration graph. This indicates the system\u2019s ability to account for squashed migrations, which is central to understanding why new migrations might be incorrectly numbered.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\nWhile this code effectively recognizes squashed migrations, the intended behavior would ensure that the migration numbering logic (particularly in `arrange_for_graph`) fully accounts for squashed migrations when generating names for new migrations. The system needs to correctly interpret the presence of squashed migrations and their impact on the sequential numbering of future migrations, thereby avoiding the re-use of numbers from replaced migrations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe direct cause of the reported issue seems most closely related to the functionality within `arrange_for_graph`, which is responsible for naming migrations based on the existing migration graph. To resolve the issue, modifications in this area should ensure that the calculation of the next migration number properly accounts for the presence of any squashed migrations, ensuring that new migrations are correctly sequenced without reusing numbers from squashed migrations."

If a squashed migration was the last applied, the next migration number should logically follow the highest migration number included in the squashed migration (i.e., if `0001_squashed_0002` is the last, the next should be `0003_...`).\n- This ensures that even with squashed migrations, the migration numbering will proceed without reverting to previously used numbers, thus preserving the sequential integrity of migration files.\n\n### Additional Context:\n- While `add_operation` method in `autodetector.py` and the handling of squashed migrations in `loader.py` and `graph.py` contribute to understanding the migration framework, it is the naming logic within `arrange_for_graph` that directly impacts the reported issue. Thus, focusing on adjusting the naming sequence logic within this method addresses the core of the problem described.\n- No further context required as the analysis of provided code snippets from `arrange_for_graph` gives sufficient insight into the probable cause of the issue and the necessary adjustments needed to resolve it. These adjustments require careful consideration of existing migration history, including squashed migrations, to maintain the integrity and continuity of the migration numbering sequence."
