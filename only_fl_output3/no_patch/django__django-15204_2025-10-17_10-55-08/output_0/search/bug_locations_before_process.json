        "intended_behavior": "The `parse_duration` function should be enhanced to provide better handling of malformed inputs. Specifically, when encountering inputs that do not match any of the expected duration formats, instead of attempting to convert non-numeric substrings to a float (which leads to `ValueError`), the function should catch such errors and raise a more descriptive exception or handle the error in a way that doesn't cause the system to crash. The function should maintain its existing functionality of parsing valid duration strings into `datetime.timedelta` objects but should handle invalid inputs more gracefully, possibly by returning `None` or raising a custom exception that higher-level functions like `DurationField.to_python` can catch to provide meaningful user feedback."

        "method": "to_python",
        "intended_behavior": "The `to_python` method should be updated to catch the exceptions raised by the `parse_duration` function when it encounters malformed input. Upon catching such exceptions, it should raise a `ValidationError` with an error message that accurately describes the issue, informing the user about the incorrect input format. This approach ensures that users receive clear guidance on how to correct their input without encountering a server error. The method should continue to successfully convert valid strings and `datetime.timedelta` objects as before, preserving its existing functionality while enhancing input validation and error handling."
