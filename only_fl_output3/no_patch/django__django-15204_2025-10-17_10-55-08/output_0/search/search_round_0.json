Search for the `DurationField` class in the codebase to understand its structure and methods, specifically `clean`.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"DurationField\")\n   ```\n\n2. Search for the `clean` method within the `DurationField` class to get more details on how it is implemented.\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"clean\", \"DurationField\")\n   ```\n\n3. The exception traceback mentions a failure occurring in the `to_python` method of what seems to be related to the `DurationField` class, located in `django/forms/fields.py`. Let's get more context about that method.\n   ```\n   search_method_in_file(\"to_python\", \"django/forms/fields.py\")\n   ```\n\n4. The traceback also highlights issues during the `parse_duration` call in `django/utils/dateparse.py`. To understand how duration strings are parsed and where the error might be happening, we should look into this method.\n   ```\n   search_method_in_file(\"parse_duration\", \"django/utils/dateparse.py\")\n   ```"
