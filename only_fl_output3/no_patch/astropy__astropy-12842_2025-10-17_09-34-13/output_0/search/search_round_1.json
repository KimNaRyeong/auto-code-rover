        "content": "<issue>No longer able to read BinnedTimeSeries with datetime column saved as ECSV after upgrading from 4.2.1 -> 5.0+\n### Description\nHi, [This commit](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/commit/e807dbff9a5c72bdc42d18c7d6712aae69a0bddc) merged in PR #11569 breaks my ability to read an ECSV file created using Astropy v 4.2.1, BinnedTimeSeries class's write method, which has a datetime64 column. Downgrading astropy back to 4.2.1 fixes the issue because the strict type checking in line 177 of ecsv.py is not there.\nIs there a reason why this strict type checking was added to ECSV? Is there a way to preserve reading and writing of ECSV files created with BinnedTimeSeries across versions? I am happy to make a PR on this if the strict type checking is allowed to be scaled back or we can add datetime64 as an allowed type.\n### Expected behavior\nThe file is read into a `BinnedTimeSeries` object from ecsv file without error.\n### Actual behavior\nValueError is produced and the file is not read because ECSV.py does not accept the datetime64 column.\n`ValueError: datatype 'datetime64' of column 'time_bin_start' is not in allowed values ('bool', 'int8', 'int16', 'int32', 'int64', 'uint8', 'uint16', 'uint32', 'uint64', 'float16', 'float32', 'float64', 'float128', 'string')`\n### Steps to Reproduce\nThe file is read using:\n`BinnedTimeSeries.read('<file_path>', format='ascii.ecsv')`\nwhich gives a long error.\nThe file in question is a binned time series created by  `astropy.timeseries.aggregate_downsample`. which itself is a binned version of an `astropy.timeseries.TimeSeries` instance with some TESS data. (loaded via TimeSeries.from_pandas(Tess.set_index('datetime')). I.e., it has a datetime64 index.  The file was written using the classes own .write method in Astropy V4.2.1 from an instance of said class:\n`myBinnedTimeSeries.write('<file_path>',format='ascii.ecsv',overwrite=True)`\nI'll attach a concatenated version of the file (as it contains private data). However, the relevant part from the header is on line 4:\n```\n# %ECSV 0.9\n# ---\n# datatype:\n# - {name: time_bin_start, datatype: datetime64}\n```\nas you can see, the datatype is datetime64. This works fine with ECSV V0.9 but not V1.0 as some sort of strict type checking was added.\n###\nFull error log:\n```\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\nInput In [3], in <module>\n---> 49 tsrbin = BinnedTimeSeries.read('../Photometry/tsr_bin.dat', format='ascii.ecsv')\nFile ~/Apps/miniconda3/envs/py310_latest/lib/python3.10/site-packages/astropy/timeseries/binned.py:285, in BinnedTimeSeries.read(self, filename, time_bin_start_column, time_bin_end_column, time_bin_size_column, time_bin_size_unit, time_format, time_scale, format, *args, **kwargs)\n230 \"\"\"\n231 Read and parse a file and returns a `astropy.timeseries.BinnedTimeSeries`.\n232\n(...)\n279\n280 \"\"\"\n282 try:\n283\n284     # First we try the readers defined for the BinnedTimeSeries class\n--> 285     return super().read(filename, format=format, *args, **kwargs)\n287 except TypeError:\n288\n289     # Otherwise we fall back to the default Table readers\n291     if time_bin_start_column is None:\nFile ~/Apps/miniconda3/envs/py310_latest/lib/python3.10/site-packages/astropy/table/connect.py:62, in TableRead.__call__(self, *args, **kwargs)\n59 units = kwargs.pop('units', None)\n60 descriptions = kwargs.pop('descriptions', None)\n---> 62 out = self.registry.read(cls, *args, **kwargs)\n64 # For some readers (e.g., ascii.ecsv), the returned `out` class is not\n65 # guaranteed to be the same as the desired output `cls`.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context helps us understand the parts of Astropy affected by the reported issue and frame potential solutions. Here's a breakdown based on the questions:\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\n**Ecsv.py Context**\n- The snippet from `astropy/io/ascii/ecsv.py` provides insight into how Astropy processes ECSV file headers during the column setup phase (`get_cols` function within the `EcsvHeader` class). \n- It performs attribute transfer from YAML metadata to new table columns, and importantly, it includes logic related to data type (`dtype`) handling. \n- Lines 180-186 introduce a check against a predefined list of \"allowed\" data types (`ECSV_DATATYPES`), but unlike previous strict enforcement, the current logic displays a warning for unexpected data types, allowing backward compatibility with older ECSV files using data types like `datetime64`.\n\n**BinnedTimeSeries Class Context**\n- The provided context for the `BinnedTimeSeries` class, especially its `read` method, shows an effort to parse a given file and return an instance of `BinnedTimeSeries`. The method is versatile, intending to handle different format specifiers and making use of column names for time binning.\n- The `read` method uses the unified I/O system in Astropy, firstly attempting to use readers specific to `BinnedTimeSeries` and falling back to default `Table` readers if the former fails due to a `TypeError`.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\n- The error reported in the issue arises while reading an ECSV file containing a `datetime64` data type, which is not explicitly listed in the `ECSV_DATATYPES`. This discrepancy triggers the error during the `EcsvHeader.get_cols` function execution.\n- However, the current implementation in `ecsv.py` shows an allowance for unexpected data types, signaling a move towards improving backward compatibility with older ECSV files. This adjustment seems to conflict with the error encountered by the submitter, implying a misalignment between the expectation (backward compatibility) and actual behavior (error thrown).\n- The `BinnedTimeSeries.read` function details show no direct handling or special case for `datetime64` types or any relevant customization that could bypass the restriction seen in `ecsv.py`.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\n- Ideally, the `get_cols` function should allow for the seamless inclusion of `datetime64` columns, aligning with the commit's apparent intent to warn against, but still permit, non-standard ECSV data types. This functionality should enable users to read ECSV files generated with older versions of Astropy without error, especially for types like `datetime64` used in time series data.\n- For the `BinnedTimeSeries.read` method, even though the error does not directly stem from its logic, it should be robust enough to support reading files with diverse data types, especially given the temporal nature of the data it handles. If necessary, it could include additional checks or preprocessing steps to ensure compatibility with the updated ECSV handling logic.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the analysis, a potential patch could involve ensuring that `datetime64` data types (and potentially other non-standard but commonly used types) are formally recognized or at least safely convertible within the ECSV read process, possibly by updating the `ECSV_DATATYPES` list or modifying the handling logic in `ecsv.py` to enforce the warning system without throwing an error.\n\nAdditionally, verifying that `BinnedTimeSeries` read operations with `datetime64` columns are tested and accounted for in the unit tests would be crucial to prevent regression and ensure consistent behavior across versions."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

The information gathered provides a sufficient understanding to identify the bug location and propose a plan for resolving the issue.\n\n### Where are bug locations:\n\n**Bug Location 1:**\n- **File:** `astropy/io/ascii/ecsv.py`\n- **Class:** `EcsvHeader`\n- **Method:** `get_cols`\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\nThe intended behavior at this location is to modify the logic that checks for allowed `datatype`s in ECSV columns such that `datetime64` is either explicitly allowed or handled in a way that does not prevent files with these column types from being read. This could involve adjusting the `ECSV_DATATYPES` constant to include `datetime64` or refining the logic that triggers the ValueError to instead issue a warning for `datetime64` types, similar to the logic currently described in the comments but not reflected in the encountered behavior. This adjustment will ensure backward compatibility with earlier versions of Astropy that permitted `datetime64` data types in ECSV files, aligning with the error message's indication towards supporting older file versions. \n\nTo resolve the issue while preserving existing functionality, the updated implementation should:\n- Allow `datetime64` columns by adjusting the `ECSV_DATATYPES` list to include this type or by modifying the conditional that results in a `ValueError` to permit `datetime64` as an exceptional case.\n- Ensure that any changes maintain or improve the clarity of error messages and warnings for unsupported types, helping users understand the file format requirements and potential issues without compromising the flexibility introduced in previous versions.\n\nThis approach aims to retain the comprehensive support for scientific data types in Astropy's ECSV handling, recognizing the importance of `datetime64` in time series and other astronomical data sets."
