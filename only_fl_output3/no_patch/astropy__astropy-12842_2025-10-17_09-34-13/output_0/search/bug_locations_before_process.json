        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior at this location is to modify the logic that checks for allowed datatypes in ECSV columns such that datetime64 is either explicitly allowed or handled in a way that does not prevent files with these column types from being read. This could involve adjusting the ECSV_DATATYPES constant to include datetime64 or refining the logic that triggers the ValueError to instead issue a warning for datetime64 types, similar to the logic currently described in the comments but not reflected in the encountered behavior. This adjustment will ensure backward compatibility with earlier versions of Astropy that permitted datetime64 data types in ECSV files, aligning with the error message's indication towards supporting older file versions. To resolve the issue while preserving existing functionality, the updated implementation should: Allow datetime64 columns by adjusting the ECSV_DATATYPES list to include this type or by modifying the conditional that results in a ValueError to permit datetime64 as an exceptional case. Ensure that any changes maintain or improve the clarity of error messages and warnings for unsupported types, helping users understand the file format requirements and potential issues without compromising the flexibility introduced in previous versions. This approach aims to retain the comprehensive support for scientific data types in Astropy's ECSV handling, recognizing the importance of datetime64 in time series and other astronomical data sets."
