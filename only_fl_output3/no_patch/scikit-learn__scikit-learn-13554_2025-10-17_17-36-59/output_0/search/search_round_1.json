See the code snippet below.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy\nimport sklearn.metrics.pairwise\n# create 64-bit vectors a and b that are very similar to each other\na_64 = np.array([61.221637725830078125, 71.60662841796875,    -65.7512664794921875],  dtype=np.float64)\nb_64 = np.array([61.221637725830078125, 71.60894012451171875, -65.72847747802734375], dtype=np.float64)\n# create 32-bit versions of a and b\na_32 = a_64.astype(np.float32)\nb_32 = b_64.astype(np.float32)\n# compute the distance from a to b using numpy, for both 64-bit and 32-bit\ndist_64_np = np.array([np.linalg.norm(a_64 - b_64)], dtype=np.float64)\ndist_32_np = np.array([np.linalg.norm(a_32 - b_32)], dtype=np.float32)\n# compute the distance from a to b using sklearn, for both 64-bit and 32-bit\ndist_64_sklearn = sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances([a_64], [b_64])\ndist_32_sklearn = sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances([a_32], [b_32])\n# note that the 64-bit sklearn results agree exactly with numpy, but the 32-bit results disagree\nnp.set_printoptions(precision=200)\nprint(dist_64_np)\nprint(dist_32_np)\nprint(dist_64_sklearn)\nprint(dist_32_sklearn)\n```\n#### Expected Results\nI expect that the results from sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances would agree with np.linalg.norm for both 64-bit and 32-bit.

The hardcoded amount of additional memory of 10MB is also derived from a benchmark.\nAs a side bonus, this implementation should also support float16 out of the box, should scikit-learn support it at some point.\nAdd a test for numeric precision (see #9354)\nSurprisingly bad precision, isn't it?\nNote that the traditional computation sqrt(sum((x-y)**2)) gets the results exact.\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\n#### What does this implement/fix?

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### `euclidean_distances` Function in `sklearn.metrics.pairwise`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThe function computes the Euclidean distance matrix between each pair of the two collections of inputs. The code snippet provided shows a detailed implementation of how the distance between vectors \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is computed, taking into account efficiency and the possibility of pre-computed norms to speed up calculations. Specifically, it computes distances with the formula \\( \\sqrt{dot(x, x) - 2 \\cdot dot(x, y) + dot(y, y)} \\), which is optimized for sparse data and situations where one of the arguments (`X` or `Y`) remains constant while the other varies.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug**\n\nThe issue reported is centered on the precision discrepancy when dealing with `float32` arrays compared to `float64`. Given that the implementation provided in the snippet supports squared distances and takes pre-computed norms as optional arguments, the point of interest might be around the handling of these inputs and the computation's data type preservation or conversion.\n\n- **Intended behavior**\n\nWhen comparing `float32` inputs, the intended behavior is to preserve numerical accuracy as closely as possible to calculations with `float64`. This means maintaining a balance between efficient computation and numerical precision, avoiding the introduction of significant errors during the distance matrix computation.\n\n#### References to `float32` in the Codebase\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThe search for `float32` instances throughout the sklearn codebase returned numerous hits, indicating a widespread use of this data type across different parts of the library. This includes various models, methods for data manipulation, and internal utilities. These references signify areas where `float32` arrays are either expected, processed, or converted for different uses within the library.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug**\n\nThe fact that `float32` is commonly used across sklearn suggests that there should be established practices for handling `float32` data accurately. The discrepancy in precision with `euclidean_distances` might stem from a lack of adherence to these practices in this specific function or an oversight in handling conversion or computation in a way that preserves precision.\n\n- **Intended behavior**\n\nGiven sklearn's wide use of `float32`, the library should ideally manage this data type in a way that minimizes loss of precision. For numerical computations like distance calculation, it implies the need for mechanisms that either enhance the precision of `float32` computations (perhaps temporarily converting to `float64` when needed) or ensuring that the algorithms are robust against the precision loss inherent in `float32`.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nFrom this analysis, it appears necessary to investigate further into how `euclidean_distances` specifically handles `float32` data during its computations. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explore the benchmarks or tests involving `euclidean_distances` to see if there's any existing awareness or accommodation for precision issues with `float32`. \n\nGiven the collected context, we should focus on sections of the code that might convert or specifically handle `float32` arrays during distance computation. It is essential to review how the algorithm deals with data type conversion, especially concerning pre-computed norms and the final distance calculation. Understanding these mechanisms in detail could reveal potential areas where precision loss occurs and hence provide insight into addressing the reported issue."

The provided information has highlighted the central function (`euclidean_distances` in `sklearn.metrics.pairwise`) where the discrepancy in numeric precision occurs between `float32` and `float64` computations. Given that the core of the issue lies within the handling of data types during the Euclidean distance calculations, particularly how `float32` computations are managed, the next steps involve proposing modifications to enhance numerical precision without compromising efficiency.\n\n2. **Where are bug locations:**\n\n- **Location 1:**\n  - **File:** `sklearn/metrics/pairwise.py`\n  - **Function:** `euclidean_distances`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** To resolve the issue, the function should ensure that when processing `float32` input arrays, the intermediate computations, especially the dot products and subtractions which might exacerbate precision loss due to underflow or overflow, handle `float32` data types in a way that preserves numerical accuracy as closely as possible. This could involve temporarily casting inputs to `float64` for the most sensitive parts of the computation, especially around the dot products and the final distance computation, before possibly casting back to `float32` if needed to match the input types. It's crucial that these enhancements do not significantly degrade the performance of the function for `float64` inputs or alter its expected behavior when handling these more precise data types. Moreover, special care should be taken to ensure that any changes do not introduce backward compatibility issues for existing codebases relying on the current behavior of `sklearn.metrics.pairwise.euclidean_distances`.\n\nThe intended modifications are expected to minimize the precision discrepancy observed when `euclidean_distances` processes `float32` arrays, aligning the results more closely with the precision of `float64` computations and the expectations established by the usage of NumPy's `np.linalg.norm` function. These changes aim to enhance the reliability of scikit-learn's distance metrics for applications requiring or opting to use `float32` data types for memory efficiency or other reasons."
