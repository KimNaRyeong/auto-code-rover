        "content": "<issue>Numerical precision of euclidean_distances with float32\n#### Description\nI noticed that sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances function agrees with np.linalg.norm when using np.float64 arrays, but disagrees when using np.float32 arrays. See the code snippet below.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy\nimport sklearn.metrics.pairwise\n# create 64-bit vectors a and b that are very similar to each other\na_64 = np.array([61.221637725830078125, 71.60662841796875,    -65.7512664794921875],  dtype=np.float64)\nb_64 = np.array([61.221637725830078125, 71.60894012451171875, -65.72847747802734375], dtype=np.float64)\n# create 32-bit versions of a and b\na_32 = a_64.astype(np.float32)\nb_32 = b_64.astype(np.float32)\n# compute the distance from a to b using numpy, for both 64-bit and 32-bit\ndist_64_np = np.array([np.linalg.norm(a_64 - b_64)], dtype=np.float64)\ndist_32_np = np.array([np.linalg.norm(a_32 - b_32)], dtype=np.float32)\n# compute the distance from a to b using sklearn, for both 64-bit and 32-bit\ndist_64_sklearn = sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances([a_64], [b_64])\ndist_32_sklearn = sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances([a_32], [b_32])\n# note that the 64-bit sklearn results agree exactly with numpy, but the 32-bit results disagree\nnp.set_printoptions(precision=200)\nprint(dist_64_np)\nprint(dist_32_np)\nprint(dist_64_sklearn)\nprint(dist_32_sklearn)\n```\n#### Expected Results\nI expect that the results from sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances would agree with np.linalg.norm for both 64-bit and 32-bit. In other words, I expect the following output:\n```\n[ 0.0229059506440019884643266578905240749008953571319580078125]\n[ 0.02290595136582851409912109375]\n[[ 0.0229059506440019884643266578905240749008953571319580078125]]\n[[ 0.02290595136582851409912109375]]\n```\n#### Actual Results\nThe code snippet above produces the following output for me:\n```\n[ 0.0229059506440019884643266578905240749008953571319580078125]\n[ 0.02290595136582851409912109375]\n[[ 0.0229059506440019884643266578905240749008953571319580078125]]\n[[ 0.03125]]\n```\n#### Versions\n```\nDarwin-16.6.0-x86_64-i386-64bit\n('Python', '2.7.11 | 64-bit | (default, Jun 11 2016, 03:41:56) \\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)]')\n('NumPy', '1.11.3')\n('SciPy', '0.19.0')\n('Scikit-Learn', '0.18.1')\n```\n[WIP] Stable and fast float32 implementation of euclidean_distances\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\nFixes #9354\nSuperseds PR #10069\n#### What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.\nThese commits implement a block-wise casting to float64 and uses the older code to compute the euclidean distance matrix on the blocks. This is done useing only a fixed amount of additional (temporary) memory.\n#### Any other comments?\nThis code implements several optimizations:\n* since the distance matrix is symmetric when `X is Y`, copy the blocks of the upper triangle to the lower triangle;\n* compute the optimal block size that would use most of the allowed additional memory;\n* cast blocks of `{X,Y}_norm_squared` to float64;\n* precompute blocks of `X_norm_squared` if not given so it gets reused through the iterations over `Y`;\n* swap `X` and `Y` when `X_norm_squared` is given, but not `Y_norm_squared`.\nNote that all the optimizations listed here have proven useful in a benchmark. The hardcoded amount of additional memory of 10MB is also derived from a benchmark.\nAs a side bonus, this implementation should also support float16 out of the box, should scikit-learn support it at some point.\nAdd a test for numeric precision (see #9354)\nSurprisingly bad precision, isn't it?\nNote that the traditional computation sqrt(sum((x-y)**2)) gets the results exact.\n#### Reference Issues/PRs\n#### What does this implement/fix?

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to the numerical precision of `euclidean_distances` with `float32` in scikit-learn's pairwise distances function, we need to investigate several components of the sklearn library, related to the calculation of Euclidean distances:\n\n1. The `euclidean_distances` function in the `sklearn.metrics.pairwise` to understand its current implementation, especially regarding how it deals with different data types and computes the distance.\n2. Since the issue mentions a specific problem with `float32`, it would be critical to see if there's explicit handling or conversion of data types within the `euclidean_distances` function or any called function therein.\n3. Any utilities related to the computation of norms or squared distances since these are fundamental to the calculation of Euclidean distance.\n\nAccordingly, we should perform the following API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"euclidean_distances\")`: To find the implementation details of the `euclidean_distances` function.\n- `search_code(\"float32\")`: This will help us identify parts of the codebase that explicitly mention `float32`, which could be crucial in understanding how data types are managed within distance computations.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive overview of the parts of the sklearn codebase relevant to addressing the raised issue."
