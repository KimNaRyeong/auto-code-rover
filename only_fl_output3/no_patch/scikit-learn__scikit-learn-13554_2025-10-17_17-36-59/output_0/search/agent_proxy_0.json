The `euclidean_distances` function in the `sklearn.metrics.pairwise` to understand its current implementation, especially regarding how it deals with different data types and computes the distance.\n2. Since the issue mentions a specific problem with `float32`, it would be critical to see if there's explicit handling or conversion of data types within the `euclidean_distances` function or any called function therein.\n3. Any utilities related to the computation of norms or squared distances since these are fundamental to the calculation of Euclidean distance.\n\nAccordingly, we should perform the following API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"euclidean_distances\")`: To find the implementation details of the `euclidean_distances` function.\n- `search_code(\"float32\")`: This will help us identify parts of the codebase that explicitly mention `float32`, which could be crucial in understanding how data types are managed within distance computations.\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive overview of the parts of the sklearn codebase relevant to addressing the raised issue."
