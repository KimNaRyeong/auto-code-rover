        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the function should ensure that when processing float32 input arrays, the intermediate computations, especially the dot products and subtractions which might exacerbate precision loss due to underflow or overflow, handle float32 data types in a way that preserves numerical accuracy as closely as possible. This could involve temporarily casting inputs to float64 for the most sensitive parts of the computation, especially around the dot products and the final distance computation, before possibly casting back to float32 if needed to match the input types. It's crucial that these enhancements do not significantly degrade the performance of the function for float64 inputs or alter its expected behavior when handling these more precise data types. Moreover, special care should be taken to ensure that any changes do not introduce backward compatibility issues for existing codebases relying on the current behavior of sklearn.metrics.pairwise.euclidean_distances."
