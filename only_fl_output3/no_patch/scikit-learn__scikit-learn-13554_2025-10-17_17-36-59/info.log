167     """
168     Considering the rows of X (and Y=X) as vectors, compute the
169     distance matrix between each pair of vectors.
170 
171     For efficiency reasons, the euclidean distance between a pair of row
172     vector x and y is computed as::
173 
174         dist(x, y) = sqrt(dot(x, x) - 2 * dot(x, y) + dot(y, y))
175 
176     This formulation has two advantages over other ways of computing distances.
177     First, it is computationally efficient when dealing with sparse data.
178     Second, if one argument varies but the other remains unchanged, then
179     `dot(x, x)` and/or `dot(y, y)` can be pre-computed.
180 
181     However, this is not the most precise way of doing this computation, and
182     the distance matrix returned by this function may not be exactly
183     symmetric as required by, e.g., ``scipy.spatial.distance`` functions.
