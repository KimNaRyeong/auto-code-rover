This change should include a conditional check to determine if the running Python version supports onexc, and fall back to onerror for older Python versions to maintain backward compatibility."

Adding this method would address the compatibility issue with the new addDuration API in Python 3.12, ensuring that no warnings are triggered when TestCaseFunction instances are used as test result objects, particularly when running tests with warnings treated as errors (-We). The implementation should seamlessly integrate with the existing mechanisms for handling and reporting test outcomes."
