Something in Pytest's temp path fixtures calls an `rm_rf` function which calls `rmtree` with the `onerror` parameter. https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/6dcd652d4a55bacda01a15017e155caa816e15a5/src/_pytest/pathlib.py#L147 When warnings are treated as errors, this makes pytest fail any test using temp paths.\nAdd `addDuration` to `TestCaseFunction`\ncpython 3.12  (alpha) has added an `addDuration` API to test results (python/cpython#12271).\nThis would not be an issue, except it was designed to trigger a warning if the test result doesn't have such a method (hence e.g. python/cpython#103309). This means when using pytest as runner for unittest tests *and* running `-We` an error is triggered as pytest's test result (which seems to be `TestCaseFunction`) does not support this protocol.\nNow obviously this should be non-blocking, as hopefully nobody is running CI which blocks on testing 3.12, but there you go, I figure an early forewarning can't hurt.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we should focus on gathering more context around the `rm_rf` function call and the `TestCaseFunction` class mentioned in the issue description.\n\nFirstly, we need to investigate the `rm_rf` function that calls `rmtree` with the `onerror` parameter, as described in the issue. The GitHub link directs us to a specific line in `pathlib.py`, which will help us find the surrounding code context and see if there's a straightforward way to adapt it to use the new `onexc` parameter. Since we know the file and the approximate code vicinity, we can make targeted queries:\n\n```plaintext\n1. get_code_around_line(\"src/_pytest/pathlib.py\", 147, 10)\n```\n\nThis would provide us with enough context around the usage of `rmtree` within the `rm_rf` function, allowing us to understand how it's currently implemented and think about how to modify it for Python 3.12 compatibility.\n\nSecondly, to adapt pytest to support the new `addDuration` API in Python 3.12 for test results, we should get more context around the `TestCaseFunction` class, specifically if and how it interacts with test result reporting mechanisms. Since `TestCaseFunction` is likely to be crucial in this context, understanding its structure and current methods will be essential:\n\n```plaintext\n1. search_class(\"TestCaseFunction\")\n```\n\nThis query will help us find where the class is defined within the pytest codebase. However, since `TestCaseFunction` may not directly deal with test result objects in a way that's relevant to adding support for `addDuration`, but it's worth starting from understanding this class's role in the pytest architecture.\n\nAs a next step, depending on what's found from these initial queries, we might need further information on how pytest's test results are structured or how `TestCaseFunction` interacts with them. This could include looking into how test duration is currently recorded or integrated into test reports within pytest."

        "content": "### Analysis of `rm_rf` Function Context\n\n#### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe provided code snippet from `src/_pytest/pathlib.py` defines a function `rm_rf` which is intended to remove a file path recursively. The function first converts the provided path into an extended-length path format for compatibility with long paths on Windows. It then defines a partial `onerror` function, `on_rm_rf_error`, which presumably handles any errors occurring during the recursive deletion process. This partial function is passed along with the path to `shutil.rmtree`, which performs the actual recursive deletion.\n\n#### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe relevant part of the issue mentions that with Python 3.12 alpha, the `onerror` parameter in `shutil.rmtree` has been deprecated and replaced with `onexc`. Since the `rm_rf` function in `_pytest/pathlib.py` uses `shutil.rmtree` with the `onerror` parameter, this code will trigger a `DeprecationWarning` in Python 3.12, potentially causing test failures when warnings are treated as errors.\n\n#### 3. What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior of `rm_rf` is to safely and recursively delete a path, handling any errors that occur in the process using a custom error handler. With the upcoming changes in Python 3.12, this function should adapt to use the new `onexc` argument for error handling instead of `onerror` while preserving its existing error-handling functionality.\n\n### Analysis of `TestCaseFunction` Class Context\n\n#### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `TestCaseFunction` class, found within `src/_pytest/unittest.py`, appears to be a pytest wrapper around a unittest test case. It inherits from a parent `Function` class (not shown) and overrides or defines methods for setup, teardown, handling test results, and running the test. These methods, such as `addError`, `addFailure`, `addSkip`, etc., suggest that `TestCaseFunction` is involved in hooking into the test lifecycle to report on test outcomes.\n\n#### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nOne of the issues mentioned is that CPython 3.12 introduces an `addDuration` method to test results, designed to emit a warning if not implemented; since this addition is recent, `TestCaseFunction` does not support this new method. Given `TestCaseFunction`'s role in handling test results and reporting, the lack of an `addDuration` method means that it is not fully compatible with the new test results API introduced in CPython 3.12, potentially leading to warnings or errors when running tests under certain conditions (like with `-We` flag).\n\n#### 3. What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nTo resolve the compatibility issue with Python 3.12, `TestCaseFunction` should be extended to implement the `addDuration` method, allowing it to properly record and report the duration of test execution as part of the test results. This would keep pytest test execution behavior consistent and avoid any warnings regarding the missing `addDuration` functionality when using newer Python versions.\n\n---\n\nGiven the analysis, the next steps would involve modifying the `rm_rf` function in `_pytest/pathlib.py` to replace the deprecated `onerror` parameter with `onexc`, ensuring backward compatibility with earlier Python versions where applicable. For `TestCaseFunction`, introducing an `addDuration` method that integrates with the existing test result reporting mechanisms would address the second part of the reported issue."
