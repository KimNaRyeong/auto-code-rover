        "content": "<issue>Use of `rmtree` causes `DeprecationWarning` on Python 3.12 alpha\nThe current Python 3.12 alpha has made a change to `rmtree` https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/102828, deprecating the `onerror` parameter and replacing it with an `onexc` parameter. Something in Pytest's temp path fixtures calls an `rm_rf` function which calls `rmtree` with the `onerror` parameter. https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/6dcd652d4a55bacda01a15017e155caa816e15a5/src/_pytest/pathlib.py#L147 When warnings are treated as errors, this makes pytest fail any test using temp paths.\nAdd `addDuration` to `TestCaseFunction`\ncpython 3.12  (alpha) has added an `addDuration` API to test results (python/cpython#12271).\nThis would not be an issue, except it was designed to trigger a warning if the test result doesn't have such a method (hence e.g. python/cpython#103309). This means when using pytest as runner for unittest tests *and* running `-We` an error is triggered as pytest's test result (which seems to be `TestCaseFunction`) does not support this protocol.\nNow obviously this should be non-blocking, as hopefully nobody is running CI which blocks on testing 3.12, but there you go, I figure an early forewarning can't hurt.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we should focus on gathering more context around the `rm_rf` function call and the `TestCaseFunction` class mentioned in the issue description.\n\nFirstly, we need to investigate the `rm_rf` function that calls `rmtree` with the `onerror` parameter, as described in the issue. The GitHub link directs us to a specific line in `pathlib.py`, which will help us find the surrounding code context and see if there's a straightforward way to adapt it to use the new `onexc` parameter. Since we know the file and the approximate code vicinity, we can make targeted queries:\n\n```plaintext\n1. get_code_around_line(\"src/_pytest/pathlib.py\", 147, 10)\n```\n\nThis would provide us with enough context around the usage of `rmtree` within the `rm_rf` function, allowing us to understand how it's currently implemented and think about how to modify it for Python 3.12 compatibility.\n\nSecondly, to adapt pytest to support the new `addDuration` API in Python 3.12 for test results, we should get more context around the `TestCaseFunction` class, specifically if and how it interacts with test result reporting mechanisms. Since `TestCaseFunction` is likely to be crucial in this context, understanding its structure and current methods will be essential:\n\n```plaintext\n1. search_class(\"TestCaseFunction\")\n```\n\nThis query will help us find where the class is defined within the pytest codebase. However, since `TestCaseFunction` may not directly deal with test result objects in a way that's relevant to adding support for `addDuration`, but it's worth starting from understanding this class's role in the pytest architecture.\n\nAs a next step, depending on what's found from these initial queries, we might need further information on how pytest's test results are structured or how `TestCaseFunction` interacts with them. This could include looking into how test duration is currently recorded or integrated into test reports within pytest."
