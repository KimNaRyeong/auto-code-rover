Based on your request, I'm crafting a `reproducer.py` that correctly aligns with the given problem specifications. The script aims to demonstrate the issue where `JSONField.bound_data` raises a `TypeError` when the data is `None`, as described in the provided error scenario.

```python
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.forms import Form, JSONField

# Setup minimal Django settings
settings.configure(
    DEBUG=True,
    SECRET_KEY='a-random-secret-key',
    INSTALLED_APPS=[
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.messages',
    ],
)

django.setup()

class JSONForm(Form):
    json_field = JSONField(required=False)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        form = JSONForm({})
        output = form.as_p()
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exiting with error code 1 to indicate an issue.
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    
    print("The test executed successfully without raising the issue.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exiting with code 0 to indicate success/no issue detected.
```

This script, when executed in the appropriate environment, is designed to:

1. Instantiate a Django form (`JSONForm`) including a `JSONField` that is not required.
2. Execute with the expectation that this form instantiation should not result in an exception, specifically not a `TypeError` saying the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not `NoneType`, as described in the issue.
3. Utilize the `print_stacktrace()` function to capture and display the exception details clearly, with line numbers from the traceback, if the error occurs.
4. Exit with code 1 if the specified issue is encountered, providing clear signal for further investigation or acknowledgment that the issue is present; otherwise, exit with code 0 to indicate the absence of the issue.

**Note**: Ensure Django is installed and properly configured in your environment before executing this script. This script is standalone and meant for demonstration in a controlled setting. Adjustments might be required to align with specific project configurations or Django versions that have not been accounted for here.
