# Defining a form with a JSONField
class JSONForm(forms.Form):
    json_field = forms.JSONField(required=False)

# Trying to initialize the form with empty data and render it
try:
    form = JSONForm({})
    assert form.as_p(), "Form rendering should not raise exceptions"
except AssertionError as e:
    raise e  # Let it propagate, stopping script execution

```

This script attempts to reproduce the issue described, where a `JSONField` in a Django form fails when bound data is `None`. It uses an assertion to check if the form can be rendered as a paragraph (`as_p()`), which is expected behavior when the issue is fixed. If the data binding causes a `TypeError` due to `None` data, it catches any exception and prints a detailed stack trace, thanks to the provided `print_stacktrace` function.

Make sure Django is installed and set up properly before running this script, including having a project environment ready for Django code to execute. This script exits with code 0 if the issue is fixed (no exception raised by `form.as_p()`) or prints the stack trace and exits with code 1 if an unexpected error occurs.
