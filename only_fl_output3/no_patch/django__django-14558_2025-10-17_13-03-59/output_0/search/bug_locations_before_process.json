        "intended_behavior": "The `bound_data` method should include an additional condition to gracefully handle cases where `data` is `None`. Given the context that a `JSONField` can be optional (`required=False`), it's reasonable to expect `None` as a potential input. The intended behavior would be to return `None` immediately if `data` is `None`, before it attempts to decode the data as JSON. This change would prevent the `TypeError` from being raised when a bound form is rendered without a provided value for the `JSONField`, thus preserving existing functionality for cases where `data` is provided and is valid JSON."
