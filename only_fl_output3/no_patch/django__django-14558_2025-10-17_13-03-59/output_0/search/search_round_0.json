        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue related to the `JSONField` in a Django project when bound data is `None`, we would target the following areas based on the given description:\n\n1. Search for the `JSONField` class in the codebase, as it's directly mentioned in the issue.\n2. Since `JSONField` is likely part of a form, it's also useful to find where `JSONField` is used within forms, or any method that handles its data, especially methods that deal with binding or validating data.\n3. Given that the issue mentions a `TypeError` related to the handling of `None` values, we should look for any methods or functions that handle the conversion or validation of JSON data within `JSONField`.\n4. The description references a pull request by @AlexHill for fixing this issue, but since we're gathering context rather than immediately applying a fix, we'll focus on the current state in the codebase.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are the appropriate API calls to make:\n\n- `search_class(\"JSONField\")`: This will help us find the definition of `JSONField` to see how it is implemented.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"bound_data\", \"JSONField\")`: Since the issue occurs when a bound form with no value for `JSONField` is rendered, this method could be directly involved in the issue.\n- `search_code(\"form = JSONForm({})\")`: This could help us find examples or tests in the codebase that showcase how `JSONForm` or `JSONField` is intended to be used, possibly highlighting where the breakdown occurs with `None` values.\n\nThese calls should provide enough context to understand how `JSONField` handles data binding and where the type error with `None` values could be originating from within the codebase."
