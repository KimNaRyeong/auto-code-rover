Search for the `JSONField` class in the codebase, as it's directly mentioned in the issue.\n2. Since `JSONField` is likely part of a form, it's also useful to find where `JSONField` is used within forms, or any method that handles its data, especially methods that deal with binding or validating data.\n3. Given that the issue mentions a `TypeError` related to the handling of `None` values, we should look for any methods or functions that handle the conversion or validation of JSON data within `JSONField`.\n4. The description references a pull request by @AlexHill for fixing this issue, but since we're gathering context rather than immediately applying a fix, we'll focus on the current state in the codebase.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are the appropriate API calls to make:\n\n- `search_class(\"JSONField\")`: This will help us find the definition of `JSONField` to see how it is implemented.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"bound_data\", \"JSONField\")`: Since the issue occurs when a bound form with no value for `JSONField` is rendered, this method could be directly involved in the issue.\n- `search_code(\"form = JSONForm({})\")`: This could help us find examples or tests in the codebase that showcase how `JSONForm` or `JSONField` is intended to be used, possibly highlighting where the breakdown occurs with `None` values.\n\nThese calls should provide enough context to understand how `JSONField` handles data binding and where the type error with `None` values could be originating from within the codebase."

        "content": "### Collected Context Analysis\n\n#### 1. `JSONField` in `django/forms/fields.py`\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**  \nThis `JSONField` class extends `CharField` and is designed for handling JSON data in forms. It includes methods such as `to_python`, `bound_data`, `prepare_value`, and `has_changed`, which are responsible for converting, validating, and preparing JSON data for forms.\n\n**Relationship to the bug?**  \nThe bug specifically occurs in the `bound_data` method of this class when a bound form with a `JSONField` that has no value provided is rendered, leading to a crash. The `bound_data` method attempts to load the data as JSON, but does not handle `None` gracefully, which is the cause of the `TypeError`.\n\n**Intended Behavior?**  \nWhen no value is provided (i.e., `data` is `None`), the method should not raise an exception. Instead, it should likely return `None` or a default value that indicates no data was provided, especially considering the field is not required (`required=False`). This would allow the form to render without crashing when the JSON data is missing.\n\n#### 2. `bound_data` method in `JSONField`\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**  \nThe `bound_data` method in `JSONField` checks if the field is disabled and returns the initial data if it is. If not disabled, it tries to load the `data` string as JSON using `json.loads`, catching `json.JSONDecodeError` if the data is not valid JSON and returning an instance of `InvalidJSONInput` instead.\n\n**Relationship to the bug?**  \nThe issue occurs within this method when `data` is `None`, leading to an unhandled `TypeError` because `json.loads` expects a string-like object, not `None`. The bug directly arises from the absence of a check for `None` before attempting to decode the JSON.\n\n**Intended Behavior?**  \nThe method should handle the case where `data` is `None` by either returning `None` or some other marker that can be recognized as representing no data, without trying to decode it as JSON. This behavior would align with the flexibility usually expected in dynamic form fields, especially for optional fields.\n\n### Next Steps for Additional Context\n\nGiven the analysis, the next steps might include:\n- Checking how invalid or missing data is typically handled in similar fields or forms within Django to ensure consistency. This could involve searching for patterns in error handling across the form fields.\n- Looking into how the `InvalidJSONInput` object that the method potentially returns is handled elsewhere in the codebase to ensure that the proposed solution aligns with existing error-handling patterns.\n- Since the search for `form = JSONForm({})` returned no results, it might be useful to verify the initialization of forms that contain optional `JSONField` instances, possibly by searching for documentation or examples within the codebase that use `JSONField` in a `Form`. This could involve a more generic search for instances of `JSONForm` or `Form` declarations.\n\nThese additional insights would provide clarity on the standard practices within Django for handling similar situations, which can inform the proposed fix to ensure it is robust and consistent with the rest of the framework."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

Given the context that a `JSONField` can be optional (`required=False`), it's reasonable to expect `None` as a potential input. The intended behavior would be to return `None` immediately if `data` is `None`, before it attempts to decode the data as JSON. This change would prevent the `TypeError` from being raised when a bound form is rendered without a provided value for the `JSONField`, thus preserving existing functionality for cases where `data` is provided and is valid JSON.\n   \n   Specifically, before the try block where `json.loads(data, cls=self.decoder)` is called, add a check:\n   ```python\n   if data is None:\n       return data\n   ```\n   This ensures that when no data is present, the method returns `None` without attempting to parse it as JSON, thus avoiding the `TypeError` and maintaining consistency in the handling of optional fields."
