        "intended_behavior": "The `savefig` method should ensure that when `bbox_inches=\"tight\"` is specified, the layout settings (including `layout='compressed'` from `subplot_mosaic`) are consistently applied or re-evaluated for each save operation. This involves potentially re-applying or checking that the compressed layout settings are maintained when calculating the tight bounding box for the figure. The method should not overwrite or ignore these layout settings after the first save, ensuring that subsequent saves with the same parameters produce identically laid out figures. This fix must preserve `savefig`'s existing functionality for figures not using `layout='compressed'`, maintaining backward compatibility."

        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior of the `subplot_mosaic` method when used with `layout='compressed'` is to properly initialize or set up the figure layout so that its settings are robust against multiple calls to `savefig` with `bbox_inches=\"tight\"`. If necessary, modifications or additional flags might be introduced to ensure that layout preferences are preserved or re-applied correctly during each save. The method should ensure that layout settings, particularly those affecting the figure's bounding box and aspect ratios, are consistently respected across saves. Any adjustments made to achieve this should not disrupt the method's existing ability to create and manage complex layout arrangements."
