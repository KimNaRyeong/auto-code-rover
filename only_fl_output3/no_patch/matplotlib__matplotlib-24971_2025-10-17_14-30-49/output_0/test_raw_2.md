Based on your requirement, it seems like there might have been a misunderstanding about the execution outcome of the previously provided code. If the execution of the provided script did not reproduce the issue and exited with code 0, that suggests the script did not encounter the problem as described, possibly indicating the issue has been resolved, or it wasn't triggered by the script's conditions.

However, if further adjustments or another attempt is desired to ensure the scenario is accurately tested, considering additional verification steps or refining the test conditions could be necessary. Given your instructions, the initial approach seems aligned with your request.

If the intention is to retry under possibly overlooked conditions or misinterpretation, hereâ€™s an amendment to the script, focusing more on explicitly comparing the bounding boxes (or layout dimensions) to ensure differences are caught at a layout level rather than pixel-level image comparison, which might not be reliable if the issue is subtle or manifest differently:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def get_image_bbox(image_path):
    from PIL import Image

    with Image.open(image_path) as img:
        return img.getbbox()

def reproduce_issue_and_check_bbox():
    import matplotlib
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    arr = np.arange(100).reshape((10, 10))

    matplotlib.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use'] = True

    fig, ax_dict = plt.subplot_mosaic('AB;AC', figsize=(6, 9), width_ratios=[3, 2],
                                      layout='compressed')

    for key in ["B", "C"]:
        ax_dict[key].imshow(arr)

    fig.savefig("test1.png", bbox_inches="tight")
    bbox1 = get_image_bbox("test1.png")

    # Potential fix or investigation step
    # Force the figure to recalculate the layout by drawing
    fig.canvas.draw()

    fig.savefig("test2.png", bbox_inches="tight")
    bbox2 = get_image_bbox("test2.png")

    if bbox1 != bbox2:
        raise AssertionError(f"The bounding boxes differ: {bbox1} vs {bbox2}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue_and_check_bbox()
        print("No issue detected: both bounding boxes are identical.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code to indicate failure
```

This version of the script incorporates a check for the bounding box sizes of the images saved, which may better target the issue's nature as described. By comparing bounding boxes instead of direct pixel comparison, it aims to catch discrepancies in layout/dimensions directly influenced by the layout processing, possibly providing a closer assessment towards the reported bug's specifics.
