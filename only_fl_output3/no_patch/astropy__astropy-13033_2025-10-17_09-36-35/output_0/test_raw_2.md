It seems there was a misunderstanding regarding my previous response, so I'll generate the `reproducer.py` again with the assumption that proper environment setup will be addressed before running it. Remember, the script depends on having Astropy, Numpy, and their dependencies correctly installed and set up in your Python environment.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

try:
    import numpy as np
    from astropy.time import Time
    from astropy.timeseries import TimeSeries
except ImportError as import_error:
    print(f"Required modules are not installed: {import_error}", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error status due to missing dependencies

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        time = Time(np.arange(100000, 100003), format='jd')
        ts = TimeSeries(time=time, data={"flux": [99.9, 99.8, 99.7]})
        ts._required_columns = ["time", "flux"]
        ts.remove_column("flux")
        # If execution reaches this point without exception, it indicates the bug is unresolved.
        assert False, "The issue is still present. Required column check failed silently."
    except ValueError as e:
        if "expected 'time' as the first columns but found 'time'" in str(e):
            # This error message indicates the incorrect/unclear behavior described in the issue.
            print_stacktrace(e)
        else:
            # If a different message is encountered, it's assumed the issue might be addressed.
            print("An expected exception was raised, but the message differs. Please review if the issue is resolved.")
            sys.exit(0)  # Exit gracefully assuming the issue might be resolved or behavior changed.
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "An unexpected error occurred, which needs further investigation."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Be sure to have `numpy` and `astropy` installed in your Python environment before running this script. If they are not installed, you can install them using `pip`:

```sh
pip install numpy astropy
```

This script is designed to check for the specific error message mentioned in your issue description. If the error message is the expected one ("expected 'time' as the first columns but found 'time'"), it will print the stack trace. Otherwise, if the error message has changed (or if the code does not raise an error), it may indicate that the issue has been fixed or its nature has changed, and it exits with code 0 assuming a potential resolution.
