        "content": "To resolve the issue, we need to gather more information about how the `TimeSeries` class and its `remove_column` method are implemented, especially in the context of handling required columns. The issue describes a problem with handling exceptions when trying to remove columns that are deemed required. Here are the targeted API calls to gather necessary information:\n\n1. **Search for the `TimeSeries` class**: This will help us understand the overall structure of the class and potentially where required columns are checked.\n   - `search_class(\"TimeSeries\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `remove_column` method within the `TimeSeries` class**: Since the issue occurs when the `remove_column` method is called, we need to see its implementation to understand how it deals with required columns.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"remove_column\", \"TimeSeries\")`\n\n3. **Search for where `_required_columns` is used**: This could give us insights into how required columns are defined and managed, which is crucial for understanding the background of the issue.\n   - `search_code(\"_required_columns\")`"
