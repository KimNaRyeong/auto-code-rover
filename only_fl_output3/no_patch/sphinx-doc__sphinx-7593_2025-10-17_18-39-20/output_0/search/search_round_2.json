The specific feature request is about enhancing the handling of the `:kbd:` role to produce nested `<kbd>` HTML elements for representing key combinations, aligning with best practices for web documentation. Given this context, let's plan our search API calls to gather enough information for developing a solution. \n\nFirst, we need to find where in the Sphinx codebase the `:kbd:` role is processed and converted into `<kbd>` HTML elements. Given that Sphinx is a large project with a structured codebase, it's likely that roles like `:kbd:` are handled in a specific module or class dedicated to roles or reStructuredText parsing.\n\n1. To find the relevant class or module, we can start by searching for the code that handles the `:kbd:` role specifically.\n   - `search_code(\":kbd:\")`\n\n2. Once we've identified the module or class related to the processing of roles like `:kbd:`, we can look for methods within that class that are responsible for the transformation of the role into HTML.\n   - This step requires the outcome of the first step, and depending on what we find, we might use:\n     - `search_method_in_class(method_name: str, class_name: str)`\n\n3. If we identify any specific file names from the first search operation, it might be beneficial to explore those files for additional context or related code snippets that could inform our solution.\n   - Depending on the outputs of the initial search, we might use calls like:\n     - `search_code_in_file(code_str: str, file_path: str)`\n\nThis approach will provide a foundation upon which to understand how Sphinx currently handles `:kbd:` roles and to begin architecting a patch for nested `<kbd>` element support."

Sphinx uses roles to enrich text with semantic meaning, and these roles are processed by specific functions or methods during the document generation phase.\n\nHere are some alternative approaches to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Since Sphinx is an extensible tool, it's possible that roles are handled through a generic mechanism or via a plugin system. We should look for the general mechanism Sphinx uses for processing roles or extending functionality.\n   \n   - **Search for the role registration or handling mechanism**: Sphinx documentation and custom roles are likely managed through a registration system or a handler that processes each role.\n     - `search_method(\"add_role\")`\n     - `search_method(\"role\")`\n\n2. Sphinx generates HTML from reStructuredText, so there should be parts of the code specifically dedicated to the HTML transformation process.\n   \n   - **Search for the document transformation process or HTML builder functionality**: This would likely involve classes or methods that are a part of the output generation phase, specifically the HTML generation.\n     - `search_class(\"HTMLWriter\")`\n     - `search_class(\"HTMLBuilder\")`\n\n3. The issue suggests that the desired behavior could be implemented by parsing the value of the `:kbd:` role differently. Therefore, we can also look for the parsing mechanism that processes the content of roles.\n   \n   - **Search for the parsing mechanism**: Look for classes or methods related to parsing reStructuredText or handling the text within roles.\n     - `search_method(\"parse_role\")`\n     - `search_method(\"parse_text\")`\n\nThese alternative searches aim to identify the points in the Sphinx codebase where roles are registered and processed, how HTML output is generated, and how the content within roles is parsed.

        "content": "Analyzing the retrieved context:\n\n1. **`add_role` in `sphinx/application.py`:**\n   - **What it does:** This function registers a Docutils role with Sphinx. It receives a role name and a role function, which is used to process text marked with this role during the Sphinx build process. It also has an override mechanism to replace an already registered role.\n   - **Relationship to the bug:** Since the issue involves enhancing the functionality of the `:kbd:` role to support nested `<kbd>` HTML elements, this method's relevance lies in understanding how roles are registered within Sphinx. Any enhancement or modification to the `:kbd:` role would likely require interaction with this registration process.\n   - **Intended behavior related to the issue:** While the `add_role` method itself may not require modification, understanding its mechanics is crucial for possibly extending or altering the `:kbd:` role's processing function to achieve nested `<kbd>` output.\n\n2. **`role` methods in various files (`sphinx/domains/__init__.py` and `sphinx/ext/extlinks.py`):**\n   - **What they do:** These functions seem to handle role processing in different contexts. The one in `domains/__init__.py` likely deals with roles within Sphinx's domain system, allowing roles to be scoped within a domain (e.g., Python, C++, etc.). The `extlinks.py` role function processes custom external links defined by the user.\n   - **Relationship to the bug:** Although these functions show how Sphinx processes roles, the direct relevance to the `:kbd:` role issue is slightly indirect. They serve as examples or points of reference for understanding how custom role processing is implemented and might offer insights into how to approach modifying or extending the `:kbd:` role.\n   - **Intended behavior related to the issue:** To address the issue, one possible approach involves creating or modifying a role processing function for `:kbd:` that generates nested `<kbd>` elements. Studying these implementations can guide how to structure such a function.\n\n3. **`HTMLWriter` in `sphinx/writers/html.py`:**\n   - **What it does:** `HTMLWriter` is a class that likely oversees converting the document tree (which Sphinx works with internally) into HTML output. This includes taking processed roles and other directives and rendering them as HTML elements.\n   - **Relationship to the bug:** This class is central to the issue since the modification needed for the `:kbd:` role involves the HTML output specifically. Any changes to how Sphinx generates HTML for the `:kbd:` role would likely be implemented or be relevant to this class.\n   - **Intended behavior related to the issue:** Ideally, this class (or related processing functions within the HTML generation process) would be where the logic for translating the `:kbd:` role into nested `<kbd>` elements is implemented, maintaining existing functionality while adding the new nested elements feature.\n\n**Summary:**\nTo resolve the issue, a potential solution involves identifying or creating a specific role processing function for `:kbd:` that generates the desired nested `<kbd>` HTML structure. This function would then need to be registered appropriately with Sphinx, ensuring it's used during the HTML generation process overseen by `HTMLWriter` or related components. Thus, while direct modification may not be required in the `add_role` and `HTMLWriter` functions, understanding their operation and context is crucial for developing and integrating the solution."

The need is to develop a strategy for resolving the issue based on the current understanding.\n\n### Bug Locations and Intended Behaviors\n\n1. **Location**: Not exactly a \"bug\" in its traditional sense, but rather a feature extension. However, for the purpose of this task, the relevant file and class where modifications or additions are likely required is:\n   - **File**: `sphinx/writers/html.py`\n   - **Class**: `HTMLWriter`\n   - **Method/Functionality to Add or Modify**: Not specified in the search results, but an addition is likely needed in the way Sphinx handles the `:kbd:` role specifically when generating HTML output. This could either be a modification within an existing method responsible for rendering roles to HTML or the introduction of a new method specifically for handling the `:kbd:` role in a more nuanced manner.\n   \n   - **Intended Behavior**:\n     - Introduce or modify logic within the `HTMLWriter` class (or a related component responsible for processing roles for HTML output) to detect and appropriately process the `:kbd:` role values, splitting the keystroke sequences into separate or nested `<kbd>` elements, following the specification described in the issue.\n     - The solution should ensure that the `:kbd:` role can still be used in its simple form (`:kbd:`Control-x Control-f``) for a single `<kbd>` element grouping but also support a syntax (possibly via a directive or a specific delimiter) that indicates when the keystrokes should be broken into nested `<kbd>` elements.\n     - This behavior should be implemented in such a way that it does not break or alter the existing functionality of the Sphinx documentation build process. It should only enhance the rendering of the `:kbd:` role when specified.\n\n2. **Registration of Enhanced `:kbd:` Role Processing**:\n   - Since no specific file or class was identified for directly handling the `:kbd:` role registration and definition, the understanding is that the registration might still happen through the general mechanisms provided by Sphinx for extending or modifying role processing, as seen in the `add_role` function within:\n     - **File**: `sphinx/application.py`\n     - **Method**: `add_role`\n     \n   - **Intended Behavior**:\n     - Utilize the `add_role` method to register the enhanced handling of the `:kbd:` role once it is developed. This may involve specifying a new role processing function that includes logic for breaking down the keystroke sequence into nested `<kbd>` elements as required.\n     - This registration should ensure backward compatibility and not conflict with existing roles or Sphinx functionality.\n\nIn summary, the resolution involves enhancing how Sphinx processes the `:kbd:` role for HTML output, requiring modifications or additions in handling roles and their HTML representation, specifically within the context of how `HTMLWriter` (or closely related components/classes) generates the output from reStructuredText with the `:kbd:` role."
