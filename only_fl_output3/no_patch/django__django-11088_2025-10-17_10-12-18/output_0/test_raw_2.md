Given the constraints and requirements, I'm providing a revised Python script that aims to closely reproduce the issue within a standalone script. This script tries to emulate the Django migration process concerning `BinaryField` default value changes and their reversal.

Please note that for a more simplified and constrained emulation, the script will interact with Django's ORM and migration system programmatically. Ideally, this should be run in an environment where Django is installed, and set up with a project configuration similar to what's described in the issue.

```python
"""
reproducer.py
-------------
Reproduces the issue where default value modification on a BinaryField from '' to b'' causes migration reverse failure.

    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

settings.configure(
    DATABASES={

django.setup()

# Define initial model
class TableOne(models.Model):
    field1 = models.BinaryField(default='')

# Programmatic migration to simulate issue reproduction.
try:
    # Initial migration
    call_command('makemigrations', '__main__', interactive=False, verbosity=3)
    call_command('migrate', '__main__', interactive=False, verbosity=3)

    # Modify model inside the try block to catch exceptions if they occur during the process.
    # This change simulates editing the models.py file between migrations
    TableOne._meta.get_field('field1').default = b''

    # Second migration after modifying the default
    call_command('makemigrations', '__main__', interactive=False, verbosity=3)
    call_command('migrate', '__main__', interactive=False, verbosity=3)

    # Now, attempt to reverse the migration
    call_command('migrate', '__main__', 'zero', interactive=False, verbosity=3)

    print("The issue did not occur. Migration reversal was successful.")

except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    assert False, "The issue occurred. Please check the traceback."

```

This script adjusts the model in place to simulate changing the default value of the `BinaryField`. The attempt to reverse the migration after changing the default to a byte string (from an empty string) is supposed to trigger the described issue, which should be evident through the raised exception. If the migration reversal fails due to the issue, the script will print the stack trace for diagnostic purposes.

Please note:

- This script uses SQLite as the database for simplicity. You should adjust database settings if you aim to replicate the issue with PostgreSQL or another database.
- Always run such scripts in a controlled, test, or development environment to avoid any unintended database alterations.
- Since the script dynamically simulates migrations based on model changes within the script itself, this doesn't represent a common real-world Django workflow.
