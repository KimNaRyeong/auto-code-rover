When a BinaryField is encountered, the method should ensure that its default is correctly set as a binary type (b'') instead of a string (''). This would involve checking the field's type and, if it is BinaryField, ensuring the default value is processed as a bytes object. This change respects the existing functionality by allowing BinaryField to have a more appropriate effective default that matches its expected data type, thus preventing the type mismatch error during migrations."

        "intended_behavior": "The BinaryField definition should be updated to include validation logic for its default value directly within its initialization or through overriding the get_default method. The goal is to coerce or flag invalid default values (like non-binary strings) at the point of field definition. Specifically, if a non-binary default is set ('' instead of b''), the field initialization should either coerce this into a binary default or raise an informative error. This proactive validation approach ensures that the field's requirements are enforced consistently across different parts of the Django framework, including model definition and migration generation."
