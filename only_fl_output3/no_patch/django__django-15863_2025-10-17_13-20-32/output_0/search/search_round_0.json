Decimal numbers are converted to float instead.\nPull request is prepared \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/15863\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather enough context for resolving the issue related to the `floatformat` template filter improperly handling `Decimal` numbers in Django, the following API calls are necessary:\n\n1. Investigate the implementation of `floatformat` to understand how it currently handles `Decimal` and `float` types:\n   - `search_method(\"floatformat\")`\n\n2. Since the issue description mentions that `Decimal` numbers are converted to `float`, which leads to precision loss, it's crucial to examine the actual code segment where this conversion happens:\n   - `search_code(\"Decimal to float conversion\")`\n\n3. The issue description does not specify the exact location or file where the erroneous code resides, but it\u2019s likely to be within the Django template filters or a closely related module. Since `floatformat` is a template filter, it should be in the Django templates' backends. However, without the specific filename, we'll initially search across the whole project and narrow it down based on the results:\n   - `search_code(\"{{ value|floatformat\")` \n\nThese calls aim to uncover the precise location of the bug and how `floatformat` is implemented to address the issue effectively.\n"
