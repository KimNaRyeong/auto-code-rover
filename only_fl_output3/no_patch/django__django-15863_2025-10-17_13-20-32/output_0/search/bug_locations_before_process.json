        "intended_behavior": "The `floatformat` method's intended behavior is to format a number to a specified number of decimal places without losing precision on `Decimal` inputs. This involves preserving the exact numeric value specified by the user throughout the formatting process, especially when the input is a `Decimal`.\n\nTo resolve the issue while preserving existing functionality, the handling of `Decimal` inputs should be updated in a way that avoids converting them to floats altogether. This means any logic leading to `Decimal(str(float(text)))` (currently line 157-158) needs to be reassessed. Instead of converting to a float and back to a `Decimal`, the method should directly work with the `Decimal` input to determine the necessary formatting based on the specified precision (arg). This avoids the precision loss inherent in the float conversion process.\n\nThis change should ensure that `Decimal` values maintain their precision, especially when large numbers of decimal places are involved, aligned with the precision specified in the filter's argument. The rest of the method should remain as is, to continue supporting float inputs and other functionalities like localization and grouping as previously implemented."
