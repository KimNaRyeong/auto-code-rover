The API calls that would likely yield the most useful information are:\n\n1. **Search for a method that does the conversion to LaTeX:** Since the issue is about converting to LaTeX, there's probably a specific method handling this conversion. We should start by searching for a method involved in this process.\n   - `search_method(\"toLatex\")`\n\n2. **Search for specific code snippets that might do the incorrect conversion:** Given the details of the issue, we know the conversion results in `log{\\left(10\\right)}` when it should result in `\\ln`. Searching for the incorrect conversion might lead us to the responsible code piece.\n   - `search_code(\"log{\\left(10\\right)}\")`\n\n3. **Search for the usage of `ln(10)`:** It might also be helpful to find where `ln(10)` is being processed or captured before conversion, to see if the issue lies in how it's being interpreted before conversion.\n   - `search_code(\"ln(10)\")`\n\nThese searches should help identify where the relevant conversion is happening and provide a good starting point for revising the conversion to use `\\ln` instead of `log`."
