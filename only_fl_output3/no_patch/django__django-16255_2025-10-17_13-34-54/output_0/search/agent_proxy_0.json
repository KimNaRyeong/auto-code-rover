            "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue about sitemaps without items raising a `ValueError` when a callable `lastmod` is used, we need to look into specific classes and methods mentioned in the traceback and the proposed solution. Here are the API calls that would provide the necessary information:\n\n1. Search for the class where `get_latest_lastmod` method is defined. This seems to be within a sitemap-related class:\n   - `search_class(\"Sitemap\")`\n\n2. Since the error traceback points to a specific method `get_latest_lastmod` inside Django's sitemap framework, let's get more context on this method:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"get_latest_lastmod\", \"Sitemap\")`\n\n3. It's mentioned that the issue occurs when `items()` returns an empty list and `lastmod` is called. To understand how items are handled and to possibly check for any control flow that leads to this issue, we should look at the `items` method:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"items\", \"Sitemap\")`\n\n4. The error message also references code in `views.py` specifically in the `index` view related to sitemaps, which attempts to retrieve `site_lastmod` using `get_latest_lastmod`. It might be helpful to examine this piece of code to see how the method is used:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"index\", \"django/contrib/sitemaps/views.py\")`\n\n5. Finally, to ensure comprehensive understanding and possible interconnected issues, it would be beneficial to review the actual code that is proposed for change in the issue description. There may not be a direct search for proposed solutions, but looking at the current implementation of `get_latest_lastmod` might reveal where the adjustment could be made:\n   - `search_code(\"def get_latest_lastmod(self):\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a broad context of the issue, covering class definitions, method implementations, and usage across the Django sitemap framework, facilitating a deeper understanding necessary for resolving the reported bug."
