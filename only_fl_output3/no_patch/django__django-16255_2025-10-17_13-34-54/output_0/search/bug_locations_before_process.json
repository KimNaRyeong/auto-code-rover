        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue without altering the existing functionality, the method get_latest_lastmod should be modified to catch a ValueError when attempting to find the maximum modification date (lastmod) from an empty sequence. This change would enable the method to return None (or a similar appropriate value) gracefully when there are no items in the sitemap, thus preventing the entire sitemap generation process from failing. The existing functionality of determining the latest last modification date among all items when they exist should be preserved. Specifically, an exception handler for ValueError should be added, similar to how TypeError is currently handled, to return None when faced with an empty items list. This would effectively handle the case where a sitemap section has no items to include."
