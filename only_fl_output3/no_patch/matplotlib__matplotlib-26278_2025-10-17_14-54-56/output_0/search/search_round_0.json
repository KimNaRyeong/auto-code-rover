        "content": "<issue>Cleaning up kwargs in ContourSet\nThis is a continuation of a mailing list thread where we talked about how to clip a plot inside a polygon. It is a very useful application for people who are visualizing data on maps since often times we want to plot everything inside one region (country, state or province).\nhttp://matplotlib.1069221.n5.nabble.com/Clipping-a-plot-inside-a-polygon-td41950.html\nCurrently for many types of plots this is not that hard to do using the clip_path keyword for most of the plotting functions, since the kwargs are usually used to modify properties of the artists to be generated by the plotting function. For example, suppose that I had a polygon defining the border of a country, poly, and some data to overlay on top.\n```\nplt.pcolor(data, clip_path=poly)\n```\nDoes what I want because the kwargs of pcolor let me modify the underlying PolyCollection instance. However, there are a few plotting functions where I cannot do this, most notably in contour / contourf:\n```\nplt.contourf(data, clip_path=poly)\n```\nWill work but the clip_path kwarg gets completely ignored. To get the result I want, I need to store the output of contourf and use the set_clip_path method on each collection instance:\n```\ncs = plt.contourf(data)\nfor col in cs.collections:\ncol.set_clip_path(poly)\n```\nSo I looked at the code in contour.py and realized that no kwargs get passed when instantiating the collections. @pelson mentioned that this might call for an overhaul of how the kwargs get passed into a ContourSet. His suggestion was either adding a set_clip_path method directly to ContourSet, or a more thorough change of how the kwargs are getting passed so they are more consistent with the other plotting functions. Ideally, I would prefer the latter case since then for my usage case I could always get what I want just by passing in the kwarg directly. Additionally it would make the functionality of contour(f) more similar to the other plotting functions, ie some of the kwargs can be passed to the collections. Any thoughts on this?\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue raised, we need to gather more context about the ContourSet class and the methods involved in creating contour plots. Here are the specific search API calls I would make based on the details provided in the issue:\n\n1. To understand how `ContourSet` is implemented and where it might lack the ability to accept kwargs such as `clip_path` directly, we should examine its class definition:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"ContourSet\")\n```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that the `clip_path` kwarg is not being utilized in `plt.contourf(data, clip_path=poly)`, we need to examine how kwargs are handled in the `contourf` function:\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"contourf\")\n```\n\n3. The existing workaround involves calling `set_clip_path` on each collection instance within a `ContourSet`, so understanding how `set_clip_path` is implemented will be useful:\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"set_clip_path\")\n```\n\n4. Lastly, to get an idea of how kwargs might be properly propagated to the `ContourSet` or its collection instances, we should see how `kwargs` are passed and used in other plotting functions that do support `clip_path`:\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"clip_path\")\n```\n\nThese calls will provide us with the necessary context to understand the current implementation gaps and how kwarg handling could be improved in the `ContourSet` class and its related functions."
