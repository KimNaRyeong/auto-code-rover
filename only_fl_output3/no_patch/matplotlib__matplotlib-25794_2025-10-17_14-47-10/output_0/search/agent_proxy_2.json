Bug Location:\n   - File: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`\n   - Class: `Axes`\n   - Method: `scatter`\n\nIntended Behavior:\nIn the `scatter` method of the `Axes` class, the code needs to be modified to introduce a validation step early in the method to check if both singular and plural forms of `linewidth`/`linewidths` and `edgecolor`/`edgecolors` have been specified by the user. This validation should occur before any processing of these parameters.\n\nThe validation logic should follow these steps:\n1. Before any manipulation of `linewidths`, `edgecolors`, or processing of `**kwargs`, introduce a check for both singular and plural forms in the parameters passed to the function, including the inspection of `**kwargs` for the singular forms if they're allowed through this mechanism.\n2. If the method detects both forms for either parameter, it should raise a `ValueError` with a clear message indicating that both singular and plural forms cannot be specified simultaneously, guiding the user to correct the call by choosing one form.\n3. This validation should preserve the functionality of the method when correctly used, without affecting the processing of other parameters or the core functionality of the `scatter` method.\n\nAdding this validation ensures that the API's behavior aligns more closely with the principle of clarity in parameter specification, helping users avoid confusion and potential bugs arising from conflicting attribute specifications."
