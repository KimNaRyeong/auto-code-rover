        "intended_behavior": "In the `scatter` method of the `Axes` class, the code needs to be modified to introduce a validation step early in the method to check if both singular and plural forms of `linewidth`/`linewidths` and `edgecolor`/`edgecolors` have been specified by the user. This validation should occur before any processing of these parameters. The validation logic should: 1. Introduce a check for both singular and plural forms in the parameters passed to the function, including `**kwargs` for the singular forms. 2. Raise a `ValueError` if both forms are detected for either parameter, with a message guiding to correct the call. 3. Preserve the method's functionality when used correctly, without affecting other parameters or core functionality."
