The plural forms are documented in the function signature, but the singular forms actually take precedence if both are specified.\nThis adds some complexity for downstream libraries and confusion for their users (cf. https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues/2384).\n### Proposed Solution\nSmall change: Matplotlib could raise when both the singular and plural forms are specified.\nLarger change: I will confess that I don't know why the plural forms of the kwargs exist. If there's not a strong reason for the duplication, perhaps they could be deprecated, or at least \"formally discouraged\"?\n### Additional context and prior art\nScatter does a lot of argument checking on the `c`/`color` parameters (too much at times, \ud83d\ude09), so there's some local precedence for a lot of handholding. On the other hand, matplotlib generally doesn't raise when both long- and short-forms of kwargs are given `e.g. `edgecolor` and `ec`).\n</issue>"

Given that the issue did not specify the dimensionality of the scatter plot, we may need to consider changes in both 2D and 3D scatter methods. However, the primary concern is likely with 2D plotting, as it is the most commonly used and the one directly accessible through `plt.scatter`.\n\n2. **lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py**: This module provides a state-based interface to Matplotlib. It wraps plotting functions into a stateful package, which is designed to be similar to MATLAB's plotting interface. The `scatter` function here likely acts as a convenience wrapper around the core Matplotlib object-oriented plotting library, delegating the call to the appropriate Axes object method.\n\n3. **lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py**: This is likely where the core implementation of the `scatter` method for 2D plots resides. This module contains class definitions for Axes objects, which are central to plotting in 2D space in Matplotlib. This file is most likely to contain the detailed handling of `scatter` parameters, including `linewidths`, `edgecolors`, and their singular forms.\n\nBased on the issue description and these considerations, our next steps should focus on the core implementation of the `scatter` method in 2D plotting, as it\u2019s where the handling of singular and plural forms of the mentioned attributes would be implemented. The file of interest should be **lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py**.\n\nThe goals for further context gathering are:\n- **How the `scatter` method in `_axes.py` defines and processes `linewidths`, `edgecolors`, and their singular forms**: This will show the current method of precedence or merging of these attributes.\n- **Existing checks or warnings for argument misuse**: Understanding how other conflicts with attribute naming (e.g., singular vs plural or abbreviated vs full names) are handled could provide insight into designing a solution for the `linewidths` vs `linewidth` and `edgecolors` vs `edgecolor` issue.\n\nGiven these goals, the next API call should aim to get the detailed implementation of the `scatter` method within `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"scatter\", \"lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py\")` - to get the implementation details of the `scatter` method specific to 2D plotting.\n\nAnalyzing the handling of parameters within this method will directly inform how we can approach solving the issue at hand."

This behavior will prevent confusion and ensure clarity about which attribute is being used to define the visual properties of the scatter plot markers.\n\nTo preserve existing functionality:\n- The method should first check if both forms of either attribute are present.\n- If both forms are present for either `linewidth(s)` or `edgecolor(s)`, raise a ValueError indicating that both forms cannot be used simultaneously.\n- This check should occur before any processing of these attributes to ensure the error is raised at the earliest possible point, making it clear to the user what needs to be corrected.\n- The implementation should ensure that if only singular or plural forms are specified (not both), the method behaves as currently documented without any change.\n- The documentation should be updated to clearly indicate that specifying both singular and plural forms of these attributes is not allowed and will result in an error.\n\nThis behavior aligns with the proposed solution in the issue for raising an error when singular and plural forms are specified simultaneously without altering how the `scatter` method functions when correctly used."
