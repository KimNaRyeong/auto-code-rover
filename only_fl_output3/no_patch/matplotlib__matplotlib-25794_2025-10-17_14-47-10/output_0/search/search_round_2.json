        "content": "<issue>Raise when both singular and plural scatter attributes are specified\n### Problem\n`plt.scatter` accepts both singular and plural forms of the `linewidth(s)` and `edgecolor(s)` attributes. The plural forms are documented in the function signature, but the singular forms actually take precedence if both are specified.\nThis adds some complexity for downstream libraries and confusion for their users (cf. https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues/2384).\n### Proposed Solution\nSmall change: Matplotlib could raise when both the singular and plural forms are specified.\nLarger change: I will confess that I don't know why the plural forms of the kwargs exist. If there's not a strong reason for the duplication, perhaps they could be deprecated, or at least \"formally discouraged\"?\n### Additional context and prior art\nScatter does a lot of argument checking on the `c`/`color` parameters (too much at times, \ud83d\ude09), so there's some local precedence for a lot of handholding. On the other hand, matplotlib generally doesn't raise when both long- and short-forms of kwargs are given `e.g. `edgecolor` and `ec`).\n</issue>"

Given that the issue did not specify the dimensionality of the scatter plot, we may need to consider changes in both 2D and 3D scatter methods. However, the primary concern is likely with 2D plotting, as it is the most commonly used and the one directly accessible through `plt.scatter`.\n\n2. **lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py**: This module provides a state-based interface to Matplotlib. It wraps plotting functions into a stateful package, which is designed to be similar to MATLAB's plotting interface. The `scatter` function here likely acts as a convenience wrapper around the core Matplotlib object-oriented plotting library, delegating the call to the appropriate Axes object method.\n\n3. **lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py**: This is likely where the core implementation of the `scatter` method for 2D plots resides. This module contains class definitions for Axes objects, which are central to plotting in 2D space in Matplotlib. This file is most likely to contain the detailed handling of `scatter` parameters, including `linewidths`, `edgecolors`, and their singular forms.\n\nBased on the issue description and these considerations, our next steps should focus on the core implementation of the `scatter` method in 2D plotting, as it\u2019s where the handling of singular and plural forms of the mentioned attributes would be implemented. The file of interest should be **lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py**.\n\nThe goals for further context gathering are:\n- **How the `scatter` method in `_axes.py` defines and processes `linewidths`, `edgecolors`, and their singular forms**: This will show the current method of precedence or merging of these attributes.\n- **Existing checks or warnings for argument misuse**: Understanding how other conflicts with attribute naming (e.g., singular vs plural or abbreviated vs full names) are handled could provide insight into designing a solution for the `linewidths` vs `linewidth` and `edgecolors` vs `edgecolor` issue.\n\nGiven these goals, the next API call should aim to get the detailed implementation of the `scatter` method within `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"scatter\", \"lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py\")` - to get the implementation details of the `scatter` method specific to 2D plotting.\n\nAnalyzing the handling of parameters within this method will directly inform how we can approach solving the issue at hand."

This behavior will prevent confusion and ensure clarity about which attribute is being used to define the visual properties of the scatter plot markers.\n\nTo preserve existing functionality:\n- The method should first check if both forms of either attribute are present.\n- If both forms are present for either `linewidth(s)` or `edgecolor(s)`, raise a ValueError indicating that both forms cannot be used simultaneously.\n- This check should occur before any processing of these attributes to ensure the error is raised at the earliest possible point, making it clear to the user what needs to be corrected.\n- The implementation should ensure that if only singular or plural forms are specified (not both), the method behaves as currently documented without any change.\n- The documentation should be updated to clearly indicate that specifying both singular and plural forms of these attributes is not allowed and will result in an error.\n\nThis behavior aligns with the proposed solution in the issue for raising an error when singular and plural forms are specified simultaneously without altering how the `scatter` method functions when correctly used."

        "content": "The provided code snippet from `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` outlines the implementation details of the `scatter` method within the `Axes` class. This method is responsible for creating a scatter plot of y vs. x, with customizable marker size, color, and additional properties.\n\n### Analysis of the Code\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - This code defines the `scatter` method, which is used to draw a scatter plot. It processes several parameters including `x`, `y`, `s` (size), `c` (color), `marker`, `cmap`, `norm`, `vmin`, `vmax`, `alpha`, `linewidths`, and `edgecolors`. Several of these parameters are optional and have defaults based on `rcParams` or specific rules detailed within the method comments.\n   - The method performs checks and normalization on these inputs, such as validating the sizes of `x` and `y` to ensure they match, handling `s` (size) to ensure it meets the expected criteria, and parsing color arguments with a call to `_parse_scatter_color_args`. There is also logic for dealing with nonfinite values and setting up marker styles and properties.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue raised concerns the simultaneous specification of singular and plural forms for the `linewidths` and `edgecolors` attributes. From the extracted snippet, we see that both `linewidths` and `edgecolors` are accepted as parameters, with `linewidths` defaulting to the value defined in `rcParams['lines.linewidth']` and `edgecolors` having defined default behaviors based on the marker being filled or not.\n   - The given code does not currently check for or raise an error if both the singular and plural forms of these parameters are specified by the user, which is the crux of the reported issue.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - To resolve the issue, the intended behavior would be to introduce validation logic at the beginning of the `scatter` method to detect if both singular and plural forms of the `linewidth`/`linewidths` and `edgecolor`/`edgecolors` are provided. If both forms for either attribute are specified, the method should raise an informative `ValueError`, alerting the user to the conflict.\n   - This behavior aligns with the proposal to raise an error when mutually exclusive attribute forms are specified, guiding users towards consistent and clear usage of the API. It also maintains the existing functionality for all other parameters and uses where singular or plural forms are appropriately specified.\n   - To implement this, a check could be added right after the initial parameter validations (around line 4605), assessing the presence of both attribute forms, which might involve checking both the explicit parameter list and the `**kwargs` for aliases or singular forms if they were not part of the explicit parameter list in this version (though it's mentioned they are provided, singular forms are not explicitly part of the function definition shown).\n\nThis analysis indicates the precise intervention point and intended modifications to address the issue thoroughly without affecting the remainder of the method's functionality or broader library behavior."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Bug Location:\n   - File: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`\n   - Class: `Axes`\n   - Method: `scatter`\n\nIntended Behavior:\nIn the `scatter` method of the `Axes` class, the code needs to be modified to introduce a validation step early in the method to check if both singular and plural forms of `linewidth`/`linewidths` and `edgecolor`/`edgecolors` have been specified by the user. This validation should occur before any processing of these parameters.\n\nThe validation logic should follow these steps:\n1. Before any manipulation of `linewidths`, `edgecolors`, or processing of `**kwargs`, introduce a check for both singular and plural forms in the parameters passed to the function, including the inspection of `**kwargs` for the singular forms if they're allowed through this mechanism.\n2. If the method detects both forms for either parameter, it should raise a `ValueError` with a clear message indicating that both singular and plural forms cannot be specified simultaneously, guiding the user to correct the call by choosing one form.\n3. This validation should preserve the functionality of the method when correctly used, without affecting the processing of other parameters or the core functionality of the `scatter` method.\n\nAdding this validation ensures that the API's behavior aligns more closely with the principle of clarity in parameter specification, helping users avoid confusion and potential bugs arising from conflicting attribute specifications."
