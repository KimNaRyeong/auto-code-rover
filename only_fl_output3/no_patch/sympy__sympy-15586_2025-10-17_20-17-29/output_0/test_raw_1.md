I see there was an attempt to run a Python script that depends on `numpy` and sympy`, but it appears that `numpy` was not installed in the environment where the script was executed, leading to a `ModuleNotFoundError`. Let's write a corrected version of the `reproducer.py` script that checks for these dependencies and attempts to demonstrate the issue as requested:

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def ensure_dependencies():
    try:
        import numpy as np
        from sympy import MatrixSymbol, lambdify
    except ImportError as e:
        missing_module = str(e).split("'")[-2]
        print(f"Required module '{missing_module}' is not installed. Please install it and try again.", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    ensure_dependencies()

    import numpy as np
    from sympy import MatrixSymbol, lambdify

    X0 = MatrixSymbol('X0', 4, 4)  # Correct dimension to match 'xx'
    xx = np.random.rand(4,4)  # Matching dimension for inversion
    X0Inv = X0**-1
    
    try:
        # Attempt normal matrix inversion using numpy to ensure it works
        np.linalg.inv(xx)
        # Attempt symbolic inversion
        symInv = lambdify(X0, X0Inv, modules=["numpy"])
        symInv(xx)

        # If execution reaches here without exception, the issue was not reproduced
        print("No issue encountered with matrix inversion using Sympy and Numpy via lambdify.")
        sys.exit(0)

    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Reproduced the issue with matrix inversion using lambdify.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version of the script includes a function `ensure_dependencies` to check if `numpy` and `sympy` are installed before proceeding. The `main` function then attempts to reproduce the reported issue. If the issue is present, it will print a stack trace and raise an `AssertionError`. If the required libraries are missing, it prompts the user to install them and exits with error code `1`. This script correctly exits with code `0` when the issue is fixed.
