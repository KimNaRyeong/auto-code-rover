        "intended_behavior": "Ensure that when `lambdify` is converting sympy expressions (in this case, matrix inversion) into numpy functions, it correctly handles sympy's symbolic matrices by generating numpy-compatible numeric matrices without triggering type or unsupported operation errors (e.g., 'bitwise_xor'). This may involve adding or refining a check or conversion step specifically for matrix inversion operations to ensure compatibility with numpy's expectations."
