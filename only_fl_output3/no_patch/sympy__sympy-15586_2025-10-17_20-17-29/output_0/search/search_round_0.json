        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to sympy and numpy, we need to focus on the key aspects mentioned: inversion of a matrix using sympy and numpy, the use of `MatrixSymbol`, `lambdify`, and the observed `TypeError` when trying to invert a `numpy` matrix. The `TypeError` suggests a problem at the intersection of using sympy's symbolic computation with numpy's array manipulation functionalities. \n\nBased on the description, the primary operations and objects involved are tied to:\n- sympy's `MatrixSymbol` and matrix inversion operation (`**-1` for finding the inverse)\n- The `lambdify` function, which turns sympy expressions into callable functions that can evaluate numerical arrays via numpy\n- Numpy's `inv` function for matrix inversion\n\nHence, the necessary search operations would involve looking into how these items are implemented or used in the codebase, and understanding the integration or interaction points between sympy and numpy, especially through `lambdify`.\n\nI will issue the following search API calls to gather relevant context:\n\n1. **Search in the sympy library**: Since the sympy library is involved, it's useful to understand any customizations or specialized uses of its features in our project, especially `MatrixSymbol` and `lambdify`. However, it's noted that API capabilities provided do not specify searching within external libraries but within the current project's codebase. If `MatrixSymbol` and `lambdify` have been extended or specifically used in the project's files, searches like `search_class(\"MatrixSymbol\")` or `search_method(\"lambdify\")` could be insightful but based on the task's restrictions, it seems we can only search within our project's scope.\n  \n2. **Understanding numpy integration**: The use of `numpy.linalg.inv` for inversion suggests we should also look into how numpy arrays are handled post-transformation by sympy expressions.\n\nDue to the provided API's scope focusing on the project's codebase rather than external libraries, our search will adjust to focus on:\n- Instances where sympy's `MatrixSymbol`, `lambdify`, and numpy's `inv` are specifically mentioned in our project files\n- Any custom wrapper or utility functions that facilitate matrix inversion using both numpy and sympy\n\nGiven the constraints and the information required, the API calls might look like this:\n\n- `search_code(\"MatrixSymbol\")`\n- `search_code(\"lambdify\")`\n- `search_code(\"np.linalg.inv\")`\n\nSince the error message and the integration of numpy and sympy are central to the issue, these searches aim to identify how the project utilizes these functionalities and whether there are existing compatibility layers or utility functions addressing this integration."
