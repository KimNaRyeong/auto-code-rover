Given the feedback and the need to address the issue correctly, a revised approach will be taken to focus more accurately on elements that could capture the essence of the reported problems on a non-NumPy environment. I'll adjust the script accordingly, taking into account the error related to the failed import (such as `fac` from `sympy`), which appears to be a misreference or a typo, as the correct reference is likely `factorial`. Here is an updated attempt:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

            assert str(fast_series_result)[:100] == pistr, f"fast_series_result failed: {fast_series_result}"
        except Exception as e:

            assert func([1, 2, 3]) == (3, 6), "DeferredVector test failed"

    test_sympy_issues()
```

This version corrects the import issue by replacing `fac` with `factorial`, which is a valid SymPy function. Other segments of the script are left in try-catch blocks to continue execution even if some parts fail, thereby allowing a broader coverage of the tests in the same run. This script should be more robust in handling potential exceptions and make it clearer where the issues lie.

Please ensure that you're working in a clean Python environment with no NumPy installed and that you have the correct version of SymPy where these tests and functionalities are expected to be present and behave as implied by the issue descriptions.
