To accurately replicate the issues presented, including failure scenarios in tests without NumPy installed in a `sympy` environment, here's a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py`. This script is designed to simulate the test failures and to ensure they can be executed within the root directory of the project. The script selectively targets the described test scenarios, considering the required import statements and the described functionality. The script makes assertions and utilizes `print_stacktrace` for capturing and printing detailed exception information.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def simulate_tests():
    from sympy import symbols, oo, factorial, S, lambdify, sin
    from sympy.concrete.summations import Sum
    from sympy.utilities.lambdify import implemented_function
    from sympy.matrices import DeferredVector

    x, n = symbols('x n')
    
    # Placeholder for actual test evaluations.
    try:
        result = Sum(4*n*factorial(n), (n, 0, oo)).doit()
        assert result == S.Infinity, "Test Summation failed on sympy concrete test"
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
    
    try:
        func_expr = sin(x)
        func = lambdify(x, func_expr, modules="math")
        result = func(3.14)  # Approximation to Ï€
        assert isinstance(result, float), "Lambdify test_sin failed"
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
    
    try:
        v = DeferredVector('v')
        func = implemented_function('func', lambda x: (x[0] + x[1], x[1] + x[2]))
        result = func(v)
        assert result == (v[0] + v[1], v[1] + v[2]), "DeferredVector test failed"
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    simulate_tests()
```

Note:
- This script is targeted towards bringing about the specific issues within a non-NumPy environment in various parts of the SymPy library.
- It follows the structure of simulating test environments, making assertions based on expected outputs. Corrections have been made where necessary to ensure that we are calling the appropriate SymPy functions and performing meaningful tests.
- Adjustment in the nature of assertions and specific test payloads may be necessary depending on the evolving state of the library and its dependencies.
