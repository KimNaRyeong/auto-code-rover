        "intended_behavior": "The `DeferredVector` class, when used in conjunction with `lambdify`, should ensure that the numeric types of the evaluated results remain consistent according to the operations performed on them, especially in environments lacking NumPy. If floating-point results are not strictly necessary, the evaluation should preserve integer types if all operations involved would naturally result in integers. This might involve adjusting how `lambdify` interprets `DeferredVector` instances, possibly requiring enhancements to `lambdify` to check the presence of NumPy and adjust its behavior accordingly, or making it handle type conversion more explicitly in non-NumPy environments to prevent unintended floating-point conversion."
