        "intended_behavior": "Within the `__init__` method of `ManyToManyField`, after ensuring `symmetrical` is properly assigned (either explicitly or by default for self-referential relationships), there should be a condition to check if both `symmetrical` is `True` and a `related_name` is provided. If so, raise a `ValueError` with a clear message indicating that `related_name` cannot be used with `symmetrical=True` on `ManyToManyField`. This validation must be performed before the field is fully initialized to prevent the creation of a misconfigured field. This addition preserves all existing functionalities while ensuring developers are immediately made aware of the misuse of `symmetrical` and `related_name` together."
