It handles the initialization of these fields, including supporting arguments such as `related_name`, `symmetrical`, and others which configure the relationship.\n- The `__init__` method specifically deals with the initialization of a `ManyToManyField`, setting up the relationship based on the provided parameters.\n\n**Relationship with the bug**\n- The issue at hand is associated with the `symmetrical` parameter in `ManyToManyField`. If a `ManyToManyField` is declared with `symmetrical=True` or if it's a self-referential field (implied symmetrical), the Django framework does not create a related field on the target model. However, developers might still pass a `related_name`, potentially leading to confusion.\n- The current implementation does not explicitly prevent or raise an error when `related_name` is defined alongside `symmetrical=True` in a self-referential relationship, which is directly related to the reported issue.\n\n**Intended behavior**\n- Given the issue description, the intended behavior is to detect when both `symmetrical=True` (or its condition is automatically met for self-referential fields) and a `related_name` are defined. Upon this detection, the framework should raise a meaningful error during the model initialization stage, preventing the developer from proceeding with a potentially misconfigured `ManyToManyField`.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Intended Behavior\n\nTo enforce this behavior, the `__init__` method of `ManyToManyField` would need modifications to:\n- Check if `symmetrical` is `True` (or the condition for it being symmetrical by default is met) and a `related_name` is also specified.\n- Raise an appropriate error guiding the developer to either remove the `related_name` or revise their model design if these conditions are met.\n\nLooking at the context gathered, the modification seems straightforward but requires precise insertion to avoid disrupting the existing logic. This change is crucial for improving the developer experience by providing immediate, clear feedback on misconfiguration rather than leaving them to discover the issue through documentation or runtime behavior."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

If so, raise a `ValueError` with a clear message indicating that `related_name` cannot be used with `symmetrical=True` on `ManyToManyField`. This validation must be performed before the field is fully initialized to prevent the creation of a misconfigured field. This addition preserves all existing functionalities while ensuring developers are immediately made aware of the misuse of `symmetrical` and `related_name` together."
