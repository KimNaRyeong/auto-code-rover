I understand that there might have been confusion in the previous attempts. Let's adjust the approach by crafting a refined `reproducer.py` script that better targets the issue described â€“ the disappearance of the figure title when the seaborn objects API is involved in plotting on subfigures. 

This script will explicitly check for the presence of the figure title after plotting, producing an `AssertionError` if the title is not correctly displayed. Note that correct behavior (the absence of the issue) is when the script exits with code 0, implying that the figure title remains as set after all plotting commands are executed.

Please ensure you have the necessary dependencies (`matplotlib` and `seaborn`) correctly installed in your environment before running this script.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import seaborn.objects as so

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        fig = plt.figure(constrained_layout=True)
        subfigs = fig.subfigures(1, 2)
        tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
        p = (
            so.Plot(tips, "total_bill")
            .add(so.Bars(), so.Hist())
        )
        p.on(subfigs[0]).plot()

        ax = subfigs[1].subplots()
        ax.scatter([1], [1])

        expected_title = "Test title"
        fig.suptitle(expected_title)

        # Check if the title set is present after plotting.
        if fig._suptitle.get_text() != expected_title:
            raise AssertionError("Figure title was removed after plotting with seaborn's objects API.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code 1 if the issue is present
    except Exception as general_exception:
        print_stacktrace(general_exception)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code 1 for any other exceptions
    else:
        print("No issues detected. The figure title persists after plotting.")
        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script will meet the criteria as specified by executing a minimal test of the issue in question, and exiting with the appropriate status code depending on whether or not the issue is detected.
