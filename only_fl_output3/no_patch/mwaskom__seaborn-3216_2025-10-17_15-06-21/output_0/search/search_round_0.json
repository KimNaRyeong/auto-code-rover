        "content": "<issue>Figure title being removed by seaborn objects API when plotting on subfigures\nI recently came across an odd behaviour with the seaborn objects API when using subfigures. Here is a minimal example :\n```\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport seaborn.objects as so\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfig = plt.figure(constrained_layout=True)\nsubfigs = fig.subfigures(1,2)\ntips = sns.load_dataset(\"tips\")\np = (\nso.Plot(tips, \"total_bill\")\n.add(so.Bars(), so.Hist())\n)\np.on(subfigs[0]).plot()\nax = subfigs[1].subplots()\nax.scatter([1],[1])\nfig.suptitle(\"Test title\")\nplt.show()\n```\nwhich results in the title missing from the image :\n![title_issue_bad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1338337/210242982-57262fb0-d1d4-4aab-b400-8f59cae522f3.png)\nCommenting the `p.on(subfigs[0]).plot()` results in the title reappearing.\nI have done a bit of digging and found that changing  line 186 from the _core/subplots.py file from `figure = target.figure` to `figure = target` seems to solve the issue. Is there a specific reason to why it fetches the parent figure currently, since Subfigure is supposed to be a drop-in replacement for Figure ? I also expect this will not have the intended behaviour if we deal with subfigures of subfigures.\n</issue>"

Locate the `_core/subplots.py` file where the affected line is mentioned. Since the file path is provided, we don't need a search for it directly, but we should inspect the surrounding code to understand the change better.\n2. Examine the class/method in `_core/subplots.py` that contains the line which, when changed, resolves the issue. This involves looking at the code around the mentioned line number to understand its context and potential impacts of the proposed modification.\n\nGiven these steps, I will make the following API calls:\n\n- `get_code_around_line(\"_core/subplots.py\", 186, 10)`: This call will help us understand the context around the line that, when modified, appears to solve the issue. By examining a window of 10 lines before and after line 186, we can better understand the logic and intentions behind the existing code.\n\n\nThese calls should provide us with a good starting point for resolving the issue described."
