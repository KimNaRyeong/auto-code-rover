        "intended_behavior": "The `init_figure` method within the `Subplots` class currently assigns the parent figure of a subfigure to `self._figure` when the target for plotting is actually a `SubFigure` instance. This leads to issues where plotting on a `SubFigure` unintentionally affects the parent figure's properties, such as removing or not properly displaying the figure title. To resolve the issue while preserving existing functionality for handling different types of targets (Figures, Axes, SubFigures), the method should be modified to treat `SubFigure` instances as first-class citizens, akin to `Figure` instances. This means directly assigning the `SubFigure` instance to `self._figure` when `target` is detected as an instance of `mpl.figure.SubFigure`. The intended behavior here is to ensure that all figure-level manipulations, such as setting titles or adjusting layouts, apply correctly to `SubFigure` instances without unintended impacts on any parent figures. Specifically, the conditional check should be corrected to directly assign the `SubFigure` to `self._figure`, thereby preserving the integrity of layouts and titles set on subfigures."
