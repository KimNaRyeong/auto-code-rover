        "content": "<issue>Figure title being removed by seaborn objects API when plotting on subfigures\nI recently came across an odd behaviour with the seaborn objects API when using subfigures. Here is a minimal example :\n```\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport seaborn.objects as so\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfig = plt.figure(constrained_layout=True)\nsubfigs = fig.subfigures(1,2)\ntips = sns.load_dataset(\"tips\")\np = (\nso.Plot(tips, \"total_bill\")\n.add(so.Bars(), so.Hist())\n)\np.on(subfigs[0]).plot()\nax = subfigs[1].subplots()\nax.scatter([1],[1])\nfig.suptitle(\"Test title\")\nplt.show()\n```\nwhich results in the title missing from the image :\n![title_issue_bad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1338337/210242982-57262fb0-d1d4-4aab-b400-8f59cae522f3.png)\nCommenting the `p.on(subfigs[0]).plot()` results in the title reappearing.\nI have done a bit of digging and found that changing  line 186 from the _core/subplots.py file from `figure = target.figure` to `figure = target` seems to solve the issue. Is there a specific reason to why it fetches the parent figure currently, since Subfigure is supposed to be a drop-in replacement for Figure ? I also expect this will not have the intended behaviour if we deal with subfigures of subfigures.\n</issue>"

        "content": "The retrieved code snippet from `_core/subplots.py` around line 186 provides insight into how Seaborn's `Subplots` class handles different plotting targets, specifically with regards to determining the figure to which a plot should be tied.\n\n### Analysis of the Code Snippet\n\n1. **Purpose of the code**:\n   - The code in context is part of the `init_figure` function within the `Subplots` class. It's responsible for identifying and initializing the figure associated with the plotting action.\n   - It checks the type of the target (i.e., the object on which the plot will be drawn) and accordingly sets the figure attribute (`self._figure`) of the `Subplots` instance. This attribute will later be used for plotting.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug**:\n   - The issue arises when a seaborn plot is drawn on a subfigure (as with the new matplotlib subplot API), and this action leads to the unintentional removal of the figure title. The bug report specifically mentions that changing the line `figure = target.figure` to simply use `target` (presuming to be `figure = target`) for the case where `target` is an instance of `mpl.figure.SubFigure`, resolves the issue.\n   - This suggests that the original code, by always referencing `target.figure`, unintentionally fetches the parent figure of the subfigure, rather than treating the subfigure as the intended plotting target. This behavior likely interferes with how titles and layouts are managed on the parent figure when only a subfigure is intended to be manipulated.\n\n3. **Intended behavior**:\n   - The intended behavior, as implied by the issue and the user's suggested fix, is for the `Subplots` class to treat subfigures as independent plotting targets when they are passed to seaborn plotting functions. This would mean recognizing and treating subfigures similarly to how top-level figures are treated, allowing for titles, layouts, and other figure-level properties to be appropriately managed on subfigures without unintended side effects on the parent figure.\n   - Therefore, the fix aims to ensure that when a `SubFigure` object is the target, it should be directly assigned to `self._figure` rather than defaulting to its parent figure. This change would maintain the modular use of subfigures as intended in newer versions of matplotlib, thus preventing the loss of titles or other figure-level attributes when seaborn plots are drawn on subfigures.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next step towards a patch would be preparing a modification that allows `SubFigure` instances to be treated as independent figures within seaborn's plotting context. This involves ensuring that the assignment in the conditional block (line 186) treats `SubFigure` instances correctly, potentially by directly using them as the figure context for subsequent plot operations."

Bug Location: \n   - File: `_core/subplots.py`\n   - Class: `Subplots`\n   - Method: `init_figure`\n   \n   Intended Behavior: \n   \n   The `init_figure` method within the `Subplots` class currently assigns the parent figure of a subfigure to `self._figure` when the target for plotting is actually a `SubFigure` instance. This leads to issues where plotting on a `SubFigure` unintentionally affects the parent figure's properties, such as removing or not properly displaying the figure title.\n   \n   To resolve the issue while preserving existing functionality for handling different types of targets (Figures, Axes, SubFigures), the method should be modified to treat `SubFigure` instances as first-class citizens, akin to `Figure` instances. This means directly assigning the `SubFigure` instance to `self._figure` when `target` is detected as an instance of `mpl.figure.SubFigure`. The intended behavior here is to ensure that all figure-level manipulations, such as setting titles or adjusting layouts, apply correctly to `SubFigure` instances without unintended impacts on any parent figures.\n   \n   Specifically, the conditional check:\n   \n   ```python\n   elif isinstance(target, mpl.figure.SubFigure):\n       figure = target.figure\n   ```\n   \n   Should be corrected to directly assign the `SubFigure` to `self._figure`, like so:\n   \n   ```python\n   elif isinstance(target, mpl.figure.SubFigure):\n       figure = target\n   ```\n   \n   This adjustment ensures that subsequent plotting operations on the `SubFigure` do not inadvertently modify the parent figure's attributes or display properties, thereby preserving the integrity of layouts and titles set on subfigures."
