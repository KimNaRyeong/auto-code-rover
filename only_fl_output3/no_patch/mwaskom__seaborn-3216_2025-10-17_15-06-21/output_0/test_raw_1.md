Given the previous confusion and the unique requirements of the prompt to not only reproduce but assert an issue (and that the error provided was due to a missing module, not the issue itself), the following script is designed to encapsulate the issue, check for the presence of the figure title, and error out accordingly if the title is missing, which would indicate the presence of the issue. Please install all necessary dependencies (`seaborn`, `matplotlib`) before running the script.

```python
def main():
    try:
        import seaborn as sns
        import seaborn.objects as so
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        # Setting up the plot with subfigures
        fig = plt.figure(constrained_layout=True)
        subfigs = fig.subfigures(1, 2)
        tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
        p = (
            so.Plot(tips, "total_bill")
            .add(so.Bars(), so.Hist())
        )

        # Plotting the seaborn plot on the first subfigure
        p.on(subfigs[0]).plot()

        # Creating a scatter plot on the second subfigure for contrast
        ax = subfigs[1].subplots()
        ax.scatter([1], [1])

        # Setting a superscript title and displaying the plot
        expected_title = "Test title"
        fig.suptitle(expected_title)

        # Save the figure to a buffer instead of showing it
        from io import BytesIO
        buf = BytesIO()
        plt.savefig(buf, format='png')

        # Check the figure title through the matplotlib object
        assert fig._suptitle.get_text() == expected_title, "Figure title does not match expected title."

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code 1 if the issue is present
    except Exception as general_exception:
        print_stacktrace(general_exception)
        exit(1)  # Exit with error code 1 for any other exceptions
    else:
        print("No issues detected.")
        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Ensure that the required libraries are installed and properly configured on your system before running this script. This program attempts to address the primary concern: verifying the presence of the figure title when seaborn plots are used within subfigures, and it utilizes matplotlib's figure object to directly assess the presence of the title, thus minimizing dependency on the display environment.
