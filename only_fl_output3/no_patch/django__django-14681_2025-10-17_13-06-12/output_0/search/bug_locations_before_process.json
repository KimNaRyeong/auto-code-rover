When an issue is detected with file storage (e.g., MEDIA_ROOT misconfiguration or inaccessible), the system should raise a clear and specific exception related to storage instead of deferring to a CSRF error. This distinction ensures administrators and developers can quickly diagnose and rectify configuration issues or filesystem permissions rather than being misled by incorrect CSRF failure messages."

If a request fails due to a storage issue in the process of file upload, the CSRF middleware should not overwrite or mask this error with a CSRF verification failure. Instead, it should allow storage or filesystem errors to pass through unchanged or be logged appropriately, aiding in debugging and system administration."
