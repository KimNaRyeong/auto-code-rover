When used with a descending order it will look correct.\nUnfortunately in the fix in #30903 it was assumed that the col_suffixes passed to django.db.backends.ddl_references.Columns would be empty for ascending order but instead it will contain empty strings and thus causing this bug. See: \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/db/backends/ddl_references.py#L87\nThe expected output would be:\nCREATE INDEX \"idx\" ON \"schema_author\" (\u201cname\u201d text_pattern_ops)\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather enough context for resolving the issue described, we need to focus on how the CREATE INDEX statements are generated, specifically how opclasses and ordering are handled in the context of generating these statements. The issue mentions a particular fix introduced by a ticket and points to a file and line number in the Django project on GitHub. Based on the description, let's outline the necessary API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the class that handles the generation of SQL for indexes**: Since `Index` objects are involved and ultimately, the creation SQL statement is generated, it's likely that a specific class or utility is responsible for generating the `CREATE INDEX` SQL statement. The class `ddl_references` is mentioned, which suggests a potential starting point.\n\n2. **Look into the `ddl_references.py` file around the specified line number**: The issue mentions a specific line in `ddl_references.py`. Inspecting the code around this line will help understand how `col_suffixes` are handled and potentially pinpoint where the logic fails to account for the proper whitespace insertion.\n\n3. **Inspect how `Index` objects are handled and converted to SQL statements**: The description suggests that the issue stems from how `Index` objects, especially their `fields`, `name`, and `opclasses` attributes, are processed. Seeing the implementation might reveal where adjustments are necessary.\n\nGiven the above analysis, here are the API calls I'll make:\n\n- `search_class(\"ddl_references\")`: To validate the existence of a class or module directly related to generating the SQL for database schema operations and possibly get its file location.\n- `get_code_around_line(\"django/db/backends/ddl_references.py\", 87, 10)`: Since the issue points to a specific line in `ddl_references.py`, inspecting the code around this line provides context on how `col_suffixes` are managed.\n\nThese calls aim to gather enough context to understand how `Index` objects are transformed into SQL statements and how the whitespace issue arises."
