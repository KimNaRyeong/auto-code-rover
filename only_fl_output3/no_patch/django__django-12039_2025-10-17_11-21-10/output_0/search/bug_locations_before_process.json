        "intended_behavior": "The `__str__` method needs to be adjusted to ensure proper whitespace handling between a column's name and its suffix (if any). Specifically, when concatenating `self.quote_name(column)` with `self.col_suffixes[idx]`, it should conditionally insert a space between the column name and the suffix if the suffix is non-empty. This adjustment preserves the existing functionality (which handles column names and suffixes) while ensuring the correct formatting of SQL statements. The modification can be done by checking if `self.col_suffixes[idx]` is not just present but also a non-empty string, and in such cases, prepend a space to the suffix before concatenating it with the column name. This ensures that generated SQL statements have the correct whitespace, particularly in `CREATE INDEX` statements, addressing both the lack of necessary whitespace for descending order indexes and removing unwanted trailing spaces after opclasses."
