When used with a descending order it will look correct.\nUnfortunately in the fix in #30903 it was assumed that the col_suffixes passed to django.db.backends.ddl_references.Columns would be empty for ascending order but instead it will contain empty strings and thus causing this bug. See: \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/db/backends/ddl_references.py#L87\nThe expected output would be:\nCREATE INDEX \"idx\" ON \"schema_author\" (\u201cname\u201d text_pattern_ops)\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather enough context for resolving the issue described, we need to focus on how the CREATE INDEX statements are generated, specifically how opclasses and ordering are handled in the context of generating these statements. The issue mentions a particular fix introduced by a ticket and points to a file and line number in the Django project on GitHub. Based on the description, let's outline the necessary API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the class that handles the generation of SQL for indexes**: Since `Index` objects are involved and ultimately, the creation SQL statement is generated, it's likely that a specific class or utility is responsible for generating the `CREATE INDEX` SQL statement. The class `ddl_references` is mentioned, which suggests a potential starting point.\n\n2. **Look into the `ddl_references.py` file around the specified line number**: The issue mentions a specific line in `ddl_references.py`. Inspecting the code around this line will help understand how `col_suffixes` are handled and potentially pinpoint where the logic fails to account for the proper whitespace insertion.\n\n3. **Inspect how `Index` objects are handled and converted to SQL statements**: The description suggests that the issue stems from how `Index` objects, especially their `fields`, `name`, and `opclasses` attributes, are processed. Seeing the implementation might reveal where adjustments are necessary.\n\nGiven the above analysis, here are the API calls I'll make:\n\n- `search_class(\"ddl_references\")`: To validate the existence of a class or module directly related to generating the SQL for database schema operations and possibly get its file location.\n- `get_code_around_line(\"django/db/backends/ddl_references.py\", 87, 10)`: Since the issue points to a specific line in `ddl_references.py`, inspecting the code around this line provides context on how `col_suffixes` are managed.\n\nThese calls aim to gather enough context to understand how `Index` objects are transformed into SQL statements and how the whitespace issue arises."

        "content": "Analyzing the provided code snippet from `django/db/backends/ddl_references.py`, we can draw several conclusions:\n\n### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe snippet defines a class named `Columns`, which is responsible for holding references to one or more columns of a table. Specifically, the `__init__` method initializes the object with a table, columns, a function to quote column names (`quote_name`), and a tuple of column suffixes (`col_suffixes`).\n\nThe `__str__` method of the `Columns` class returns a string representing a comma-separated list of columns, where each column name is quoted appropriately using the `quote_name` method, and any column suffixes (if applicable) are appended directly to the column name without additional whitespace.\n\n### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe described issue involves incorrect whitespace handling in the generation of `CREATE INDEX` SQL statements, particularly when opclasses (column suffixes in this context) are utilized. The problematic behavior manifests as either a lack of necessary whitespace between the column name and its suffix (for descending order indexes) or extraneous whitespace after the suffix when no explicit ordering is specified.\n\nThe provided code snippet is directly related to this bug because it touches upon how column names and their suffixes are concatenated (`self.quote_name(column) + self.col_suffixes[idx]`). The bug described indicates that the concatenation logic does not consider the inclusion of appropriate whitespace, leading to malformed SQL statements.\n\n### Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior for generating SQL parts for columns and their suffixes should ensure that:\n- There is a space between the column name and its suffix when the suffix is present (e.g., `\"name\" DESC`).\n- There is no trailing space after the suffix if it is the last part of the column's SQL part (to avoid issues with extraneous spaces in SQL statements).\n\nTo rectify the issue based on the collected context, the code should be adjusted to include a conditional space character before the column suffix if one is present. This may be achieved by altering the concatenation logic within the `col_str` function to check whether `self.col_suffixes[idx]` is not empty, and if so, prepend a space to it before appending it to the column name.\n\nGiven the insights gained from analyzing the search results, further steps could involve:\n- Implementing a fix in the `__str__` method of the `Columns` class to account for proper whitespace handling.\n- Extending the analysis or bug fix to other related parts of the project that might be affected by the same logic of appending column suffixes without appropriate whitespace."

Specifically, when concatenating `self.quote_name(column)` with `self.col_suffixes[idx]`, it should conditionally insert a space between the column name and the suffix if the suffix is non-empty. This adjustment preserves the existing functionality (which handles column names and suffixes) while ensuring the correct formatting of SQL statements. The modification can be done by checking if `self.col_suffixes[idx]` is not just present but also a non-empty string, and in such cases, prepend a space to the suffix before concatenating it with the column name. This ensures that generated SQL statements have the correct whitespace, particularly in `CREATE INDEX` statements, addressing both the lack of necessary whitespace for descending order indexes and removing unwanted trailing spaces after opclasses."
