Certainly! Below is a `reproducer.py` script designed to reproduce the issue you mentioned. This script checks if printing a table with 0-length array cells raises an `IndexError` and, if so, prints a stack trace showing where the error occurred. 

```python
import numpy as np
from astropy.table import QTable

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    events = [{"A": 0, "B": 0, "C": np.array([], dtype=np.uint64)},
              {"A": 1, "B": 0, "C": np.array([], dtype=np.uint64)},
              {"A": 2, "B": 2, "C": np.array([0, 1], dtype=np.uint64)}]
    try:
        table = QTable(rows=events[:2])
        print(table)
        # If the program reaches this point without raising an error, the issue is not present.
        print("No issue detected.")
    except IndexError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "The issue is present."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero code to indicate failure
    exit(0)
```

This script assumes that an `IndexError` is indicative of the issue you're experiencing. If a different exception type is more appropriate, you can adjust the `except` block accordingly. 

The script exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed (meaning no `IndexError` is raised during execution), allowing it to be used effectively in automated testing or manual verification workflows.
