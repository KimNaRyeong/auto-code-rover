Certainly! Below is the updated standalone python script `reproducer.py` for reproducing the issue. Make sure that Astropy and Numpy packages are installed in your environment before executing the script. The script aims to produce an `AssertionError` if the issue exists and prints a descriptive stack trace using the provided function. Conversely, it exits with code 0 if the issue is fixed.

```python
import numpy as np
from astropy.table import QTable

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    # Define a dataset with 0-length array cells for some rows
    events = [{"A": 0, "B": 0, "C": np.array([], dtype=np.uint64)},
              {"A": 1, "B": 0, "C": np.array([], dtype=np.uint64)},
              {"A": 2, "B": 2, "C": np.array([0, 1], dtype=np.uint64)}]
    try:
        # Attempt to create and print a table from the events which have 0-length array cells
        table = QTable(rows=events[:2])
        print(table)
        # If no IndexError is raised, the AssertionError will indicate that the issue might have been fixed
        assert False, "No IndexError raised. The issue may be fixed."
    except IndexError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Signal that the issue is still present
        raise AssertionError("IndexError encountered as expected due to the issue.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate the presence of the issue
    exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed or not encountered
```

This script should be executed in an environment where both Astropy and Numpy are properly installed. The `print_stacktrace` function will output a detailed trace of where the `IndexError` occurs, aiding in diagnosing the issue. 

Please replace `"No IndexError raised. The issue may be fixed."` with the appropriate message depending on the behavior observed when running the script.
