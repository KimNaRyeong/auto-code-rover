This means we need to adjust our approach to get more context.\n\n### Analyzing Collected Context\nThe only direct hit from the search was related to `--ignore`, with 8 matches in `pylint/checkers/similar.py`. This file likely deals with functionality around checking for code similarity, which might not be directly related to the issue at hand (ignoring files or directories when running in recursive mode), but it gives us a clue about where ignore rules might be applied. The absence of references to `--ignore-paths` and `--ignore-patterns` in the search result doesn't necessarily mean they aren't processed or used; it's possible that these configurations are handled in a way that wasn't caught by the direct search terms used.\n\n### Revised Search Strategies\nGiven the initial results, we need to think about different angles to approach the problem:\n\n1. **Review how Pylint handles configuration settings in general**: Since we couldn't find `ConfigHandler`, we should look for snippets or methods related to Pylint's general configuration setup or processing, which might give us a clue about where and how `--ignore`, `--ignore-paths`, and `--ignore-patterns` settings could be processed.\n   - `search_code(\"load_configuration\")`\n   - `search_code(\"configuration\")`\n\n2. **Investigate how Pylint discovers files to lint**: Although `collect_files` didn't return any results, there must be functionality within Pylint responsible for discovering Python files to lint, especially in recursive mode.\n   - `search_method(\"find_files\")`\n   - `search_code(\"file discovery\")`\n\n3. **Examine how Pylint applies ignore rules**: Since `--ignore` returned results but `--ignore-paths` and `--ignore-patterns` did not, it might be helpful to examine more closely how ignore rules are applied, possibly through a different angle.\n   - `search_code(\"apply_ignore\")`\n   - `search_code(\"ignore rules\")`\n\n4. **Broaden the search around command-line argument parsing**: Pylint uses command-line arguments to configure its behavior, and if `parse_arguments` didn't yield results, it might be due to it being part of a library or framework usage.\n   - `search_code(\"ArgumentParser\")`\n\nThese adjusted search strategies aim to find more indirect but relevant parts of the code that could illuminate how Pylint's recursive mode fails to respect the ignore settings. By understanding the mechanisms of configuration handling, file discovery in recursive mode, and ignore rule application, we can get closer to identifying the root cause of the reported issue."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

        "content": "1. Based on the initial analysis and the lack of direct information concerning how Pylint's `--recursive`, `--ignore`, `--ignore-paths`, and `--ignore-patterns` options are handled, it appears we need to adjust our search tactics to gain more insight into the configuration and file discovery mechanisms. Therefore, let's construct more context-aware search API calls:\n\n- `search_code(\"load_configuration\")`\n- `search_method(\"find_files\")`\n- `search_code(\"apply_ignore\")`\n- `search_code(\"ArgumentParser\")`\n\n2. Since the inquiries have not produced direct evidence of where the bug precisely resides so far, and additional context is necessary to pinpoint the exact locations, the following hypothetical analysis proposes potential bug locations based on typical patterns found in similar cases within large Python projects like Pylint:\n\n- **Potential Bug Location 1**: \n   - **File**: Not directly identified yet (requires further context).\n   - **Class/Method**: The class or method responsible for handling command-line arguments related to file discovery and ignore settings. Based on the need for more context, this cannot be precisely named but would be where Pylint parses command-line arguments to decide which files to lint.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: This location should implement or fix logic that correctly parses `--recursive`, `--ignore`, `--ignore-paths`, and `--ignore-patterns` arguments to filter out specified files or directories during the recursive file search. The intended behavior ensures that when a directory or file pattern is specified as ignored, it is excluded from the linting process regardless of the recursive flag being enabled.\n\n- **Potential Bug Location 2**:\n   - **File**: Also not directly identified yet.\n   - **Class/Method**: A configuration loading class or method that might be situated close to where Pylint's initial setup and configuration parsing happen. This could relate to processing `.pylintrc` or equivalent configurations which might also impact how ignore patterns are managed.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Ensure that any ignore rules defined in configuration files or directly via command-line arguments are effectively consolidated and applied to the file discovery process. It should honor ignore patterns and paths explicitly, particularly in recursive mode, to adhere to user expectations and documentation.\n\nWithout explicit results from the searches, these locations and intended behaviors are speculative. However, they align with common architectural areas in similar tools where such issues could manifest. After obtaining more context with the revised search API calls, we would be able to specify exact file names, classes, and methods that require modification."
