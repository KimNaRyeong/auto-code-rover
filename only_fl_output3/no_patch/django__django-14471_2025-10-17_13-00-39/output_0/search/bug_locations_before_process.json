        "intended_behavior": "The `_get_token` method should be modified to immediately reject requests with CSRF cookies that have the wrong format (i.e., incorrect length or containing invalid characters) without attempting to generate a new token and mask. This means, instead of generating a new token when an `InvalidTokenFormat` exception is encountered (currently on line 223), it should allow this exception to bubble up so it can be handled appropriately in the `process_view` method, thereby preventing unnecessary execution of code that ultimately fails the CSRF check."

        "method": "process_view",
        "intended_behavior": "In the `process_view` method, handle the `InvalidTokenFormat` exception by rejecting the request outright instead of allowing it to proceed through further unnecessary steps. This involves modifying the handling around getting the CSRF token (lines 374-377) to catch `InvalidTokenFormat` exceptions and then directly rejecting the request with a clear and specific reason. This change is aimed at streamlining CSRF validation and improving efficiency by avoiding redundant operations when the CSRF cookie is already known to be invalid."
