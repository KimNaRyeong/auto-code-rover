Ensure that when a new log entry is added, it includes which AdminSite it was created through, if applicable. This might involve extending the LogEntry model to include a foreign key to the AdminSite model (or a suitable identifier if the relationship is not direct), and adjusting the method to populate this field based on the admin site context."
