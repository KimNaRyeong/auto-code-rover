It is confusing for users to access a specific site and see log entries for models they can't access.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather context for resolving the described issue, we need to look into how the Django admin logs actions and how actions are associated with specific `AdminSite` instances. The main areas of interest involve the `LogEntry` model, `AdminSite` class, and possibly how models are registered with the `AdminSite`. Here are the API calls that would provide essential context:\n\n1. **Search for the `LogEntry` Model**: The `LogEntry` model is directly associated with the described problem. Understanding its structure and relationships will be crucial.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"LogEntry\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the `AdminSite` Class**: Since the issue involves filtering `LogEntry` records based on models registered to specific `AdminSite` instances, inspecting the `AdminSite` class definition and methods can provide insights into how `AdminSite` instances are currently managing models and logs.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"AdminSite\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for Model Registration Method**: Models are registered to admin sites using a specific method. This process is important because the issue may be resolved by modifying how models are associated with `AdminSite` instances during registration.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"register\", \"AdminSite\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Search for Log Creation Code**: Since we're looking at how logs are generated and associated with registered models, searching for the code snippet that handles the creation of `LogEntry` instances will be helpful. This might not be directly within the `AdminSite` or `LogEntry` class but can be found in their usage within the admin actions.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"LogEntry.objects.create\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the components involved in the issue, hence allowing for a better assessment of where and how to implement the necessary filtering functionality."
