This will likely involve looking for the class or method where this validation should be performed. Considering the nature of Django (given the description involves query handling, which is a typical framework behavior), we will search for classes or methods related to query building or lookup handling.\n\nFirstly, we should find where `__isnull` is implemented or processed. Since `__isnull` is a type of filter used in querysets, it's reasonable to assume it's part of the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer, possibly in classes relating to query construction, processing, or field handling.\n\nLet's begin with the following search API calls to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. search_method(\"__isnull\")\n2. search_code(\"lookup='isnull'\")\n\nThese searches aim to identify the specific method implementations or instances where `__isnull` is processed or defined, as well as to capture any direct references to this lookup type in the codebase, which will help us understand how it's currently being handled and where we might need to introduce a validation for boolean values only."

It's possible that `__isnull` lookups are handled as part of a more generalized method or through a dynamic mechanism that doesn\u2019t directly tie to the literal strings or method names we searched for.\n\nSince `__isnull` is a query lookup, it's likely processed alongside other field lookups within the framework, in a part of the ORM that interprets field lookups and translates them into SQL queries or similar. To investigate further, we can:\n\n1. Search for classes or methods related to field lookup processing, specifically those that handle dynamic field lookups or translate lookup strings into query parameters.\n2. Since Django uses a QuerySet system to construct database queries, looking for methods within relevant QuerySet classes or something similar might also provide insights.\n\nGiven this, we should consider the following API calls next:\n\n1. **Search for a way Django processes the lookups in general.** Since `__isnull` is part of Django's queryset filtering syntax, we should look for methods or classes that deal with filtering or lookup processing in general.\n\n2. **Search in relation to QuerySet or Field classes.** Since these are the most likely places for the handling of such lookups.\n\nLet's adjust our strategy and make the following API calls:\n\n1. search_class(\"QuerySet\")\n2. search_method_in_class(\"add_filter\", \"QuerySet\")\n3. search_method(\"get_lookup\")\n4. search_class(\"Field\")\n\nThis range of search attempts should help us zero in on the relevant parts of the codebase where `__isnull` lookup processing might be configured or manipulated, providing a pathway to implement the necessary boolean value validation."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Since the required context to identify the specific locations of the bug was not successfully obtained through the search API calls, and because the exact locations, files, or classes related to handling `__isnull` lookups were not identified, it's not possible to provide precise bug locations and intended behavior without further information.\n\nHowever, we can infer potential bug locations based on the nature of Django ORM and the description of the issue:\n\n- **Potential Bug Location**: Any part of Django's ORM layer that handles field lookup translations, specifically for translating `__isnull` into the appropriate SQL syntax. This might involve classes or methods responsible for parsing query parameters, validating them, and then constructing the SQL query part that checks for NULL values.\n\n- **Intended Behavior**: The code within these locations should include additional logic to explicitly check that the value passed with the `__isnull` lookup is a boolean. If a non-boolean value is passed, the framework should raise a descriptive error to inform the developer that only `True` or `False` values are acceptable for the `__isnull` lookup. This validation step would preserve the existing functionality (which allows querying for NULL or NOT NULL fields) but prevent unintended behavior by enforcing type checks on the value provided with `__isnull`.\n\nThis approach would align with the issue's suggestion to avoid confusion and ensure consistency in how `__isnull` lookups are handled, by making the framework's behavior more predictable and the codebase more maintainable."
