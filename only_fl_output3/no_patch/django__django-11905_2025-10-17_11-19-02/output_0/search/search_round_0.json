Using truthy/falsey doesn't promote INNER JOIN to an OUTER JOIN but works fine for a simple queries. Using non-boolean values is \u200bundocumented and untested.

        "content": "To address the issue of preventing the use of `__isnull` lookup with non-boolean values, we need to gather context about where and how `__isnull` is implemented and used in the codebase. This will likely involve looking for the class or method where this validation should be performed. Considering the nature of Django (given the description involves query handling, which is a typical framework behavior), we will search for classes or methods related to query building or lookup handling.\n\nFirstly, we should find where `__isnull` is implemented or processed. Since `__isnull` is a type of filter used in querysets, it's reasonable to assume it's part of the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer, possibly in classes relating to query construction, processing, or field handling.\n\nLet's begin with the following search API calls to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. search_method(\"__isnull\")\n2. search_code(\"lookup='isnull'\")\n\nThese searches aim to identify the specific method implementations or instances where `__isnull` is processed or defined, as well as to capture any direct references to this lookup type in the codebase, which will help us understand how it's currently being handled and where we might need to introduce a validation for boolean values only."
