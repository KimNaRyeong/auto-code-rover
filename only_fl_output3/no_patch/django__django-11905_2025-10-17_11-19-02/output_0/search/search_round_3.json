Since `__isnull` is a type of filter used in querysets, it's reasonable to assume it's part of the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer, possibly in classes relating to query construction, processing, or field handling.\n\nLet's begin with the following search API calls to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. search_method(\"__isnull\")\n2. search_code(\"lookup='isnull'\")\n\nThese searches aim to identify the specific method implementations or instances where `__isnull` is processed or defined, as well as to capture any direct references to this lookup type in the codebase, which will help us understand how it's currently being handled and where we might need to introduce a validation for boolean values only."

It's possible that `__isnull` lookups are handled as part of a more generalized method or through a dynamic mechanism that doesn\u2019t directly tie to the literal strings or method names we searched for.\n\nSince `__isnull` is a query lookup, it's likely processed alongside other field lookups within the framework, in a part of the ORM that interprets field lookups and translates them into SQL queries or similar. To investigate further, we can:\n\n1. Search for classes or methods related to field lookup processing, specifically those that handle dynamic field lookups or translate lookup strings into query parameters.\n2. Since Django uses a QuerySet system to construct database queries, looking for methods within relevant QuerySet classes or something similar might also provide insights.\n\nGiven this, we should consider the following API calls next:\n\n1. **Search for a way Django processes the lookups in general.** Since `__isnull` is part of Django's queryset filtering syntax, we should look for methods or classes that deal with filtering or lookup processing in general.\n\n2. **Search in relation to QuerySet or Field classes.** Since these are the most likely places for the handling of such lookups.\n\nLet's adjust our strategy and make the following API calls:\n\n1. search_class(\"QuerySet\")\n2. search_method_in_class(\"add_filter\", \"QuerySet\")\n3. search_method(\"get_lookup\")\n4. search_class(\"Field\")\n\nThis range of search attempts should help us zero in on the relevant parts of the codebase where `__isnull` lookup processing might be configured or manipulated, providing a pathway to implement the necessary boolean value validation."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Since the required context to identify the specific locations of the bug was not successfully obtained through the search API calls, and because the exact locations, files, or classes related to handling `__isnull` lookups were not identified, it's not possible to provide precise bug locations and intended behavior without further information.\n\nHowever, we can infer potential bug locations based on the nature of Django ORM and the description of the issue:\n\n- **Potential Bug Location**: Any part of Django's ORM layer that handles field lookup translations, specifically for translating `__isnull` into the appropriate SQL syntax. This might involve classes or methods responsible for parsing query parameters, validating them, and then constructing the SQL query part that checks for NULL values.\n\n- **Intended Behavior**: The code within these locations should include additional logic to explicitly check that the value passed with the `__isnull` lookup is a boolean. If a non-boolean value is passed, the framework should raise a descriptive error to inform the developer that only `True` or `False` values are acceptable for the `__isnull` lookup. This validation step would preserve the existing functionality (which allows querying for NULL or NOT NULL fields) but prevent unintended behavior by enforcing type checks on the value provided with `__isnull`.\n\nThis approach would align with the issue's suggestion to avoid confusion and ensure consistency in how `__isnull` lookups are handled, by making the framework's behavior more predictable and the codebase more maintainable."

        "content": "1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n- The `build_filter` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` builds a `WhereNode` for a single filter clause but doesn't add it directly to the query's `where` Node; instead, `Query.add_q()` is responsible for adding this filter to the where Node later on. It deals with the intricacies of constructing the where clause of a query, including parsing filter expressions, handling negations, managing join operations, and determining if certain conditional logic should apply.\n- The `Lookup` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py` represents a field lookup, which is a way to specify how a field is compared to a value in a query. It contains the logic for processing the left-hand side (lhs) and right-hand side (rhs) of a lookup, preparing the lookup for database querying, and generating the SQL.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n- The `build_filter` method is likely a central location where the interpretation and processing of filters, including `__isnull` lookups, occur. Since the issue involves ensuring that `__isnull` lookups only accept boolean values, logic within this method or logic related to how it processes lookups would need to be updated or checked to ensure this validation is enforced.\n- The `Lookup` class is likely the foundation for all specific lookup types, including `__isnull`. Understanding its structure and methods is essential because ensuring `__isnull` accepts only boolean values might require adjustments in how this lookup (or potentially all lookups) processes its rhs (right-hand side) inputs, especially around the `get_prep_lookup` and `get_db_prep_lookup` methods which prepare lookups for database querying.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n- For `build_filter`, the intended behavior should include a validation step when handling lookups to ensure that if the lookup type is `isnull`, then the corresponding value must strictly be a boolean. If a non-boolean value is encountered, a clear and concise error should be raised to inform the developer of the invalid use case. This preserves existing functionality while adding a straightforward validation to catch and prevent misuse of the `__isnull` lookup.\n- For the `Lookup` class, specifically within methods that process the rhs of a lookup (`get_prep_lookup`, `process_rhs`, etc.), there should be a check to confirm that for `isnull` lookups, the rhs is a boolean. If not, similar to `build_filter`, an error should be thrown to prevent non-boolean values from being processed for `__isnull` lookups.\n\nImplementing this validation aligns with the issue's requirement to prevent the use of non-boolean values with `__isnull` lookups, thereby avoiding confusion and maintaining consistent behavior across the framework."

If the lookup type is determined to be `isnull` (as indicated by the variable `lookup_type` at line 1310), the method should verify that the `value` (or `rhs` in other contexts) is strictly of a boolean type. If the value is not a boolean, the method should raise a `ValueError` with a message indicating that only boolean values are valid for `isnull` lookups. This additional validation step ensures that developers are immediately notified of misuse, maintaining the integrity of query construction and avoiding undesired behavior or confusing results stemming from improper use of the `__isnull` lookup.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `django/db/models/lookups.py`\n  - **Class:** `Lookup`\n  - **Methods to Adjust:** Potentially, methods such as `process_rhs` or a method specific to the `isnull` lookup should be modified or added to enforce the validation.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** In the context of the `Lookup` class, particularly for an `IsnullLookup` subclass (which might need to be located or explicitly defined if not already separate from the generic `Lookup`), override or adjust the method responsible for processing the `rhs` value. This method should include a conditional check to confirm if the lookup name is `isnull`, and if so, validate that the `rhs` value is boolean. If the validation fails, the method should raise an appropriate error signalizing the invalid use of non-boolean values with the `isnull` lookup. Implementing this behavior ensures that all `isnull` lookups, regardless of their point of origin in the codebase, are subjected to this boolean-only validation, thus unifying the treatment of `isnull` lookups across the Django ORM layer.\n\nThese locations and intended behaviors target the enforcement of stringent type checks for `isnull` lookup values, addressing the issue's core requirement to prevent confusion and improve consistency in how `isnull` lookups are handled within Django's ORM."
