Given the previous result appears to have encountered an environment setup issue rather than the specific bug in question, assuming your development environment correctly installs scikit-learn and does not encounter the same build or import issues as described, here is how a `reproducer.py` file should be written to aim at reproducing the reported bug:

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_adaboost_base_estimator_none():
    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
    try:
        # Attempt to initialize AdaBoostClassifier with base_estimator set to None
        clf = AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator=None)
        clf.fit([[1]], [0])
        # If the operation completes without error, the issue is presumed fixed
        print("Test Passed: No issue detected.")
    except Exception as e:
        # If an exception occurs, it means the issue is still present
        # Print the stack trace using the provided function
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Raise an AssertionError to indicate failure
        raise AssertionError("AdaBoost `base_estimator=None` handling failed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_adaboost_base_estimator_none()
        exit(0) # Indicate successful execution (from the script's perspective)
    except AssertionError:
        exit(1) # Indicate script detected the problem and reproduced the issue correctly
```

To use this, ensure your environment already has scikit-learn installed correctly, preferably at version 1.2.2 or another within the range where this issue is present. If the environment issue persists, it indicates a problem outside the scope of this test script, likely requiring a fix in your environment's setup or a reinstallation of scikit-learn.
