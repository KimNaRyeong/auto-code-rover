To resolve the issue, this function needs to be updated or the constraints for `base_estimator` need adjustment to explicitly allow `None` as a valid value. Since `base_estimator` has been deprecated in favor of `estimator`, its validation must handle both the deprecation gracefully and support `None` to maintain backward compatibility. Providing a clear path for how `None` is treated (either as an acceptable value during the transition or by implementing a fallback mechanism when `base_estimator` is `None`) is crucial. This might include adjusting the parameter constraints definition for `base_estimator` to include `None` as a valid option or handling the deprecation case more explicitly within the validation logic."

The key is to ensure that the transition from `base_estimator` to `estimator` does not break existing codebases that rely on the default behavior of `base_estimator=None`. This could involve adding logic within the constructor or a related method that checks for the presence of `base_estimator` and handles its deprecation and value of `None` appropriately, ensuring users who have not yet migrated to the new `estimator` parameter do not experience errors."
