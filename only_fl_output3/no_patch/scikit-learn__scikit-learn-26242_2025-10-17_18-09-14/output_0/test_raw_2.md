It appears the original issue got mixed up with environment-specific issues related to scikit-learn's installation. To ensure we focus on the task at hand, let's create a `reproducer.py` file that properly attempts to reproduce the reported AdaBoost `base_estimator=None` deprecation issue as initially described. This script assumes that your scikit-learn installation is free from the environmental/build issues previously encountered:

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
    try:
        # Attempt to initialize AdaBoostClassifier with base_estimator set to None
        clf = AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator=None)
        clf.fit([[1]], [0])
        # If no exception is thrown, the issue is considered fixed and the script indicates success
        print("Success: The issue with 'base_estimator=None' is resolved.")
    except Exception as e:
        # If an exception is caught, the script prints the stack trace and raises an AssertionError
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "The issue with 'base_estimator=None' persists."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script, when executed in a clean and correctly set up environment with the relevant version of scikit-learn where this issue exists (around 1.2.x as per the issue description), should either fail by printing a stack trace and an `AssertionError` if the issue is still present, or succeed and print a success message if the issue has been resolved. 

It's important to note that this script assumes the presence of Scikit-Learn 1.2 versions where the deprecation was introduced and the handling of `None` for `base_estimator` could lead to an exception. Future versions of Scikit-Learn may address this issue, at which point the script would indicate the problem has been resolved.
