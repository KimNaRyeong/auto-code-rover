Bug locations and intended behavior:\n\n### Location 1:\n- **File**: sympy/physics/quantum/tensorproduct.py\n- **Class**: TensorProduct\n- **Method**: _eval_expand_tensorproduct\n\n**Intended Behavior**:\nThe `_eval_expand_tensorproduct` method's behavior should be enhanced or corrected to properly handle the expansion of powers of tensor products. It needs to identify when it is operating on a power of a tensor product and apply the correct algebraic expansion rules for such cases. This might involve checking if the expression is an instance of `Pow` and, if so, ensuring that the tensor product is correctly expanded according to tensor algebra rules, possibly by recursively applying the tensor product rules or leveraging properties of exponents and multiplication within the context of tensor products. This behavior should preserve existing functionality for other types of tensor product expansions (e.g., scalar distribution, associative laws) while correctly handling power expansions.\n\n### Location 2:\n- **File**: sympy/physics/quantum/tensorproduct.py\n- **Function**: tensor_product_simp\n\n**Intended Behavior**:\nThe `tensor_product_simp` function should accurately simplify expressions involving powers of tensor products. Specifically, when encountering a `Pow` object that represents a power of a tensor product, it should ensure the simplification is consistent with the mathematical properties of tensor products and powers. This might involve enhancing the current logic that simplifies or combines tensor products to recognize and apply simplification rules that are specifically tailored to powers of tensor products, such as distributing the power across the tensor product or combining like terms in a way that reflects the mathematical properties specific to tensor products. The goal is to make `tensor_product_simp` more robust in handling various expressions involving tensor products, especially powers, without affecting its ability to simplify other forms of tensor product expressions."
