For this, I'll need to look into the implementation of fixture handling, particularly how fixtures are registered, how their metadata (including scopes) is stored, and how the `--fixtures` command line option is processed to display the fixture information.\n\n1.

        "content": "Let's analyze the collected context based on the results from our API calls to better understand how it relates to the issue of displaying fixture scopes with `pytest --fixtures`.\n\n### Analyzing `parse_known_args` Method\n\n**Location**: `src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py`\n\n**Code Analysis**: This method parses known command-line arguments and returns a namespace object with these arguments. Given its placement within `argparsing.py`, it's fundamental to how pytest handles all command-line arguments, including potentially `--fixtures`.\n\n**Relation to Issue**: Since this method is responsible for parsing command-line arguments, enhancements to include fixture scope information with the `--fixtures` argument would likely require modifications at or downstream from this method. Understanding how arguments are parsed can provide insight into where to inject the new feature.\n\n**Intended Behavior**: The intended behavior after addressing the issue would likely involve extending the argument parsing or handling mechanism to include an additional step or check for the `--fixtures` argument that then triggers retrieval and display of fixture scopes.\n\n### Analyzing `def fixture(` Search Results\n\n**Found in**: Several files, most notably `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` among others.\n\n**Code Analysis**: The presence of `def fixture(` in various files suggests these are definitions or uses of fixtures within the test suite of pytest itself, or examples on how fixtures can be defined. The actual registration and handling of fixtures likely occur in `fixtures.py`.\n\n**Relation to Issue**: While not directly touching on the registration or scope management of fixtures, the presence of fixture definitions in `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` indicates it's a crucial file for understanding how fixtures are managed. Any modification to display fixture scopes could require changes where fixtures are handled or defined, especially in how they're registered or documented.\n\n### Analyzing `--fixtures` Search Results\n\n**Found in**: Multiple files, with a concentration in `testing/python/fixtures.py` and `src/_pytest/python.py`.\n\n**Code Analysis**: The appearance of `--fixtures` in several locations indicates places where the logic related to displaying fixtures upon request is implemented or tested. Specifically, `src/_pytest/python.py` and `testing/python/fixtures.py` likely contain the logic to display fixtures and their descriptions when the `--fixtures` argument is used.\n\n**Relation to Issue**: These files are likely critical in implementing the requested feature. Understanding how fixture listing is currently implemented will be key to extending it to include scope information.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven the above analysis, the next steps would involve:\n\n1. Diving deeper into `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` and `src/_pytest/python.py` to understand how fixture scopes are stored and could be accessed or extended to include in the output when `--fixtures` is used.\n2. Investigating the current implementation within `src/_pytest/python.py` (identified from the `--fixtures` search) for displaying fixture data to see where scope information could be integrated.\n\n### Additional API Calls Needed\n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"register\", \"src/_pytest/fixtures.py\")`: To find how fixtures are registered, since the direct search for `register_fixture` returned no results. Fixture registration likely involves scope handling.\n2. `search_method_in_file(\"show_fixtures\", \"src/_pytest/python.py\")`: This is an anticipatory search based on naming conventions, aimed at identifying the method responsible for handling the `--fixtures` output, directly addressing the feature mentioned in the issue.\n\nThese calls are selected to focus more closely on where the issue could be resolved by understanding fixture registration and the current mechanism for listing fixtures in response to command-line arguments."

To resolve the issue, a modification or extension of the method handling the `--fixtures` output is needed to include scope information alongside each fixture's description. This addition should not alter the existing functionality but rather augment the output to include each fixture's scope (e.g., function, class, module, package, or session). The scope information is crucial for developers to understand the applicability and lifecycle of a fixture without having to delve into the source code or documentation externally.\n    \n- **Bug Location 2**: \n    - **File**: `src/_pytest/fixtures.py`\n    - **Intended Behavior**: Since this file is central to fixture handling, including registration and metadata management, it's likely that enhancements here are necessary for extracting and maintaining scope information about fixtures. Specifically, adjustments or additions to the methods responsible for registering and storing fixture metadata should ensure that scope information is readily available and correctly associated with each fixture. This information then needs to be accessible to whatever mechanism `src/_pytest/python.py` uses to list fixtures so that it can be included in the output. This improvement requires careful integration to preserve existing fixture functionalities, such as fixture discovery, registration, and use within tests, while adding the scope dimension for each fixture in the listing provided to the user.\n    \nThe approach to resolving the issue involves extending current functionalities with minimal alterations to existing logics, ensuring backward compatibility and preservation of pytest's existing capabilities."
