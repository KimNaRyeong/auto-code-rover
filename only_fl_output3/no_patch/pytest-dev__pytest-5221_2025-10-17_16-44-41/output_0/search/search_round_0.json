        "content": "To address the issue of showing fixture scopes with `pytest --fixtures`, I need to gather more context on how fixtures are currently being displayed by pytest and where the scope of a fixture is defined and used in the pytest codebase. For this, I'll need to look into the implementation of fixture handling, particularly how fixtures are registered, how their metadata (including scopes) is stored, and how the `--fixtures` command line option is processed to display the fixture information.\n\n1. First, I would search for the method that handles the `--fixtures` command line argument to understand how fixtures are listed.\n2. Next, I need to find the class or method responsible for registering fixtures and storing their metadata, including scope.\n3. Finally, it might also be helpful to look into how the fixture's metadata is retrieved and formatted for display.\n\nGiven these objectives, here are the search API calls I would make:\n\n- `search_method(\"parse_known_args\")`: This could help locate the method where command line arguments are parsed, including `--fixtures`.\n- `search_method(\"register_fixture\")`: If pytest uses a method resembling this name to register fixtures, it could lead us directly to where fixture metadata is handled.\n- `search_code(\"def fixture(\")`: Since fixtures are often defined with a `@pytest.fixture` decorator, searching for this pattern can help identify how fixtures are being registered and their scope managed in the codebase.\n- `search_code(\"--fixtures\")`: This might help find the specific part of the code that deals with the `--fixtures` command line option."
