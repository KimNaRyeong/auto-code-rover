To resolve the issue, a modification or extension of the method handling the `--fixtures` output is needed to include scope information alongside each fixture's description. This addition should not alter the existing functionality but rather augment the output to include each fixture's scope (e.g., function, class, module, package, or session). The scope information is crucial for developers to understand the applicability and lifecycle of a fixture without having to delve into the source code or documentation externally."

        "intended_behavior": "Since this file is central to fixture handling, including registration and metadata management, it's likely that enhancements here are necessary for extracting and maintaining scope information about fixtures. Specifically, adjustments or additions to the methods responsible for registering and storing fixture metadata should ensure that scope information is readily available and correctly associated with each fixture. This information then needs to be accessible to whatever mechanism `src/_pytest/python.py` uses to list fixtures so that it can be included in the output. This improvement requires careful integration to preserve existing fixture functionalities, such as fixture discovery, registration, and use within tests, while adding the scope dimension for each fixture in the listing provided to the user."
