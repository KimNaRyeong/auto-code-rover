Additionally, exploring how LaTeX is utilized in the documentation could give insights into how to automate the generation of LaTeX equations as suggested in the issue. Therefore, I suggest the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Catalan\")` - To find the `Catalan` class in the codebase.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"rewrite\", \"Catalan\")` - To check if there's already a `rewrite` method within the `Catalan` class that can be extended or needs modification.\n3. `search_method(\"rewrite\")` - To identify how the `rewrite` method is implemented across other classes, which can provide insights into implementing it for `Catalan`.\n4. `search_code(\"latex\")` - This would help in understanding how LaTeX is currently generated or included in the documentation, providing a starting point for automating the process."
