In many cases we could generate those equations ourselves instead of typing them manually (I found errors while doing #11014 for example).\nThis PR should demonstrate the idea.  @asmeurer what do you think?  Will this work?  Its certainly nice for maintainance, although it is probably slightly less readable...\n(If we want to do this widely, the latex printer could probably be optimized for things like `^{2}` and when it uses `\\left(` instead of `(`.)\n#### Release notes\n* core\n* Catalan can be rewritten as a sum\n</issue>"

        "content": "To better understand and resolve the issue, we need to get more context about where and how `S.Catalan` is currently implemented and examine any existing instances of `.rewrite()` method within similar contexts. Additionally, exploring how LaTeX is utilized in the documentation could give insights into how to automate the generation of LaTeX equations as suggested in the issue. Therefore, I suggest the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Catalan\")` - To find the `Catalan` class in the codebase.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"rewrite\", \"Catalan\")` - To check if there's already a `rewrite` method within the `Catalan` class that can be extended or needs modification.\n3. `search_method(\"rewrite\")` - To identify how the `rewrite` method is implemented across other classes, which can provide insights into implementing it for `Catalan`.\n4. `search_code(\"latex\")` - This would help in understanding how LaTeX is currently generated or included in the documentation, providing a starting point for automating the process."
