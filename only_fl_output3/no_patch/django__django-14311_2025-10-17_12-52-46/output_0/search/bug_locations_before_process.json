It must preserve the entire path without erroneously truncating it. The autoreload system should watch for changes in the specific module path and trigger a reload when changes occur. This includes correctly handling the module's path to ensure that paths like `foo.bar.baz` are not mistakenly handled as `foo.bar`."

It needs to ensure that the full module path is retained and passed correctly to the autoreload system, facilitating proper monitoring for changes. This implies that the command should carefully parse the `-m` option and ensure that the autoreloader is set up with the full, undistorted module path."
