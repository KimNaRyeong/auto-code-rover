To understand where and how `model_to_dict` is defined, we should look at its implementation:\n   - `search_method(\"model_to_dict\")`\n\n2. Since the PR mentions a critical condition that needs to be changed, it might be helpful to look directly at where this condition is used:\n   - `search_code(\"if fields and f.name not in fields:\")`\n\nThese calls should give us the relevant segments of code to understand the function's current behavior and to make appropriate modifications as described in the issue."
