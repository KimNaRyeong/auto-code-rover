        "intended_behavior": "The condition `if fields and f.name not in fields:` should be altered to `if fields is not None and f.name not in fields:`. This change ensures that `model_to_dict` will return an empty dictionary when called with `fields=[]`, as opposed to returning a dictionary with all fields. This behavior aligns with the expected functionality, where specifying an empty list for `fields` explicitly requests no fields to be included in the output. The rest of the method's functionality, including its handling of the `exclude` parameter and its process for gathering data from the provided instance, should remain unchanged to preserve existing behavior when `fields` is specified or `None`."
