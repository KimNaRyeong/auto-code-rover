        "intended_behavior": "The expand_trig function should be enhanced to include the expansion logic for the hyperbolic functions csch and sech similar to how it currently expands other trigonometric functions like sin, cos, tan, etc., and hyperbolic functions like tanh. This entails devising and implementing expansion rules for csch and sech that are analogous to the existing ones for csc and sec, which are expressed in terms of reciprocal trigonometric functions in the denominator. The new implementation should detect expressions containing csch and sech and apply these new rules without affecting the current functionality for other functions. This could involve adding conditional checks within the method to identify csch and sech specifically and then applying the appropriate expansion formulae that can express csch(x + y) and sech(x + y) in expanded form, leveraging their definitions and properties in hyperbolic function terms."

This can include adding helper methods or properties that explicitly define how csch should be expanded when passed to expand_trig, potentially aiding in the construction of the expansion rule to be implemented in expand_trig."

Ensuring that sech can be identified and properly expanded when encountered in an expression by expand_trig means possibly defining new helper methods or properties that align with how its expansion should be carried out, in line with the issue's demand for coherent expansion rules that resemble those of other trigonometric and hyperbolic functions."
