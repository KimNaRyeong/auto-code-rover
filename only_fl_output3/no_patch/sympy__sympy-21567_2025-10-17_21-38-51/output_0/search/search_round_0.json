Additionally, we'll need to identify the implementations of `csch` and `sech` to understand how they can be expanded within the `expand_trig` function, similar to `csc` and `sec`.\n\nTherefore, I will start by searching for the `expand_trig` function to see how it is implemented and where it might be extended to include support for `csch` and `sech`.\n\nNext, I will look for the classes or methods that implement `csch` and `sech` to understand their structure and how they are currently being handled in the codebase. This will provide insight into how they need to be extended in the `expand_trig` function.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls:\n- search_method(\"expand_trig\")\n- search_class(\"csch\")\n- search_class(\"sech\")"
