        "content": "Analyzing the gathered context from the search results, we can derive insights for each of the targeted queries:\n\n1. **`expand_trig` Method in `sympy/core/function.py`:**\n   - **What does this part of the code do?**\n     The `expand_trig` function in `sympy` acts as a wrapper around the core `expand` method, specifically focusing on expanding trigonometric expressions. It accepts an expression and applies trigonometric expansion rules to it.\n   - **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n     The issue in discussion pertains to the inability of the `expand_trig` method to handle and properly expand expressions involving hyperbolic functions `csch` and `sech`, whereas it can handle similar operations for other trigonometric and hyperbolic functions such as `csc`, `sec`, and `tanh`. The reported bug lies in the expansion process or in the way `expand_trig` selectively applies expansions.\n   - **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n     Given the issue description, `expand_trig` should be capable of recognizing expressions involving `csch` and `sech` and apply similar expansion rules as it does for other functions like `sinh`, `cosh`, `sec`, and `csc`, i.e., expanding these in terms of `sinh` and `cosh` to match how `csc` and `sec` are handled in terms of `sin` and `cos`.\n\n2. **`csch` Class in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`:**\n   - **What does this part of the code do?**\n     This class represents the hyperbolic cosecant function, `csch`. It inherits from `ReciprocalHyperbolicFunction` and defines its behavior, including differentiation, rewrites, and some properties like oddness.\n   - **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n     Since the issue is about expanding `csch` using `expand_trig`, the implementation and properties of the `csch` function could be essential for determining the right expansion rules or identifying if current functionality lacks the proper handling within the `expand_trig` methodology.\n   - **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n     To address the issue, the `csch` class (or potentially the places it is used in expansion contexts) may need to be updated or extended to provide clear rules or mechanisms by which `expand_trig` can operate on it effectively.\n\n3. **`sech` Class in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`:**\n   - **What does this part of the code do?**\n     Similar to `csch`, the `sech` class implements the hyperbolic secant function, marking its properties, differentiation rules, and potential rewrites. It designates it as an even function, analogously to its cosine counterpart.\n   - **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n     The `sech` class is directly related to the reported issue as it outlines the part of the functionality not being expanded as expected by `expand_trig`. Understanding its current implementation may shed light on deficiencies or areas for enhancement within the `expand_trig` logic.\n   - **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n     For the `sech` function to be properly expanded by `expand_trig`, either the `sech` class itself or the way `expand_trig` interacts with it might need adjustments. The intended behavior would involve detailed rules or mechanisms that allow `expand_trig` to recognize and expand `sech` expressions in a manner aligned with expansions for other trigonometric and hyperbolic functions.\n\nGiven this analysis, it would be prudent to examine how `expand_trig` currently expands expressions to ensure any modifications for expanding `csch` and `sech` align with the overarching design and functionality of the `expand` system in SymPy. Additional steps might include looking into the `expand` method itself or identifying specific expansion rules for hyperbolic functions within the codebase."

This entails devising and implementing expansion rules for `csch` and `sech` that are analogous to the existing ones for `csc` and `sec`, which are expressed in terms of reciprocal trigonometric functions in the denominator. The new implementation should detect expressions containing `csch` and `sech` and apply these new rules without affecting the current functionality for other functions. This could involve adding conditional checks within the method to identify `csch` and `sech` specifically and then applying the appropriate expansion formulae that can express `csch(x + y)` and `sech(x + y)` in expanded form, leveraging their definitions and properties in hyperbolic function terms.\n   \n   - **Bug Location 2:**\n     - **File:** `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`\n     - **Class:** `csch`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** While the `csch` class itself may not directly contain buggy code related to this issue, it might be necessary to extend its functionality or annotations to better facilitate its recognition and proper handling within `expand_trig`. This can include adding helper methods or properties that explicitly define how `csch` should be expanded when passed to `expand_trig`, potentially aiding in the construction of the expansion rule to be implemented in `expand_trig`.\n\n   - **Bug Location 3:**\n     - **File:** `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`\n     - **Class:** `sech`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** Similar to `csch`, the `sech` class might require enhancements or additional annotations to support its expansion via `expand_trig`. Ensuring that `sech` can be identified and properly expanded when encountered in an expression by `expand_trig` means possibly defining new helper methods or properties that align with how its expansion should be carried out, in line with the issue's demand for coherent expansion rules that resemble those of other trigonometric and hyperbolic functions.\n\nThese modifications aim to preserve and extend the `expand_trig` functionality to comprehensively include hyperbolic functions `csch` and `sech`, ensuring the method's utility remains broad and consistent across different types of trigonometric and hyperbolic expressions."
