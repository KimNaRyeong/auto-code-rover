        "intended_behavior": "This function should ensure that it operates within the context of the correct database when Django is configured with multiple databases, and possibly no default database set explicitly. The update operation wrapped within the `transaction.atomic()` should explicitly specify the database to use based on Django\u2019s database routing or migration's target database settings, rather than defaulting implicitly. This would prevent the `ImproperlyConfigured` exception from being raised due to the absence of a default database or misconfiguration. To preserve existing functionality while resolving the issue, the function could be modified to:\n\n- Determine the appropriate database for executing the migration script, either from the `using` argument passed to migration operations or by consulting the application's database routing configuration.\n- Apply this database selection when calling `transaction.atomic(using=<appropriate_database_alias>)` and when querying or modifying `Permission` objects, ensuring that all database operations are routed to the intended database.\n\nThis approach will maintain the integrity and intention of the migration while making it compatible with environments where the default database is not set, thus adhering to Django\u2019s documentation and support for multiple databases without requiring a default."
