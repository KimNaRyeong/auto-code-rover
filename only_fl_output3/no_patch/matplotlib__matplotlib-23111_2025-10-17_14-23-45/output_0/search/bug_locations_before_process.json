        "intended_behavior": "This method needs to ensure no invalid `delta` values (such as negative values or zero) are used in a way that would result in a `math domain error` when applying `math.log10(delta)`. The fix should introduce either a pre-validation check or an adjusted calculation approach to handle cases where `delta` could lead to such errors. It should retain its primary functionality of calculating significant digits but with added guards against these edge cases. Specifically, it could ensure `delta` is always positive and non-zero by adjusting it to a minimal positive value if the computed `delta` is not suitable for `math.log10()`. This change will prevent domain errors when hovering over images with uniform data values, preserving the method's ability to format cursor data across the diverse range of possible inputs."

        "intended_behavior": "While the direct cause of the math domain error lies within `_g_sig_digits`, ensuring that `format_cursor_data` contributes positively to robust error handling is beneficial. If further investigation reveals that `format_cursor_data` plays a part in passing unexpected `delta` values to `_g_sig_digits`, a safeguard or pre-validation could be implemented here as well. For instance, ensuring that `delta` is derived or passed along in a way that anticipates and corrects for edge cases\u2014such as uniform data ranges\u2014before it reaches `_g_sig_digits`. The intended behavior is to continue enabling precise, context-sensitive cursor data formatting, particularly for use cases like `imshow`, without risking unexpected exceptions from downstream processing."
