        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, let's address the questions for each piece of returned information:\n\n### Analysis of `_g_sig_digits` in `cbook/__init__.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The function `_g_sig_digits` computes the number of significant digits to format a given value, considering an error margin (`delta`). It calculates how many significant digits should be displayed based on the absolute value of the data and the error range around it. The presence of a check for `delta == 0` and the adjustment with `np.spacing(value)`, an edge case handling for infinitesimally small deltas, are crucial.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The bug is triggered because there's an issue with computing the number of significant digits when the delta becomes negative or leads to a scenario where `math.log10(delta)` fails due to `delta` being zero or negative. This function directly contributes to the bug when `delta` calculation does not anticipate negative or zero deltas in contexts like this one, leading to a `ValueError: math domain error`.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be to gracefully handle cases where `delta` could lead to invalid inputs for `math.log10()`. It implies that there should be either a validation step for `delta` before applying `math.log10()` or a more robust error handling mechanism to ensure that values like `-1` do not result in a crash.\n\n### Analysis of `format_cursor_data` in `matplotlib/artist.py`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - This function formats cursor data into a string representation. For singular data points associated with a `ScalarMappable` artist (like images shown with `imshow`), it handles the visualization of data at cursor locations. The calculation of significant digits for the data representation relies on `_g_sig_digits`.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - It is directly related to the bug because the error occurs while trying to format cursor data when hovering over an imshow plot. The calculation of significant digits through `_g_sig_digits`, and in particular the handling of scalar mappable data, are central to reproducing the bug scenario. This method's logic for determining the number of significant digits directly influences the failure.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior is to correctly display the cursor data in the plot's overlay, regardless of the data range or uniformity (all negative values in this case). It should handle edge cases where the data does not vary (all values are identical) without throwing errors, ensuring that cursor data is displayed in a useful and informative manner.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven these analyses, to better understand the source of negative or zero delta values that might be causing this bug, it may be necessary to explore how `delta` is computed or derived before it's passed to `_g_sig_digits`. Specifically:\n\n- Understanding the call chain that leads to `_g_sig_digits` from `imshow` - Not directly searcheable without more context, but one could look into the handling of mouse movement events or data range computations.\n- Further explore the interaction between `format_cursor_data` and the values it operates on when called in scenarios like the issue describes. Considering the lack of direct hits for `plt.imshow(test)`, it might be worthwhile to look for methods that handle cursor events or data mapping in imshow or related classes (e.g., `ScalarMappable` or cursor event handlers).\n\nThis analysis points toward potential fixes such as ensuring `delta` is always positive and non-zero before calling `_g_sig_digits`, or adding safeguards within `_g_sig_digits` itself against invalid input values."

        "content": "2. Bug Locations:\n\n### Location 1:\n- **File:** `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py`\n- **Method:** `_g_sig_digits`\n\n**Intended Behavior:** This method needs to ensure no invalid `delta` values (such as negative values or zero) are used in a way that would result in a `math domain error` when applying `math.log10(delta)`. The fix should introduce either a pre-validation check or an adjusted calculation approach to handle cases where `delta` could lead to such errors. It should retain its primary functionality of calculating significant digits but with added guards against these edge cases. Specifically, it could ensure `delta` is always positive and non-zero by adjusting it to a minimal positive value if the computed `delta` is not suitable for `math.log10()`. This change will prevent domain errors when hovering over images with uniform data values, preserving the method's ability to format cursor data across the diverse range of possible inputs.\n\n### Location 2:\n- **File:** `lib/matplotlib/artist.py`\n- **Method:** `format_cursor_data`\n\n**Intended Behavior:** While the direct cause of the math domain error lies within `_g_sig_digits`, ensuring that `format_cursor_data` contributes positively to robust error handling is beneficial. If further investigation reveals that `format_cursor_data` plays a part in passing unexpected `delta` values to `_g_sig_digits`, a safeguard or pre-validation could be implemented here as well. For instance, ensuring that `delta` is derived or passed along in a way that anticipates and corrects for edge cases\u2014such as uniform data ranges\u2014before it reaches `_g_sig_digits`. The intended behavior is to continue enabling precise, context-sensitive cursor data formatting, particularly for use cases like `imshow`, without risking unexpected exceptions from downstream processing.\n"
