        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to collect relevant code context about the Django middleware mechanism, specifically around the `AuthenticationMiddleware`, `MessageMiddleware`, and `SessionMiddleware`. Based on the issue, we also need to examine the system checks related to middleware order and dependencies, as well as the `process_request` method of `AuthenticationMiddleware` where the exception is raised.\n\nLet's start with these API calls:\n\n1. **search_class(\"AuthenticationMiddleware\")**: This call will help us locate the file and class definition of `AuthenticationMiddleware`, which is critical since we need to understand how it's implemented and where exactly the `AssertionError` is raised.\n\n2. **search_class(\"SessionMiddleware\")**: Knowing where `SessionMiddleware` is defined will help us understand its role and functionalities, aiding in the resolution of the dependency issue mentioned.\n\n3. **search_method(\"process_request\")**: Given that the issue specifically mentions an error in `process_request`, finding all instances of this method could lead us to the correct implementation within `AuthenticationMiddleware` to examine the conditions leading to the AssertionError.\n\n4. **search_code(\"MIDDLEWARE = []\")**: This code snippet represents an empty middleware setting. Searching for this might help us find where in the Django documentation or checks framework the initial checks (admin.E408, admin.E409, admin.E410) are implemented, though the specific implementation may vary.\n\n5. **search_method(\"check\")**: Since the issue mentions that the order of errors (admin.E410, specifically) should trigger a system check rather than an exception, finding all system check methods can help us understand how Django performs these checks and where to integrate the improvement for middleware order validation."
