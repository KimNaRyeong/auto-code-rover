        "intended_behavior": "The `delete_cookie` method in `HttpResponseBase` needs to be modified to ensure it correctly handles cookie attributes, specifically the `SameSite` attribute, when instructing browsers to delete a cookie. The method should be updated to accept additional parameters for `samesite`, `secure` (while maintaining its current behavior that sets `secure=True` for cookies prefixed with `__Secure-` or `__Host-`), and `httponly`. This change allows for explicit control over these attributes when deleting cookies, ensuring that cookies are deleted in a manner compliant with modern browser security requirements. Ensure that the `samesite` attribute of the cookie is preserved or explicitly set when expiring cookies. Given the issue's context, a reasonable default behavior would ideally align with the application's global settings (`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE`). However, providing the option to specify this attribute allows for flexibility in cases where different behavior is desired. Modify the invocation of `self.set_cookie` within `delete_cookie` method to include these new parameters. For example, `self.set_cookie(key, max_age=0, path=path, domain=domain, secure=secure, httponly=httponly, samesite=samesite, expires='Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT')`. This ensures that when a cookie is set to be deleted, it will also include the correct `Secure` and `SameSite` attributes as needed. This updated behavior will address the issue by ensuring cookies are deleted in a way that is compliant with browser security requirements and avoids generating warnings about cookies being set without the necessary attributes."
