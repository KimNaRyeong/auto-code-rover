This could involve directly converting these columns to a supported type within the method before further processing or adjusting the call to the underlying readers to ensure `datetime64` can be processed as an acceptable type. This adjustment would enable the reading of ECSV files with `datetime64` columns, thereby preserving the ability to load timeseries data saved with older versions of Astropy."

        "intended_behavior": "The `get_cols` method within the ECSV reader needs to adjust its strict type checking logic to allow `datetime64` as a valid datatype or implement a mechanism to convert `datetime64` to an acceptable format within the context of the ECSV reader's expectations. The adjustment should ensure backward compatibility by allowing older ECSV files with `datetime64` columns to be read successfully while also maintaining the integrity of the data being read. This could involve explicitly checking for `datetime64` and either accepting it as-is or transforming it into a 'string' or another supported type that preserves the temporal information for further processing by Astropy's timeseries and table functionalities."
