This seems inconsistent, so can we try and make things more consistent for the 3.1 release? (I see this as bug-like, so I think it can be addressed after feature freeze).\nNote that this is related to https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/8003 - if we change the default cosmology to Planck 2015, then we can change the ``thermodynamic_temperature`` equivalency to use the default cosmology without changing results (for now).\n</issue>"

The functionalities and code snippets in question pertain to:\n\n- The default behavior of the `thermodynamic_temperature` equivalency using `Planck15` cosmology for `T_cmb`.\n- The behavior of the `with_H0` equivalency using the default cosmology, which is currently `WMAP9` for `H0`.\n- The implementation and default settings of cosmology within the Astropy project, especially how `Planck15` and `WMAP9` cosmologies are employed and potentially how the default cosmology can be set or changed.\n\nTo accomplish a thorough analysis and ensure we have enough context to propose a consistent approach, I will perform the following API calls:\n\n1. Search the codebase for where `Planck15` cosmology is referenced to understand its usage context.\n2. Search the codebase for where `WMAP9` cosmology is set or used as the default to understand how and where this setting is defined.\n3. Search for the method or function that defines or interacts with the `default_cosmology` to see how it is implemented and how it can be changed.\n4. Search for the implementation of the `thermodynamic_temperature` equivalency to look at how `T_cmb` is defaulted to `Planck15`.\n5. Look for the `with_H0` equivalency function or method to understand its current implementation and how `H0` is defaulted to the current cosmology.\n\nHence, the API calls to be made are:\n\n- `search_code(\"Planck15\")`\n- `search_code(\"WMAP9\")`\n- `search_method(\"default_cosmology\")`\n- `search_code(\"thermodynamic_temperature\")`\n- `search_code(\"with_H0 equivalency\")`"
