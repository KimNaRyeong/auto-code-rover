This seems inconsistent, so can we try and make things more consistent for the 3.1 release? (I see this as bug-like, so I think it can be addressed after feature freeze).\nNote that this is related to https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/8003 - if we change the default cosmology to Planck 2015, then we can change the ``thermodynamic_temperature`` equivalency to use the default cosmology without changing results (for now).\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given the results from the API calls, let's analyze the context and findings:\n\n### Analysis of `Planck15` and `WMAP9` Results\n\n- **`Planck15` References:** Appear in `astropy/cosmology/parameters.py` and `astropy/cosmology/core.py` as well as `astropy/units/equivalencies.py`. This suggests that `Planck15` cosmology is defined within the cosmology module of Astropy and is used or referenced in the units equivalencies, likely as a default setting for certain operations or calculations that involve cosmology.\n\n- **`WMAP9` References:** Found also within `cosmology/parameters.py` and `cosmology/core.py`, indicating it's another set of cosmological parameters available within Astropy. Its role as the current default cosmology implies it's used as a standard basis for cosmological calculations unless another cosmology is explicitly specified.\n\n### Relation to The Bug\n\nThe inconsistency arises from the fact that `thermodynamic_temperature` equivalency defaults to `Planck15` for its `T_cmb` parameter, whereas equivalencies such as `with_H0` (despite the search not finding direct references, inferred from issue description) use the default cosmology, which is `WMAP9`. This inconsistency could lead to confusion or incorrect assumptions in the handling of cosmological data.\n\n### Intended Behavior\n\nIn light of the issue description, the intended behavior would be to harmonize the default cosmology across different parts of the codebase:\n1. Either by making `thermodynamic_temperature` also use the `default_cosmology.get().H0` (alongside others that might be using this pattern).\n2. By aligning the default cosmology to `Planck15`, thus by default aligning `thermodynamic_temperature` and other functions with it without explicitly changing their internal defaults.\n\n### Further Actions Based on Analysis\n\nGiven that the method search for `default_cosmology` yielded no direct results, and the `with_H0 equivalency` search did not return any relevant snippets, it suggests that the correct API calls might involve more specific terms or potentially a broader search. The absence of direct hits may imply that:\n\n1. The naming convention or the implementation details might differ slightly than what is referenced in the issue or anticipated, suggesting a need to search with variations or look into files where defaults are likely set or modified.\n2. There's a possibility that the relevant configuration or functionality is spread out or implemented in ways that aren't captured by the initial search strings.\n\n### Adjustments for Further Context Gathering\n\nGiven the analysis, further API calls could include:\n\n- Broader or variant search terms for the missing parts, like looking directly into specific files (`cosmology/parameters.py`, `cosmology/core.py`, `units/equivalencies.py`) for any hints on how defaults are applied or can be changed.\n- Searching for the method or functions by their usage rather than by a specific name, especially for setting or getting the default cosmology settings.\n\nTo refine the understanding, specifically:\n- `search_code_in_file(\"default_cosmology\", \"astropy/cosmology/core.py\")` or `search_method_in_file(\"get\", \"astropy/cosmology/core.py\")` to locate how the default cosmology might be set or retrieved.\n- Since the exact search for `with_H0 equivalency` did not yield results, try a broader search that could capture its implementation, like `search_code_in_file(\"H0\", \"astropy/units/equivalencies.py\")` to find how H0 is being defaulted."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

To resolve the inconsistency issue, the intended behavior should be altered to dynamically use the default cosmology, similar to how the `with_H0` equivalency (based on the issue description) operates. This means if the default cosmology is updated to, for example, Planck 2015 across the board, then `thermodynamic_temperature` would automatically align with this without explicitly referencing Planck15. Specifically, the fetching of `T_cmb` should mirror the approach taken for `H0` by leveraging `cosmology.default_cosmology.get().Tcmb0` if `T_cmb` is not provided by the user. This change would ensure consistency across equivalencies when no specific cosmology is stated, thereby preserving existing functionality while aligning with the principle of having a unified approach to default cosmological parameters.\n\n- **Location 2:** Given the issue description's mention of using `WMAP9` as the current default cosmology and considering harmonization efforts, any location in the code that explicitly sets or relies on a hardcoded reference to `WMAP9` (or any specific cosmology) for defaults might need an audit to ensure it aligns with the new approach. However, without direct references or search results pointing to specific implementations, recommending exact changes here is speculative. The general intended behavior across these unspecified locations would be to ensure that the use of default cosmology values (like `H0` or `T_cmb`) dynamically reflects the library's currently set default cosmology, rather than hardcoded values. This would involve reviewing and potentially refactoring how `WMAP9` is set or used as the default in `astropy/cosmology/parameters.py` or `astropy/cosmology/core.py`, making sure that any default cosmology usage is consistent and updates accordingly when the default cosmology setting is changed. This check-and-adjust strategy ensures that future updates or changes to the default cosmology within Astropy are seamlessly propagated through all relevant parts of the codebase, including equivalencies and beyond."
