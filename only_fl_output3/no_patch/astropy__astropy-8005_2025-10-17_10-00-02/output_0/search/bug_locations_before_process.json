        "intended_behavior": "Modify the method to use `cosmology.default_cosmology.get().Tcmb0` for the `T_cmb` parameter when `T_cmb` is not provided by the user. This aligns with the approach of using `cosmology.default_cosmology.get().H0` seen with other equivalencies, ensuring that the default cosmology used is consistent across different parts of Astropy. This change would standardize the behavior when a specific cosmology is not specified by the user and follow the principle of having a single, updatable default cosmology source that reflects the most current consensus or preferred values."
