In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n</issue>"

The implementation details of `MemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile` to understand how uploads are being handled differently.\n3.
