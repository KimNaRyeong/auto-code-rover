This method must asynchronously resolve the HTTP response for a given request object, potentially leveraging the `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` for file retrieval and response preparation. This addition will ensure that `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` can serve static files in an ASGI environment without causing `TypeError` due to a missing `get_response_async` method. The method should ideally check if the requested static file exists and is accessible; if so, return an appropriate ASGI-compatible response. If the file does not exist or cannot be served for any reason, it should fall back to the next available handler in the ASGI application chain or raise an HTTP error response asynchronously. This approach preserves the existing functionality by extending it to support asynchronous operations, remaining consistent with Django's move towards asynchronous web handling capabilities."
