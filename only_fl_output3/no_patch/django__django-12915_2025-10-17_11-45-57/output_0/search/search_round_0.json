Search for the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` class to understand its implementation and what might be missing:\n   - `search_class(\"ASGIStaticFilesHandler\")`\n\n2. Since the traceback mentions `get_response_async` is being expected in `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` or within its inheritance chain, I will search for its implementation to check if it indeed exists or where it should ideally be located:\n   - `search_method(\"get_response_async\")`\n\n3. Given that the issue points out the `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` might be missing the async response function and it's related to the encountered bug, I will look into this mixin as well:\n   - `search_class(\"StaticFilesHandlerMixin\")`\n\n4. Lastly, to understand the correct placement of `get_response_async` or how it's being intended to be used within the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler`, finding where `__call__` method of `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` is and its implementation might give some insights. Since we don't know its exact file location, I will explore this via its class directly:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__call__\", \"ASGIStaticFilesHandler\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive view of the implementation details of the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler`, `StaticFilesHandlerMixin`, and the `get_response_async` method, helping to pinpoint the cause of the issue and how it can be addressed."
