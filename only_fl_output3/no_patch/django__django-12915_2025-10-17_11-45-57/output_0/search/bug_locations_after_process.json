        "intended_behavior": "Implement the `get_response_async` method within `ASGIStaticFilesHandler`, which should asynchronously process a given request to serve static files. The method should attempt to match the requested path to a static file and, if found, asynchronously serve this file back to the client. If no file matches or if an error occurs, the method should either raise an appropriate exception or pass the request onto the next available handler in the ASGI application chain, as per ASGI's specifications. This method will closely parallel the logic in `ASGIHandler`'s `get_response_async` method, but it will specifically handle static file serving, ensuring that requests for static resources are processed efficiently and correctly in an asynchronous manner. The implementation must ensure that all static file requests that hit this handler are responded to asynchronously, in line with ASGI's protocol, and fallback mechanisms are in place for error handling or when resources are not found, thus preserving the existing functionality while enhancing it to support asynchronous execution properly."
