        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to the migration changing `ManyToManyField` target to 'self' not working correctly, we should focus on searching the code relevant to the models described and any custom migration files or admin configurations that might have influenced the error. Here are the necessary API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `Foo` model in the codebase, as it is directly related to the problem described.\n2. Search for the `Bar` model as well, even though it seems like this class does not change, understanding its relationship to `Foo` might be crucial.\n3. Because migrations are involved in causing the issue, searching for any custom migration files related to the `Foo` and `Bar` models could provide valuable insights. This is a bit tricky without knowing the exact names of the migration files, so this step will focus on identifying any direct references to migrations concerning `Foo` or `Bar` in the codebase.\n4. Lastly, since the error is encountered on the admin page, searching for any admin configuration related to `Foo` could reveal customization that assumes the old ManyToMany relationship or provides clues to the cause of the error.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Foo\")\nsearch_class(\"Bar\")\nsearch_code(\"ManyToManyField\")\nsearch_code(\"admin.site.register(Foo)\")\n```\n\nThese searches should give us a clearer understanding of how the `Foo` and `Bar` models are implemented and any custom logic that might interfere with Django's automatic migration system, especially regarding the ManyToManyField changes."
