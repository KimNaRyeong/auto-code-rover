Specifically, `deconstruct` should accurately reflect changes for migrations, ensuring the generated migration operations correctly handle self-referential relationships. Validation methods like `_check_relationship_model` should include logic to recognize and validate self-referential `ManyToManyField` configurations without erroneously flagging them during model checks."
