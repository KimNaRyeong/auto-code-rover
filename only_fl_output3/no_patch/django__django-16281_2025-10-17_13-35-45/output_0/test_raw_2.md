To address the requirement for creating a standalone `reproducer.py` file that accurately and autonomously attempts to reproduce the issue as described—changing a `ManyToManyField` target to 'self' and assessing its effect on Django migrations—below is a crafted Python script. This script integrates Django's setup and teardown mechanisms within its flow to simulate the steps leading to the potential `OperationalError`.

This standalone script encapsulates Django's model and migration handling, setting up a minimal Django environment for the purpose of migration testing. After executing the initial migration, it redefines the `Foo` model to establish a `ManyToManyField` relationship with itself, rather than with another model, and then it proceeds to execute another migration. The script aims to trigger the said `OperationalError` under the conditions described, providing a clear path to observe the issue's manifestation.

```python
import os
import sys
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models, OperationalError, connections, DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS
from django.core.management import call_command

BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

settings.configure(
    BASE_DIR=BASE_DIR,
    DEBUG=True,
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=['__main__', ],
    USE_I18N=True,
    USE_L10N=True,
    USE_TZ=True,
)

django.setup()


# Define the initial models
class Bar(models.Model):
    pass


class Foo(models.Model):
    bar = models.ManyToManyField(Bar, blank=True)


# Standalone function to print stack trace
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_migrations():
    try:
        # Initial migration
        call_command('makemigrations', verbosity=0)
        call_command('migrate', verbosity=0)

        # Modify the Foo model to have a ManyToManyField to itself
        models.signals.pre_migrate.disconnect()
        models.signals.post_migrate.disconnect()

        # Redefine models to simulate changing ManyToManyField target
        class Foo(models.Model):
            bar = models.ManyToManyField('self', blank=True)

        # Attempt to run migrations again
        call_command('makemigrations', verbosity=0)
        call_command('migrate', verbosity=0)
        print("Migration successful - Issue not present.")
        os.remove(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'))  # Cleanup
    except OperationalError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert "no such column: app_foo_bar.from_foo_id" in str(e), "Issue not triggered."
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit code 0 to indicate issue presence correctly detected
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "Unexpected error occurred."
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error due to unexpected issue
    finally:
        # Remove the database file to avoid pollution
        if os.path.exists(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3')):
            os.remove(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run_migrations()
```

Important notes on the approach and execution:
- This script assumes it is run in an environment where Django is installed and properly configured to run standalone scripts.
- The script dynamically configures Django settings inline, which includes setting up a SQLite database for migration purposes.
- After the initial migration, the `ManyToManyField` relationship in the `Foo` model is changed from targeting the `Bar` model to targeting itself. This is the core action aimed at reproducing the described issue. 
- The script should be executed in an environment where it has permission to create and delete files, given its need to create a temporary SQLite database file.
- The script deliberately triggers migrations before and after the model alteration to simulate the behavior described in the issue.
- If the issue is correctly reproduced, the script will print the stack trace of the `OperationalError` and exit with code 0, indicating the issue's occurrence. If the script catches any unexpected exceptions, it asserts failure and exits with code 1. This ensures that the script's exit code accurately reflects the test outcome.
