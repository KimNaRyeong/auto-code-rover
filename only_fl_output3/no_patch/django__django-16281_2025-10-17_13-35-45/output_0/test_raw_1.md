Given the clarification and the request for a correct script that genuinely attempts to reproduce the issue inside a standalone Python environment without relying on an existing Django project setup, here's an adjusted reproducible script. 

This time, focus is placed on ensuring the script can execute within any given Python environment with Django installed, and it sidesteps the previously encountered issue regarding the Django app label 'app'.

```python
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models, OperationalError


# Setup Django environment
def setup_django_environment():
    settings.configure(
        DEBUG=True,
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': 'db.sqlite3',
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=('__main__',),
    )
    django.setup()


# Initial models before migration
class Bar(models.Model):
    pass


class Foo(models.Model):
    bar = models.ManyToManyField('Bar', blank=True)


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def main():
    # Configures Django
    setup_django_environment()

    from django.core.management import call_command

    # Perform initial migrations 
    call_command('makemigrations', verbosity=0)
    call_command('migrate', verbosity=0)

    # Attempt to modify the Foo model to reference 'self'
    # This simulates altering the models.py file and making migrations
    models.signals.pre_migrate.disconnect(dispatch_uid='django_clear_cache')
    models.signals.post_migrate.disconnect(dispatch_uid='django_clear_cache')

    class Foo(models.Model):
        # Change applied here
        bar = models.ManyToManyField('self', blank=True)

    # Reconfigure Django to acknowledge changes
    setup_django_environment()
    
    try:
        call_command('makemigrations', verbosity=0)
        call_command('migrate', verbosity=0)
        assert False, "The second migration was expected to fail but did not."
    except OperationalError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

    # Cleanup after script
    if os.path.exists('db.sqlite3'):
        os.remove('db.sqlite3')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
Note:
- This script defines a minimal Django setting and attempts to perform a series of migrations which replicate the steps described in your issue.
- The use of Django's `call_command` directly simulates running migration commands from the command line.
- Since Django model changes cannot actually be dynamically reflected without restarting the Django environment, this script attempts to simulate the process rather directly.
- It's expected to cleanup the `db.sqlite3` file after the script runs to avoid interference with subsequent executions.
- The `AssertionError` is adjusted based on the script's flow. If the script does not exit with an exception, it indicates that the migration process did not raise an `OperationalError`, suggesting the issue might not be present. Nonetheless, due to the idiosyncrasies of Django's dynamic model handling within a single runtime, this simulation might not perfectly replicate the original issue's conditions or detect its resolution accurately.
