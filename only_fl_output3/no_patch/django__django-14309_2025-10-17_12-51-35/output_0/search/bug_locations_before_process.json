The negation method (__invert__) should correctly toggle the negation state of a Q object without inadvertently undoing the negation of nested expressions like Exists. The core of the fix should ensure that the logic of combining Q objects, especially with nested Exists, preserves the intended logical operations (including negation) correctly in all scenarios."

Whenever Exists is involved in combination operations with Q, the Q object should correctly interpret and reflect the negated state of Exists. This may involve ensuring Exists correctly toggles and reports its negated status to the Q object during combination operations, or it interacts properly with Q's internal logic to maintain the integrity of the intended logic after being combined or negated."
