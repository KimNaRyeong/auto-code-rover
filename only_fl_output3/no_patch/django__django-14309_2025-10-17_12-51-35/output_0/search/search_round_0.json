        "content": "For resolving the issue described, we should gather more information about how the `Q` and `Exists` classes are implemented and interact with each other in Django's codebase. The issue specifically points to a problematic behavior when combining an empty `Q` object with a negated `Exists` object, which suggests that we should look into the implementation details of these classes and their combination logic.\n\nLet's start with the following search API calls to get the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Q\")` - This will help us understand how the `Q` class is structured, and potentially how it handles logical operations like `&` (AND) and negation (`~`).\n\n2. `search_class(\"Exists\")` - Since the issue involves the `Exists` class, we need to see how it's implemented, especially any logic that might be related to its interaction with `Q` objects or negation.\n\n3. `search_method(\"combine\")` - Given that the issue description implies a problem during the combination of `Q` and `Exists` objects, finding where and how the `combine` method is implemented might reveal insights into why negation isn't working as expected.\n\nThese searches should give us a good starting point to understand the root cause of the issue and guide us towards crafting a patch."
