Adding 0, d.tzinfo arguments to the datetime.datetime call seems to fix this.\nHappy to send a PR.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to the `timesince()` function with `USE_TZ=True` and intervals longer than one month, I will invoke the following search API calls:\n\n1. Search for the implementation of the `timesince` method to understand its current handling of datetime objects, especially the logic that leads to the TypeError mentioned in the issue:\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"timesince\")\n```\n\n2. Given the mention of a specific commit and a specific portion of code within `timesince.py`, it's essential to look at the existing code around the problematic pivot instantiation. The issue description hints at the relevant lines, but to ensure accuracy, I'll gather the surrounding context of the mentioned lines. Assuming the mentioned lines (93-100) are accurate references to the source of the issue, I'll look around these lines for more details:\n\n```python\nget_code_around_line(\"django/utils/timesince.py\", 96, 10)\n```\n\n3. Since the issue description implies a modification to the instantiation of a `datetime` object within `timesince()`, understanding how `timezone.now()` is implemented might also provide valuable context, especially since `USE_TZ=True` affects how datetimes are handled:\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"now\")\n```\n\n4. The test case provided in the issue description references the testing setup for this bug, including decorators like `requires_tz_support` and `override_settings`. It might be beneficial to look at these to understand how they configure the test environment for timezone support:\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"requires_tz_support\")\nsearch_method(\"override_settings\")\n```\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive view of the current implementation of `timesince`, how datetimes are being handled in relation to timezones, and the testing environment setup related to the issue."
