        "intended_behavior": "The `pivot` datetime object instantiation within the `timesince` method does not currently account for timezone information. This oversight leads to a TypeError when subtracting timezone-aware and timezone-naive datetime objects, particularly visible when `USE_TZ=True` is set in Django settings. The intended behavior here should be amended to ensure the `pivot` datetime object respects the timezone information of the `d` datetime object. If `d` is timezone-aware, the `pivot` should be created with the same timezone information. This adjustment would preserve the existing functionality of accurately calculating and displaying the time since `d`, with the added correctness of handling timezone-aware datetime objects without raising errors."
