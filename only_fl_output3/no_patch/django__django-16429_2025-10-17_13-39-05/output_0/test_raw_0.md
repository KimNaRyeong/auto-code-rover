To reproduce the issue described, we will create a `reproducer.py` script that sets the `USE_TZ` setting to `True`, creates a datetime object more than a month in the past (to simulate the issue), and attempts to use the `timesince` method from Django. This script will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, demonstrating the `TypeError` when trying to subtract an offset-naive and an offset-aware datetime. If the issue is fixed, the script should exit with code 0.

```python
# reproducer.py
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from django.conf import settings
from django.utils import timezone
from django.utils.timesince import timesince

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_long_interval_with_tz():
    settings.configure(USE_TZ=True)
    now = timezone.now()
    past_date = now - timedelta(days=31)
    try:
        result = timesince(past_date)
        assert "month" in result, "The timesince function did not return expected '1 month' string."
        print("No issue detected. Exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "timesince() raised an exception with >1 month interval."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_long_interval_with_tz()
```

Make sure to have Django installed and properly configured to run this script, as `settings.configure(USE_TZ=True)` is only a basic setup for demonstration purposes. In a full Django project, `settings.py` would typically already include `USE_TZ=True`.

Remember, this script explicitly checks for the specific error condition described in the issue and uses an assertion to ensure it's clear under what circumstance the error occurs. If the issue is fixed (by correcting the handling of timezone-aware datetimes in `django.utils.timesince` as suggested), the script will confirm the absence of the issue by exiting with code 0.
