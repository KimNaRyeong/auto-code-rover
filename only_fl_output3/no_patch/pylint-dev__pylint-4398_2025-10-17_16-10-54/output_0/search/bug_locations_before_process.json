To resolve the issue, a new logic path should be added to evaluate detected issues against the new `--fail-on` criteria (specific issue types or codes). This logic should be able to override the `--fail-under` behavior if necessary, without disrupting the existing functionality for users not using the new option. This requires implementing or modifying a method within this file to include checking against the `--fail-on` criteria before deciding the exit code. Existing functionality around exit codes, especially related to the `--fail-under` option, should be preserved unless explicitly overridden by the new option."
