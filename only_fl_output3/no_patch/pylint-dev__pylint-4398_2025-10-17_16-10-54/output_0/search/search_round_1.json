Ensure there are no error-category issues - this can be achieved by looking at the exit code\n2. Ensure the overall linting score doesn't deteriorate too much - this can be achieved by using `--fail-under=8`\nHowever if `--fail-under` is used, and the score is above that, then it passes even if there are error-category issues detected. Essentially it's acting as a \"only throw fail (non-zero) codes if under this\", instead of a \"fail if under this, otherwise change nothing\".\nTwo possible solutions I can think of here are:\n1. Have a configuration option to prevent `--fail-under` from consuming other exit statuses. I.e. a way to say \"if score is under N, return error code X, regardless of all else, otherwise change nothing\".\n2. Add a new option like `--fail-on=E,unused-import` which means that if there are any `E*` code (error-category) issues, or any `unused-error` issues, then fail, otherwise change nothing.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given the results from the API calls, it seems our initial search terms did not directly pinpoint the relevant parts of the codebase responsible for parsing command line arguments, exiting with codes, reporting issues, or an IssueReporter class. However, the information about `sys.exit` gives us a clue about where to look next, especially since `sys.exit` calls are likely around areas where exit codes are determined based on lint results or issues.\n\n### Analyzing `sys.exit` Occurrences\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - Occurrences of `sys.exit` in various files suggest these are points at which the application decides to terminate with a specific exit code, which could be based on error detection, command line argument parsing, or the completion of the linting process.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue relates to how the application exits based on detected issues and the `--fail-under` option's behavior. Therefore, the parts of the code that call `sys.exit` are likely relevant because they are where the decision to exit with a particular code is made, which is central to the issue at hand.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Ideally, these parts of the code would also include logic to handle new exit scenarios based on the proposed `--fail-on` option. This means somewhere close to these `sys.exit` calls, there should be logic to assess lint results against the new criteria (specific issues or issue types) before deciding on the exit code.\n\n### Next Steps for Context Collection\n\nGiven the analysis, the next step is to look more closely into files likely involved in the exiting process and potentially the parsing of command line arguments or configuration that affects linting outcomes.\n\n1. Explore the code around the `sys.exit` calls, especially in `pylint/lint/run.py` since it contains the most matches. This file is likely central to running lint checks and deciding on exit codes.\n   \n   - `get_code_around_line(\"pylint/lint/run.py\", line_number, 10)` for each occurrence of `sys.exit` might reveal the decision-making process on lint outcomes.\n\n2. It's possible the method names related to parsing command line arguments or reporting issues are named differently than initially searched for. Without more specific method names, it may be beneficial to look in files directly involved in configuration, argument parsing, or lint execution (like `pylint/lint/run.py`) for clues on how these processes are handled.\n   \n   - `search_code_in_file(\"parse_args\", \"pylint/lint/run.py\")` could reveal how command-line arguments are being processed, suggesting where a `--fail-on` option could be integrated.\n\n3. Since no direct hits were found for `report_issue` or an `IssueReporter` class, review the specific linting or checker files (e.g., in the `checkers` directory) to understand how issues are categorized and reported, which could highlight where to implement the `--fail-on` logic.\n   \n   - `search_code(\"register_checker\")` might give insights into how checkers (which detect issues) are managed and could provide a path to intercepting specific issue types for the new option.\n\nThese steps aim to gather more context on how the tool currently processes lint results and exits, thus providing a foundation to propose a solution for the issue described."

To resolve the issue, a new logic path should be added to evaluate detected issues against the new `--fail-on` criteria (specific issue types or codes). This logic should be able to override the `--fail-under` behavior if necessary, without disrupting the existing functionality for users not using the new option. This requires implementing or modifying a method within this file to include checking against the `--fail-on` criteria before deciding the exit code. Existing functionality around exit codes, especially related to the `--fail-under` option, should be preserved unless explicitly overridden by the new option.\n\nGiven the lack of specifics about where in `pylint/lint/run.py` the adjustments need to be made (like specific method names or line numbers where `sys.exit` is called relevant to the issue), the intention is to ensure the new feature `--fail-on` integrates seamlessly with the current mechanisms around exit codes and issue handling. Additional analysis of the file is needed to pinpoint the exact insertion points and methods for modification or enhancement."
