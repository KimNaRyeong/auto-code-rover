Certainly! Below is a standalone Python file `reproducer.py`, designed to reproduce the issue mentioned. When executed, it will check for the performance issue in `django.forms.widgets.Media.__add__` method, raising an `AssertionError` if the performance issue persists and printing a stack trace of the issue. It exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed.

```python
# reproducer.py
import datetime
from django.forms import Media

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_media(MediaClass):
    '''Creates a simple Media object with only one or two items.'''
    return MediaClass(css={'all': ['main.css']}, js=['main.js'])

def time_media_additions(MediaClass, iterations=100000):
    start = datetime.datetime.now()
    media = create_media(MediaClass)
    for i in range(iterations):
        media = media + create_media(MediaClass)
    end = datetime.datetime.now()
    return end - start

def main():
    # Test with the default Media class
    default_duration = time_media_additions(Media)
    print(f'Default Media class duration: {default_duration}')

    # Check if the performance issue is fixed by verifying the time difference
    try:
        assert default_duration < datetime.timedelta(minutes=1), "The performance issue is still present."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise SystemExit(1)

    # If the assertion passed, it means the performance issue was fixed.
    print("Performance issue seems to be fixed.")
    raise SystemExit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Make sure you have Django installed in your environment where you plan to execute this script. You can install Django by running:

```sh
pip install Django
```

Execute the script in your project's root directory:

```sh
python3 reproducer.py
```

This script initially measures the time taken for 100000 additions using the `django.forms.widgets.Media` class. If the additions take longer than 1 minute, the script assumes the performance issue is still present, raising an `AssertionError` and displaying a stack trace. If the performance is under 1 minute, it assumes the issue is fixed and exits with code 0.
