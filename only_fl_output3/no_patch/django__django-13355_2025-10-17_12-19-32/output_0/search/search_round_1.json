        "content": "<issue>Optimize django.forms.widgets.Media.__add__.\nDescription\nWhile working with another project that make extensive use of django.forms.widgets.Media I discovered that the fix for ticket #30153 has unintended consequences on the performance of Media.__add__. If the number of Media objects added grows beyond a certain point (not sure it may be machine specific) then the performance of all subsequent Media.__add__ calls becomes terrible.\nThis was causing page load times of several minutes on my development machine. I agree that you need to delay as long as possible as #30153 intends but it seems that there probably should be an upper bound on this so that performance does not suddenly decrease.\nHere is some sample code that can reproduce the issue:\nfrom django.forms import Media\nimport datetime\ndef create_media(MediaClass):\n'''Creates a simple Media object with only one or two items.'''\nreturn MediaClass(css={'all': ['main.css']}, js=['main.js'])\nstart = datetime.datetime.now()\nmedia = create_media(Media)\nfor i in range(100000):\nmedia = media + create_media(Media)\nprint('100000 additions took: %s' % (datetime.datetime.now() - start))\nOn my machine several runs of this code result in times between 1:35 - 1:44 (eg. 1 minute 35 seconds to 1 minute 44 seconds). However, taking away one zero from the number of media objects runs in under a second. Near as I can tell this has to do with the memory used to store these arrays and when it gets past a certain point the performance is awful. Since I am not sure if it is machine specific, for reference my machine is a i7-8700 with 64 GB RAM.\nHere is a sample that has a modified Media class that does not have theses issues:\nfrom django.forms import Media\nimport datetime\ndef create_media(MediaClass):\n'''Creates a simple Media object with only one or two items.'''\nreturn MediaClass(css={'all': ['main.css']}, js=['main.js'])\nclass CustomMedia(Media):\ndef __add__(self, other):\ncombined = CustomMedia()\nif len(self._css_lists) + len(other._css_lists) > 1000:\ncombined._css_lists = [self._css, other._css]\nelse:\ncombined._css_lists = self._css_lists + other._css_lists\nif len(self._js_lists) + len(other._js_lists) > 1000:\ncombined._js_lists = [self._js, other._js]\nelse:\ncombined._js_lists = self._js_lists + other._js_lists\nreturn combined\nstart = datetime.datetime.now()\nmedia = create_media(CustomMedia)\nfor i in range(100000):\nmedia = media + create_media(CustomMedia)\nprint('100000 additions took: %s' % (datetime.datetime.now() - start))\nWith this change it again runs in under a second. If I increase the number of loops the performance seems to change at a much more expected level.\nI set an upper limit on the length allowed before a merge occurs. I'm not sure if the number of additions allowed should be a setting that can be adjusted to meet specific needs or if something that is just \"reasonably\" high is sufficient. It does appear that limiting the total number of items in the list to about 1000 works best on my machine. I'm also not sure that this is the best solution.\nThanks for your consideration.\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe provided code snippet is from `django/forms/widgets.py`, showing the `__add__` method of the `Media` class. This method combines two `Media` objects by concatenating their CSS and JS asset lists. Specifically, it creates a new `Media` object, `combined`, and sums up the `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` from the current `Media` object (`self`) and the other `Media` object (`other`). Finally, it returns this new combined `Media` object.\n\n#### Relationship between this part of the code and the bug\n\nThe issue described relates directly to this method's handling of large numbers of `Media` objects being combined. According to the bug report, when the number of `Media` objects to be combined is large, the performance degrades significantly, leading to long page load times. The issue stems from the way `__add__` merely concatenates lists without any optimization or consideration for the growing size of these lists, which can become a performance bottleneck, likely due to both memory usage and the time it takes to concatenate large lists repeatedly.\n\n#### Intended behavior of this part of the code\n\nGiven the issue description and the presented solution in the form of a `CustomMedia` class, the intended behavior would be to efficiently handle the combination of large numbers of `Media` objects without significantly degrading performance. This could involve introducing a threshold for the number of items in the `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` where, beyond this threshold, a more optimized method of merging or handling these lists would be used. The goal would be to maintain or improve the method's efficiency, especially in scenarios where numerous `Media` objects are added together.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the analysis, a potential next step would be to inspect how `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` are defined and managed within the `Media` class. This could offer insight into possible areas for optimization.\n\nHowever, since the issue clearly points out the need for optimization in `__add__` itself and even proposes a custom solution that improves performance, the primary next step should focus on designing a solution that can be integrated into Django's `Media` class. This solution would ideally honor the original intent of the bug report: limiting the negative performance impact when combining a large number of `Media` objects, possibly by incorporating an upper limit to the length of the lists being combined or optimizing how these lists are managed and stored during the addition process."

A potential solution is to implement an optimization similar to the one described in the issue report:\n    - Introduce checks to measure the lengths of `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` before combining them. If the total length of either list exceeds a predetermined threshold (for example, 1000 items), an alternative strategy for combining the lists should be employed to avoid the performance penalty associated with large list operations. This could involve more efficient data structures or algorithms that can handle large lists better than simple concatenation.\n    - Preserve the existing functionality for scenarios where the combined lists do not exceed this threshold, ensuring that the behavior of the `Media` class remains unchanged for the majority of use cases.\n    - This update must be thoroughly tested to confirm that it both resolves the performance issue with large-scale combinations and that it does not introduce regressions for the typical usage of the `Media` class."
