        "intended_behavior": "The `__add__` method should be optimized to handle a large number of `Media` objects being combined without significant performance degradation. A potential solution is to implement an optimization similar to the one described in the issue report: Introduce checks to measure the lengths of `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` before combining them. If the total length of either list exceeds a predetermined threshold (for example, 1000 items), an alternative strategy for combining the lists should be employed to avoid the performance penalty associated with large list operations. This could involve more efficient data structures or algorithms that can handle large lists better than simple concatenation. Preserve the existing functionality for scenarios where the combined lists do not exceed this threshold, ensuring that the behavior of the `Media` class remains unchanged for the majority of use cases. This update must be thoroughly tested to confirm that it both resolves the performance issue with large-scale combinations and that it does not introduce regressions for the typical usage of the `Media` class."
