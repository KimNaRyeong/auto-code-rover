Below is a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that aims to reproduce the issue outlined. The script checks performance degradation when many `Media` objects are added together by using timestamps. If the operation takes significantly longer than expected, it assumes the performance issue is present, raising an `AssertionError`. If the operation completes within a reasonable amount of time, it concludes that the issue is fixed.

```python
# reproducer.py
import datetime
from django.forms import Media

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def create_media(MediaClass):
    '''Creates a simple Media object with only one or two items.'''
    return MediaClass(css={'all': ['main.css']}, js=['main.js'])

def test_performance():
    start = datetime.datetime.now()
    media = create_media(Media)
    for i in range(100000):
        media = media + create_media(Media)
    duration = datetime.datetime.now() - start
    print(f'100000 additions took: {duration}')
    # Assuming any duration longer than 5 seconds is indicative of the performance issue
    assert duration < datetime.timedelta(seconds=5), "Performance degradation detected"

def main():
    try:
        test_performance()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e
    print("No performance issues detected.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script does a simple performance check by timing how long it takes to add 100,000 media objects together. The `AssertionError` is raised if this operation takes longer than 5 seconds, indicating the performance issue is present. The script also contains a utility function `print_stacktrace` to provide detailed error information if an exception is raised.

Please ensure Django is installed and correctly configured in your project before running this script. Adjust the `assert` condition's duration threshold (`datetime.timedelta(seconds=5)`) as necessary to match your performance expectations or to better suit the capabilities of the testing environment.
