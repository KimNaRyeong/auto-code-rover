        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the reported issue, I will perform the following API calls based on the description given:\n\n1. Search for the `MigrationExecutor` class where the issue occurs to get an overview of its structure and to verify if the problematic code snippet is indeed located there, as the issue description suggests an issue in `django/db/migrations/executor.py`.\n   \n2. Search for the method within the `MigrationExecutor` class that contains the code dealing with column name comparison to verify and analyze the implementation for sensitivity to case in column names.\n\n3. Given the specific code snippet provided in the issue, search for this code to locate exactly where in the file it is and to understand the surrounding context to better assess how to implement a case-insensitive comparison.\n\nTherefore, I will issue the following API calls:\n- `search_class(\"MigrationExecutor\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"get_table_description\", \"MigrationExecutor\")` - Assuming that this is the method where the issue may occur based on the code snippet provided. If not, this call helps in identifying the correct method responsible for acquiring table descriptions.\n- `search_code(\"self.connection.introspection.get_table_description(self.connection.cursor(), table)\")` - This will help locate the exact location of the problematic code snippet within the file for further analysis."
