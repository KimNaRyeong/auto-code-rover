        "intended_behavior": "The primary correction or enhancement would need to focus on bolstering numerical stability and precision within `linsolve`. This could involve improving floating-point handling by implementing more robust checks or preprocessing steps to mitigate the impact of floating-point arithmetic errors, such as normalizing coefficients or applying thresholds for determining coefficient equality. Additionally, ensuring solution consistency for systems with minor variations in coefficients and updating documentation or implementing warnings for conditions that are inherently unstable or may lead to inconsistent results due to the limitations of floating-point arithmetic."
