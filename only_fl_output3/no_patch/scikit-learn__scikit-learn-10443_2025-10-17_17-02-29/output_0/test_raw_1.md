Given the constraints and the goal, here is a Python script designed to reproduce the issue as described. This script attempts to create a TfidfVectorizer with a specific `dtype` set to `np.float32` and will raise an `AssertionError` if the output `dtype` is not as expected. The `print_stacktrace` function is utilized to provide detailed error information if the assertion fails.

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    # Attempt to create a TfidfVectorizer with dtype=np.float32
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(dtype=np.float32)
    result = vectorizer.fit_transform(["Help I have a bug"])

    # Check whether the resulting dtype matches the expected dtype
    assert result.dtype == np.float32, "TfidfVectorizer's output dtype does not match the specified dtype."

    # If the assertion passes, print a success message
    print("Success: TfidfVectorizer's output dtype matches the specified dtype.")

except AssertionError as e:
    # If an assertion error is encountered, print the stack trace
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise
```

This script:
1. Imports necessary modules.
2. Defines the `print_stacktrace` function for detailed error logging.
3. Creates a `TfidfVectorizer` with `dtype=np.float32`.
4. Processes a sample text to transform it into TF-IDF features.
5. Asserts that the output `dtype` matches the specified `np.float32`.
6. Catches any `AssertionError` thrown if the expected and actual `dtype` do not match, calling `print_stacktrace` to provide detailed error output.

You should run this script in an environment where the reported versions of the dependencies (Python, NumPy, and SciPy) are installed. If the environment matches but the issue does not reproduce, it might be worth checking if any patch releases of the dependencies used could have influenced the behavior or if there are any environmental factors that could affect the outcome.
