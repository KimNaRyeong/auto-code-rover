        "content": "To address the described issue effectively, we need to first gather sufficient context around the `TfidfVectorizer` class, specifically how it handles the `dtype` argument and how it performs the `fit_transform` operation. The issue points towards a potential problem within the `fit` or `fit_transform` method of `TfidfVectorizer`, or within any method that these may call to handle the data type setting. Therefore, the following API calls would be necessary to gather the required information:\n\n1. **Search for the `TfidfVectorizer` class:**\n   To understand how the `TfidfVectorizer` is implemented and to find the file it is defined in.\n   - `search_class(\"TfidfVectorizer\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `fit_transform` method within the `TfidfVectorizer` class:**\n   To see how the method is implemented and how it may interact with the `dtype`.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"fit_transform\", \"TfidfVectorizer\")`\n\n3. **Search for the `fit` method within the `TfidfVectorizer` class:**\n   Although the issue does not directly mention `fit` beyond the fact that both `fit` and `fit_transform` are affected, investigating it could provide insights into how `dtype` is handled during the `fit` process, which might affect `fit_transform`.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"TfidfVectorizer\")`\n\n4. **Search for the usage of `dtype` argument within the `TfidfVectorizer` class:**\n   To see how `dtype` is being handled or potentially ignored within the class.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"dtype=\", \"<TfidfVectorizer file path from the first search>\")`\n\nThis combination of API calls aims to gather detailed information on the implementation of `TfidfVectorizer`, the handling of the `dtype` parameter, and any potential reasons why `dtype` might default to `np.float64` regardless of user input."
