        "intended_behavior": "The `fit_transform` method should respect the `dtype` parameter defined in the constructor of `TfidfVectorizer` when producing the term-document matrix. This involves ensuring that the transformation applied by `self._tfidf.fit(X)` and subsequently through `self._tfidf.transform(X, copy=False)` correctly utilizes the `dtype` passed to the constructor. This might require adjusting the call to `_tfidf.transform` and ensuring that the intermediate transformations and storage also adhere to this `dtype`, potentially involving modifications not just in `fit_transform` but also in how `_tfidf` handles these transformations."

While `fit` does not directly output the term-document matrix, ensuring `dtype` adherence during its process might be necessary to fix cascading effects in `fit_transform` or other methods relying on `fit` outcomes."
