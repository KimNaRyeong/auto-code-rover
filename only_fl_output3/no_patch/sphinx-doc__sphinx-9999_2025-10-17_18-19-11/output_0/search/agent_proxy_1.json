The methods responsible for rendering generic text content to LaTeX should be reviewed to ensure they correctly interpret newlines and spaces around inline elements like `:samp:`. It might involve refining how blocks of text are parsed and rendered into LaTeX, ensuring inline elements and their following text respect spacing and newline rules.
