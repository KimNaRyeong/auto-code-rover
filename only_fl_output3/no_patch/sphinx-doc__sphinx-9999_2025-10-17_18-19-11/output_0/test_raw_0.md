Certainly! Below is a standalone Python script, `reproducer.py`, designed to programmatically create a Sphinx project, generate documentation including the described issues with LaTeX rendering, and examine the LaTeX output for the specific issues noted. If the problem exists (terms not separated by a newline or excessive vertical whitespace in glossary terms), the script will raise an `AssertionError`. Otherwise, if the issue is resolved, it will exit with code 0.

This script performs the following actions:

1. Creates a minimal Sphinx project directory structure with sample content triggering the issue.
2. Configures Sphinx to use basic settings and includes the problematic RST content.
3. Executes Sphinx to generate the LaTeX documentation.
4. Parses the generated LaTeX file, looking for indicators of the described issue.
5. Raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, printing a detailed stack trace.

Make sure that Sphinx is installed (`pip install sphinx`) and that you have a LaTeX distribution installed that Sphinx can use to build the documentation (for example, TeX Live or MiKTeX).

You can run this script in the root directory of your Sphinx project (or a test project) with:

```bash
python3 reproducer.py
```

Please adjust any paths or configurations as needed for your specific environment or Sphinx setup.
