        "method": "",
        "intended_behavior": "When `approx` encounters a dictionary value or a sequence element that is `None`, it should not raise a `TypeError`. Instead, it should gracefully compare the value to `None` directly, effectively treating it as a strict equality comparison. This update would not alter the existing functionality for numeric and other types that `approx` currently supports. For numeric comparisons, `approx` should continue to work as it does now, using specified tolerances to determine equality. The change would specifically cater to the case where `None` is part of a complex structure like a dictionary or a list that is being compared, making `approx` more versatile and user-friendly for testing scenarios where optional values represented by `None` are expected."
