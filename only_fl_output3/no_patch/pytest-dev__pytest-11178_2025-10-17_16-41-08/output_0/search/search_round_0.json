        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to find out how `pytest.approx` is implemented and how it handles the comparison of floating-point numbers, particularly in cases where one of the comparison operands is `None`. The error arises when attempting to compare a float with a `NoneType`, which suggests that the implementation does not gracefully handle `None` values.\n\nGiven that `pytest.approx` is a feature of the `pytest` package, it is likely part of a specific module or class within that package. Since we do not have the exact location or file where this feature is implemented, the following steps should provide useful insights:\n\n1. Search for the method or class that implements `approx` to understand how it's designed.\n2. Once we have the class or method, inspect its implementation to identify how it handles operands and why `None` might lead to a `TypeError`.\n\nStart with:\n- search_method(\"approx\")"
