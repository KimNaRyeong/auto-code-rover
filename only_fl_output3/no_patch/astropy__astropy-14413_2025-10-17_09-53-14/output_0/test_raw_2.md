Certainly! To directly address the issue as detailed, we'll construct a Python script named `reproducer.py` that attempts to mimic the inconsistent space handling in `astropy.units` string representations. This script checks if the unit string representations start with a space or have an unexpected space after a numeric scale for different formats (`unicode`, `console`, etc.), raising an `AssertionError` if such spaces are found when they shouldn't be, indicating the presence of the issue.

Here's how you can write the script:

```python
import astropy.units as u

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        # Check if a space is incorrectly present or absent
        tests = [
            (f'{(u.m**-1):unicode}', False),
            (f"{(u.eV*u.s**2).decompose()}", True),
            (f"{(u.eV*u.s**2).decompose():unicode}", False),
            (f"{(1*u.eV*u.s**2).decompose()}", True),
            (f"{(1*u.eV*u.s**2).decompose():unicode}", False)
        ]

        for test_string, should_start_with_space in tests:
            if should_start_with_space:
                assert test_string.startswith(' '), "String does not start with a space when it should."
            else:
                assert not test_string.startswith(' '), "String starts with an unexpected space."

        print("All unit representations are correctly formatted.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise SystemExit(1) from None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script attempts to reproduce the issue by:
- Defining a set of test cases with their expected outcome regarding the presence or absence of a leading space.
- Checking each case against its expectation and raising an `AssertionError` for any mismatches.
- Utilizing `print_stacktrace` to provide detailed error reporting when an assertion fails.

This approach ensures an immediate and clear indication if the problem persists, by directly confronting the reported inconsistencies. It concludes with a non-zero exit code when inconsistencies are detected, adhering to your requirements for error signaling and exit behavior.
