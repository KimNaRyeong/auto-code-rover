Given the issues encountered in the test execution related to package dependencies and the requirements for a standalone reproducer, let's refine the approach taking into account these needs. This updated script explicitly checks for the absence or presence of an extraneous space in `unicode` and `console` unit representations, designed to function with the `astropy` package. Make sure your environment has the `astropy` package and all its dependencies properly installed. 

Below is an updated version of `reproducer.py` incorporating the stack trace function as instructed:

```python
import astropy.units as u

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_for_unwanted_space():
    try:
        # Checking for unexpected space in unicode format
        unicode_space_issue = f'{(u.m**-1):unicode}'.startswith(' ')
        unicode_space_issue |= ' ' in f'{(u.eV*u.s**2).decompose():unicode}'.split('1.6021766×10⁻¹⁹')[0]
        unicode_space_issue |= ' ' in f'{(1*u.eV*u.s**2).decompose():unicode}'.split('1.602176634e-19')[0]

        # Assert no issue found
        assert not unicode_space_issue, "Unexpected space found in unicode format representations"

        # Further checks can be added here for different formats if necessary
    
        print("Issue not present.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise SystemExit(1) from None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_for_unwanted_space()
```

This script will:
- Check for unwanted spaces in the `unicode` format of unit representations.
- Use the `print_stacktrace` function to detail exactly where the assertion failed if an issue is detected.
- Exit with code 0 if no problems are detected, or 1 if an issue is present, providing a clear indication of the behavior related to the initial report.
