This adjustment must maintain existing functionality for all other aspects of unit representation, such as accuracy and adherence to specified formats. The method should handle scenarios with and without scale factors uniformly, perhaps by checking the format requested and ensuring consistent handling of spaces across different unit scales and compositions. Specifically, it should eliminate any conditional logic or post-processing step that inadvertently introduces or fails to remove a leading space in specific cases."

        "intended_behavior": "If `to_string` in `console.py` is responsible for the specific `console` format of units, it should be revised to ensure no leading spaces are introduced before units, in line with the expected behavior outlined for `core.py`. The correction here should focus on the consistency of space handling in the conversion to string, making sure that the presence of scale factors or specific unit combinations does not alter the intended format. The logic that formats the unit string must be scrutinized to prevent any inadvertent space character insertion, especially in configurations that were previously prone to this issue."
