        "content": "To gather enough context for addressing the issue with the space inconsistencies in unit representations in `unicode` and `console` format, let's make the following API calls:\n\n1. Since the issue mentions that the problem is tied to the method responsible for converting units to a string representation, it would be useful to search for the implementation of `to_string` method within the context of units. Therefore, we should look for the `to_string` method within a class related to unit representation in Astropy, which might be simply \"Unit\" or a similarly named class. However, the exact class name is not specified, so we'll start by searching for the method in the entire codebase to get clues about where it resides:\n    - `search_method(\"to_string\")`\n\n2. The issue description involves specific unit examples (`u.m**-1`, `u.eV*u.s**2`, and their decomposed forms), and it mentions how these are represented differently in `unicode` and `console` format. It might be helpful to search for how these specific representations are handled or generated in the code. We'll search for any code snippets that directly mention these units and their formatting to unicode, which would likely be part of the implementation details for formatting units:\n    - `search_code(\"u.m**-1\")`\n    - `search_code(\"u.eV*u.s**2\")`\n\n3. Lastly, to understand how the decomposed method affects the string representation and possibly interacts with the `to_string` method, we should find where `decompose` is defined and used in relation to unit formatting:\n    - `search_method(\"decompose\")`\n\nThese searches should give us a good starting point to understand where the issue resides and how the code handling unit formats and their conversions to strings is structured within Astropy."
