This script is structured to simulate the environment and actions needed to reproduce the described issue. It programmatically applies a `RenameModel` migration to test for the failure scenario outlined. If it encounters the error, it prints a stack trace and exits with code `1` to indicate failure. Conversely, if the issue is not present (e.g., the RenameModel succeeds as expected), it reports the issue as fixed and exits with code `0`.

**Please Note:**

1. This script assumes the presence of a Django project set up according to the description with an `Incident` model in two separate apps `incidents` and `vault`. For it to work, you need to replace `'edemo.settings'` with the actual Django project settings module path.
2. The script attempts to apply a migration directly to your database. It is essential to be cautious with this operation, especially in a production database, to avoid data loss or corruption. Ideally, test this in a development or isolated environment.
3. This script does not include creation, rollback, or clean-up of the test migration in the database. You might want to manage the database state carefully when testing.
4. The `ProgrammingError` exception catch is used as a placeholder for the specific exception that might be thrown during the failure. Depending on the actual behavior and errors Django throws when encountering the described issue, you may need to adjust this exception handling to fit the actual error scenario better.
