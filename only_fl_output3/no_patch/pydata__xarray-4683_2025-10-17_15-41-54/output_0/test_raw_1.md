Given the feedback and the need for a correction based on the previous attempt, here's a refined version of the `reproducer.py` that adheres to your instructions. This revised script is crafted to validate the presence of the issue concerning the `order` parameter's disappearance in the `astype` method of `xarray` version 0.16.2. It leverages the provided function for error tracing to ensure clarity in error reporting. Note that this script is designed under the assumption that the environment where it's executed has `xarray` version 0.16.2 installed. Adjustments might be necessary based on the actual results obtained during its execution.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_astype_order_parameter():
    import xarray as xr

    xr_version = xr.__version__
    print(f"Testing xarray version: {xr_version}")

    # Ensure the xarray version is as expected for this test
    assert xr_version == '0.16.2', f"Test is designed for xarray 0.16.2, but found version {xr_version}"

    try:
        da = xr.DataArray([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
        # This tries to use the 'order' parameter, expected to fail in version 0.16.2
        result = da.astype(dtype='d', order='F')
        strides = result.values.strides
        # If no exception is raised, manually trigger AssertionError since the test expects failure
        assert False, "Expected TypeError due to missing 'order' parameter was not raised."
    except TypeError as e:
        if "unexpected keyword argument 'order'" in str(e):
            print("Test confirmed: 'order' parameter is not supported in this version.")
        else:
            print_stacktrace(e)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_astype_order_parameter()
```

This script aims to detect the specific issue related to the disappearance of the `order` parameter from the `astype` method in xarray version 0.16.2. Upon encountering the anticipated `TypeError`, it confirms the presence of the issue. If the `TypeError` does not match expectations, or if an unexpected error occurs, it provides detailed tracebacks for further inspection.
