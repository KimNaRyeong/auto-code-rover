This parameter should then be used to control the memory layout of the array's result after the dtype conversion. It might involve passing this parameter down to underlying numpy or similar array operations that actually execute the dtype conversion, ensuring that the `order` parameter's value is respected.\n- Ensure compatibility with numpy's behavior for `order` to maintain user expectations.\n- Documentation or migration notes should clearly communicate this change or restoration of functionality, catering to users migrating between versions.\n- Implement tests to verify the `order` parameter effectively controls the memory layout in situations analogous to the reported issue scenario."
