Given the aim to recreate an executable Python script `reproducer.py` that responds to the outlined expectations accurately, here's an adjusted standalone script ready to exemplify the specified issue. This script checks for the presence of an `AssertionError` triggered by a missing `order` parameter in the `astype` method, reflects the encountered issue through a printed stack trace, and maintains an exit code of 0 when the conditions communicate the addressed issue has been fixed within the xarray library environment setup.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import xarray as xr

    try:
        xr_version = xr.__version__
        print(f"xarray version: {xr_version}")

        da = xr.DataArray([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
        # Attempt to use the 'order' parameter, which is expected to fail for the specific version
        result = da.astype(dtype='d', order='F')
        strides = result.values.strides
        
        # If the above line doesn't raise an error, it means the issue is fixed
        print("Issue appears to be fixed in this version.")
        
    except TypeError as e:
        if "unexpected keyword argument 'order'" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("Expected failure due to missing 'order' parameter.")
        else:
            print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as error:
        # Handles the specific assertion error from the test case
        print(f"Assertion error: {error}")
        exit(0)  # Exit code 0 to indicate the script worked as intended for reproducing the issue
```

This script, when executed, should not only attempt to reproduce the outlined issue regarding the absence of the `order` parameter in xarray's `astype` method but also manage exceptions distinctly. If the raised error matches the expected `TypeError` due to the `order` parameter, a stack trace from the encountered exception will be displayed, followed by an `AssertionError` indicating the reproduction of the issue. The script is designed to exit with code 0 upon catching this `AssertionError`, connoting that the observed behavior aligns with the reported issue, thus functioning as expected for its purpose.
