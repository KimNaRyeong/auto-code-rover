The intended behavior should be to handle this error within the function or at a higher level, allowing for a user-friendly message to be printed, suggesting correct usage or directing the user to help resources. Instead of letting the exception cause a crash with a traceback, catch this exception and format a clear, helpful error message without displaying a traceback to the user."

This might involve adding an additional exception handler around the call to `PylintRun` (or where `PylintRun` is expected to execute) to catch `_UnrecognizedOptionError` and handle it by printing an error message and possibly the correct command usage, then exiting gracefully."
