        "content": "To resolve the issue effectively, we need to gather more details about the specific classes and methods involved in error handling for unrecognized options in Pylint. Based on the traceback and the desired outcome mentioned in the issue, let's focus on the following components:\n\n1. The class `PylintRun` constructor in `pylint/lint/run.py` where the error seems to initiate.\n2. The `_config_initialization` function in `pylint/config/config_initialization.py` which is directly involved in raising the `_UnrecognizedOptionError`.\n3. The `_UnrecognizedOptionError` exception class to understand how the exception is structured.\n4. Any relevant code for handling command-line arguments in `pylint`, specifically looking for how errors and usage tips are displayed.\n\nGiven these areas of focus, here are the API calls we'll make:\n\n- `search_class(\"PylintRun\")` to get the location and basic structure of the `PylintRun` class.\n- `search_method(\"run_pylint\")` to understand how Pylint processes command-line arguments initially.\n- `search_code(\"_UnrecognizedOptionError\")` to find where this exception is defined and used.\n- `search_code(\"Command line:1:0: E0015: Unrecognized option found\")` to see how errors about unrecognized options are currently handled and reported.\n- `search_method_in_file(\"__init__\", \"pylint/lint/run.py\")` and `search_method_in_file(\"_config_initialization\", \"pylint/config/config_initialization.py\")` for specifics on argument handling and error raising in these contexts."
