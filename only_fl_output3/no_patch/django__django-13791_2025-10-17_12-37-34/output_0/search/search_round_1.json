The sign of a timedelta string will be ignored by django.utils.dateparse.parse_duration if the input string only contains days. Compare the following (notice the minus signs):\nIn [4]: timedelta(days=-1)\nOut[4]: datetime.timedelta(days=-1)\nIn [5]: td = timedelta(days=-1)\nIn [6]: duration_iso_string(td)\nOut[6]: '-P1DT00H00M00S'\nIn [7]: parse_duration(duration_iso_string(td))\nOut[7]: datetime.timedelta(days=1) # <-- Why is this 1 and not -1?\nIn [8]: td = timedelta(days=-1, microseconds=1)\nIn [9]: duration_iso_string(td)\nOut[9]: '-P0DT23H59M59.999999S'\nIn [10]: parse_duration(duration_iso_string(td))\nOut[10]: datetime.timedelta(days=-1, microseconds=1)\nI guess the problem is in django/utils/dateparse.py line 147 that reads return days + sign * datetime.timedelta(**kw).\nHowever, if datetime.timedelta(**kw) ends up being zero (timedelta(0)) then the sign multiplication ends up in zero, not -0. This is just a preliminary quick look though and maybe the problem is something else.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the provided code segment from `django/utils/dateparse.py` in the `parse_duration` function:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `parse_duration` function is designed to parse a duration string into a `datetime.timedelta` object. It supports various formats, including the preferred Django format (`'%d %H:%M:%S.%f'`), the ISO 8601 duration representation, and PostgreSQL's day-time interval format. The function matches the input string against these formats and constructs a dictionary (`kw`) of the matched groups.\n   - The `sign` variable is determined based on whether a `-` sign is found in the matched string, impacting the final duration as either negative or positive.\n   - It then processes microseconds and seconds for proper formatting and sign adjustment.\n   - Finally, the function computes a `datetime.timedelta` object by popping `days` from `kw` and adding it to a timedelta created from the remaining `kw` values, adjusted by the `sign`.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue arises specifically at line 147, where the computation of the final timedelta occurs. If the input string represents a duration with only days (and potentially a sign), the function mistakenly ignores the sign if there are no further time components (hours, minutes, seconds, microseconds) to process. This results in incorrect behavior for input strings that represent negative durations comprising only days.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be for the `parse_duration` function to accurately return a `datetime.timedelta` object that reflects the duration specified by the input string, including the correct sign for durations that consist solely of days. Thus, if the input is a string representing a negative duration of days (e.g., '-P1D'), the function should return a `datetime.timedelta` object that signifies a negative duration, such as `datetime.timedelta(days=-1)`.\n\nTo address the bug, a potential correction might involve revising the computation at line 147 to ensure that the sign is properly applied even when the `datetime.timedelta(**kw)` results in zero for all components except days. This might involve rethinking how the `days` and `sign` values are combined to accurately reflect negative durations represented solely by days."

The current issue arises because the multiplication of `sign * datetime.timedelta(**kw)` results in a positive timedelta when it should respect the sign of the duration.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the computation at line 147 needs adjustment to ensure that the sign is consistently applied to the resulting timedelta, even when no other time components (hours, minutes, seconds, microseconds) are present besides days. This could be achieved by revising the formula to explicitly account for the sign when adding days to the result. One potential approach is to modify the computation of `days` to directly apply the sign:\n\n```python\ndays = datetime.timedelta(days=sign * (kw.pop('days', .0) or .0))\n```\n\nThis change ensures that the `days` variable correctly reflects negative durations when the input string specifies a negative duration in days, while still preserving the functionality for other time components and positive durations."
