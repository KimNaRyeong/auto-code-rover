The sign of a timedelta string will be ignored by django.utils.dateparse.parse_duration if the input string only contains days. Compare the following (notice the minus signs):\nIn [4]: timedelta(days=-1)\nOut[4]: datetime.timedelta(days=-1)\nIn [5]: td = timedelta(days=-1)\nIn [6]: duration_iso_string(td)\nOut[6]: '-P1DT00H00M00S'\nIn [7]: parse_duration(duration_iso_string(td))\nOut[7]: datetime.timedelta(days=1) # <-- Why is this 1 and not -1?\nIn [8]: td = timedelta(days=-1, microseconds=1)\nIn [9]: duration_iso_string(td)\nOut[9]: '-P0DT23H59M59.999999S'\nIn [10]: parse_duration(duration_iso_string(td))\nOut[10]: datetime.timedelta(days=-1, microseconds=1)\nI guess the problem is in django/utils/dateparse.py line 147 that reads return days + sign * datetime.timedelta(**kw).\nHowever, if datetime.timedelta(**kw) ends up being zero (timedelta(0)) then the sign multiplication ends up in zero, not -0. This is just a preliminary quick look though and maybe the problem is something else.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the described issue effectively, we need to gather more context around the specific points of code mentioned in the issue description. The relevant areas to focus on are within the `django.utils.dateparse` module, particularly the `parse_duration` function and any other code that interacts with timedelta sign handling, especially when only days are present in the ISO string.\n\nGiven the information from the issue, here are the actions we'll take using the search APIs:\n\n1. **Search for the `parse_duration` function within the codebase** to understand its implementation and see where the bug might originate from.\n2. **Search for the code snippet that might be causing the issue**, specifically the line mentioned in the issue where the sign of the timedelta is applied.\n3. **Retrieve code context around the problematic line** if the exact location (file path and line number) was known, but since it's not specified beyond `django/utils/dateparse.py line 147`, we'll focus on finding the function and related code first.\n\nLet's start with:\n\n- `search_method(\"parse_duration\")`: This will help find the file path and location of the `parse_duration` method."
