        "intended_behavior": "The `parse_duration` function should correctly handle duration strings that represent negative time durations consisting solely of days (e.g., \"-P1D\"). The current issue arises because the multiplication of `sign * datetime.timedelta(**kw)` results in a positive timedelta when it should respect the sign of the duration.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the computation at line 147 needs adjustment to ensure that the sign is consistently applied to the resulting timedelta, even when no other time components (hours, minutes, seconds, microseconds) are present besides days. This could be achieved by revising the formula to explicitly account for the sign when adding days to the result. One potential approach is to modify the computation of `days` to directly apply the sign:\n\n```python\ndays = datetime.timedelta(days=sign * (kw.pop('days', .0) or .0))\n```\n\nThis change ensures that the `days` variable correctly reflects negative durations when the input string specifies a negative duration in days, while still preserving the functionality for other time components and positive durations."
