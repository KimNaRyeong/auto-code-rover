Based on the requirements and the feedback provided, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the execution context. The script should have been exiting with an error code that reflects the failure to handle the issue as expected. The following revised script correctly interprets the requirements:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import Range, FiniteSet, Symbol

    n = Symbol('n', integer=True)
    try:
        _ = Range(1).intersect(FiniteSet(n))
        print("No issue detected.", file=sys.stderr)
        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate no error if the issue is fixed.
    except Exception as e:  # Catch a broader set of Exceptions to ensure we capture the TypeError.
        if isinstance(e, TypeError) and "cannot determine truth value of Relational" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate the presence of the issue.
        else:
            raise AssertionError(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script will exit with code 0 if the intersection does not raise a `TypeError`, indicating the issue has been fixed. If the script catches the specific `TypeError` mentioning "cannot determine truth value of Relational", it will print the stack trace as per the function `print_stacktrace` and then exit with code 1 to indicate the error was encountered and reproduced successfully.

The modifications ensure that the script conforms to the requirement of exiting with code 0 when the issue is resolved and prints a comprehensive stack trace when the issue is reproduced.
