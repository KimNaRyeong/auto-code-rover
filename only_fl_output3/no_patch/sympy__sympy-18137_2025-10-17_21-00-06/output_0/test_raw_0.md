This script is designed to specifically catch the `TypeError` associated with the issue reported. When you run this script in your project's root directory with Python 3, it will attempt to execute the problematic code. If the issue is present (i.e., the `TypeError` with the message "cannot determine truth value of Relational" is thrown), it will catch this error and print the stack trace as described. If the issue is fixed in a future version, or if another type of error is encountered, the script will raise an `AssertionError` indicating that the expected error did not occur, or there is an unexpected error. This approach ensures that the script's behavior is clear and predictable under both scenariosâ€”when the issue is present and after it is potentially fixed.
