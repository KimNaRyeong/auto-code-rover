Certainly, here is a `reproducer.py` script tailored to reproduce the issue and use the provided function for printing stack traces. The script will raise an `AssertionError` if the targeted error is not captured, ensuring it exactly follows the specified directives:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_issue():
    from sympy import Range, FiniteSet, Symbol

    n = Symbol('n', integer=True)
    try:
        Range(1).intersect(FiniteSet(n))
    except TypeError as e:
        if "cannot determine truth value of Relational" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
        else:
            # If the TypeError does not match the expected message, re-raise it
            raise
    else:
        # If no exception occurs, exit with code 0 signaling the issue is fixed
        print("Issue has been resolved.")
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_issue()
    except Exception as e:
        # If an unexpected exception occurs, raise an AssertionError
        raise AssertionError(f"An unexpected exception occurred: {e}") from None
```

This script ensures that:
- The specified issue with `Range` and `FiniteSet` will trigger the `TypeError` you've described.
- Upon catching the specific `TypeError`, it prints the detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function.
- It exits with code 0 if no exception is raised (indicating the issue has been resolved).
- It raises an `AssertionError` for unexpected exceptions, signaling a deviation from the anticipated behavior.
