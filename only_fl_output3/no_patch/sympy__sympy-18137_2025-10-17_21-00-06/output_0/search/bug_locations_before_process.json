This enhancement would involve modifying the conditional checks to handle symbolic variables more gracefully, perhaps by returning a conditional expression or a special object indicating the dependence on the value of the variable."

The action here might not be to change the behavior of this method but to ensure it's less frequently encountered through better handling of symbolic expressions in set operations."
