        "content": "Given the provided issue description, we need to investigate several elements in the SymPy library's codebase to understand the root cause of the `TypeError` when attempting to compute the intersection of a `Range` object and a `FiniteSet` that contains a symbolic integer `n`. The error message indicates problems in methods related to set operations (`intersect` and `_contains`), as well as the handling of relational operations (`__nonzero__` or `__bool__` in `sympy/core/relational.py`). To drill down into the issue, we'll look into the classes and methods mentioned in the traceback.\n\nHere are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. Search for the `Intersection` class to understand the overall mechanism of intersection operation in SymPy, as the traceback involves `Intersection._handle_finite_sets`.\n   - `search_class(\"Intersection\")`\n\n2. Since the issue arises from the interaction between `Range` and `FiniteSet` when calling their `intersect` method, we need to examine the definitions of `intersect` and `_contains` methods in both classes.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"intersect\", \"Range\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"_contains\", \"Range\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"intersect\", \"FiniteSet\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"_contains\", \"FiniteSet\")`\n\n3. The error occurs upon evaluating the truth value of a `Relational` object. Investigating the `__nonzero__` (or `__bool__` in Python 3) method in `Relational` class might provide insights into why the TypeError is thrown.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__bool__\", \"Relational\")` If this doesn't return results (due to versioning or name differences), then:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__nonzero__\", \"Relational\")` \n\n4. Lastly, understanding the code that specifically raises the error could also give us some context about the handling of such relational checks.\n   - `search_code(\"raise TypeError(\\\"cannot determine truth value of Relational\\\")\")`\n\nThese API calls will provide comprehensive information surrounding the computational process that led to the error, insights into how intersection operations are determined for symbolic sets in SymPy, and specific conditions under which relational truth values are deemed indeterminable within the context of the library's functionality."
