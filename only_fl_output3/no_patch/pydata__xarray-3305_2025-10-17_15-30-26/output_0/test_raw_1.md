Certainly! It appears you might be seeking an updated or corrected version of the `reproducer.py` based on the previous conversation and the guidelines provided. Hereâ€™s a refined script:

```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    import xarray as xr

    # Reproduction test function
    def test_quantile_keeps_attrs():
        da = xr.DataArray([0, 0], dims="x", attrs={'units': 'K'})
        out = da.quantile(.9, dim='x', keep_attrs=True)
        expected_attrs = {'units': 'K'}
        if out.attrs != expected_attrs:
            raise AssertionError("Attributes were not preserved by quantile.")

    # Main execution logic
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        try:
            test_quantile_keeps_attrs()
        except AssertionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            print("The issue is present.", file=sys.stderr)
            exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero code to indicate failure
        else:
            print("The issue is fixed.")
            exit(0)

except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)
```

In this version, the code is wrapped safely within a try-except block to capture any initialization issues, such as problems with imports or other errors that might occur even before the `test_quantile_keeps_attrs` function is called. This ensures that if there are any import-related errors (like the `AttributeError` you encountered due to incompatibilities with `numpy` version and usage of `np.unicode_`), they are gracefully caught and presented with a stack trace. Furthermore, to address any broader exceptions beyond the AssertionError, an additional catch-all `except` is also included to ensure any unexpected issue is caught and handled appropriately.
