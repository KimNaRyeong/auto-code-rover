Certainly! Below is the `reproducer.py` Python script designed to check whether the `DataArray.quantile` function in xarray preserves attributes when the `keep_attrs` parameter is set to `True`. The script raises an `AssertionError` if the attributes are not preserved (indicating the presence of the issue). If the attributes are correctly preserved, indicating the issue has been fixed, it exits with code 0.

```python
import xarray as xr

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_quantile_keeps_attrs():
    da = xr.DataArray([0, 0], dims="x", attrs={'units':'K'})
    out = da.quantile(.9, dim='x', keep_attrs=True)
    expected_attrs = {'units': 'K'}
    try:
        assert out.attrs == expected_attrs, "Attributes were not preserved by quantile."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_quantile_keeps_attrs()
    except AssertionError:
        print("The issue is present.", file=sys.stderr)
        exit(1) # Exit with a non-zero code to indicate failure
    else:
        print("The issue is fixed.")
        exit(0)
```

This script performs the exact operation described in the issue report, attempting to preserve the `'units': 'K'` attribute through the `.quantile()` method call and asserts whether or not this attribute is preserved in the output. If the issue persists, an `AssertionError` is raised, and a detailed stack trace is printed to help in diagnosing the problem's location within the code or stack.
