Sure, based on your instructions and incorporating the function to print detailed stack traces, the following Python script is designed to reproduce the reported issue concerning the `DataArray.quantile` method not honoring the `keep_attrs` parameter in `xarray`. It checks if attributes are preserved when `keep_attrs=True`, and it will raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present. If the issue is fixed, the script will exit with code 0 without any error.

```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    import xarray as xr

    # Reproduce the issue
    da = xr.DataArray([0, 0], dims="x", attrs={'units': 'K'})
    out = da.quantile(.9, dim='x', keep_attrs=True)

    if out.attrs != {'units': 'K'}:
        raise AssertionError("DataArray.quantile did not honor `keep_attrs`.")
    
    print("The issue is fixed.")

except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)

except Exception as general_error:
    print_stacktrace(general_error)
    sys.exit(1)
```

Please copy this script into a file named `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project. Then, you can execute it with Python 3 by running `python3 reproducerer.py`. This script is self-contained and checks specifically for the preservation of attributes through the `quantile` method when `keep_attrs=True` is specified, which aligns with the issue you've described.
