        "intended_behavior": "The `call_command` method should be enhanced to properly interpret and forward list arguments to the underlying management command, especially when dealing with options that allow multiple values (`nargs='+'`). This involves parsing list arguments passed to `call_command` in such a way that they accurately reflect a command line invocation with multiple occurrences of the same option. For instance, if `call_command('some_command', foo=[1, 2, 3])` is called, it should be interpreted as if the user had typed `python manage.py some_command --foo 1 --foo 2 --foo 3` on the command line.\n\nThis enhancement must preserve the functionality for all other types of arguments and use cases (e.g., single values, named arguments, etc.), ensuring that no existing behavior is broken. The solution should also maintain compatibility with Django's current method of parsing arguments, likely requiring careful consideration of how arguments are prepared and passed to the `parse_args` method of the underlying command's argument parser.\n\nGiven the importance of backward compatibility and the diverse ways `call_command` can be used (with strings, with command objects, with mixed arguments and options), any modification requires thorough testing with various argument configurations to ensure no regressions are introduced.\n\n**Additional Note:**\nThe lack of direct findings related to `add_mutually_exclusive_group` or detailed implementation specifics of `add_argument` with `nargs='+'` suggests the main issue resides in how `call_command` handles the passing of arguments to commands rather than in the definition of command arguments themselves. As such, the focus should be on refining the argument handling logic within `call_command` to better accommodate list arguments within the specified constraints."
