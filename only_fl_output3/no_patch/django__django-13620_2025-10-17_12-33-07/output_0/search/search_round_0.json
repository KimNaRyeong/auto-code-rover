        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about several aspects mentioned in the problem description. Specifically, we're interested in the implementation of `add_arguments`, the handling of argument groups in the Django command management system, how `call_command` interprets and passes arguments, and any logic that might relate to the parsing or coercion of the type for command line arguments. Given these areas of interest, here are the necessary API calls:\n\n1. To understand how the `add_arguments` method is typically implemented and to check if there are custom implementations or hooks that we could leverage:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"add_arguments\", \"BaseCommand\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a potential problem with how `call_command` interprets list arguments, we need to review its implementation to identify how it deals with parameters passed to commands:\n   - `search_method(\"call_command\")`\n\n3. The description suggests there is an issue with how arguments are added to mutually exclusive groups with `nargs='+'` expecting multiple values. Thus, examining the implementation of `add_argument` within the context of a mutually exclusive group is crucial, especially since it's related to type coercion:\n   - `search_method(\"add_mutually_exclusive_group\")`\n   - `search_code(\"add_argument('--foo', nargs='+', type=int)\")`\n\n4. Finally, to address the type coercion concern directly mentioned in the issue (as this seems to be the crux of the problem), it would be useful to find instances where `type=str` is being set as a workaround or where manual type coercion for arguments is mentioned or implemented:\n   - `search_code(\"type=str\")`\n   - `search_code(\"int(value)\")`\n\nThese searches aim to provide a comprehensive background on how Django's command line argument parsing works, particularly in handling list arguments and type coercion, which are central to the reported issue."
