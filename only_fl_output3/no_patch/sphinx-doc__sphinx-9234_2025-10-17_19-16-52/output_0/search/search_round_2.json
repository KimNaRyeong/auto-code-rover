Since `LinkChecker` was not found, the functionality might be part of a more generically named utility or library. Let's broaden the search to any classes or methods that might deal with links or HTTP requests, as these are likely involved in checking links and handling redirects.\n\n2. The specifics such as `handle_redirect` and `report_error` might be functionalities captured under different naming or part of a larger method that deals with HTTP responses or error handling in a broader sense.\n\n3. The absence of any code snippets about \"allowed redirects\" suggests that the concept of managing or filtering redirects based on a whitelist might be currently non-existent in the project. This implies that adding such a feature would involve creating new mechanisms or extending existing ones.\n\nGiven these considerations, we should adjust our search strategy to look for:\n\n- Code that deals with HTTP requests and responses, as this will likely encompass how redirects are handled.\n- Generic error handling mechanisms, which might be where we can integrate specific redirect-related errors.\n- Configuration files or mechanisms used by the project, as they might offer insight into where and how a list of allowable redirects could be incorporated.\n\nNew API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"get\")` - This call aims to find methods that issue GET requests which might handle redirects implicitly.\n\n2. `search_method(\"post\")` - Similarly, this call checks for POST requests, as the link checker might be using POST requests in some cases.\n\n3. `search_code(\"HTTP\")` - This search aims to capture any code dealing with HTTP protocol directly, which could provide leads on handling redirects.\n\n4. `search_code(\"error\")` - Broader search for error handling mechanisms in the code.\n\nThese adjusted searches are designed to find relevant points in the codebase that deal with the broader functionality of sending HTTP requests, receiving responses, and handling errors, which are all pertinent to implementing the requested feature efficiently."

Let's analyze these leads:\n\n1. **HTTP Requests and Responses:**\n   - The method `get` within `sphinx/util/requests.py` and related files presumably deals with making HTTP GET requests, which is integral to checking the status of links, including following redirects.\n   \n   **Analysis:**\n   - This part of the code is likely responsible for issuing requests to URLs found in documentation to verify their availability. It might also handle HTTP redirects to some extent, given that HTTP redirects are a common response to GET requests.\n   - The relationship to the issue is direct since handling redirects properly to identify \"bad\" redirects versus acceptable ones is at the heart of the feature request.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Enhance this functionality to track redirects and, if a redirect is encountered, compare it against a predefined list of acceptable redirects. If the redirect does not match the list, report it as an error, rather than silently accepting it.\n\n2. **Link Checking:**\n   - The file `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` which appears to relate directly to checking links, includes snippets dealing with HTTP. This file might contain the bulk of the link checking logic.\n   \n   **Analysis:**\n   - This file likely encompasses the core functionality for verifying the status of links and could be where redirects are processed.\n   - The direct relationship to the issue: This is likely the place where handling of redirects needs to be refined to add the capability of differentiating between allowed and disallowed redirects.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Modify or enhance the link checking process to involve a verification step against a list of allowed redirects. Unmatched redirects should then trigger an error.\n\n3. **Error Handling:**\n   - Numerous instances of \"error\" present throughout the codebase, with a concentration within `sphinx/errors.py` and `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py`. These locations are likely involved in error reporting or exception handling.\n   \n   **Analysis:**\n   - These parts of the code manage how errors are reported or handled during the documentation build process, including possibly link checking errors.\n   - The relation to the issue: Effective error reporting for bad redirects is necessary for the feature to provide feedback to users/documentation maintainers about links that need attention.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Implement or extend existing error reporting mechanisms to include specific errors for disallowed redirects, perhaps by defining a new error class or extending the logic in `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py`.\n\nGiven this context, the bug locations seem to be primarily within `sphinx/util/requests.py` for handling the GET requests (including following redirects) and `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` for the actual link checking and perhaps error reporting functionalities. Enhancing these areas to deal with the specified issue would involve ensuring that redirects are not only followed but assessed against a list of acceptable redirects and then reported appropriately if they do not conform to the allowed patterns."

Upon encountering a redirect, the method should check if the redirect URL matches an entry in a predefined list of acceptable redirects. If it does not, the redirect should be reported as a \"bad\" redirect. The existing functionality for making HTTP requests and handling typical responses should be preserved, ensuring that any enhancement specifically addresses the management of redirects.\n   \n   **Location 2:**  \n   - **File:** `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py`  \n   \n   **Intended Behavior:**  \n   This file, which contains the core logic for link checking within the project, requires modification to incorporate a check against a list of permitted redirects. This involves:\n   \n   - Extending the link checking process to analyze the final URL (post-redirect) against a predefined list of acceptable redirects.\n   - Reporting an error or a specific warning for redirects that do not match the allowed list. This could be implemented through a new error class or by extending existing error reporting mechanisms within this context.\n   \n   The intended enhancement here is to provide clear feedback when a link redirects in a way that is not approved, thereby aiding in the maintenance of accurate and valid documentation links. This new behavior must integrate smoothly with the current link verification process, ensuring it does not negatively impact the functionality for verifying link availability or the reporting of unrelated issues.\n\nThese enhancements focus on providing greater control over which redirects are considered acceptable within the documentation, ensuring that redirects leading to irrelevant or incorrect content can be readily identified and corrected."
