Good websites will provide redirects to the correct new location or return an HTTP error code. Bad websites will redirect to an unrelated page or the root of the website.\nPreventing all redirects does not allow links to URLs like https://www.sphinx-doc.org/ which redirects to https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/. It needs to be possible to allow these redirects but disallow others.\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nIt should be possible to prohibit unknown redirects by listing all of the allowed redirects as pairs of URLs.\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nPost-process `linkcheck/output.txt` by removing filenames and line numbers then sorting it and comparing it with known good output.\n**Additional context**\nA link to https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/ (which used to work) now redirects to https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/. Linkcheck allows this but the original link is not valid and needs to be updated to the article's new URL of https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/.\nLinkcheck should be able to report an error for this redirect.\n</issue>"

Given the nature of the issue, key elements of interest would likely involve classes or methods responsible for processing links, handling redirects, and reporting issues with URLs.\n\nBased on the description, potential API calls to gather the necessary context might include searching for classes or methods related to link checking, handling redirects, configurations for allowed redirects, and methods for reporting errors with links.\n\n1. `search_class(\"LinkChecker\")` - This call aims to find a class that is primarily responsible for link checking, assuming a class named `LinkChecker` exists.\n\n2. `search_method(\"handle_redirect\")` - Given that handling redirects is a core part of the issue, this call aims to find methods across the project that are designed to deal with redirects.\n\n3. `search_method(\"report_error\")` - Since part of the solution would involve reporting errors for unauthorized redirects, this API call aims to find methods responsible for reporting errors.\n\n4. `search_code(\"allowed redirects\")` - This search is to find instances in the code where allowed redirects might already be configured or where there is context suggesting how such a feature could be integrated.\n\nThese calls are designed to get a broad yet relevant swath of the codebase that deals with link checking, handling redirects, and how errors are reported, which are all pertinent to implementing the feature request described in the issue."

Since `LinkChecker` was not found, the functionality might be part of a more generically named utility or library. Let's broaden the search to any classes or methods that might deal with links or HTTP requests, as these are likely involved in checking links and handling redirects.\n\n2. The specifics such as `handle_redirect` and `report_error` might be functionalities captured under different naming or part of a larger method that deals with HTTP responses or error handling in a broader sense.\n\n3. The absence of any code snippets about \"allowed redirects\" suggests that the concept of managing or filtering redirects based on a whitelist might be currently non-existent in the project. This implies that adding such a feature would involve creating new mechanisms or extending existing ones.\n\nGiven these considerations, we should adjust our search strategy to look for:\n\n- Code that deals with HTTP requests and responses, as this will likely encompass how redirects are handled.\n- Generic error handling mechanisms, which might be where we can integrate specific redirect-related errors.\n- Configuration files or mechanisms used by the project, as they might offer insight into where and how a list of allowable redirects could be incorporated.\n\nNew API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"get\")` - This call aims to find methods that issue GET requests which might handle redirects implicitly.\n\n2. `search_method(\"post\")` - Similarly, this call checks for POST requests, as the link checker might be using POST requests in some cases.\n\n3. `search_code(\"HTTP\")` - This search aims to capture any code dealing with HTTP protocol directly, which could provide leads on handling redirects.\n\n4. `search_code(\"error\")` - Broader search for error handling mechanisms in the code.\n\nThese adjusted searches are designed to find relevant points in the codebase that deal with the broader functionality of sending HTTP requests, receiving responses, and handling errors, which are all pertinent to implementing the requested feature efficiently."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).
