Good websites will provide redirects to the correct new location or return an HTTP error code. Bad websites will redirect to an unrelated page or the root of the website.\nPreventing all redirects does not allow links to URLs like https://www.sphinx-doc.org/ which redirects to https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/. It needs to be possible to allow these redirects but disallow others.\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nIt should be possible to prohibit unknown redirects by listing all of the allowed redirects as pairs of URLs.\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nPost-process `linkcheck/output.txt` by removing filenames and line numbers then sorting it and comparing it with known good output.\n**Additional context**\nA link to https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/ (which used to work) now redirects to https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/. Linkcheck allows this but the original link is not valid and needs to be updated to the article's new URL of https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2016/12/02/symlinks-windows-10/.\nLinkcheck should be able to report an error for this redirect.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, the feature request of prohibiting unknown redirects by listing allowed redirects as pairs of URLs in the `link checker`, it's essential to gather context around the components of the project that handle link checking and URL redirects. Given the nature of the issue, key elements of interest would likely involve classes or methods responsible for processing links, handling redirects, and reporting issues with URLs.\n\nBased on the description, potential API calls to gather the necessary context might include searching for classes or methods related to link checking, handling redirects, configurations for allowed redirects, and methods for reporting errors with links.\n\n1. `search_class(\"LinkChecker\")` - This call aims to find a class that is primarily responsible for link checking, assuming a class named `LinkChecker` exists.\n\n2. `search_method(\"handle_redirect\")` - Given that handling redirects is a core part of the issue, this call aims to find methods across the project that are designed to deal with redirects.\n\n3. `search_method(\"report_error\")` - Since part of the solution would involve reporting errors for unauthorized redirects, this API call aims to find methods responsible for reporting errors.\n\n4. `search_code(\"allowed redirects\")` - This search is to find instances in the code where allowed redirects might already be configured or where there is context suggesting how such a feature could be integrated.\n\nThese calls are designed to get a broad yet relevant swath of the codebase that deals with link checking, handling redirects, and how errors are reported, which are all pertinent to implementing the feature request described in the issue."
