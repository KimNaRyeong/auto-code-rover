So it would require documentation changes, release notes, and a deprecation period.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n### `make_key` Method\n\nFound in `django/core/cache/backends/base.py`, the `make_key` method is a crucial part of the caching mechanism. This method constructs a cache key that other methods use. It allows for customization through subclassing or by providing a different key function at cache construction. The key construction involves appending a `key_prefix` and a `version` to the input key. This customization capability ensures that cache keys are unique and manageable across different versions or cache instances.\n\n**Relationship with the issue:**\nThe issue describes adding a helper function to streamline the process of making and validating cache keys to reduce repetition and ensure consistency. The `make_key` method is directly involved in this since it's the first step in the process that the new helper function (`make_and_validate_key`) will encapsulate.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\nThe helper function will internally call `make_key` to construct the cache key and then validate it. This ensures that the cache keys are not just correctly formed but also valid according to the system's constraints, before being used.\n\n### `validate_key` Method\n\nMentioned to be found in `django/core/cache/backends/base.py` and `django/core/cache/backends/memcached.py`, the `validate_key` method is responsible for ensuring that the constructed cache keys meet certain criteria before being used. These criteria might involve size limits, character restrictions, or other rules specific to the cache backend, such as those enforced by Memcached.\n\n**Relationship with the issue:**\nSimilar to `make_key`, the `validate_key` method is a crucial part of ensuring that cache keys are suitable for use within the system. The proposed helper function will enforce validation as a second step after key creation, automating and centralizing this best practice.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\nIntegrating `validate_key` within the `make_and_validate_key` helper ensures every generated key is validated without requiring explicit calls or risking omission of this step. This integration further adheres to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, promoting code reuse and consistency.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nThe investigation into `make_key` and `validate_key` methods shows they are foundational to cache key management in Django. The proposed helper function seeks to encapsulate these two steps into a single operation, thus adhering to best practices and enhancing code maintainability.\n\nGiven the importance of these methods in the Django caching mechanism, it\u2019s clear that introducing a helper function like `make_and_validate_key` is not just a quality-of-life improvement but a necessary step towards ensuring robust and error-free cache key generation and validation.\n\nTo proceed, I need to:\n\n- Ensure there is a complete understanding of how `validate_key` is implemented across different backends, specifically in `django/core/cache/backends/base.py` and `django/core/cache/backends/memcached.py`. This is crucial for designing the helper function to accommodate any backend-specific validation logic.\n- Understand any existing usages of `make_key` and `validate_key` in sequence within the codebase to identify the most beneficial places to replace with the new helper function."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

Bug Locations:\n\nLocation 1: \n- File: django/core/cache/backends/base.py\n- Class: BaseCache\n\nIntended Behavior:\nA new method named `make_and_validate_key` should be added to the `BaseCache` class. This method encapsulates the process of generating and validating cache keys, thereby improving code reusability and consistency across different parts of the application. The method will call the existing `make_key` method to generate a key, then immediately validate this key using the existing `validate_key` method. After validation, the method returns the key if it passes all validations. This integration ensures all cache keys are consistently validated following the system's constraints before use, adhering to the DRY principle and minimizing repetitive code across the cache backends.\n\nThe method's implementation will resemble:\n```python\ndef make_and_validate_key(self, key, version=None):\n    key = self.make_key(key, version=version)\n    self.validate_key(key)\n    return key\n```\n\nThis method makes the process of generating and validating cache keys a single-step operation for all cache backends inheriting from `BaseCache`, ensuring consistency, reducing the likelihood of developer errors, and adhering to the principle of encapsulation."
