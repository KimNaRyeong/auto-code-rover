        "intended_behavior": "A new method named `make_and_validate_key` should be added to the `BaseCache` class. This method encapsulates the process of generating and validating cache keys, thereby improving code reusability and consistency across different parts of the application. The method will call the existing `make_key` method to generate a key, then immediately validate this key using the existing `validate_key` method. After validation, the method returns the key if it passes all validations. This integration ensures all cache keys are consistently validated following the system's constraints before use, adhering to the DRY principle and minimizing repetitive code across the cache backends."
