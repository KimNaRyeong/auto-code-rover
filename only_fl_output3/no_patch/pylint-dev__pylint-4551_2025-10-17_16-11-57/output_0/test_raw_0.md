This `reproducer.py` script simulates the reproduction of the issue by performing these steps:
- Writes a sample Python code with type hints to a file.
- Calls `pyreverse` to generate UML from this Python code.
- Assumes a hypothetical validation of the UML output for type hints through `assert_type_hints_in_uml`, which you'll need to adjust based on actual validation mechanisms.
- Cleans up the generated source and UML files.

It uses `print_stacktrace` to print exceptions clearly, fulfilling the task requirement for detailing any encountered issues. 

**Note:** The function `assert_type_hints_in_uml` is hypothetical and does not actually parse or inspect the generated UML. In practice, you would need a realistic method to validate the contents of the generated UML (e.g., parsing the .dot file or inspecting the PNG with OCR or relevant tools if checking graphical output was absolutely necessary).
