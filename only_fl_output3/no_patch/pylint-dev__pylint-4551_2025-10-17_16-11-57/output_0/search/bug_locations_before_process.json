When the method encounters an attribute with a type hint, it should capture this type information and store it alongside the attribute's name. This enhancement allows the generation of UML diagrams that accurately reflect the type hints as specified in the source code, thereby improving the utility of the diagrams for documentation and analysis purposes. The modification must ensure that it does not interfere with the current functionality for attributes without type hints."

It needs to be modified so that when attributes with type hints are present, these type hints are included in the UML diagram output. This would likely involve adjusting how the class attributes are formatted for the diagram, to include type information where available. The existing functionality for adding classes and attributes without type hints should remain unaffected, ensuring that the method can handle both cases seamlessly."
