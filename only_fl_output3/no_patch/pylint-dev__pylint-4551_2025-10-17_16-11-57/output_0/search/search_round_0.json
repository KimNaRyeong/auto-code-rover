        "content": "To address the issue related to pyreverse not reading Python type hints, and to gather context on how the current implementation handles class definition and initialization, the following search API calls would be particularly useful:\n\n1. Search for the implementation of the class handling in pyreverse to understand how classes are processed.\n   - `search_class(\"ClassDiagram\")`\n\n2. Search for the method that might be responsible for generating the UML diagram output, as this is likely where modifications are needed to include type hints.\n   - `search_method(\"generate_diagram\")`\n\n3. Since `__init__` function and its parameters are key to this issue, looking up how methods and their parameters are currently handled can provide insight into where changes might be necessary.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"Diagram\")`\n\n4. Finally, to get an exact match on how default arguments are parsed and represented in the UML output, searching the codebase for similar patterns might uncover relevant implementation details.\n   - `search_code(\"def __init__(self\")`\n\nThese searches aim to uncover how pyreverse generates UML diagrams, specifically how it handles class methods and parameters, and to find the point in the code where type hints need to be considered to enhance the tool as requested."
