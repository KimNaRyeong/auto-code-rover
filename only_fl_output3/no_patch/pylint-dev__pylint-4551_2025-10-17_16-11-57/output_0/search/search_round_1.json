Based on its methods, it can add objects (classes), relationships, and attributes to the diagram. These capabilities make it central to generating UML diagrams which include class relationships and individual class details.\n   \n2. **Relationship to the bug**: \n   - Given that the issue is with pyreverse not showing Python type hints in its UML output, `ClassDiagram` and its methods might not currently account for type annotations when extracting class attributes and their types. This means the mechanism to read and integrate type hints (like `a: str`) into the UML diagrams needs to be improved or implemented within this part of the codebase.\n   \n3. **Intended behavior**: \n   - Ideally, `ClassDiagram` should be capable of parsing and representing type hints in the UML diagrams it generates. This might involve modifying methods such as `get_attrs` to extract type information from the AST nodes of class attributes, and `add_object` to include this information when adding class details to the diagram. \n\nConsidering the issue and the results of the search API calls, it seems that we need more information on how attributes and their types are currently processed within classes like `ClassDiagram`. To further dig into this, we need to specifically look into the methods that are most likely to handle the extraction and representation of class attributes and their types\u2014namely, `get_attrs`, `add_object`, and any other method that deals with the processing of class attributes for the UML output.\n\n**Next Steps Based on Analysis**:\n\n1. Examine how `get_attrs` extracts attributes from classes, as it could be the method where adding support for type hints is most logical.\n   - Since the `get_attrs` method is directly involved in gathering attribute information, understanding its current behavior is key to implementing our desired type hint support.\n\n2. Look at `add_object` to understand how classes and their attributes are added to UML diagrams.\n   - The way objects are added to the diagram might need to be extended to include type information alongside the attribute names.\n\nTo gain further context necessary for developing a patch, the following API calls should be made next:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"get_attrs\", \"pylint/pyreverse/diagrams.py\")`\n- `search_method_in_file(\"add_object\", \"pylint/pyreverse/diagrams.py\")`\n\nThese calls aim to provide a deeper understanding of how `ClassDiagram` interacts with class attributes and how it could be adapted to include type hints in the generated UML diagram, addressing the reported issue."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

To resolve the issue, it should be enhanced to also parse and include Python type hints for each attribute. When the method encounters an attribute with a type hint, it should capture this type information and store it alongside the attribute's name. This enhancement allows the generation of UML diagrams that accurately reflect the type hints as specified in the source code, thereby improving the utility of the diagrams for documentation and analysis purposes. The modification must ensure that it does not interfere with the current functionality for attributes without type hints.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: \n  - File: `pylint/pyreverse/diagrams.py`\n  - Class: `ClassDiagram`\n  - Method: `add_object`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: This method is responsible for adding classes and their attributes to the UML diagram. It needs to be modified so that when attributes with type hints are present, these type hints are included in the UML diagram output. This would likely involve adjusting how the class attributes are formatted for the diagram, to include type information where available. The existing functionality for adding classes and attributes without type hints should remain unaffected, ensuring that the method can handle both cases seamlessly.\n\nThese adjustments will ensure that pyreverse is updated to utilize Python type hints, thereby making the generated UML diagrams more informative and accurate, fulfilling the feature request."
