Below is an example `reproducer.py` that follows your instructions. This script attempts to reproduce the issue as described, checking for the presence of `NULL` in an IN clause due to the prefetch_related method on a model with a nullable ForeignKey. It will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue exists (i.e., if `NULL` is passed in the IN clause), printing a detailed stack trace. If the issue is fixed, the script will complete without any errors and exit with code 0.

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models, connections
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line

# Configuration to run as standalone script
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
settings.configure(
    INSTALLED_APPS=['__main__'],
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    },
    USE_TZ=True,
)

django.setup()

class Author(models.Model):
    pass

class Book(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, null=True, on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING)

execute_from_command_line(['manage.py', 'migrate'])

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_query():
    author = Author.objects.create()
    Book.objects.create(author=author)
    Book.objects.create(author=None)
    Book.objects.prefetch_related('author')._fetch_all()
    last_query = connections['default'].queries[-1]['sql']
    assert "IN (NULL" not in last_query, f"Found 'IN (NULL, ...)' in SQL query: {last_query}"

try:
    test_query()
    print("No issue detected.")
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise
```

To use this script, you'd place it in the project's root directory as instructed and run it with `python3 reproducer.py`. This setup assumes you have Django installed in your environment and does not include specific versions or deeper configurations for simplicity. Note that for a real-world scenario or more complex Django project settings, additional configurations (like `SECRET_KEY`, more complex `DATABASES` settings) might be necessary.

Remember, the script uses Django's ability to dynamically configure settings, which is useful for standalone scripts but differs from the typical setup in a standard Django project deployment.
