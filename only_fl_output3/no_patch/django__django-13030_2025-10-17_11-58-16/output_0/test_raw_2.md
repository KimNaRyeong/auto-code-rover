To address the issue and create a standalone `reproducer.py` script that reproducibly demonstrates the issue with handling `NULL` in a Django `prefetch_related` query, and then exits correctly based on whether the issue is present or fixed, follow the structure below. This script includes adjustments to ensure Django is correctly configured for this isolated context:

```python
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models, connection
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line


# Define a minimal Django configuration
def setup_django():
    settings.configure(
        DEBUG=True,
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': 'testdb.sqlite3',
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=('__main__',),
        USE_I18N=True,
        USE_L10N=True,
        USE_TZ=True,
        SECRET_KEY='justasecretkey',
        ROOT_URLCONF=None,
    )
    django.setup()

    # Automate migrations
    execute_from_command_line(['manage.py', 'migrate'])


class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255, null=True)


class Book(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, null=True, on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING)


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def main():
    setup_django()

    a1 = Author.objects.create(name="Author 1")
    Book.objects.create(author=a1)
    Book.objects.create(author=None)

    books = Book.objects.prefetch_related('author')
    list(books)  # Force the query to run

    last_query = connection.queries[-1]['sql']
    try:
        assert "NULL" not in last_query, "The issue is present: NULL found in IN clause of the query"
        print("The issue is fixed. EXITING with code 0.")
        os._exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("EXITING with code 1.")
        os._exit(1)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script sets up a minimal Django environment programmatically, including configuration, models, and database migrations. It then reproduces the issue by creating `Author` and `Book` instances, where one `Book` instance has a `NULL` author, and prefetches the authors. The script checks the last executed SQL query for the presence of `NULL` in the `IN` clause and asserts to fail if `NULL` is present, which is expected behavior to illustrate the issue. Depending on the assertion's outcome, it prints a stack trace of the assertion error or exits with the corresponding code indicating whether the issue is resolved.

Note:
- The database used here is SQLite for simplicity and demonstration purposes. Adjustments may be required for other database systems.
- This script manipulates process exit codes directly to conform to the provided specifications.
