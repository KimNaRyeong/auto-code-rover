        "intended_behavior": "The method constructing the IN query for prefetch_related should exclude NULL values from the list of IDs it uses to prefetch related objects. This change aims to optimize query performance and integrity by ensuring that NULL values, which won't match any related objects (since FK constraints prevent such matches), are not used in an IN clause. This behavior should be implemented in a way that does not affect other functionalities of prefetch_related, such as handling other valid lookup values or the ability to prefetch multiple related objects efficiently."
