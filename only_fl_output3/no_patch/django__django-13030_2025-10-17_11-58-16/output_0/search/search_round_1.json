Passing NULL is always unnecessary, since it's not allowed in FK's. There's a small risk from passing NULL that it could lead to incorrect with complex prefetch querysets using PK refs because of NULL's weirdness in SQL.\nFor example with these models:\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Author(models.Model):\npass\nclass Book(models.Model):\nauthor = models.ForeignKey(Author, null=True, on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING)\nPrefetching authors on Books, when at least one Book has author=None, uses IN (..., NULL, ...) in the query:\nIn [1]: from example.core.models import Author, Book\nIn [2]: a1 = Author.objects.create()\nIn [3]: Book.objects.create(author=a1)\nOut[3]: <Book: Book object (3)>\nIn [4]: Book.objects.create(author=None)\nOut[4]: <Book: Book object (4)>\nIn [5]: Book.objects.prefetch_related('author')\nOut[5]: <QuerySet [<Book: Book object (3)>, <Book: Book object (4)>]>\nIn [6]: from django.db import connection\nIn [7]: connection.queries\nOut[7]:\n[{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_author\" (\"id\") VALUES (NULL)', 'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_book\" (\"author_id\") VALUES (2)', 'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_book\" (\"author_id\") VALUES (NULL)',\n'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"core_book\".\"id\", \"core_book\".\"author_id\" FROM \"core_book\" LIMIT 21',\n'time': '0.000'},\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"core_author\".\"id\" FROM \"core_author\" WHERE \"core_author\".\"id\" IN (NULL, 2)',\n'time': '0.000'}]\nMaybe this could generally be extended to use of __in with non-nullable fields?\n</issue>"

The reported issue suggests the problem arises in the context of Django ORM's handling of prefetch_related queries on models having nullable foreign keys.\n\nLet's break down the necessary steps to get more context:\n\n1. **Find where `prefetch_related` is implemented**: This method is likely part of Django's QuerySet API, which suggests we start by looking in the Django codebase for the implementation of `prefetch_related`.\n\n2. **Understand how FK fields are handled during prefetch_related operations**: Since the issue involves foreign key relationships (`models.ForeignKey`), it will be beneficial to understand the implementation and usage of foreign key fields within prefetch_related operations or any related utility methods.\n\n3. **Identify how `IN` queries are constructed**: The issue mentions an `IN` query that includes `NULL` values (`IN (NULL, 2)`). Hence, it's important to find out where and how these `IN` queries are built, specifically for prefetch_related use cases.\n\nGiven these considerations, here are the API calls we will make:\n\n- `search_method(\"prefetch_related\")`: To find the implementation or usage of `prefetch_related`.\n- `search_class(\"ForeignKey\")`: To get more context on how ForeignKey fields are represented and possibly any relation to prefetch_related logic.\n- `search_code(\"IN (NULL\")`: To find code snippets that may show how `IN` queries containing `NULL` values are constructed, which might be extending or used by `prefetch_related`.\n\nThese searches should provide enough context to start addressing the issue by understanding the current handling of `NULL` values in `IN` queries and how foreign keys are considered during prefetch_related operations."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context to address the issue of avoiding passing `NULL` to the `IN` lookup, especially in the context of Django's `prefetch_related` and how foreign key (FK) fields are handled, let's dive into each part:\n\n### 1. `prefetch_related` Implementation\n\n**Located in:** `django/db/models/query.py`\n\n**Analysis:**\n- This part of the codebase is where `prefetch_related` functionality is defined within Django's ORM.\n- `prefetch_related` is used to improve the efficiency of database operations by reducing the number of queries made, specifically for related objects.\n- The issue is linked to how `NULL` values are being passed through to the database in an `IN` lookup when using `prefetch_related`, which could be unnecessary or even problematic.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\n- Ideally, `prefetch_related` should optimize the query to exclude `NULL` values when identifying objects to prefetch, especially since `NULL` values in an `IN` clause for FK fields don't match any rows (given that FKs typically don't relate to `NULL` entries unless specifically allowed).\n\n### 2. `ForeignKey` Class\n\n**Located in:** `django/db/models/fields/related.py`\n\n**Analysis:**\n- This class defines the behavior of ForeignKey fields within Django models.\n- It is central to understanding how FK relationships are established and how they interact with database operations.\n- Given that the issue involves prefetching related objects through FK fields, any optimization or checks to exclude `NULL` from `IN` lookups might involve altering or extending the behavior of the `ForeignKey` class or related utility methods.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\n- The `ForeignKey` class, or related mechanisms, might need to ensure `NULL` values are not passed to `IN` lookups, perhaps by filtering out such values at the point of constructing the prefetch query.\n\n### Next Steps:\nGiven the analysis above, we'll need to dive deeper into how `prefetch_related` constructs its queries, specifically around FK fields. Since we didn't find direct references to the code constructing `IN (NULL, ...)` queries, a closer look into the methods within `django/db/models/query.py` that involve prefetching and handling `IN` queries is warranted.\n\n**Additional API Calls to Make:**\n1. **Explore the `prefetch_related` Implementation:** We need to examine the code inside `django/db/models/query.py` for any method that constructs the `IN` clause used by `prefetch_related`.\n   \n   - `search_method_in_file(\"prefetch_related\", \"django/db/models/query.py\")`\n   - Since specific method names that construct the `IN` queries weren't identified from the previous information, looking for methods related to query construction within `query.py` might be necessary. However, without explicit method names, we need to review the file where `prefetch_related` is to find related query construction methods.\n\n2. **Examine ForeignKey Related Query Construction:** Checking if there are specific methods in `ForeignKey` or its parent classes that contribute to the query preparation, particularly for prefetch operations, might also be insightful.\n\nWithout direct leads on how `IN (NULL, ...)` queries are constructed for `prefetch_related`, exploring how queries are generated in `query.py` where `prefetch_related` is implemented seems to be the most promising next step."

This particular location/method needs review, but without the exact method name, it's assumed to be part of or related to the `prefetch_related` implementation in this file.\n   \n   **Intended Behavior:**\n   - The method constructing the `IN` query for `prefetch_related` should exclude `NULL` values from the list of IDs it uses to prefetch related objects. This change aims to optimize query performance and integrity by ensuring that `NULL` values, which won't match any related objects (since FK constraints prevent such matches), are not used in an `IN` clause. This behavior should be implemented in a way that does not affect other functionalities of `prefetch_related`, such as handling other valid lookup values or the ability to prefetch multiple related objects efficiently.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe proposed change involves modifying the way `IN` clauses are constructed for prefetching related objects to ensure that `NULL` values are not included. Since the issue describes a scenario where `NULL` values in an `IN` clause could lead to inefficiencies or incorrect behavior in SQL operations, specifically with foreign key relationships, the fix would involve reviewing and potentially adjusting the query construction logic within Django's ORM layer that handles `prefetch_related` operations.\n\nGiven the nature of the described issue, the exact method(s) to be modified within `django/db/models/query.py` were not identified through the search results provided; thus, a close manual inspection of the relevant part(s) of the implementation is recommended to identify where the exclusion of `NULL` values should be applied. The modification should ensure that all related object ID collection logic for `prefetch_related` queries filters out `NULL` values before forming the `IN` clause, thus preserving the performance and accuracy of prefetch operations while maintaining backward compatibility and existing functionalities."
