        "content": "<issue>Avoid passing NULL to the IN lookup\nDescription\nCurrently prefetch_related on a FK passes the NULL through to the database for e.g. author_id IN (NULL, 2). Passing NULL is always unnecessary, since it's not allowed in FK's. There's a small risk from passing NULL that it could lead to incorrect with complex prefetch querysets using PK refs because of NULL's weirdness in SQL.\nFor example with these models:\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Author(models.Model):\npass\nclass Book(models.Model):\nauthor = models.ForeignKey(Author, null=True, on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING)\nPrefetching authors on Books, when at least one Book has author=None, uses IN (..., NULL, ...) in the query:\nIn [1]: from example.core.models import Author, Book\nIn [2]: a1 = Author.objects.create()\nIn [3]: Book.objects.create(author=a1)\nOut[3]: <Book: Book object (3)>\nIn [4]: Book.objects.create(author=None)\nOut[4]: <Book: Book object (4)>\nIn [5]: Book.objects.prefetch_related('author')\nOut[5]: <QuerySet [<Book: Book object (3)>, <Book: Book object (4)>]>\nIn [6]: from django.db import connection\nIn [7]: connection.queries\nOut[7]:\n[{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_author\" (\"id\") VALUES (NULL)', 'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_book\" (\"author_id\") VALUES (2)', 'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_book\" (\"author_id\") VALUES (NULL)',\n'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"core_book\".\"id\", \"core_book\".\"author_id\" FROM \"core_book\" LIMIT 21',\n'time': '0.000'},\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"core_author\".\"id\" FROM \"core_author\" WHERE \"core_author\".\"id\" IN (NULL, 2)',\n'time': '0.000'}]\nMaybe this could generally be extended to use of __in with non-nullable fields?\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about where and how the prefetch_related mechanism is implemented and interacts with foreign keys (FKs), specifically to prevent passing `NULL` in an `IN` query. The reported issue suggests the problem arises in the context of Django ORM's handling of prefetch_related queries on models having nullable foreign keys.\n\nLet's break down the necessary steps to get more context:\n\n1. **Find where `prefetch_related` is implemented**: This method is likely part of Django's QuerySet API, which suggests we start by looking in the Django codebase for the implementation of `prefetch_related`.\n\n2. **Understand how FK fields are handled during prefetch_related operations**: Since the issue involves foreign key relationships (`models.ForeignKey`), it will be beneficial to understand the implementation and usage of foreign key fields within prefetch_related operations or any related utility methods.\n\n3. **Identify how `IN` queries are constructed**: The issue mentions an `IN` query that includes `NULL` values (`IN (NULL, 2)`). Hence, it's important to find out where and how these `IN` queries are built, specifically for prefetch_related use cases.\n\nGiven these considerations, here are the API calls we will make:\n\n- `search_method(\"prefetch_related\")`: To find the implementation or usage of `prefetch_related`.\n- `search_class(\"ForeignKey\")`: To get more context on how ForeignKey fields are represented and possibly any relation to prefetch_related logic.\n- `search_code(\"IN (NULL\")`: To find code snippets that may show how `IN` queries containing `NULL` values are constructed, which might be extending or used by `prefetch_related`.\n\nThese searches should provide enough context to start addressing the issue by understanding the current handling of `NULL` values in `IN` queries and how foreign keys are considered during prefetch_related operations."
