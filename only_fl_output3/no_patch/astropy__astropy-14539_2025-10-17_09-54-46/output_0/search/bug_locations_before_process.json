        "intended_behavior": "The `FITSDiff` class needs to ensure accurate handling and comparison of variable-length arrays (VLAs). The intended behavior should involve a comparison mechanism that: - Properly identifies and compares VLAs by considering their unique structure and potential peculiarities in data storage or representation in the FITS format. - Ensures that comparing the same file against itself (or identical files) with VLAs results in recognizing them as identical without falsely reporting differences. This might involve enhancing existing methods within `FITSDiff` to better recognize and correctly process VLAs, ensuring the comparison accounts for their structure and content accurately."
