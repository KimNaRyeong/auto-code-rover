This script adheres to your requirements closely. It attempts to reproduce the specified issue by writing a FITS file that contains a variable-length array (VLA) and then comparing it to itself using `FITSDiff`. If `FITSDiff` erroneously reports differences, an `AssertionError` will be triggered, and the traceback with relevant line numbers will be printed. If no problem is detected (i.e., when the issue has been resolved in a future release), the script exits with code 0.
