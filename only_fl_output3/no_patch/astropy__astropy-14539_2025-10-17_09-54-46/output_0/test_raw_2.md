Certainly, to address the earlier issues and ensure the script works as intended to reproduce the observed behavior with `astropy.io.fits.FITSDiff` and variable-length arrays (VLAs), here is a revised standalone Python script. The script is more comprehensive, including error handling to print a stack trace in case of an assertion failure which will be caused by the unexpected behavior of `FITSDiff`.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from astropy.io import fits
    col = fits.Column(name='a', format='QD', array=[[0], [0, 0]])
    hdu = fits.BinTableHDU.from_columns([col])
    hdu.writeto('diffbug.fits', overwrite=True)

    diff_result = fits.FITSDiff('diffbug.fits', 'diffbug.fits')
    identical = diff_result.identical
    if not identical:
        print("Differences found:")
        diff_result.report()
    
    # Assert that no differences should be found for an identical file comparison
    assert identical, "FITSDiff reports differences between identical files."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error when the issue is present
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(2)  # Exit with a different code for unexpected errors
    else:
        print("No issue detected.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit cleanly if the problem isn't present
```

This script is well-suited for putting in the root directory of a project and can be executed directly with Python 3 to check for the issue. It will raise an `AssertionError` when the compared FITS files, which are, in fact, the same file, are reported as different by `astropy.io.fits.FITSDiff`. This error, along with the stack trace, indicates the problem is present. If no differences are found, indicating the issue is resolved, the script will exit with code 0, signaling a successful test pass.
