    hdu.writeto('diffbug.fits', overwrite=True)

    identical = fits.FITSDiff('diffbug.fits', 'diffbug.fits').identical
    fits.printdiff('diffbug.fits', 'diffbug.fits')

    assert identical, "FITSDiff reports differences between identical files."

try:
    test_fits_diff()
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error when the issue is present
else:
    print("No issue detected.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit cleanly if the problem isn't present
```

This script will behave as described: if the issue with `io.fits.FITSDiff` reporting differences between identical files (especially with at least one VLA column) is present, an `AssertionError` will be raised and caught. The `print_stacktrace` function will then output a clear stack trace pointing out where the error occurred in the script. If the issue has been resolved, the script exits with code 0, indicating no errors were detected.
