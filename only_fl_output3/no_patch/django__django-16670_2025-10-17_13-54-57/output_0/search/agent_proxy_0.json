We also want to understand the current handling of iterators in these responses, which is central to the warning being raised. Therefore, I will perform the following searches:\n\n1. Search for the class `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` to understand its current implementation and how it might be interacting with file or stream responses.\n2. Search for the class `StreamingHttpResponse` to see how it's currently dealing with synchronous iterators and possibly locate the code that emits the warning.\n3. Search for the method or code snippet that emits the warning referenced in the issue to better understand under what conditions it is triggered.\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class(\"ASGIStaticFilesHandler\")\nsearch_class(\"StreamingHttpResponse\")\nsearch_code(\"StreamingHttpResponse must consume synchronous iterators in order to serve them asynchronously.
