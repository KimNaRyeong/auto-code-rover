        "intended_behavior": "The `__iter__` method should be enhanced to more effectively differentiate and handle synchronous versus asynchronous iterators based on the context in which `StreamingHttpResponse` is used. Specifically, when operating in an ASGI context, it should avoid raising warnings when encountering an asynchronous iterator. The method should automatically adapt async iterators for synchronous use when necessary, leveraging Django's existing async utilities more gracefully. This involves using Django's async to sync utilities to check and convert async iterators only when required and doing so before falling back to the warning and the less efficient conversion process. This enhancement will ensure that `StreamingHttpResponse` can natively handle asynchronous content more smoothly in the ASGI context, aligning with the async capabilities introduced in Django 3.1 and expanded upon in subsequent releases."

        "intended_behavior": "While the `__init__` method in `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` itself may not be directly responsible for the issue, adjustments or additions to this class should be made to preemptively handle the streaming of static files in an async-compatible manner. This could involve implementing or overriding a method to specifically adapt or wrap file response iterators for async handling when necessary. The goal is to ensure that static files are served without triggering the warning about incorrect iterator usage, thereby enhancing the compatibility of `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` with Django's asynchronous environment. An ideal solution might involve checking for the response type and, if it's a `StreamingHttpResponse` with a synchronous iterator, wrapping or converting it into an asynchronous iterator in a manner that is transparent and efficient. This proactive approach ensures that static files are served in accordance with the best practices for async functionality, leveraging the full capabilities of Django's asynchronous support."
