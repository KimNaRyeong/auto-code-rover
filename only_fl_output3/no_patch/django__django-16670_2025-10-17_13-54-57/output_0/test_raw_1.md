Given that the objective is to reproduce a specific issue involving Django's `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` and `StreamingHttpResponse` within a Django 4.2 environment, and based on the feedback that running the server is not feasible for the purpose of this demonstration, the below approach is tailored to simulate the error condition without relying on external server components like Daphne. This approach will manually invoke Django functionalities that are likely to trigger the reported warning, all while encapsulating everything within a single standalone script.

To accurately reproduce the issue and detect the presence of the warning, the script will leverage Python's `warnings` module to capture warning messages. This approach allows us to programmatically assert whether the specific warning is triggered during the test's execution.

```python
import os
import sys
import warnings

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Dummy application to capture ASGIStaticFilesHandler behavior
async def application(scope, receive, send):
    if scope['type'] != 'http':
        raise ValueError("Scope type not supported")
    await send({
        'type': 'http.response.start',
        'status': 200,
        'headers': [
            [b'content-type', b'text/plain'],
        ],
    })
    await send({
        'type': 'http.response.body',
        'body': b'Hello, world!',
    })

def reproduce_issue():
    request = HttpRequest()
    request.method = 'GET'
    request.path = '/static/example.jpg'
    try:
        handler = ASGIStaticFilesHandler(application)
        response = handler(request)
        if isinstance(response, HttpResponse):
            # Assume issue did not occur if a response is generated
            # In practice, checking for warning or error conditions related to the issue.
            return False
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    return True

    execute_from_command_line(sys.argv)

    # Capture specific warnings to confirm the issue presence
    with warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as w:
        warnings.simplefilter("always")
        
        issue_reproduced = reproduce_issue()
        
        # Check if any expected warning was raised
        warning_triggered = any("StreamingHttpResponse must consume synchronous iterators" in str(warn.message) for warn in w)
        
        if warning_triggered and issue_reproduced:
            print("Issue successfully reproduced. Warning detected.")
        elif not warning_triggered and not issue_reproduced:
            print("No issue detected.")

```

This script aims to simulate the conditions under which the issue would manifest, focusing on the configuration of `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` and its handling of static files within an ASGI application. It's designed to be run in an environment where Django 4.2 is installed. Please ensure that Django is properly installed in your environment, and note that modifications may be necessary based on the project's specific configuration aspects not covered in your issue description.
