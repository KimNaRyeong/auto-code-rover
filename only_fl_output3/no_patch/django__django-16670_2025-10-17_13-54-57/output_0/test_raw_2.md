Given the constraints and requirements for this task, below is a revised version of `reproducer.py` that specifically targets to reproduce the issue with `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` in Django 4.2, involving the incorrect iterator type warning. This revision takes a direct approach to simulate an environment where Django serves static files under ASGI, thereby trying to trigger the warning about `StreamingHttpResponse` needing an asynchronous iterator.

Please ensure your environment is set up correctly with Django 4.2 (or a release candidate version compatible with the description) before running this script. The script is designed to be as self-contained as possible, but correct functioning depends on the specificities of Django's ASGI handling which can be sensitive to the project's environment and Django configuration.

```python
import asyncio
import os
import warnings

# Function to print stack trace as specified
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Setup minimal Django environment
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', '__main__.settings')
from django.conf import settings

settings.configure(
    SECRET_KEY='a not so secret key',
    ROOT_URLCONF='__main__',
    INSTALLED_APPS=['django.contrib.staticfiles'],
    MIDDLEWARE=[],
    STATIC_URL='/static/',
    ASGI_APPLICATION='__main__.application',
    STATIC_ROOT=os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'static'),
)

from django.core.asgi import get_asgi_application
from django.urls import path

# Define a dummy view to trigger static file handling
def dummy_view(request):
    raise NotImplementedError("This view should not be called.")

urlpatterns = [
    path('static/', dummy_view),
]

application = get_asgi_application()

# Test ASGI server functionality including static file serving
async def test_asgi_application():
    # Create a mock ASGI callable with Daphne or similar ASGI server behavior
    scope = {
        'type': 'http',
        'method': 'GET',
        'path': '/static/example.jpg',
        'headers': [(b'host', b'example.com')],
        'query_string': b'',
        'client': ('127.0.0.1', 12345),
        'server': ('127.0.0.1', 8080),
    }
    
    class MockSend:
        async def __call__(self, message):
            print(message)

    class MockReceive:
        async def __call__(self):
            return {'type': 'http.disconnect'}

    send = MockSend()
    receive = MockReceive()

    # Capture warnings to assert if the specific warning is raised
    with warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as captured_warnings:
        warnings.simplefilter("always")
        await application(scope, receive, send)

        # Check if the specific warning was raised
        warning_is_present = any("StreamingHttpResponse must consume synchronous iterators" in str(w.message) for w in captured_warnings)

        assert not warning_is_present, "Issue detected: StreamingHttpResponse must consume synchronous iterators warning was raised"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(test_asgi_application())
```

This script specifically captures the setup and invocation prone to raise the warning as described. When run, it should either assert the presence of the issue (if unresolved) or complete quietly (indicating no such warning was emitted).

Do keep in mind:
- The Django project's settings, particularly relating to static files (`STATIC_URL`, `STATIC_ROOT`), should be appropriately configured for your environment.
- The environment should have Django 4.2 (or the relevant version at play) installed and properly configured.
- This script uses asynchronous functionality, thus requiring a Python version that supports `asyncio`.
- The true behavior regarding static file serving might require actually stored static files and correct URLs, which this simplified setup does not fully simulate. Adjustments may be necessary based on the specifics of your project's file serving arrangements.
