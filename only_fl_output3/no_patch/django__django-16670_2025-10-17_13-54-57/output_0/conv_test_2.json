Use an asynchronous iterator instead.\nThis is because FileResponse is not async compatible (nor is that likely, since neither is open()).\nA new project with: \nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n\t\"daphne\",\n\t...\n]\nASGI_APPLICATION = \"project.asgi.application\"\nrunserver, and then visit any page serving static files such as /admin/.\nThe fix is to have ASGIStaticFilesHandler adapt the iterator in the same way StreamingHttpResponse does.\n"

        "content": "Given that the objective is to reproduce a specific issue involving Django's `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` and `StreamingHttpResponse` within a Django 4.2 environment, and based on the feedback that running the server is not feasible for the purpose of this demonstration, the below approach is tailored to simulate the error condition without relying on external server components like Daphne. This approach will manually invoke Django functionalities that are likely to trigger the reported warning, all while encapsulating everything within a single standalone script.\n\nTo accurately reproduce the issue and detect the presence of the warning, the script will leverage Python's `warnings` module to capture warning messages.
