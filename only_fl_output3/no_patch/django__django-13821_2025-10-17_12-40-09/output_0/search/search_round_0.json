Debian Jessie ships with 3.8.7 and was EOL June 30, 2020.\nSQLite 3.9.0 was released in October 2015. SQLite version support seems like a similar situation as GEOS libraries which we generally support about 5 years after released.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue of dropping support for SQLite versions below 3.9.0, I would need to gather context on how the SQLite version is currently being checked within the project, as well as where SQLite features specific to versions 3.9.0 and above are being utilized. This would likely involve looking into any database initialization logic, feature checks related to SQLite, and possibly utility methods that abstract SQLite operations. Here are the API calls I would make to gather this context:\n\n1. `search_code(\"SQLite\")`: This would help identify files and code snippets where SQLite is mentioned, providing a broad overview of where database interactions or configurations occur.\n\n2. `search_code(\"SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1\")`: Since the `SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1` compile-time option is mentioned as being supported in SQLite 3.9.0+, finding references to it could pinpoint where version-specific features are used.\n\n3. `search_code(\"Indexes on expressions\")`: This search aims to find occurrences where expression-based indexes, a feature available from SQLite 3.9.0, might be utilized or referenced within the project.\n\n4. `search_method(\"get_sqlite_version\")`: It's common for projects supporting databases to have a utility method to check the database version. This search would help locate such a method if it exists.\n\n5. `search_code(\"sqlite_version\")`: Similar to the previous search, this aims to find references to SQLite version checks that might not be encapsulated in a method named after getting the SQLite version but are important for understanding how version checks are currently implemented."
