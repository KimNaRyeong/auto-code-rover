        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the initial searches provides insight into where and how SQLite is used and configured within the Django project. Considering no results were found for \"SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1\" and \"Indexes on expressions\", and similarly, no method named \"get_sqlite_version\" was located, our next steps should adapt based on the information we did find.\n\n### Analysis of Found Context\n\n1. **Files Containing SQLite References**:\n    - The presence of SQLite references across various `django/db/backends/sqlite3/` files indicates these files are crucial for SQLite configuration, feature flagging, and operation within Django. Given that our issue involves supporting only versions of SQLite >= 3.9.0, these files are likely candidates for patching to enforce the version requirement.\n    - Specifically, `features.py` and `base.py` in the SQLite3 backend have multiple mentions of SQLite and `sqlite_version`, which could indicate where version-dependent features are toggled or where the SQLite version is checked.\n\n2. **Implications for the Project**:\n    - Given no explicit occurrences of \"SQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1\" or \"Indexes on expressions\", the project might abstractly reference these features rather than explicitly. This could be in the form of feature checks within `features.py` or how the database schema is managed in `schema.py`.\n    - The absence of `get_sqlite_version` suggests that the version check might not be centralized in a single utility method. Instead, version checks could be scattered across different backend files, particularly within `features.py` and `base.py`.\n\n### Intended Behavior Post-Patch\n\n- **Enforce SQLite Version**:\n    - The project should check for the SQLite version early during database connection initialization or during feature checks. If the version is below 3.9.0, Django should either raise a warning or fail outright, depending on how strict they want to enforce this requirement.\n  \n- **Feature Flags Based on Version**:\n    - Features like JSON1 support or expression-based indexes should be conditionally enabled based on whether the SQLite version meets the minimum version requirement.\n\n### Next Steps for Gathering Context\n\nGiven the above analysis, it would be pertinent to inspect how `sqlite_version` is being used within the `features.py` and `base.py` files to get a clear picture of version checking and feature flagging mechanisms. Also, understanding how Django initializes the database connection in the SQLite backend could reveal where to place the version check most effectively.\n\n### Additional API Calls:\n\n1. `search_code_in_file(\"sqlite_version\", \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/features.py\")`: This will provide insights into how version-specific features are enabled or disabled.\n\n2. `search_code_in_file(\"sqlite_version\", \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py\")`: This will show us how the SQLite version is determined and possibly used to affect behavior.\n\n3. `get_code_around_line(\"django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py\", line_number, 5)`: Once we know where `sqlite_version` is mentioned in `base.py`, we should look around those specific lines to understand the context better. (Note: 'line_number' would be filled with the actual line numbers from the search results.)\n\nThese additional steps aim to fill the gaps in understanding the current handling of SQLite versioning and how features depending on this versioning are managed within Django.\n"

While more detailed inspections of the mentioned files could offer deeper insight, based on the information available, we can specify the necessary modifications:\n\n### Bug Locations\n\n1. **Location 1:** \n   - **File:** `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** This file likely handles the database connection setup. Introduce version checking logic during the initialization phase to ensure the SQLite version is 3.9.0 or higher. If the version is lower, the system should raise a ConfigurationError (or similar) with a message indicating that the SQLite version is unsupported. This ensures that Django will no longer operate with databases using an unsupported version of SQLite, aligning with the application's requirements to leverage features available in SQLite 3.9.0+.\n\n2. **Location 2:** \n   - **File:** `django/db/backends/sqlite3/features.py`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Update the feature flags related to SQLite capabilities (for example, support for JSON1 or indexes on expressions) to conditionally enable these based on the SQLite version being 3.9.0 or higher. This might already be in place to some extent; however, ensuring this explicit version dependency will align with dropping support for older versions. Essentially, the system should verify the SQLite version before enabling features dependent on newer versions, ensuring compatibility and avoiding runtime errors.\n\n### Rationale\n\n- The rationale behind choosing `base.py` is based on the assumption that database connection and configuration logic, where SQLite version checks are most pertinent, would be located here. Introducing a SQLite version check at the database initialization phase ensures that the application is immediately aware of compatibility issues, rather than discovering these issues at a later stage.\n  \n- The reason for selecting `features.py` lies in its potential role in toggling database features based on the SQLite version. This file likely contains conditionals that enable or disable certain Django features based on the database's capabilities. Ensuring that these feature flags accurately reflect the new minimum version requirement of SQLite 3.9.0 is crucial for maintaining functional integrity and leveraging SQLite's capabilities to their fullest.\n\n- Addressing the issue in these locations ensures that Django can utilize SQLite features such as `JSON1` and expression-based indexes without concern for compatibility issues, and it prevents the deployment of Django applications on environments with unsupported SQLite versions, which could lead to runtime errors or degraded functionality."
