To create a standalone script `reproducer.py` that attempts to reproduce the issue described (a Sphinx "duplicate term description" warning/error when building HTML from RST documents with glossary terms that differ only by case), we need to:

1. Clone the phpMyAdmin repository.
2. Navigate to the `doc` directory.
3. Install Sphinx.
4. Build the HTML documentation.

However, for a standalone Python script, we should aim to avoid external dependencies such as cloning a whole repository. Instead, we focus on directly simulating the scenario with Sphinx in a simplified manner. The script will:

- Create a temporary Sphinx project with a minimal `conf.py`.
- Add a glossary to an `rst` file with deliberately case-insensitive duplicates.
- Attempt to build the documentation.
- Detect whether Sphinx raises the "duplicate term description" warning/error.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import tempfile
from sphinx.application import Sphinx

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

This script does not perform the exact steps listed to reproduce the reported issue, such as cloning the phpMyAdmin repository, due to the standalone and dependency-free constraints. However, it is designed to simulate a similar scenario where Sphinx processes a glossary with duplicate terms differing only by their case. This is achieved by creating a temporary Sphinx project and attempting to build it, checking for failures related to the glossary terms.

Remember to have Sphinx installed in your environment where this script is executed. You can install Sphinx by running `pip install sphinx`. Also, the behavior and output of this script may vary depending on the Sphinx version, as the handling of such cases can evolve.
