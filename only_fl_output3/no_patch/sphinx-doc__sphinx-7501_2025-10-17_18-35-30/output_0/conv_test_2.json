Build the HTML documentation.\n\nHowever, for a standalone Python script, we should aim to avoid external dependencies such as cloning a whole repository. Instead, we focus on directly simulating the scenario with Sphinx in a simplified manner.

However, it is designed to simulate a similar scenario where Sphinx processes a glossary with duplicate terms differing only by their case. This is achieved by creating a temporary Sphinx project and attempting to build it, checking for failures related to the glossary terms.\n\nRemember to have Sphinx installed in your environment where this script is executed. You can install Sphinx by running `pip install sphinx`. Also, the behavior and output of this script may vary depending on the Sphinx version, as the handling of such cases can evolve."
