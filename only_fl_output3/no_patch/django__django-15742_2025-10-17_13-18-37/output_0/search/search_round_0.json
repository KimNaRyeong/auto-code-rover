        "content": "<issue>Blocktranslate asvar escapes variables, but stores the result as str instance, leading to double escaping\nDescription\nIn the docs, this snippet is given as an example usage of blocktranslate with the asvar argument (here: \u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/i18n/translation/#blocktranslate-template-tag:\n{% blocktranslate asvar the_title %}The title is {{ title }}.{% endblocktranslate %}\n<title>{{ the_title }}</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"{{ the_title }}\">\nHowever, this template is buggy when title is a string, which I'd argue is a common use case.\ntitle will be escaped when formatting the content of the blocktranslate block, but the \"was escaped\" information is discarded, and the_title will be a str instance with escaped content.\nWhen later using the the_title variable, it will be conditionally escaped. Since it is a str, it will be escaped, so control characters are escaped again, breaking their display on the final page.\nMinimal example to reproduce (can be put in any view):\nfrom django.template import Template, Context\ntemplate_content = \"\"\"\n{% blocktranslate asvar the_title %}The title is {{ title }}.{% endblocktranslate %}\n<title>{{ the_title }}</title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"{{ the_title }}\">\n\"\"\"\nrendered = Template(template_content).render(Context({\"title\": \"<>& Title\"}))\nassert \"&amp;lt;\" not in rendered, \"> was escaped two times\"\nI'd argue that blocktranslate should:\nEither assign a SafeString instance to prevent future escaping\nor not escape the variables used within the translation, and store them marked as unsafe (= as str instance)\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described related to Django's `blocktranslate` template tag handling and its interaction with variable escaping, let's gather the necessary code context. We need to look into the implementation of the `blocktranslate` tag and how it handles variables, specifically how it escapes them and assigns them to a variable (`asvar`). Understanding if the tag currently assigns a `SafeString` or an ordinary string (`str`) when variables are included in the translation block will be crucial. Let's also inspect how the template system decides when to escape variables.\n\nThe necessary steps include checking:\n\n1. The implementation of the `blocktranslate` template tag.\n2. The mechanism by which variables are escaped in the template context.\n3. The method/template tag handling the assignment (`asvar` functionality).\n4. How Django templates handle rendering of `SafeString` vs. `str` instances.\n\nTherefore, we need to perform the following API calls:\n\n- **Search for the `blocktranslate` implementation**: Since `blocktranslate` is likely to be implemented as a template tag within Django's templating engine, we should start by searching for the method or class that implements this functionality.\n- **Search for the method that handles variable escaping**: Variable escaping is a crucial part of safely rendering user-supplied input. It's important to understand how it is implemented to see where the double-escaping issue might occur.\n- **Inspect how `SafeString` and `str` are handled differently during rendering**: This involves understanding the template rendering process, specifically how different types of strings are handled to identify potential spots where the issue can be addressed.\n\nLet's start with these API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"blocktranslate\")`: To find the implementation of the `blocktranslate` template tag.\n2. `search_code(\"SafeString\")`: To understand how `SafeString` instances are handled differently from regular `str` instances in the template rendering process.\n3. `search_class(\"Template\")`: To inspect the `Template` class for context on how variables are processed and rendered, which might give us clues about where the escaping happens.\n\nThese searches should provide us with a solid foundation of the code context necessary to address the issue."
