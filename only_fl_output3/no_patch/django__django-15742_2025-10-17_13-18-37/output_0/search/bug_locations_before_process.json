Or, if escaping occurs within the `blocktranslate` scope, it should store the result as a `SafeString` to prevent re-escaping when the variable is reused. This change must be carefully integrated to avoid affecting the general security posture of Django's templating system, which escapes variables by default to prevent injection attacks."
