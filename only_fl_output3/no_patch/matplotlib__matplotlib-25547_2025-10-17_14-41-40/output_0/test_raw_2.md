To create a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that aims to reproduce the issues described, including checks to assert the presence or absence of `UserWarning` and handling of `StopIteration`, see the updated code block below. This script incorporates the function to print a detailed stack trace when exceptions are caught or assertions fail, thus helping in pinpointing the source of the issue more effectively.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import warnings
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Check for UserWarning when all color values are np.nan
def detect_warning_for_all_nan_colors():
    with warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as w:
        warnings.simplefilter("always")
        plt.scatter(np.ones(10), np.ones(10), c=np.full(10, np.nan))
        plt.close()
        if len(w) == 0:
            raise AssertionError("Expected a UserWarning for all NaN color values but did not get one.")

# Check for the StopIteration error within an ax.errorbar call
def detect_errorbar_stop_iteration():
    try:
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        ax.errorbar([0], [0], yerr=[np.nan])
        plt.close()
    except StopIteration as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("StopIteration was raised in ax.errorbar with all nan yerr.") from None

def main():
    try:
        detect_warning_for_all_nan_colors()
        detect_errorbar_stop_iteration()
        print("The issue was not reproduced.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script, written for execution with Python 3, does the following:
1. Checks if a `UserWarning` is correctly issued when attempting to plot a scatter plot where all color values are `np.nan`. The script expects this operation to throw a `UserWarning`, and an `AssertionError` is raised if it doesn't.
2. Checks for the presence of a `StopIteration` exception when calling `ax.errorbar` with `yerr` containing `np.nan` values. If such an exception is encountered, the script prints the stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function and raises an `AssertionError`.

The script is crafted to fail (exit with code 1) and provide detailed traceback information if the issues are detected, ensuring that it fits the intended use-case of being a diagnostic tool for reproducing the reported matplotlib behavior.
