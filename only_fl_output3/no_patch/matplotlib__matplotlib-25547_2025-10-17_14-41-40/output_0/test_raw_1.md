Given the information and the structure youâ€™ve requested, I'll revise the script accordingly to include checks that assert the presence of the issues based on the behavior rather than the absence of exceptions, which was the initial approach. The revised approach will focus on detecting an unexpected `UserWarning` and the raising of `StopIteration`, and it will properly handle the cases based on the described issues.

```python
import warnings
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_warning():
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    with warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as w:
        warnings.simplefilter("always")
        plt.scatter(np.ones(10), np.ones(10), c=np.full(10, np.nan))
        plt.show()
        return len(w) == 0

def check_errorbar():
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    try:
        fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)
        ax.errorbar([0], [0], yerr=[np.nan])
        plt.show()
        return True
    except StopIteration:
        return False

def main():
    test_warning_passed = check_warning()
    if not test_warning_passed:
        raise AssertionError("UserWarning detected when all color values are np.nan.")

    test_errorbar_passed = check_errorbar()
    if not test_errorbar_passed:
        raise AssertionError("StopIteration raised by ax.errorbar with all NaN yerr.")

    # If both checks pass
    print("All tests passed successfully.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print_stacktrace(error)
        sys.exit(1)
```

This revised `reproducer.py` does the following:
- Uses `warnings.catch_warnings` to detect if a `UserWarning` is thrown due to all NaN color values. This part checks if the issue regarding the warning is present by asserting that no warnings should be caught during the operation when it's expected not to warn.
- Tries to execute `ax.errorbar` with `yerr=[np.nan]` and ensures no `StopIteration` exception is raised to validate the fix for the `StopIteration` issue with error bars.
- Exits with code 0 when both issues are deemed fixed based on the assertions passing.
- Prints a stack trace and exits with code 1 upon encountering an AssertionError, indicating the presence of one of the issues.

Please adjust the use of this script as needed based on your development environment or the specificity of the issues encountered with the versions of Matplotlib or other dependencies in your project.
