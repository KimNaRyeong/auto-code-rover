To create a standalone Python script `reproducer.py` that aims to reproduce the reported issue and behaves as described, you can follow these steps. This script will dynamically generate the necessary Sphinx project and files, then build the documentation to check if the inherited attribute `attr1` from the superclass `Foo` in the subclass `Bar` is documented or not. 

Please note, this script requires Sphinx to be installed in your Python environment. If it's not installed, you can do so by running `pip install sphinx`.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

            raise AssertionError("Bar.attr1 is not documented as expected.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        setup_sphinx_project()
        build_sphinx()
        check_documentation()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    print("Issue reproduction script completed successfully.")
    sys.exit(0)
```

This script follows these steps:
1. Sets up a minimal Sphinx project with the necessary files (`conf.py`, `example.py`, and `index.rst`) in a directory named `source`.
2. Runs the Sphinx build process with the `sphinx-build` command, generating HTML documentation in the `build` directory.
3. Checks the `index.html` file inside the `build` directory for the presence of documentation for `attr1`, indicating whether the inherited attribute is documented or treated as "undocumented".
4. Raises an `AssertionError` if the documentation does not include `attr1`, implying the issue is present.
5. Prints a stack trace if an error occurs.

It exits with code 0 if everything works as expected, meaning the issue has been resolved, or enables the stack trace of the failure if the issue persists.
