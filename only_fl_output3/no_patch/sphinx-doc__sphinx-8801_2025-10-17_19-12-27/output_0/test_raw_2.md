Given the requirements and aiming for a solution that would work within the constraints specified, I have revised the approach to include error handling that deals with potential issues during Sphinx setup and build steps explicitly. Please ensure Sphinx is installed in your environment (`pip install sphinx`) before running this script.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_project():
    conf = """
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))
extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']

html_theme = 'alabaster'
"""
    example_py = """
class Foo:
    \"\"\"docstring\"\"\"
    attr1: int  #: docstring

class Bar(Foo):

    index_rst = """
.. automodule:: example

    :members:
    :inherited-members:
"""
    os.makedirs("source", exist_ok=True)
    with open("source/conf.py", "w") as f:
        f.write(conf)
    with open("source/example.py", "w") as f:
        f.write(example_py)
    with open("source/index.rst", "w") as f:
        f.write(index_rst)

def build_sphinx():
    try:
        subprocess.check_call(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', 'source', 'build'])
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

def check_documentation():
    try:
        with open("build/index.html", 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
            assert 'attr1' in content, "Bar.attr1 is not documented as expected."
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        setup_sphinx_project()
        build_sphinx()
        check_documentation()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    print("Issue reproduction script completed successfully.")
    sys.exit(0)
```

Before running, ensure Sphinx is available in your Python environment. This script:

1. Sets up a minimal Sphinx project structure.
2. Attempts to build the Sphinx documentation. Any issue during the build (e.g., Sphinx not installed correctly, build process errors) will result in stack trace printing and script termination with exit code 1.
3. Checks the generated `index.html` to confirm whether `Bar.attr1` is documented. If not, it raises an `AssertionError`.

The major changes include explicit subprocess error catching with `subprocess.CalledProcessError` during Sphinx's build process and additional error checking for `FileNotFoundError` when opening the `index.html` file, aiming to address the previous execution issues accurately.
