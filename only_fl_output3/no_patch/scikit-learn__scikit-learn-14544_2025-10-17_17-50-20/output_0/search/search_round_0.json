Examples are an actual bug when changing columns: #14237 and how to define number of input features #13603.\nRelated is also the idea of checking for column name consistency: #7242\nMainly I'm asking whether it makes sense to have the same requirements for ColumnTransformer as for other estimators.\nColumnTransformer is the only estimator that addresses columns by name, and so reordering columns doesn't impact the model and actually everything works fine. Should we still aim for checking for reordering of columns?\nRight now, ``transform`` even works if we add additional columns to ``X``, which makes sense, since it only cares about the columns it is using.\nShould we allow that going forward as long as remainder is not used? (if remainder is used, the result of ``ColumnTransformer`` would have a different shape and downstream estimators would break, so I think we shouldn't support it in this case).\nIn either case, what's ``n_features_in_`` for a ColumnTransformer? The number of columns in ``X`` during ``fit`` or the number of columns actually used?\nDoes it even make sense to define it if we allow adding other columns that are ignored?\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we'll need to gather context around the `ColumnTransformer` class and specific methods that might be relevant to the concerns raised in the issue. The main points of interest include input validation, how column changes (like reordering or adding columns) affect the transformer, and how `n_features_in_` is defined for `ColumnTransformer`. Let's proceed with the API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the `ColumnTransformer` class** to understand its current implementation and any input validation that might already exist.\n   - `search_class(\"ColumnTransformer\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `fit` method within the `ColumnTransformer` class** because how columns are handled during fitting (especially considering `n_features_in_`) is in question.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"ColumnTransformer\")`\n\n3. **Search for the `transform` method within the `ColumnTransformer` class** because the issue mentions that `transform` works even when additional columns are added to `X`, influencing how `n_features_in_` should be considered.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"transform\", \"ColumnTransformer\")`\n\n4. **Search globally for any method that might handle column name consistency checks** to see if there is an existing logic that can be extended or improved upon for the `ColumnTransformer`.\n   - `search_method(\"check_column_consistency\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a sufficient baseline of code context to begin addressing the concerns raised in the issue."
