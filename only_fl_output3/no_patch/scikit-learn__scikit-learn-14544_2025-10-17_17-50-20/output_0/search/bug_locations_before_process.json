        "intended_behavior": "The `transform` method already restricts reordering and addition of columns when `remainder` is used, throwing a ValueError for column order mismatch. However, to address the concerns raised, it should explicitly allow the addition of extraneous columns when `remainder='drop'` without raising an exception, provided that all columns expected by the transformer are present and in the correct order. This would support scenarios where new data includes additional, irrelevant columns that should not affect transformation. The logic to enforce this should carefully consider performance and not overly complicate the implementation. Additionally, the method or class documentation should clarify the behavior regarding added columns and how `n_features_in_` is determined, aligning with how transformations consider or ignore new columns."

        "intended_behavior": "Introduce a new method or utility function within `ColumnTransformer` that checks for the consistency of columns by name, besides their order and count, if possible. This method would help in scenarios where the schema of input data changes subtly (columns added or removed) without affecting the columns used by the transformer. The function could be used as a part of the `transform` method or even during `fit` to provide warnings or errors when the input structure deviates from expectations in a way that might subtly influence model performance."
