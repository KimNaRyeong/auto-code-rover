Examples are an actual bug when changing columns: #14237 and how to define number of input features #13603.\nRelated is also the idea of checking for column name consistency: #7242\nMainly I'm asking whether it makes sense to have the same requirements for ColumnTransformer as for other estimators.\nColumnTransformer is the only estimator that addresses columns by name, and so reordering columns doesn't impact the model and actually everything works fine. Should we still aim for checking for reordering of columns?\nRight now, ``transform`` even works if we add additional columns to ``X``, which makes sense, since it only cares about the columns it is using.\nShould we allow that going forward as long as remainder is not used? (if remainder is used, the result of ``ColumnTransformer`` would have a different shape and downstream estimators would break, so I think we shouldn't support it in this case).\nIn either case, what's ``n_features_in_`` for a ColumnTransformer? The number of columns in ``X`` during ``fit`` or the number of columns actually used?\nDoes it even make sense to define it if we allow adding other columns that are ignored?\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected information provides insight into how the `ColumnTransformer` handles fitting, transforming, and its interaction with column changes. Here's a summary based on the results and the issue description:\n\n### `ColumnTransformer` Class\n- **Purpose**: The class is designed to apply transformers to columns of an array or pandas DataFrame. It allows for different transformations for different columns.\n- **Key Methods**: `fit`, `transform`, and other utility methods to manage transformers.\n\n### `fit` Method\n- **What it does**: Fits all transformers using the input data `X`. It relies on `fit_transform` to ensure consistent output type and to set `sparse_output_`.\n- **Relation to the bug**: The method delegates to `fit_transform`, which might not explicitly address the concern of input validation or handling changes in column numbers or order after fitting. It\u2019s implied that `fit_transform` will handle setting some state, but there's no validation logic visible in the `fit` method itself concerning the columns.\n- **Intended behavior**: It should potentially validate the input columns, ensure consistency with learned expectations (e.g., during a previous `fit`), and manage the `n_features_in_` attribute mentioned in the issue.\n\n### `transform` Method\n- **What it does**: Transforms the input data `X` by applying each transformer to its respective column and concatenates the results.\n- **Relation to the bug**: The method has checks for the number of features and column ordering, especially in the context of using the `remainder` keyword. It throws a ValueError if the input features are fewer than expected or if the column order does not match the fitting phase when `remainder` is used.\n- **Intended behavior**: It handles some aspects of the issue by enforcing consistency in the number of features and column ordering under certain conditions. However, it could be extended or refined to address concerns about adding unaccounted-for columns or defining how `n_features_in_` is calculated and used.\n\n### Lack of `check_column_consistency` Method\n- **Observation**: The search for a method to check column consistency (`check_column_consistency`) returned no results.\n- **Implications**: There's no dedicated method in the current codebase for checking column name consistency or managing related validations, which is part of the issue raised.\n\n### Next Steps and API Calls\nGiven this analysis, additional context is necessary to understand how `n_features_in_` is determined and managed within the `ColumnTransformer`, and how column additions or reordering could be better validated or handled, especially if no active column consistency check is occurring.\n\n1. **Understanding `n_features_in_` Handling**: Since the exact management or calculation of `n_features_in_` within `ColumnTransformer` isn't clear from the current methods, we should search for references to this attribute within the `ColumnTransformer` class.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"n_features_in_\", \"sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py\")`\n\n2. **Exploring Column Validation Logic**: Considering there's no `check_column_consistency` method, it might be beneficial to see if there's any related column validation or feature count validation logic that might not have been explicitly named as such.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"validate\", \"sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py\")`\n\nThese steps aim to gather crucial information on handling feature input validation, which seems central to the concerns raised in the issue."

However, to address the concerns raised, it should explicitly allow the addition of extraneous columns when `remainder='drop'` without raising an exception, provided that all columns expected by the transformer are present and in the correct order. This would support scenarios where new data includes additional, irrelevant columns that should not affect transformation. The logic to enforce this should carefully consider performance and not overly complicate the implementation. Additionally, the method or class documentation should clarify the behavior regarding added columns and how `n_features_in_` is determined, aligning with how transformations consider or ignore new columns.\n  \n- **Location 2:** File: `sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py`, Class: `ColumnTransformer`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Introduce a new method or utility function within `ColumnTransformer` that checks for the consistency of columns by name, besides their order and count, if possible. This method would help in scenarios where the schema of input data changes subtly (columns added or removed) without affecting the columns used by the transformer. The function could be used as a part of the `transform` method or even during `fit` to provide warnings or errors when the input structure deviates from expectations in a way that might subtly influence model performance.\n  \nClarification and enhancement of these behaviors in the `ColumnTransformer` could help address the nuances involved in managing complex data transformation pipelines, especially when dealing with dynamic or evolving datasets. Such improvements would directly address the issues raised, by making the `ColumnTransformer` more robust against changes in input data structure and clearer in its requirements and limitations."
