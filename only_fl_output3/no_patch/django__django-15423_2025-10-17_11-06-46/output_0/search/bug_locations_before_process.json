        "intended_behavior": "The `LazyObject` class should be modified in a way that prevents it from proxying methods (`__getitem__`, `__iter__`, and potentially others) that the wrapped object does not support. To resolve the issue, the class should implement a mechanism to check whether the wrapped object supports a method before it is accessed. If the method is not supported, `LazyObject` should either raise a clear and informative error or provide a neutral response that avoids runtime exceptions. This behavior would preserve the lazy instantiation benefits of `LazyObject` while ensuring compatibility with wrapped objects that do not support specific methods. Implementing a check within the `new_method_proxy` function (or where it's applied) to verify the existence of the method on the wrapped object before actually proxying the call could be a viable approach. This would ideally be done in a manner that is transparent to the developers using `LazyObject`, requiring no changes on their part to benefit from the improved error handling and method support verification."
