        "intended_behavior": "The `tripcolor` function should correctly apply the `vmin` and `vmax` parameters to scale the color normalization of the plot such that the color mapping and colorbar accurately reflect the specified limits. This involves ensuring that any logic that sets or adjusts `vmin` and `vmax` ahead of the call to `_scale_norm(norm, vmin, vmax)` properly interprets and applies these values. Specifically, any handling of `kwargs` related to `clim` or direct `vmin` and `vmax` parameters needs to ensure these are not ignored and correctly influence the normalization and scaling process.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the function must be reviewed to:\n - Verify the extraction and application of `vmin` and `vmax` (or `clim` if applicable) from the function arguments or `kwargs` is correctly implemented.\n - Ensure `_scale_norm` is called with the correct `vmin` and `vmax` values, reflecting the user's intent or defaults that respect the `clim` bounds when specified.\n - Maintain existing functionality for cases where `vmin` and `vmax` are not explicitly provided, ensuring backward compatibility and expected default behavior.\n\nThis change will ensure that when `clim` (or `vmin` and `vmax`) is specified, the color range of the plot accurately represents the specified limits, addressing the reported bug while preserving the function's existing behavior for cases where these parameters are not used."
