        "content": "To address the reported issue effectively, we need to gather context about the `tripcolor` function, how and where `clim` (color limits) are handled or should be handled within its implementation, and any relevant underlying mechanisms that relate to scaling or normalization of color values (`_scale_norm`). Given the description that mentions a potential fix involves handling `kwargs` just before calling `_scale_norm`, locating the `tripcolor` function and `_scale_norm` method within the Matplotlib codebase is essential.\n\nTherefore, we should execute the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `tripcolor` function to understand its current implementation and the handling of `clim`.\n2. Search for the `_scale_norm` method, as the issue suggests that the handling of `kwargs` should be adjusted in relation to this call.\n3. Since the issue mentions that it is a recurring problem (similar to previously identified issues #21146/#21525), it might be useful to look for any references or modifications to `kwargs` handling within `tripcolor` or related functions/methods.\n\nBased on these considerations, the appropriate API calls would be:\n\n- `search_method(\"tripcolor\")`\n- `search_code(\"_scale_norm\")`"
