This script will attempt to reproduce the issue where `tripcolor` ignores the `clim` parameter. It uses an assertion to check if the color limits (`clim`) of the resulting `tripcolor` plot are correctly set to (0, 0.5). If the assertion fails, indicating that `clim` has been ignored and the actual outcome does not match the expected outcome, the script will print a stack trace of the issue. If the issue is fixed and the `clim` parameter is respected, the script should execute without errors, implying the assertion passed, and it will print "The issue seems to be fixed."
