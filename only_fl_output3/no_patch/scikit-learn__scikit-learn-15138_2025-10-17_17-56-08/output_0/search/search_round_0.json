        "content": "To gather relevant context for the issue described, which involves potentially modifying the behavior of the stacking classifier by introducing an option to train the final estimator using the original dataset along with the predictions of other classifiers, we need to identify the relevant classes and methods within the project. Given the nature of the issue, it is most likely related to a machine learning library or framework where stacking classifiers are implemented, such as scikit-learn or a similar project.\n\nBased on the description, the functionality reminiscent of the `StackingCVClassifier` from `mlxtend` is being requested for a similar class in the project we are working on. The main points of interest would be:\n\n1. **Finding the stacking classifier implementation**: We need to identify the class that implements the stacking classifier logic.\n2. **Class constructor or method for training**: Since the feature request involves adding an option to use the original dataset when training the final estimator, we need to find where the final estimator is trained. This could be in the constructor where parameters are set or a specific method for training.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls would be helpful to get started:\n\n1. **Searching for the stacking classifier**: We don't have the exact class name, but it's likely named something like `StackingClassifier` or `StackingEstimator`. So, we can search for both.\n2. **Exploring the identified class for relevant methods**: Once we have the class, we need to look for methods related to training the final estimator.\n\nLet's start with searching for classes that might match the stacking classifier implementation:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class(\"StackingClassifier\")\nsearch_class(\"StackingEstimator\")\n```"
