        "intended_behavior": "The `tick_params` method should be enhanced to support a new keyword argument `fontfamily`. This argument will allow users to specify the font family for tick labels directly within the `tick_params` call. The method should accept `fontfamily` as part of its `**kwargs`, implement logic to apply the `fontfamily` to tick labels, ensure the addition of `fontfamily` does not disrupt any existing functionality, and update the documentation to include `fontfamily`, specifying its usage."
