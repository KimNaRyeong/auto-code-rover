The results show that this method is found in three distinct locations:\n\n1. **mplot3d/axes3d.py**: Appears twice, suggesting that the method is perhaps used or overridden specifically for 3D plotting capabilities in Matplotlib.\n2. **pyplot.py**: Appears once, which indicates a high-level interface for `tick_params` that might be ultimately calling implementations in other classes or axes objects.\n3. **axes/_base.py**: Appears twice, indicating that this might be the core implementation of `tick_params` for the majority of standard 2D plots, likely providing the base functionality that other axes types extend or utilize.\n\nGiven this context, the relationship between these parts of the code and the bug can be surmised as follows:\n\n- The issue describes a lack of the `fontfamily` parameter within the `tick_params` method, which is a common method used to configure the appearance of ticks in plots.\n- The intended behavior, according to the issue, would be to extend the `tick_params` method to allow for the direct modification of the tick label's font family, enhancing the flexibility and ease of customization for plot aesthetics directly from the `tick_params` call, without needing to globally override the default font or use more complex, less direct methods of setting label properties.\n\nConsidering these insights, to resolve the issue, our focus should likely be on the implementation of `tick_params` in **axes/_base.py**, as modifications here would presumably have the broadest impact, affecting both 2D and potentially 3D plots (although modifications might also be needed in `mplot3d/axes3d.py` to ensure consistency across plot types). The implementation in **pyplot.py** is also of interest, but it likely serves as a fa\u00e7ade to the underlying axes implementations.\n\nTo further understand how `tick_params` is currently implemented and to identify exactly where and how to introduce the `fontfamily` parameter, we need the specific implementation details from these files, starting with the primary implementation likely found in `axes/_base.py`, and checking consistency in other files if necessary. Let's proceed with more targeted searches based on these insights:\n\n1. `search_method_in_file(\"tick_params\", \"lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py\")`: To get the implementation details of `tick_params` in what seems to be its core location.\n2. Given the seeming importance of `axes/_base.py` and potential relevance of `axes3d.py` for 3D plotting, we may need a follow-up step to assess if the 3D implementation needs to be adjusted in light of changes to the 2D base.\n\nThis step-by-step approach will ensure a comprehensive understanding and a careful integration of the new feature without overlooking the nuances between different plot types."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

This location is the primary spot for the enhancement as it likely affects both 2D and 3D plotting by providing a base implementation of `tick_params`. The intended behavior at this location is to modify the `tick_params` method to accept a `fontfamily` keyword argument. This argument should then be used to set the font family for tick labels. All existing functionalities, such as setting the color, size, and visibility of ticks, should be preserved. This modification allows users to specify the font family for tick labels directly via the `tick_params` method, improving the API's usability and flexibility.\n\nConsidering the issue and the analysis of where `tick_params` is used within the Matplotlib codebase, the focus should be on implementing the proposed solution in a way that integrates smoothly with the existing codebase without causing regression in other features. It will also be important to check if similar changes are necessary in `mplot3d/axes3d.py` to maintain consistency between 2D and 3D plots, but without more specific information on the implementation in `axes/_base.py`, it's prudent to focus on this primary location first."
