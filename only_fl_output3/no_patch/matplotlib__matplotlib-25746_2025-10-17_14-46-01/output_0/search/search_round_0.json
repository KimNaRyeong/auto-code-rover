Here are the search API calls that would be helpful:\n\n1. `search_method(\"tick_params\")`: This will help locate all instances of the `tick_params` method across the entire codebase, determining which class or file it belongs to. \n\n2. Once we know the class(es) or file(s) where `tick_params` is defined, we can use:\n   - `search_class_in_file(class_name, file_name)`: If we found the method is in a specific class, to search for the class definition within a specific file.\n   - Or, `search_method_in_file(\"tick_params\", file_path)`: To find the specific implementation of `tick_params` in the file we identified. \n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive understanding of where and how `tick_params` is implemented, allowing us to accurately determine where the proposed `fontfamily` parameter should be integrated into the code."
