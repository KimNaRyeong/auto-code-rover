        "intended_behavior": "The `annotate` method should accurately integrate all annotations, including those with subqueries, into the SQL query in such a manner that they are correctly represented in the `GROUP BY` clause when necessary. To resolve the issue, it might require ensuring that the handling of group by clauses with subqueries is consistent across different versions, specifically between 2.2.9 and 3.0.2, to prevent the omission of necessary annotations. This might involve a conditional check or an enhancement in the way annotations are processed and added to the group by section, particularly ensuring complex annotations with subqueries are included without causing duplicate results."

        "intended_behavior": "Without specific method bodies, it's difficult to pinpoint exact changes. However, the intended behavior across these files for any `get_group_by_cols` method involved in this issue would be to ensure that when compiling the group by section of the SQL query, all columns associated with annotated subqueries are considered and included. This involves examining the changes in these methods between Django 2.2.9 and 3.0.2 to identify any alterations that may have led to the regression, thereby ensuring that the ability to handle annotations, and particularly subqueries within those annotations, does not diverge between versions in a way that adversely affects query results."
