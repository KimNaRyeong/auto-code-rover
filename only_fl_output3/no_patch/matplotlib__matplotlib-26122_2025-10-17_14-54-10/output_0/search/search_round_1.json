In that case, the default of `aspect=None` should just mean \"don't modify the aspect\".\n[1] Really, this should be \"something that does not contains transData as a branch\", as in #13642.\nThe current behavior is the reason why #14057 and #14117 need to explicitly set the aspect to \"auto\" in or after the last imshow() call (otherwise, some head-scratching occurs).\nOn the other hand, making this change would once again lead to some seriously non-obvious interaction between parameters (the meaning of `aspect=None` depends on the value of `transform`), which I'm not sure is great either :/\n**Matplotlib version**\n* Operating system: linux\n* Matplotlib version: master/any\n* Matplotlib backend (`print(matplotlib.get_backend())`): qt5agg\n* Python version: 37\n</issue>"

Let's focus on finding the `imshow()` method, any related method that sets the aspect ratio, and how the transform parameter is handled within the `imshow()` context. We will break down the inquiry into specific API calls to gather this context:\n\n1. **Find the `imshow()` method**: Since `imshow()` is a key function in Matplotlib that displays data as an image, it's likely part of a class that deals with axes or images. Let's attempt to find where this method is defined.\n\n2. **Investigate how `aspect` and `transform` are managed**: The issue indicates that the handling of the `aspect` parameter in relation to `transform` may not be behaving as expected when `transform` does not equal `ax.transData`. Identifying code that checks these parameters or sets the aspect ratio in the context of `imshow()` could help.\n\nTherefore, we will start with the following API calls:\n- search_method(\"imshow\")\n- search_code(\"aspect=None\")\n- search_code(\"transform != ax.transData\")\n\nThese calls are designed to help locate the `imshow()` method, understand the default handling of the `aspect` parameter, and how the `transform` parameter's condition is managed."

This parameter is particularly\n5572             relevant for images since it determines whether data pixels are\n5573             square.\n5574 \n5575             This parameter is a shortcut for explicitly calling\n5576             `.Axes.set_aspect`. See there for further details.\n5577 \n5578             - 'equal': Ensures an aspect ratio of 1.

Note that different ps,\n5600             pdf, and svg viewers may display these raw pixels differently. On\n5601             other backends, 'none' is the same as 'nearest'.\n5602 \n5603             If *interpolation* is the default 'antialiased', then 'nearest'\n5604             interpolation is used if the image is upsampled by more than a\n5605             factor of three (i.e. the number of display pixels is at least\n5606             three times the size of the data array).  If the upsampling rate is\n5607             smaller than 3, or the image is downsampled, then 'hanning'\n5608             interpolation is used to act as an anti-aliasing filter, unless the\n5609             image happens to be upsampled by exactly a factor of two or one.\n5610 \n5611             See\n5612             :doc:`/gallery/images_contours_and_fields/interpolation_methods`\n5613             for an overview of the supported interpolation methods, and\n5614             :doc:`/gallery/images_contours_and_fields/image_antialiasing` for\n5615             a discussion of image antialiasing.\n5616 \n5617             Some interpolation methods require an additional radius parameter,\n5618             which can be set by *filterrad*. Additionally, the antigrain image\n5619             resize filter is controlled by the parameter *filternorm*.\n5620 \n5621         interpolation_stage : {'data', 'rgba'}, default: 'data'\n5622             If 'data', interpolation\n5623             is carried out on the data provided by the user.  If 'rgba', the\n5624             interpolation is carried out after the colormapping has been\n5625             applied (visual interpolation).\n5626 \n5627         alpha : float or array-like, optional\n5628             The alpha blending value, between 0 (transparent) and 1 (opaque).\n5629             If *alpha* is an array, the alpha blending values are applied pixel\n5630             by pixel, and *alpha* must have the same shape as *X*.\n5631 \n5632         origin : {'upper', 'lower'}, default: :rc:`image.origin`\n5633             Place the [0, 0] index of the array in the upper left or lower\n5634             left corner of the Axes.

Their centers are on\n5650             integer coordinates, and their center coordinates range from 0 to\n5651             columns-1 horizontally and from 0 to rows-1 vertically.\n5652 \n5653             Note that the direction of the vertical axis and thus the default\n5654             values for top and bottom depend on *origin*:\n5655 \n5656             - For ``origin == 'upper'`` the default is\n5657               ``(-0.5, numcols-0.5, numrows-0.5, -0.5)``.\n5658             - For ``origin == 'lower'`` the default is\n5659               ``(-0.5, numcols-0.5, -0.5, numrows-0.5)``.\n5660 \n5661             See the :ref:`imshow_extent` tutorial for\n5662             examples and a more detailed description.\n5663 \n5664         filternorm : bool, default: True\n5665             A parameter for the antigrain image resize filter (see the\n5666             antigrain documentation).  If *filternorm* is set, the filter\n5667             normalizes integer values and corrects the rounding errors. It\n5668             doesn't do anything with the source floating point values, it\n5669             corrects only integers according to the rule of 1.0 which means\n5670             that any sum of pixel weights must be equal to 1.0.  So, the\n5671             filter function must produce a graph of the proper shape.\n5672 \n5673         filterrad : float > 0, default: 4.0\n5674             The filter radius for filters that have a radius parameter, i.e.\n5675             when interpolation is one of: 'sinc', 'lanczos' or 'blackman'.\n5676 \n5677         resample : bool, default: :rc:`image.resample`\n5678             When *True*, use a full resampling method.

Supported array shapes are:\n5545 \n5546             - (M, N): an image with scalar data. The values are mapped to\n5547               colors using normalization and a colormap. See parameters *norm*,\n5548               *cmap*, *vmin*, *vmax*.\n5549             - (M, N, 3): an image with RGB values (0-1 float or 0-255 int).\n5550             - (M, N, 4): an image with RGBA values (0-1 float or 0-255 int),\n5551               i.e. including transparency.\n5552 \n5553             The first two dimensions (M, N) define the rows and columns of\n5554             the image.\n5555 \n5556             Out-of-range RGB(A) values are clipped.\n5557 \n5558         %(cmap_doc)s\n5559 \n5560             This parameter is ignored if *X* is RGB(A).\n5561 \n5562         %(norm_doc)s\n5563 \n5564             This parameter is ignored if *X* is RGB(A).\n5565 \n5566         %(vmin_vmax_doc)s\n5567 \n5568             This parameter is ignored if *X* is RGB(A).\n5569 \n5570         aspect : {'equal', 'auto'} or float, default: :rc:`image.aspect`\n5571             The aspect ratio of the Axes.  This parameter is particularly\n5572             relevant for images since it determines whether data pixels are\n5573             square.\n5574 \n5575             This parameter is a shortcut for explicitly calling\n5576             `.Axes.set_aspect`. See there for further details.\n5577 \n5578             - 'equal': Ensures an aspect ratio of 1. Pixels will be square\n5579               (unless pixel sizes are explicitly made non-square in data\n5580               coordinates using *extent*).\n5581             - 'auto': The Axes is kept fixed and the aspect is adjusted so\n5582               that the data fit in the Axes. In general, this will result in\n5583               non-square pixels.\n5584 \n5585         interpolation : str, default: :rc:`image.interpolation`\n5586             The interpolation method used.\n5587 \n5588             Supported values are 'none', 'antialiased', 'nearest', 'bilinear',\n5589             'bicubic', 'spline16', 'spline36', 'hanning', 'hamming', 'hermite',\n5590             'kaiser', 'quadric', 'catrom', 'gaussian', 'bessel', 'mitchell',\n5591             'sinc', 'lanczos', 'blackman'.\n5592 \n5593             The data *X* is resampled to the pixel size of the image on the\n5594             figure canvas, using the interpolation method to either up- or\n5595             downsample the data.\n5596 \n5597             If *interpolation* is 'none', then for the ps, pdf, and svg\n5598             backends no down- or upsampling occurs, and the image data is\n5599             passed to the backend as a native image.  Note that different ps,\n5600             pdf, and svg viewers may display these raw pixels differently. On\n5601             other backends, 'none' is the same as 'nearest'.\n5602 \n5603             If *interpolation* is the default 'antialiased', then 'nearest'\n5604             interpolation is used if the image is upsampled by more than a\n5605             factor of three (i.e. the number of display pixels is at least\n5606             three times the size of the data array).  If the upsampling rate is\n5607             smaller than 3, or the image is downsampled, then 'hanning'\n5608             interpolation is used to act as an anti-aliasing filter, unless the\n5609             image happens to be upsampled by exactly a factor of two or one.\n5610 \n5611             See\n5612             :doc:`/gallery/images_contours_and_fields/interpolation_methods`\n5613             for an overview of the supported interpolation methods, and\n5614             :doc:`/gallery/images_contours_and_fields/image_antialiasing` for\n5615             a discussion of image antialiasing.\n5616 \n5617             Some interpolation methods require an additional radius parameter,\n5618             which can be set by *filterrad*. Additionally, the antigrain image\n5619             resize filter is controlled by the parameter *filternorm*.\n5620 \n5621         interpolation_stage : {'data', 'rgba'}, default: 'data'\n5622             If 'data', interpolation\n5623             is carried out on the data provided by the user.  If 'rgba', the\n5624             interpolation is carried out after the colormapping has been\n5625             applied (visual interpolation).\n5626 \n5627         alpha : float or array-like, optional\n5628             The alpha blending value, between 0 (transparent) and 1 (opaque).\n5629             If *alpha* is an array, the alpha blending values are applied pixel\n5630             by pixel, and *alpha* must have the same shape as *X*.\n5631 \n5632         origin : {'upper', 'lower'}, default: :rc:`image.origin`\n5633             Place the [0, 0] index of the array in the upper left or lower\n5634             left corner of the Axes. The convention (the default) 'upper' is\n5635             typically used for matrices and images.\n5636 \n5637             Note that the vertical axis points upward for 'lower'\n5638             but downward for 'upper'.\n5639 \n5640             See the :ref:`imshow_extent` tutorial for\n5641             examples and a more detailed description.\n5642 \n5643         extent : floats (left, right, bottom, top), optional\n5644             The bounding box in data coordinates that the image will fill.\n5645             These values may be unitful and match the units of the Axes.\n5646             The image is stretched individually along x and y to fill the box.\n5647 \n5648             The default extent is determined by the following conditions.\n5649             Pixels have unit size in data coordinates. Their centers are on\n5650             integer coordinates, and their center coordinates range from 0 to\n5651             columns-1 horizontally and from 0 to rows-1 vertically.\n5652 \n5653             Note that the direction of the vertical axis and thus the default\n5654             values for top and bottom depend on *origin*:\n5655 \n5656             - For ``origin == 'upper'`` the default is\n5657               ``(-0.5, numcols-0.5, numrows-0.5, -0.5)``.\n5658             - For ``origin == 'lower'`` the default is\n5659               ``(-0.5, numcols-0.5, -0.5, numrows-0.5)``.\n5660 \n5661             See the :ref:`imshow_extent` tutorial for\n5662             examples and a more detailed description.\n5663 \n5664         filternorm : bool, default: True\n5665             A parameter for the antigrain image resize filter (see the\n5666             antigrain documentation).  If *filternorm* is set, the filter\n5667             normalizes integer values and corrects the rounding errors. It\n5668             doesn't do anything with the source floating point values, it\n5669             corrects only integers according to the rule of 1.0 which means\n5670             that any sum of pixel weights must be equal to 1.0.  So, the\n5671             filter function must produce a graph of the proper shape.\n5672 \n5673         filterrad : float > 0, default: 4.0\n5674             The filter radius for filters that have a radius parameter, i.e.\n5675             when interpolation is one of: 'sinc', 'lanczos' or 'blackman'.\n5676 \n5677         resample : bool, default: :rc:`image.resample`\n5678             When *True*, use a full resampling method.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context focuses on the behavior of the `imshow()` function, especially regarding how it handles the `aspect` parameter and its interaction with the `transform` parameter, as indicated in the issue description.\n\n### Analysis of `imshow()` Function\n\nThe `imshow()` function is found in two places, `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py` and `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`. The implementation in `pyplot.py` essentially forwards arguments to the `imshow()` method of the current axes, obtained via `gca()`. Thus, the real logic of interest lives within `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`.\n\n1. **Behavior**: The `imshow()` function in `_axes.py` is responsible for displaying data as an image on a 2D regular raster. It accepts an array-like or PIL image as input and provides several customization parameters, including `aspect`, `interpolation`, `alpha`, etc.\n\n2. **Aspect Parameter Handling**: The aspect handling logic is embedded directly within the `imshow()` method. If `aspect` is `None`, the method sets the aspect to default `mpl.rcParams['image.aspect']` and then calling `self.set_aspect(aspect)`. This aspect controls whether pixels in the image data are square (`'equal'`) or adjusted such that the image fits into the axes (`'auto'`), among other behaviors.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior w.r.t Issue**: Given the issue description, the intended behavior would be that if a `transform` keyword is provided and set to something other than `ax.transData`, the default handling of `aspect=None` should effectively be ignored or bypassed since the aspect ration adjustment becomes irrelevant with a non-default `transform`.\n\n### Relationship with the Bug\n\nThe direct connection lies in how the default behavior of the `aspect` parameter is determined and applied within `imshow()`. According to the issue, if a user sets the `transform` kwarg to something other than the default (`ax.transData`), modifying the axes aspect based on the default `aspect=None` (which defaults to `rcParams[\"image.aspect\"]`, usually \"equal\") behavior is undesired. This is because, with a custom `transform`, the assumption that square pixels (or any specific aspect ratio) will maintain a meaningful relationship to the axes' scale is incorrect.\n\n### Obtaining More Context\n\nThe query for `transform != ax.transData` returned no results, which indicates we lack direct code references to how the `transform` parameter specifically interacts with the aspect setting within `imshow()`. A more nuanced understanding of how `imshow()` process or ignore the `transform` parameter when setting the aspect ratio is needed.\n\nA potential next step could be inspecting the `set_aspect()` method within the same file (`lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py`) or searching how transforms are generally handled in the context of the `Axes` or `AxesImage` class to understand better where and how the decision regarding the `aspect` parameter's application is made in the context of the value of `transform`.\n\n**Proposed Next API Call**:\n- search_method_in_class(\"set_aspect\", \"Axes\")\n- search_class(\"AxesImage\")"

Specifically, when a `transform` that does not include `ax.transData` as one of its components is provided, the default behavior of setting the aspect to `\"equal\"` should be overridden. Instead, it should either leave the aspect ratio unmodified or use a different default that aligns with the behavior expected when not drawing in data coordinates. This preserves the existing functionality (maintaining backward compatibility for calls to `imshow` without a custom `transform`) while addressing the unintended aspect ratio changes when using a custom `transform`.\n\nThis modification aims to ensure that `imshow`'s handling of the aspect ratio remains intuitive and consistent, even when users opt to draw images using custom transforms that do not map directly onto the data coordinates (`ax.transData`). Implementing this behavior requires adding logic to `imshow` that:\n- Identifies when a custom `transform` is applied.\n- Adjusts the handling of the `aspect` parameter to respect the custom `transform`'s implications on the image rendering, ensuring that the `aspect` setting does not counterintuitively alter the appearance of the image in contexts where it should logically be disregarded."
