In that case, the default of `aspect=None` should just mean \"don't modify the aspect\".\n[1] Really, this should be \"something that does not contains transData as a branch\", as in #13642.\nThe current behavior is the reason why #14057 and #14117 need to explicitly set the aspect to \"auto\" in or after the last imshow() call (otherwise, some head-scratching occurs).\nOn the other hand, making this change would once again lead to some seriously non-obvious interaction between parameters (the meaning of `aspect=None` depends on the value of `transform`), which I'm not sure is great either :/\n**Matplotlib version**\n* Operating system: linux\n* Matplotlib version: master/any\n* Matplotlib backend (`print(matplotlib.get_backend())`): qt5agg\n* Python version: 37\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need more context around how `imshow()` functions, especially in relation to the `aspect` and `transform` parameters. Let's focus on finding the `imshow()` method, any related method that sets the aspect ratio, and how the transform parameter is handled within the `imshow()` context. We will break down the inquiry into specific API calls to gather this context:\n\n1. **Find the `imshow()` method**: Since `imshow()` is a key function in Matplotlib that displays data as an image, it's likely part of a class that deals with axes or images. Let's attempt to find where this method is defined.\n\n2. **Investigate how `aspect` and `transform` are managed**: The issue indicates that the handling of the `aspect` parameter in relation to `transform` may not be behaving as expected when `transform` does not equal `ax.transData`. Identifying code that checks these parameters or sets the aspect ratio in the context of `imshow()` could help.\n\nTherefore, we will start with the following API calls:\n- search_method(\"imshow\")\n- search_code(\"aspect=None\")\n- search_code(\"transform != ax.transData\")\n\nThese calls are designed to help locate the `imshow()` method, understand the default handling of the `aspect` parameter, and how the `transform` parameter's condition is managed."
