        "intended_behavior": "The `imshow` method should check if a custom `transform` is provided and, if so, bypass or modify the automatic setting of the aspect ratio based on `aspect=None` defaulting to `rcParams[\"image.aspect\"]`. Specifically, when a `transform` that does not include `ax.transData` as one of its components is provided, the default behavior of setting the aspect to `\"equal\"` should be overridden. Instead, it should either leave the aspect ratio unmodified or use a different default that aligns with the behavior expected when not drawing in data coordinates. This preserves the existing functionality (maintaining backward compatibility for calls to `imshow` without a custom `transform`) while addressing the unintended aspect ratio changes when using a custom `transform`."
