It appears there was a misunderstanding about the issue you're facing, which seems related to the scikit-learn installation rather than the specific `ColumnTransformer` behavior with negative indices. However, focusing back on the original request to create a script that reproduces the outlined issue and adhering to the guidelines you provided, here's how you could design the `reproducer.py` file:

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    X = np.random.randn(2, 2)
    X_categories = np.array([[1], [2]])
    X = np.concatenate([X, X_categories], axis=1)
    
    ohe = OneHotEncoder(categories='auto')
    
    try:
        # Test with negative index
        tf_1 = ColumnTransformer([('ohe', ohe, [-1])], remainder='passthrough')
        result_1 = tf_1.fit_transform(X)
        
        # Test with positive index
        tf_2 = ColumnTransformer([('ohe', ohe, [2])], remainder='passthrough')
        result_2 = tf_2.fit_transform(X)
        
        # Assertion to verify if issue exists
        assert result_1.shape == result_2.shape, "Results do not match"
        np.testing.assert_array_almost_equal(result_1, result_2, decimal=6)
        print("No issue found: Negative indices work as expected.")
        
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script tests the behavior of `ColumnTransformer` with both positive and negative indices and compares the results. An `AssertionError` will be raised if there's a discrepancy in the results, indicating the presence of the issue. If the behavior is consistent and no error is raised, it will print out a message saying no issue was found.

- This script is designed based on the assumption that the issue lies in whether `ColumnTransformer` handles negative column indices similarly to positive ones, as described.
- Adjustments have been made to ensure the function `print_stacktrace` is correctly utilized to provide detailed traceback information should an exception occur, helping in diagnosing the problem.
- If the scikit-learn installation error persists, ensure scikit-learn is correctly installed in your environment. The error message suggests a problem with the scikit-learn build rather than with the script itself.
