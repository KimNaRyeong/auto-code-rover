        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `_iter` method to ensure that negative column indices are correctly interpreted as indexing from the end of the array, akin to Python's negative indexing for lists. This will require adjusting the logic within `_iter` to check for negative indices and convert them to their positive counterparts based on the total number of columns in the input data before proceeding with the transformation. The adjustment should be made prior to the processing steps that apply transformers based on column indices. This change will ensure that users can reliably use both positive and negative indices to reference columns, with negative indices counted backward from the last column, thereby preserving expected Pythonic behavior and ensuring consistency regardless of whether positive or negative indices are used."
