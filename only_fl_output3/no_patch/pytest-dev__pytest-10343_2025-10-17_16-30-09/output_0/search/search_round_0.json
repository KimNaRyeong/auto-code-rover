        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, we need to look into how the deprecation warning is triggered and identify if there's a way to enhance the warning message with location information (e.g., plugin name or file path). The issue revolves around the use of old-style `hookimpl` implementations in plugins and how the warning is generated when such an implementation is detected. Given this information, here are the API calls that would help in understanding the mechanism of deprecation warning generation and pinpointing plugin locations:\n\n1. Search for the method where `PytestDeprecationWarning` related to `hookimpl` is possibly generated or logged:\n   - `search_code(\"PytestDeprecationWarning: The hookimpl pytest_configure\")`\n\n2. Since the deprecation warning concerns the use of \"old-style configuration options\" by a `pytest_configure` hook, we should also check how and where `pytest_configure` hooks are registered and processed:\n   - `search_method(\"pytest_configure\")`\n\n3. Additionally, to understand how plugins are loaded and how hooks are registered, which might give clues on where to inject the file or plugin source information, let's locate relevant core implementation details:\n   - `search_method(\"pluginmanager\")`\n   - `search_method(\"register\")`\n   - `search_method(\"add_hookspecs\")`\n\n4. Any references to handling or decorating `hookimpl` to propose the transition to the new style (with `@pytest.hookimpl(trylast=True)`):\n   - `search_code(\"hookimpl\")`\n\nThese searches aim to collect a broad context about hook implementation registration, deprecation warnings, and plugin management within the pytest framework. The gathered information will assist in identifying where and how to enhance the warning message to include location information."
