Given the previous execution issues, let's ensure a more succinct and self-contained example while still including the necessary code to attempt reproducing the described issue using SQLite instead of MySQL to avoid the dependency problem. Since the issue is reported to specifically occur with MySQL, using SQLite might not exactly reproduce the initial problem but should give an idea if the Django ORM handling of aggregates and annotations is misbehaving in a similar way across different databases.

Please replace the database configuration with your MySQL settings if you want to test it specifically with MySQL.

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models, migrations, OperationalError
from django.db.models import F, Max, Sum

# Define temporary settings for Django. Normally, you would have these in a settings.py file.
settings.configure(
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=[
        '__main__',  # This script will act as a standalone app.
    ],
    USE_TZ=True,
)

django.setup()

# Define a simple model for demonstration.
class T(models.Model):
    foo = models.IntegerField()

# The setup function will handle migrations necessary for the Django app.
def setup():
    migration = migrations.Migration('initial', '__main__')
    migration.operations = [
        migrations.CreateModel(
            name='T',
            fields=[
                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),
                ('foo', models.IntegerField()),
            ],
        ),
    ]
    migrator = migrations.MigrationExecutor(connection=django.db.connection)
    migrator.apply_migration(migrator.loader.project_state(), migration)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback, sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    setup()

    # Simulate the inconsistent behavior with annotated fields in aggregate queries.
    try:
        result = T.objects.annotate(anon=F('foo')).aggregate(foo=Max('anon'), sum=Sum('foo'))
        print("Aggregate result:", result)
    except OperationalError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

    # If the code gets here without exceptions, the expected issue didn't occur.
    assert False, "No error occurred, indicating the issue might not be present or reproducible with SQLite."

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This script configures a minimal Django environment with a single model and performs an aggregation query that could reveal issues similar to what was described in the given issue, albeit targeting SQLite for simplicity. Replace `'django.db.backends.sqlite3'` and its settings under `DATABASES` in `configure` with settings for `'django.db.backends.mysql'` and the respective MySQL connection details to fully replicate the environment you're investigating. Remember, for MySQL, appropriate Python packages such as `mysqlclient` must be installed and properly configured.
