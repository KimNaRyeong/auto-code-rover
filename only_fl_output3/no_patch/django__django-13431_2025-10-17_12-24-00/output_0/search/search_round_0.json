        "content": "To efficiently gather context and dive deeper into the issue described, I'll perform the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `QuerySet` class where `aggregate` method might be defined or overridden, as the issue clearly involves how aggregate queries are constructed:\n   - `search_class(\"QuerySet\")`\n\n2. Since the problem involves the `aggregate` method (and potentially how annotations are handled), we will need to find the implementation of both `aggregate` and `annotate` methods in the `QuerySet` class:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"aggregate\", \"QuerySet\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"annotate\", \"QuerySet\")`\n\n3. Given the reported SQL generation issue, it might be beneficial to look into how Django constructs the SQL from the QuerySet. This generally involves the query compiler, so let's search for `SQLCompiler` or any related compiler classes to understand how annotations and aggregates are processed into SQL statements:\n   - `search_class(\"SQLCompiler\")`\n\n4. If specifics on how fields are named and referenced in the SQL query generation process are needed, finding code that specifically handles naming or aliasing might prove useful. Thus, let's search for code related to field aliasing within SQL compilation:\n   - `search_code(\"field alias\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide enough context to identify where the bug might reside and how the current implementation handles aggregate queries involving annotations, which is crucial for addressing the issue reported."
