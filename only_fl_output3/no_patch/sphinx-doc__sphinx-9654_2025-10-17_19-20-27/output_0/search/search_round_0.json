When I document class D, it lists the base class as A instead of C.\n### How to Reproduce\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo.git\n$ cd torchgeo/docs\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n$ make html\n$ # open _build/html/api/datasets.html and see that the base class is torch.utils.data.Dataset instead of RasterDataset\n```\n### Expected behavior\nI would expect the base class to be the direct super class.\n### Your project\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nmacOS 10.15.7, Linux (whatever RtD uses)\n### Python version\n3.8.11\n### Sphinx version\n4.0.1, 4.0.2\n### Sphinx extensions\nsphinx.ext.autodoc\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\nI don't think this is the same as #9504 because I can reproduce it with 4.0.1 too.\nCould be related to #9395.\nFor a class like [Landsat](https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo/blob/main/torchgeo/datasets/landsat.py#L14), even though the super class is `RasterDataset`, the base class is listed as `torch.utils.data.Dataset`.\n@calebrob6\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to investigate how Sphinx is determining the base class for documentation and what might cause it to list a different class than expected in the `torchgeo` project. Specifically, we're concerned with how the documentation for class `D` (in the user's example) is incorrectly identifying its base class. Translating this to the actual problem, we'll focus on classes like `Landsat` which is reported to incorrectly show its base class as `torch.utils.data.Dataset` instead of `RasterDataset`. First, we need to examine the declaration of the `Landsat` class and its superclasses. Then, we should look into how Sphinx determines the base class during documentation generation.\n\nHere are the steps we'll take using the search APIs:\n\n1. **Search for the Landsat class to find where it's declared**: This will help us confirm the file it's located in and its immediate superclass.\n   \n2. **Search for the RasterDataset class**: Since `RasterDataset` is supposed to be the direct superclass of `Landsat`, we need to understand its declaration and inheritance.\n\n3. **Search for the `torch.utils.data.Dataset` class reference within the project**: While `torch.utils.data.Dataset` isn't likely to be directly modified within the `torchgeo` project, there might be references or subclassing patterns in `torchgeo` that could give us clues to the issue.\n\n4. **Investigate how Sphinx extension `sphinx.ext.autodoc` determines the base class**: This might not be directly searchable with code, but understanding where and how `autodoc` is configured in the project could provide insights into potential configuration issues leading to the problem.\n\nTo start, I'll execute the first two search API calls to understand the class hierarchy within the `torchgeo` project related to `Landsat` and `RasterDataset`.\n\n- `search_class(\"Landsat\")`\n- `search_class(\"RasterDataset\")`"
