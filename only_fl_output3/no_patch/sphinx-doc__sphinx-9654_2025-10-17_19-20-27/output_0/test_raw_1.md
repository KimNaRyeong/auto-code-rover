Given the context of reproducing a documentation-related issue specifically with Sphinx, you might not be able to directly catch and assert this behavior purely from a standalone Python script without involving Sphinx's environment directly. Sphinx processes docstrings and generates documentation outside the regular Python execution flow. Hence, an "incorrect base class detection" issue is more directly related to how Sphinx and possibly its extensions interpret and render docstrings to HTML or other formats. 

However, assuming you want to simulate or prepare a scenario where you could programmatically check the Sphinx-generated documentation for a particular class's base class documentation, you'd typically need a way to parse the generated HTML files or Sphinx's internal representation after it has processed the docstrings. This isn't straightforward to achieve with simple assertion checks without employing additional parsing or analysis tools.

The initial test script you attempted to run faced issues because it tried to directly use Sphinx's internals to regenerate the documentation, which failed due to a missing module (`docutils`). While fixing the module dependency might help progress, it doesn't change the nature of how to effectively check the generated documentation content.

Given these constraints, a more fitting approach would involve generating the documentation as previously described (outside the script), then using the script to parse the generated HTML files looking for inconsistencies related to class documentation. Note that this approach requires the documentation to have been generated beforehand and doesn't directly integrate with Sphinx's process. Here's a pseudo-code outline for such an approach, noting that specific implementation details would depend on the structure of the generated HTML:

```python
import bs4  # BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML
import os

def verify_base_class_in_doc(html_file, expected_base_class):
    with open(html_file, 'r') as f:
        soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup(f.read(), 'html.parser')
    
    # This is purely illustrative; actual logic heavily depends on the HTML structure
    # You would need to adjust the selectors according to your generated HTML's structure
    base_class_element = soup.find("some_selector_identifying_the_base_class")
    actual_base_class = base_class_element.text.strip()

    assert actual_base_class == expected_base_class, f"Expected '{expected_base_class}', found '{actual_base_class}'"

def main():
    try:
        html_file_path = 'path/to/generated/html/for/class/D.html'
        if not os.path.isfile(html_file_path):
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"HTML documentation file '{html_file_path}' not found.")
        
        verify_base_class_in_doc(html_file_path, 'C')
        print("Verification successful. Correct base class detected.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Remember to replace `'some_selector_identifying_the_base_class'` with the actual HTML element or identifier used to denote the base class in your documentation, and adjust `html_file_path` to the actual path of the generated documentation for class `D`. This script assumes familiarity with HTML parsing and requires BeautifulSoup (`bs4`) for HTML parsing. The main challenge with this approach lies in accurately identifying the correct elements in the HTML structure, which can vary based on your Sphinx theme and specific documentation structure.
