        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `__init__` method of the `CharField` class to conditionally append a `MaxLengthValidator` only if `self.max_length` is not `None`. This approach ensures that a `MaxLengthValidator` is only added when a meaningful comparison can be made, avoiding the `TypeError` caused by comparing `None` with an integer. This change preserves the existing functionality by still enforcing `max_length` validation when applicable, but prevents the invalid scenario that leads to a runtime error."
