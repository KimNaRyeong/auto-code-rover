This script checks for the presence of the issue described and behaves according to the outlined requirements:

- It will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is detected, printing a stack trace of the error.
- If no issue is found (i.e., the `AssertionError` is not raised), it prints "No issue detected." and exits with code 0.

Note: To run this script correctly, Django needs to be installed and configured properly, including setting up a project environment where the `Value` function and the ORM can be used. The behavior concerning the AssertionError and the exit codes follows the task's instructions but departs from typical error handling practices (usually, scripts exit with a non-zero code upon encountering an error).
