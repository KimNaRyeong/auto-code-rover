Given your request and the context provided, to accurately demonstrate the issue and ensure the script reflects both the current problem and the criteria for resolution, we will use the given stack trace printing function. This script is designed to replicate the behavior described—the creation of a `CharField` without a `max_length` through the use of `Value`—and verify whether it results in an erroneous `MaxLengthValidator`. Then, it will appropriately handle the situation based on whether the issue is present or resolved.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    from django.db.models import Value, fields

    try:
        # Create a CharField through Value() to mimic the issue's scenario.
        x = Value('test')
        y = x._resolve_output_field()
        assert isinstance(y, fields.CharField), "Resolved field is not a CharField."
        
        # Check y's validators to confirm the issue
        has_max_length_validator = any(
            isinstance(validator, fields.validators.MaxLengthValidator) for validator in y.validators
        )

        if has_max_length_validator:
            # If the issue is present, raise an error to be caught below.
            raise AssertionError("MaxLengthValidator applied incorrectly to CharField with no max_length.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Exit with code 0 to indicate the issue was successfully reproduced.
        sys.exit(0)

    # If the script reaches this point, it means the issue was not reproduced.
    print("Issue not present or has been fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    reproduce_issue()
```

This script aims to:
- Initialize a `CharField` through `Value('test')._resolve_output_field()` as described.
- Check for the presence of a `MaxLengthValidator` in an inappropriate context (`max_length=None`).
- Utilize the provided `print_stacktrace` function to detail the issue's occurrence if it's detected.
- Ensure the script exits with code 0, indicating the issue was successfully reproduced or is no longer present.

Before running the script, make sure your Django settings are configured correctly, particularly for standalone scripts that interact with model fields.
