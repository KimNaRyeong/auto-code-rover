So in theory it shouldn't be pickling the QuerySet.\nHowever, the QuerySet is still stored on the instance within the _constructor_args attribute added by the @deconstructible decorator on the BaseExpression base class. So when the inner query object gets pickled, so does the QuerySet, which attempts to evaluate it. In this case, it gets the error \"ValueError: This queryset contains a reference to an outer query and may only be used in a subquery.\" since the inner queryset is being evaluated independently when called from pickle: it calls QuerySet.__getstate__().\nI'm not sure what the best solution is here. I made a patch that adds the following override to __getstate__ to the SubQuery class, which fixes the problem and passes all other Django tests on my machine. I'll submit a PR shortly, but welcome any better approaches since I'm not sure what else that may effect.\nclass Subquery(Expression):\n...\ndef __getstate__(self):\nobj_dict = super().__getstate__()\nobj_dict.pop('_constructor_args', None)\nreturn obj_dict\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results provides us with insights into how to address the reported issue about pickling a `QuerySet` with a `Subquery` without evaluating the `QuerySet`.\n\n### Subquery Class Analysis\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \n  The `Subquery` class, found in `django/db/models/expressions.py`, represents a SQL subquery. It is a subclass of `Expression` and is used to encapsulate a subquery inside an annotation, among other uses.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug:**  \n  The issue description specifically refers to the `Subquery` class and suggests adding a `__getstate__` method to it to prevent the evaluation of the `QuerySet` when the subquery is pickled. Currently, the `Subquery` class does not override `__getstate__`, which means it inherits the method from its superclass chain, possibly leading to unintended queryset evaluation during pickling.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**  \n  The intended behavior for the `Subquery` class is to allow pickling without triggering `QuerySet` evaluation. Considering the issue's description, this involves overriding `__getstate__` to modify the serialization process, ensuring that the query does not get evaluated when the `Subquery` instance is pickled.\n\n### BaseExpression Class Analysis\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \n  The `BaseExpression` class, also in `django/db/models/expressions.py`, is a foundational class for building complex database expressions. It includes several methods that expressions, including `Subquery`, might use or override.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug:**  \n  The issue highlights that the `BaseExpression` class's use of the `@deconstructible` decorator adds `_constructor_args` to its instances, which inadvertently causes querysets to be evaluated upon pickling due to the serialization of `_constructor_args`.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**  \n  While `BaseExpression` itself doesn't directly cause the bug, its implementation affects how subclass instances like `Subquery` handle serialization. Ideally, serialization should not evaluate querysets used in `Subquery`. Modifying the `__getstate__` method in `Subquery` would likely aim to address issues arising from `BaseExpression`'s behavior indirectly.\n\n### QuerySet __getstate__ Method Analysis\n- **What does this part of the code do?**  \n  Within `django/db/models/query.py`, the `QuerySet` class's `__getstate__` method is designed to fully populate the cache before pickling, essentially evaluating the queryset to fetch all results.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug:**  \n  The bug occurs because, during the pickling process, the serialization (invoking `__getstate__`) of a `QuerySet` ends up evaluating the queryset. For a `QuerySet` containing a reference to an outer query (like in a `Subquery`), this evaluation is inappropriate and causes the observed issue.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**  \n  The goal for addressing the bug is to enable the `QuerySet` used in a `Subquery` to be pickled without being evaluated, contrary to the current implementation of `__getstate__` in `QuerySet`. This requires ensuring that pickling a `Subquery` does not trigger the `QuerySet`'s `__getstate__` method in a way that leads to premature evaluation.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\nGiven the issue and the collected context:\n- A tailored override of `__getstate__` in the `Subquery` class could prevent the inclusion of attributes that lead to queryset evaluation during pickling.\n- This approach would specifically prevent the `_constructor_args` (implicated by the use of `BaseExpression`) from causing problems during serialization.\n- Such a change respects the desired outcome of allowing `Subquery` instances to be safely pickled without query evaluation, directly addressing the problem described in the issue."

This method should call the superclass's `__getstate__` method to get the default state dictionary, then modify this dictionary by removing the `_constructor_args` key if it exists. This change ensures that during the pickling process, the queryset passed into `Subquery` does not get inadvertently evaluated, thus preventing the \"ValueError: This queryset contains a reference to an outer query and may only be used in a subquery.\" error. This behavior should be carefully implemented to ensure that all other functionalities and usages of the `Subquery` class remain unaffected, preserving the class's existing functionality while resolving the issue."
