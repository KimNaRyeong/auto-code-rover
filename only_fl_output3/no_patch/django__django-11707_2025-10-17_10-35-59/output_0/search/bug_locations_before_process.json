        "intended_behavior": "Add an override for the '__getstate__' method in the 'Subquery' class. This method should call the superclass's '__getstate__' method to get the default state dictionary, then modify this dictionary by removing the '_constructor_args' key if it exists. This change ensures that during the pickling process, the queryset passed into 'Subquery' does not get inadvertently evaluated, thus preventing the 'ValueError: This queryset contains a reference to an outer query and may only be used in a subquery.' error. This behavior should be carefully implemented to ensure that all other functionalities and usages of the 'Subquery' class remain unaffected, preserving the class's existing functionality while resolving the issue."
