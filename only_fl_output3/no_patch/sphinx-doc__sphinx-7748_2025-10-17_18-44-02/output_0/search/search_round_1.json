Given the nature of the issue, we will likely need to search for the part of the code that handles `autodoc_docstring_signature`, as well as how method signatures from C++ are processed and converted into Python docstrings by SWIG or the documentation system. To start, I would suggest the following search API calls:\n\n1. search_method(\"autodoc_docstring_signature\")\n2. search_code(\"overloaded methods\")\n3. search_code('\"\"\"')  # To find code that might be dealing with docstrings directly."

This scenario also includes the possibility that the issue pertains to a more generic or underlying mechanism for handling docstrings in the context of SWIG-generated bindings or documentation generation, rather than a specifically named method.\n\nSince the search for \"overloaded methods\" also didn't yield any results, it indicates that the issue may require a deeper dive into how SWIG or the project's documentation system handles method overloadings at a more fundamental level or through a different terminology.\n\nThe timeout on the search for code snippets with docstrings (`\"\"\"`) suggests that there's a large amount of code dealing with docstrings, making it a common scenario in the codebase, but it's too broad to directly pinpoint the areas responsible for the behavior described in the issue.\n\nTo move forward, we need to refine our search strategy to get more context. Considering the lack of success with direct method and keyword searches, we can pivot to exploring specific components known to interact with docstrings, method signatures, or SWIG bindings (if these terms are relevant to the project). Here are some revised API calls to consider:\n\n1. Search for classes or methods that are known to handle documentation generation or parsing. This could involve looking for well-known documentation tools like Sphinx, Doxygen, or custom tools within the project that might be responsible for extracting or generating docstrings.\n   \n2. Since the initial search terms were too direct or broad, we should consider searching for SWIG interface files (typically with a `.i` extension) or configurations within the project, as understanding how they are set up might give insights into how method signatures are being handled or could be handled for overloaded methods.\n\nGiven the information we have, some suitable next steps for API calls could include:\n\n- search_code(\"SWIG\")\n- search_code(\"docstring generation\")\n- search_method(\"parse_docstring\")\n- search_code_in_file(\"def\", \"*.i\")  # Assuming the project might directly include `.i` files for interface definitions.\n\nThese calls are designed to explore broader and possibly related areas of the codebase that could give us insights into how documentation and method signatures are managed, potentially highlighting areas of the code that could be related to the reported issue."
