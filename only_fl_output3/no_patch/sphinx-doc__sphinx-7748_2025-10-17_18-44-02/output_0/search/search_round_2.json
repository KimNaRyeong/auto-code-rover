This scenario also includes the possibility that the issue pertains to a more generic or underlying mechanism for handling docstrings in the context of SWIG-generated bindings or documentation generation, rather than a specifically named method.\n\nSince the search for \"overloaded methods\" also didn't yield any results, it indicates that the issue may require a deeper dive into how SWIG or the project's documentation system handles method overloadings at a more fundamental level or through a different terminology.\n\nThe timeout on the search for code snippets with docstrings (`\"\"\"`) suggests that there's a large amount of code dealing with docstrings, making it a common scenario in the codebase, but it's too broad to directly pinpoint the areas responsible for the behavior described in the issue.\n\nTo move forward, we need to refine our search strategy to get more context. Considering the lack of success with direct method and keyword searches, we can pivot to exploring specific components known to interact with docstrings, method signatures, or SWIG bindings (if these terms are relevant to the project). Here are some revised API calls to consider:\n\n1. Search for classes or methods that are known to handle documentation generation or parsing. This could involve looking for well-known documentation tools like Sphinx, Doxygen, or custom tools within the project that might be responsible for extracting or generating docstrings.\n   \n2. Since the initial search terms were too direct or broad, we should consider searching for SWIG interface files (typically with a `.i` extension) or configurations within the project, as understanding how they are set up might give insights into how method signatures are being handled or could be handled for overloaded methods.\n\nGiven the information we have, some suitable next steps for API calls could include:\n\n- search_code(\"SWIG\")\n- search_code(\"docstring generation\")\n- search_method(\"parse_docstring\")\n- search_code_in_file(\"def\", \"*.i\")  # Assuming the project might directly include `.i` files for interface definitions.\n\nThese calls are designed to explore broader and possibly related areas of the codebase that could give us insights into how documentation and method signatures are managed, potentially highlighting areas of the code that could be related to the reported issue."

This situation suggests that either the project does not use these specific technologies or terminologies, or the issue could be located in a more nuanced part of the documentation or method handling process than initially anticipated.\n\nSince all direct and specific searches related to common keywords around the issue have returned without results, it's clear that either the terminology used within the project for these concepts diverges from standard or expected names, or the issue might be rooted in a more generic or foundational part of the codebase that deals with method documentation or Python bindings generally, rather than being explicitly tied to SWIG or a specific docstring generation tool.\n\nGiven this context, we need to reconsider our approach to locate the relevant parts of the project that could be causing the observed issue. Without specific hooks like SWIG, specific documentation tools, or known method names to anchor our search, we might need to broaden our understanding of how the project structures its Python bindings and method documentation processes.\n\n### Next Steps for More Context\n\nAt this stage, a different strategy would be to:\n\n1. **Inspect Common Points of Integration:** Look into how the project integrates C++ with Python, possibly through generic Python/C++ binding mechanisms or custom wrapper code that might not be labeled explicitly as SWIG or use `.i` files.\n\n2. **Identify Custom Documentation Practices:** Since searches for common documentation generation terms came back empty, the project might use a less conventional system for generating or handling docstrings. This could involve custom scripts or build steps that process C++ code comments into Python docstrings.\n\n3. **Review Python-C++ Binding Mechanisms:** If standard tools like SWIG are not being used, the project may employ alternative methods or custom tools for creating Python bindings for C++ code, including manual wrapper functions or less common tools.\n\n4. **Manual Examination of Method Handling:** Given the issue's focus on overloaded methods and docstrings, exploring how the project defines Python methods that wrap C++ code could reveal custom patterns or comments indicating how overloads are meant to be documented.\n\n### Refined Approach for API Calls\n\nGiven the lack of results with our initial searches, the next best approach would be manually examining parts of the codebase related to Python bindings and documentation. However, since this is not possible in our current mode of interaction, we're at a limitation point where further automated search queries might not yield the necessary insights without a more detailed understanding of the specific technologies or custom systems at play in the project."
