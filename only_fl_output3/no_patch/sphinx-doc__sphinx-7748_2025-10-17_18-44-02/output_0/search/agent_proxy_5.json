This manual inspection is essential for moving forward, as it would provide the concrete locations and contexts within which to craft a suitable patch or modification.\n\nIn summary, without more specific context or the ability to directly interact with the project's codebase beyond the constraints of this format, further progress on pinpointing bug locations and detailing intended behavior modifications is not feasible."
