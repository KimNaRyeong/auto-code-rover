I understand there was a mistake in the instructions provided for the script's execution behavior in response to the presence of the issue.

Given your updated request, it appears we need a script that effectively attempts to reproduce the issue and behaves in the manner you've described: raising an `AssertionError` when the issue is present and exiting cleanly otherwise. Unfortunately, my previous script misinterpreted the desired outcome upon encountering the issue, explicitly exiting with an error code upon catching the exception, which contradicts the requirement for raising an assertion error.

Let's correct the approach with a new version of `reproducer.py`:

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    from sympy import exp
    from sympy.physics import units
    from sympy.physics.units.systems.si import SI

    expr = units.second / (units.ohm * units.farad)
    
    # Catching the AssertionError if the dimension is not detected as dimensionless before applying the exp function
    try:
        dim = SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr)[1]
        assert SI.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(dim), "The dimension is not detected as dimensionless before applying the exp function."
    except AssertionError as assert_error:
        print_stacktrace(assert_error)
        raise AssertionError('Dimensional analysis failed before applying the exp function.') from None

    # Handling the ValueError expected from the bug in SI._collect_factor_and_dimension
    try:
        buggy_expr = 100 + exp(expr)
        SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(buggy_expr)
        # If no exception is raised, the issue is considered fixed, exit with code 0
        sys.exit(0)  
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError('The exp function does not handle dimensionless exponent correctly.') from None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error on AssertionError
```

This script attempts to reproduce the specific issue described and uses the `print_stacktrace` function to clearly show where the error occurs. If no error is encountered (indicating the issue has been fixed), it will exit with code 0. If the issue is present and causes an `AssertionError`, the script will print the stack trace and exit with code 1, as requested.
