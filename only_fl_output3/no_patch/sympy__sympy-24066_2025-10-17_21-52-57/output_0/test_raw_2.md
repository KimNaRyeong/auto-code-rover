Based on your requirements, I've amended the approach to ensure the script will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present and will attempt to reproduce the error as accurately as possible. Note that the previous oversight has been addressed to align with your instructions correctly.

Here's how the standalone Python script, `reproducer.py`, should look to meet your criteria:

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    from sympy import exp
    from sympy.physics import units
    from sympy.physics.units.systems.si import SI

    try:
        expr = units.second / (units.ohm * units.farad)
        buggy_expr = 100 + exp(expr)
        SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(buggy_expr)
        # If no exception is raised by the above line, the issue is considered fixed, thus exit with code 0.
        print("No issue detected. Exiting with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:  # Capturing the general exception to cover ValueError and any other potential exceptions.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError('Failed due to an unhandled dimensionality in exponentiation.') from None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError:
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code 1 if an AssertionError is raised
```

**Instructions:**

1. Place this file in the root directory of your project.
2. Execute the script using Python 3 by running `python3 reproducer.py` in your terminal.
3. The script will attempt to execute operations that may trigger the discussed issue.
    - If the issue is present, it catches the resulting exception and prints a detailed stack trace for debugging purposes. Subsequently, it raises an `AssertionError`, exiting with code 1.
    - If the issue does not occur (indicating it's been resolved), the script prints a success message and exits with code 0.

This revised script is specifically designed to handle the exception by printing a detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function before raising an `AssertionError` if the issue persists.
