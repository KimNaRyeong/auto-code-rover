Unfortunately, my previous script misinterpreted the desired outcome upon encountering the issue, explicitly exiting with an error code upon catching the exception, which contradicts the requirement for raising an assertion error.\n\nLet's correct the approach with a new version of `reproducer.py`:\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\nimport sys\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef reproduce_issue():\n    from sympy import exp\n    from sympy.physics import units\n    from sympy.physics.units.systems.si import SI\n\n    expr = units.second / (units.ohm * units.farad)\n    \n    # Catching the AssertionError if the dimension is not detected as dimensionless before applying the exp function\n    try:\n        dim = SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr)[1]\n        assert SI.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(dim), \"The dimension is not detected as dimensionless before applying the exp function.\"\n    except AssertionError as assert_error:\n        print_stacktrace(assert_error)\n        raise AssertionError('Dimensional analysis failed before applying the exp function.') from None\n\n    # Handling the ValueError expected from the bug in SI._collect_factor_and_dimension\n    try:\n        buggy_expr = 100 + exp(expr)\n        SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(buggy_expr)\n        # If no exception is raised, the issue is considered fixed, exit with code 0\n        sys.exit(0)  \n    except ValueError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise AssertionError('The exp function does not handle dimensionless exponent correctly.') from None\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        reproduce_issue()\n    except AssertionError as e:\n        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error on AssertionError\n```\n\nThis script attempts to reproduce the specific issue described and uses the `print_stacktrace` function to clearly show where the error occurs. If no error is encountered (indicating the issue has been fixed), it will exit with code 0. If the issue is present and causes an `AssertionError`, the script will print the stack trace and exit with code 1, as requested."
