        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue, we'll need to perform a series of API calls focused on the classes, methods, and specific code usage mentioned in the issue description. The primary focus areas identified from the issue are:\n\n1. **Class `SI`**: Specifically, we are interested in how the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method is implemented within this class.\n2. **Methods**: We need to examine the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method to understand how it processes expressions and why it fails to correctly handle expressions passed to the `exp` function.\n3. **Usage of `exp` with dimensions**: The issue seems to stem from handling dimensioned expressions within the `exp` function, so any implementation details about how dimensions are handled or checked in `exp` or related processing would be valuable.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls will help us gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the class `SI` to understand its location and context within the codebase:**\n   - `search_class(\"SI\")`\n\n2. **Search for the implementation of the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method within the `SI` class or the codebase to study its logic and parameters:**\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"_collect_factor_and_dimension\", \"SI\")`\n   \n3. **Since the `exp` function's handling of dimensions is under question, investigating how `exp` processes its arguments and any dimensionality checks would be insightful:**\n   - `search_method(\"exp\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive context around the reported issue, allowing for targeted inspection of the problem areas and ideation towards a patch."
