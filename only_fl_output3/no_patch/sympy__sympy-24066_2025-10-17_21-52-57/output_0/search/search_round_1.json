The class could be part of a module that requires a more specific search path or is dynamically generated or registered in a way that makes it less straightforward to locate with a simple class name search.\n\n2. **`exp` method found in various files:**\n    - The `exp` function's occurrences across multiple files indicate its fundamental role in different parts of SymPy, including matrices, plotting, quantum physics, and notably, in `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`. Given the issue description mentioning a dimensionality error from an `exp` expression, the implementation within `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` is likely most relevant. This file is where the core functionality of exponential expressions, possibly including handling of units and dimensions, would be implemented.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nSince we need more specific information about the handling of units and dimensions, particularly in relation to the `exp` function and potentially missing `SI` class, we should:\n\n1. **Investigate the implementation of `exp` in `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`:**\n   - The issue specifically mentions a failure related to the detection of dimensionlessness in the exponent expression. The handling code for such logic may well reside in the `exponential.py` module, which implements `exp`.\n\n2. **Search for a possible module or file that deals with physics units or the SI system:**\n   - Since directly searching for the `SI` class was unsuccessful, it's worth exploring files related to units of measurement or the implementation of the SI system within SymPy. The file name or class might not directly match the search query used. Therefore, a broader search approach might be necessary, possibly by searching code snippets related to dimensionality checking or manipulation.\n\nHere are the recommended specific API calls to resolve the above points:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"exp\", \"sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py\")`: To get more context on how `exp` is implemented and its handling of dimensions.\n- `search_code(\"SI _collect_factor_and_dimension\")`: Since the initial direct class search failed, this broader search might catch usage or definition contexts of `SI` or its methods that were missed.\n\nThese steps are designed to close the gap in our understanding of the issue's context by pinpointing where the reported problem occurs and how the specific functionalities related to the bug are implemented within SymPy."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Location 1: File: `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py`, Method: `exp`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** The implementation of `exp` should be enhanced to correctly handle expressions with dimensions. Specifically, when an expression involving physical units (such as `second/(farad*ohm)`) is passed to `exp`, the method should identify if the expression is dimensionless or can be simplified to a dimensionless form before proceeding with the exponential calculation. If the expression is not dimensionless, the method should raise a clear and informative error indicating the incompatibility of applying `exp` to dimensioned quantities. This will preserve the existing functionality of handling pure mathematical or dimensionless expressions, while providing a safeguard and informative feedback for expressions involving physical units. This change aims to prevent the calculation from proceeding with incorrect assumptions about dimensionality, addressing the core issue reported."
