        "intended_behavior": "The implementation of `exp` should be enhanced to correctly handle expressions with dimensions. Specifically, when an expression involving physical units (such as `second/(farad*ohm)`) is passed to `exp`, the method should identify if the expression is dimensionless or can be simplified to a dimensionless form before proceeding with the exponential calculation. If the expression is not dimensionless, the method should raise a clear and informative error indicating the incompatibility of applying `exp` to dimensioned quantities. This will preserve the existing functionality of handling pure mathematical or dimensionless expressions, while providing a safeguard and informative feedback for expressions involving physical units. This change aims to prevent the calculation from proceeding with incorrect assumptions about dimensionality, addressing the core issue reported."
