Added to `<testsuite>` tags directly if they are intended to be global or suite-level properties. This would likely involve modifying how `finalized` processes and writes out properties. 2. Conditionally placed within `<testcase>` or moved to `<testsuite>`, based on a better understanding of their intended scope. The method responsible for converting `request.node.user_properties` and how they're added to the XML needs to follow the JUnit schema, placing `<properties>` outside of `<testcase>` and within `<testsuite>` if the properties are meant to be global."

        "intended_behavior": "This method currently adds properties directly to itself, which are then serialized within a `<testcase>`. To resolve the issue, a mechanism needs to be implemented within `_NodeReporter` or its usage modified so that properties destined for suite-level inclusion are handled and stored differently. If properties should remain at the test case level for some reason, ensure they comply with the schema by perhaps including properties in a compatible format or adjusting them at the point of XML generation. If, instead, properties are meant to be global, consider adjusting the mechanism to aggregate these properties at the suite level, which may involve enhancing `_NodeReporter` to distinguish between test case and suite-level properties."
