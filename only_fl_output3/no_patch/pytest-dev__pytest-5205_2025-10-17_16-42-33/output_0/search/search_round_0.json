This behavior happens with newer versions of  hypothesis (https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/issues/1935).\n```\n[xUnit] [ERROR] - The result file '/somewhere/tests/pytests.xml' for the metric 'JUnit' is not valid. The result file has been skipped.\n```\nIn fact, as already mentioned in https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1126#issuecomment-484581283,  `record-property` is adding `<properties>` inside `<testcase>` which seems to be wrong (it should be inside `<testsuite>`). See: https://github.com/windyroad/JUnit-Schema/blob/master/JUnit.xsd .\nIt happens with all junit families.\nReproducing:\n```\n$ pip list\nPackage        Version\n-------------- --------\napipkg         1.5\natomicwrites   1.3.0\nattrs          19.1.0\ncertifi        2019.3.9\nexecnet        1.6.0\nhypothesis     4.18.3\nmore-itertools 4.3.0\npip            19.1\npluggy         0.9.0\npy             1.8.0\npytest         4.4.1\npytest-forked  1.0.2\npytest-xdist   1.28.0\nsetuptools     41.0.1\nsix            1.12.0\nwheel          0.33.1\n```\n`test_xml_generation.py`\n```\nfrom hypothesis import given, strategies\n@given(x=strategies.integers(1, 10,))\ndef test_xml_generation(x):\nassert 1 <= x <= 10\n```\n```\n$ pytest --junitxml=report.xml\n```\n`report.xml`\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<testsuite errors=\"0\" failures=\"0\" name=\"pytest\" skipped=\"0\" tests=\"1\" time=\"0.211\">\n<testcase classname=\"test_xml_generation\" file=\"test_xml_generation.py\" line=\"3\" name=\"test_xml_generation\"\ntime=\"0.074\">\n<properties>\n<property name=\"hypothesis-stats\"\nvalue=\"[&apos;test_xml_generation.py::test_xml_generation:&apos;, &apos;&apos;, &apos;  - 100 passing examples, 0 failing examples, 0 invalid examples&apos;, &apos;  - Typical runtimes: &lt; 1ms&apos;, &apos;  - Fraction of time spent in data generation: ~ 49%&apos;, &apos;  - Stopped because settings.max_examples=100&apos;, &apos;&apos;]\"/>\n</properties>\n</testcase>\n</testsuite>\n```\nI was trying to create a PR to fix this, but when I saw https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/7dcd9bf5add337686ec6f2ee81b24e8424319dba/src/_pytest/junitxml.py code I realized that what is needed to do could have more implications that I though. I think that nobody uses this feature with JUnit (as it breaks) and removing that is something to think about.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to understand how pytest's junitxml plugin is generating `<properties>` tags within `<testcase>` elements, and identify where and how to modify this behavior to adhere to the JUnit schema. The key points from the issue include:\n\n- The improper placement of `<properties>` within `<testcase>` instead of `<testsuite>`.\n- Mention of `record-property` in relation with this issue.\n- The file `junitxml.py` is identified as relevant to the problem.\n\nBased on this information, let's perform the following API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the relevant junitxml implementation file**: Since the file mentioned is `junitxml.py`, we should look for classes or methods within this file related to generating the XML structure, especially those handling `<testcase>` and `<properties>`.\n\n   - `search_class_in_file(\"LogXML\", \"junitxml.py\")`: To find if there's a class handling logging to XML, assuming `LogXML` based on common naming conventions for such classes.\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"record_property\", \"junitxml.py\")`: Since `record_property` is mentioned as part of the cause, finding its implementation might shed light on how `<properties>` are being added.\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"add_property\", \"junitxml.py\")`: This could be a method that directly adds `<properties>` which might be placing them incorrectly.\n   \n2. **Understanding JUnit XML generation logic**: To correct the structure, it's important to understand the logic that generates the `<testcase>` elements and how `<properties>` tags are intended to be nested within.\n\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"<testcase>\", \"junitxml.py\")`: To find the snippet responsible for generating `<testcase>` tags.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"<properties>\", \"junitxml.py\")`: To identify where and how `<properties>` tags are being added to the XML.\n\n3. **General inspection of XML schema compliance**: To ensure there is no other related issue or overlooked aspect.\n\n   - `search_method(\"validate_xml_schema\", \"junitxml.py\")`: Assuming there's a method to validate against an XML schema, which could indicate existing awareness or handling of the schema requirements.\n\nThese search API calls are designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how pytest's junitxml plugin handles XML generation, specifically relating to the issue at hand."
