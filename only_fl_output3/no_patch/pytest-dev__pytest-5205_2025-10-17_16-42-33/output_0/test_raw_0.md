To create a reproducible script for the described issue, we need to:

1. Use Pytest to run a simple test case that involves the `record_property` fixture.
2. Generate the JUnit XML report.
3. Validate the generated JUnit XML report against the expected structure, which should have `<properties>` inside `<testsuite>` and not `<testcase>`, according to the standard.

Since the issue involves directly interacting with Pytest's generated output, and there's no straightforward Python library universally accepted for validating XML against JUnit's schema in a standalone script, we'll approach this by checking for the presence of `<properties>` inside `<testcase>` elements in the generated XML as a string contains, which indicates the issue. Here's a simplified version that could serve the purpose:

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys

TEST_CONTENT = """
from hypothesis import given, strategies

@given(x=strategies.integers(1,10))
def test_sample(record_property, x):
    record_property("example", x)
    assert x
"""

REPRODUCER_PY_CONTENT = """
import pytest
"""

XML_PATH = "report.xml"
TEST_FILE_NAME = "test_reproducer.py"


def write_test_file():
    with open(TEST_FILE_NAME, "w") as test_file:
        test_file.write(TEST_CONTENT)


def run_pytest():
    cmd = ["pytest", TEST_FILE_NAME, "--junitxml", XML_PATH]
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
    if result.returncode != 0:
        raise Exception("Pytest failed to run successfully.")


def check_xml_for_issue():
    with open(XML_PATH, "r") as xml_file:
        content = xml_file.read()
        if '<testcase' in content and '<properties>' in content:
            raise AssertionError(
                "Found <properties> tag inside <testcase>, indicating the issue is present."
            )


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def main():
    try:
        write_test_file()
        run_pytest()
        check_xml_for_issue()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("Test completed successfully. No issue found.")
        sys.exit(0)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please make sure you have:

- Installed Pytest and Hypothesis using pip (`pip install pytest hypothesis`).
- Placed this script in the root directory of your project or the context where you intend to reproduce the issue.
- Python3 is required to run the script properly (`python3 reproducer.py`).

This script should exit with code 0 and print "Test completed successfully. No issue found." when the issue is not present. If the described issue is present, it will raise `AssertionError`, print the stack trace indicating where the check failed, and exit with code 1.
