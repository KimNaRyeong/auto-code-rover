Specifically, we want to look into how seaborn manages plot titles, axis label formatting in scientific notation, and possibly any changes made to layout or style handling in the new version that might affect label placement.\n\nFirst, let's explore the `relplot` function and any relevant classes or methods that handle plot layout, titles, or axis formatting since these are directly mentioned or implicated in the issue description. \n\n- Search for the `relplot` function to understand its implementation and any changes in the new version.\n- Look into classes or methods that handle plot titles. Since `set_titles` is explicitly called, this is a good starting point.\n- Examine methods related to axis formatting, particularly those that handle scientific notation since the `ticklabel_format` function is used in the provided code snippet.\n- Investigate any classes or methods that deal with facet grid management (`FacetGrid` might be relevant here), especially since the issue seems related to how plots are arranged and displayed in a grid layout.\n\nThese searches will provide us with a better understanding of the components involved in the issue and any recent changes that could have introduced the label overlapping problem.\n\nAPI calls to make:\n- search_method(\"relplot\")\n- search_method(\"set_titles\")\n- search_code(\"ticklabel_format\")\n- search_class(\"FacetGrid\")"
