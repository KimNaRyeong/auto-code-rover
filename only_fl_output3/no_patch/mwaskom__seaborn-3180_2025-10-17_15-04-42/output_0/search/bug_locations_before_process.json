        "intended_behavior": "The `set_titles` method should dynamically adjust title spacing based on the length of the title and the plot dimensions to prevent overlapping with axis labels or tick marks. Adjustments may involve calculating optimal title positions or allowing for customization of title placement via additional parameters. The objective is to ensure that long titles, especially in faceted plots with varying axis label lengths, do not overlap with plot content. This behavior should preserve the method's current functionality while enhancing it to address the issue of title overlap in dense grid layouts."

        "intended_behavior": "While `relplot` primarily orchestrates the creation of relational plots by configuring a `FacetGrid` and applying the plotting function, ensuring that `facet_kws` or other related parameters (potentially new ones introduced to address this issue) are properly utilized to manage subplot titles and label formatting could mitigate the overlapping labels issue. Any adjustment made should retain `relplot`'s ability to flexibly generate scatter or line plots within a faceted grid. Introducing or properly utilizing parameters that allow for explicit control over subplot margins or padding may also contribute to a resolution by providing additional space for labels and titles, thereby preventing overlap."
