        "intended_behavior": "The intention here is to replace all occurrences of 'D' with 'E' in the `output_field` to correctly interpret the exponent part of floating-point numbers that are read from FITS files. Since the original `output_field.replace` call does not modify `output_field` in place but rather returns a new string with the replacements made, the correct approach would be to update `output_field` with the value returned by `replace`. That is, after the `replace` call, `output_field` should be updated to reference the new string returned by the method, effectively applying the intended modification. This change ensures that the exponent characters are correctly standardized to 'E', allowing for the proper handling and interpretation of floating-point numeric values within the wider codebase, especially in operations that may rely on the parsing or display of these numbers."
