If we knew the class name, we could search directly within it, but since we don't, we can start by searching the file itself.\n\n```python\nsearch_code_in_file(\"output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))\", \"fitsrec.py\")\n```\n\n2. **Search for the method that contains the problematic code**: The snippet provided looks like it might be part of a method. If we can identify the method, it would provide valuable context for understanding how `output_field.replace` is supposed to work within the larger logic.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))\")\n```\n\nThese calls should help us understand where exactly the issue is located in the codebase and possibly reveal more about the logic and data structures involved."
