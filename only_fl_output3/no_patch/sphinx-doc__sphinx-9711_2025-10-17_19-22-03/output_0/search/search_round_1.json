This means any version >9 is not allowed for any check of something >1. That is, treated as string '0.6' > '0.10', but treated as versions '0.6' < '0.10'. Since Sphinx does the former, some extension versions may not be allowed when they should be.\n### How to Reproduce\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors\n$ cd mplcursors\n$ pip install -r .doc-requirements.txt\n$ pip install -e .\n$ make -C doc html\n```\nThis passes just fine, because the requirements pin sphinx-gallery to 0.9. But if you then update to the current 0.10 release:\n```\n$ pip install sphinx-gallery==0.10\n$ make -C doc html\n```\nresults in a failure due to a \"not new enough\" version:\n```\nRunning Sphinx v4.1.2\nloading translations [en]... done\nmaking output directory... done\nSphinx version error:\nThis project needs the extension sphinx_gallery.gen_gallery at least in version 0.6.0 and therefore cannot be built with the loaded version (0.10.0).\n```\n### Expected behavior\nsphinx-gallery 0.10.0 should be accepted if 0.6 is the minimum specified.\n### Your project\nhttps://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nFedora\n### Python version\n3.9.6\n### Sphinx version\n4.1.2\n### Sphinx extensions\n_No response_\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

A logical approach is to look at how extensions are checked for their version requirement to identify where the string comparison issue arises. Given the information provided, here are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. Search for any method that might be responsible for checking the extension versions, which could be named something related to \"needs_extensions\" or dealing with version checks. Since the exact method name is not given, we'll start with a broad search:\n   - `search_method(\"needs_extensions\")`\n\n2. Next, considering the issue might be related to how version comparison is implemented for Sphinx extensions, a direct search for code snippets that deal with version comparison can provide relevant contexts. We would look for a string comparison or version checking logic in the codebase:\n   - `search_code(\"version comparison\")`\n   - `search_code(\"'>='\")`\n\nThese searches should help us gather context on where and how the version checks for extensions are implemented, which is crucial for resolving the issue."

        "content": "Since the search for `needs_extensions` did not yield results, it's possible that the exact mechanism or method name for checking extension versions in Sphinx or the mentioned project (mplcursors) differs from the initial guess. Additionally, the absence of hits for a specific \"version comparison\" code suggests that the version comparison logic might not be straightforward or described differently within the code.\n\nGiven that direct searches did not lead us directly to the relevant parts of the Sphinx or project code dealing with extension version checks, let's analyze the snippets where the string `'>='` appeared. Without direct access to the snippets, we can infer that these files (`sphinx/domains/c.py` and `sphinx/domains/cpp.py`) likely contain version comparison logic, perhaps for C and C++ domain specifics within Sphinx. These snippets, however, seem less likely to relate directly to the extension version check issue as described. They might be related to other version comparison tasks within Sphinx's domain handling for C and C++, not to the overall extension version checking mechanism impacting \"sphinx_gallery.gen_gallery\".\n\nGiven the information from the issue and the search results, it's clear we need to pivot our search strategy to find more relevant parts of the codebase. We should focus on finding how Sphinx handles extension versions more generally or how the `conf.py` file (or equivalent Sphinx configuration files) interprets extension requirements.\n\nA better approach to get closer to the root of the issue could involve:\n\n1. Exploring how Sphinx extensions are loaded and their versions are checked. This information might not be directly named `needs_extensions` but could involve similar loading or bootstrapping logic in Sphinx.\n   \n2. Since the issue is with version checking logic, looking for where Sphinx might parse or interpret version strings for extensions could help. This might involve generic version parsing or comparison utilities used by Sphinx.\n\nGiven these considerations, alternate search steps could include:\n\n- Searching for functionality related to loading or interpreting extension configurations, which might be referenced in Sphinx's documentation or extension handling code. This might not directly reference \"version comparison\" but could involve loading extension metadata (which includes version information).\n  \n- Broadening the code search to find how Sphinx processes its extensions could also involve looking at configuration loading (`conf.py` processing) or startup initialization code where extension requirements are parsed and evaluated.\n\nAnother potentially fruitful avenue, knowing that direct searches for \"needs_extensions\" and specific version comparison logic were unfruital, could be to:\n\n- Investigate the broader mechanism Sphinx uses for extension management, including any utility methods or classes designed to compare or parse version numbers, under the assumption that Sphinx extensions follow a common protocol or use shared utilities for such tasks.\n\nGiven the lack of direct hits on the initial queries, these broader searches would aim to uncover either the specific machinery Sphinx uses for extension version checks or utility components in Sphinx for version parsing and comparison, which might require correction or enhancement to address the reported issue."

Since the specific search strategies did not return direct references to the exact mechanism where the \"needs_extensions\" version checking occurs or did not yield the specific version comparison logic that might be causing the issue, and no direct locations of bug have been identified through the search API calls made, we cannot conclusively identify bug locations or describe the intended behavior to resolve the issue based on the provided responses.\n\nGiven the nature of the issue described regarding the improper version comparison (treating version numbers as strings leading to incorrect precedence of versions like \"0.10\" being considered lower than \"0.6\" due to lexicographical comparison), the bug is likely located in a part of the Sphinx code or project-specific code that parses and compares extension version requirements. However, without specific API call results pointing to that code, we can only speculate on general areas that may need investigation and potential fixes:\n- **Possible Area for Investigation**: Search and identification of Sphinx extension loading and version checking logic, potentially within the Sphinx core library rather than project-specific code, would need a more focused examination.\n- **Intended Behavior**: The intended behavior of the correct mechanism would involve accurately comparing semantic version numbers, ensuring that \"0.10\" is correctly identified as higher than \"0.6\", for example. This would likely involve:\n  - Parsing version strings to numerical tuples or a similar structure that facilitates correct comparison of major, minor, and patch numbers.\n  - Implementing or utilizing a version comparison function or library that correctly interprets semantic versioning rules in the context of Sphinx extension requirements.\n\nWithout the direct code snippets or file references from the search results, suggesting modifications or identifying specific buggy locations is speculative. A more fruitful approach might involve manual review of the Sphinx and project codebase where extensions are loaded and version requirements are parsed and evaluated."
