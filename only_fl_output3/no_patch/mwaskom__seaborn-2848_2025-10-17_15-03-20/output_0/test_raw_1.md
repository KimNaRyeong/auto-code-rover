Given the context that the previous attempt did not account for specific conditions such as the presence and version of `matplotlib` which is a dependency for `seaborn`, let's make a revision that ensures the dependencies are correctly mentioned. However, given that executing the script in a controlled environment where dependencies might not be automatically resolved, you will need to ensure that both `seaborn` and `matplotlib` are available in your Python environment. 

Here is a revised version of `reproducer.py` incorporating the function to print the stack trace correctly. This script checks for the specific issue reported but still, the environment needs to have the necessary libraries installed. If the required version of seaborn (`0.11.1`) is not installed, or if `matplotlib` is missing, this script will raise an error unrelated to the original issue described.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_seaborn_pairgrid_hue_in_map():
    try:
        import seaborn as sns
        # Checking seaborn's version
        assert sns.__version__ == '0.11.1', "This script expects seaborn version 0.11.1"
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Ensure matplotlib is available
        iris = sns.load_dataset("iris")
        g = sns.PairGrid(iris, y_vars=["sepal_length", "sepal_width"], x_vars=["petal_length", "petal_width"])
        g.map(sns.scatterplot, hue=iris["species"])
        g.map(sns.regplot, scatter=False)
        print("The issue has been fixed.")
    except AssertionError as ae:
        raise AssertionError(ae)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is still present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_seaborn_pairgrid_hue_in_map()
```

Please make sure that `seaborn` version `0.11.1` and `matplotlib` are correctly installed in your environment before running this script. This script aims to check specifically for the reported issue and will clearly print a stack trace if the issue occurs, fulfilling the requirements to either assert the presence of the bug or confirm its resolution.
