        "intended_behavior": "The `_map_bivariate` method should ensure that when plotting functions such as `scatterplot` are applied, the categorical `hue` data is handled correctly, whether it's passed directly via `map` or set in the PairGrid constructor. This might require adjusting how `kwargs` are passed to plotting functions, especially ensuring that `hue` data that's not initially recognized as part of the grid's setup is translated properly into the plotting context. Preservation of existing functionality means ensuring that any modifications to support direct `hue` assignments in `map` do not disrupt how `_map_bivariate` currently supports numerical and other types of `hue` values."

        "method": "scatterplot",
        "intended_behavior": "Given that the error traceback highlights a problem when passing `hue` data to `scatterplot` via `PairGrid.map`, it is essential that `scatterplot` can robustly handle categorical `hue` data, including when such data is passed in a non-standard context. The function should ensure that categorical hues are properly mapped and normalized into the appropriate color codes without causing key errors or type errors. This includes error-proofing the function against unexpected `hue` values and ensuring there's a clear, documented method for how `scatterplot` handles hues both in and out of a `PairGrid` context. This process might involve revising the function's handling of its `hue` parameter to better interpret dataframe columns or series passed directly as `hue` arguments, ensuring that seaborn functions consistently across versions and maintains backward compatibility where feasible."
