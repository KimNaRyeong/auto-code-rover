Allow makemigrations to skip database consistency checks
Description
	
Currently makemigrations always requires an active database connection, due to it executing loader.check_consistent_history() here: â€‹https://github.com/django/django/blob/290d8471bba35980f3e228f9c171afc40f2550fa/django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py#L93-L101
Sometimes you are making a change on a machine that doesn't have a database set up or is configured to use a database on a host that isn't resolvable (i.e a postgres host that's only resolvable within docker-compose). If you run makemigrations on such a machine it will fail while attempting to check the migrations consistency, which is quite annoying. The solution seems to either add a django.db.backends.dummy backend for such cases or start a database server locally.
I'd like to add a flag to skip the consistency check in these situations, or fail gracefully if the connection to the database isn't available.
