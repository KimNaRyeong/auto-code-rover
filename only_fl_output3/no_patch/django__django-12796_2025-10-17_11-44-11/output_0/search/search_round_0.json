If you run makemigrations on such a machine it will fail while attempting to check the migrations consistency, which is quite annoying. The solution seems to either add a django.db.backends.dummy backend for such cases or start a database server locally.\nI'd like to add a flag to skip the consistency check in these situations, or fail gracefully if the connection to the database isn't available.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To start addressing the issue, we need to understand the location and implementation of the `makemigrations` command and how the database consistency check is performed within it. The issue points directly to a section in the `makemigrations.py` file and suggests adding a flag to skip the consistency check. As such, we need to examine the code around the indicated location and understand the structure of the `makemigrations` command implementation to plan how a flag could be introduced to modify its behavior.\n\n1. We should first get the context around the specified lines in `makemigrations.py` to see how `loader.check_consistent_history()` is being called and understand the surrounding control flow. This could help in identifying a suitable place to introduce a new flag for skipping the consistency check.\n   \n   - `get_code_around_line(\"django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py\", 97, 10)`\n\n2. Additionally, understanding how command-line flags are parsed and used within this management command will be essential. We need to look for the method that handles parsing of command-line arguments in the same file, this can help in determining where and how to add the new flag.\n   \n   - `search_method_in_file(\"add_arguments\", \"django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py\")`\n\n3. Since the problem description mentions the possibility of the database check failing due to unavailable database connections, it might also be useful to investigate how Django management commands typically handle database connections so we can propose a graceful failure mechanism or a skip mechanism. It's not directly specified which method or class handles this, so we need to look more broadly.\n   \n   - `search_method(\"handle\")`\n\nThese selections target obtaining a clear view of the implementation details relevant to the issue at hand, focusing specifically on the parts of the Django codebase that deal with making migrations and handling database connections within management commands."
