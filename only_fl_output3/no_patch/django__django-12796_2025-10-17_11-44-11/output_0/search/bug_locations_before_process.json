This flag will allow users to skip the database consistency check when running the 'makemigrations' command. The intended behavior is to preserve existing functionality while providing an option to bypass the consistency check if this new flag is set. This requires adding a few lines to define the new flag in the argument parser setup."

        "intended_behavior": "In the 'handle' method, the logic that calls 'loader.check_consistent_history(connection)' should now also conditionally check if the '--skip-db-check' argument was provided by the user. If the argument is present (and presumably set to True), the method should skip the entire block of code that performs the consistency check (lines 93 to 101 in the current context). The behavior for users not utilizing the new flag should remain unchanged, ensuring that the database consistency check is performed by default. This change ensures that developers working in environments where the database is not accessible can still create migration files without modifying their database settings or setup."
