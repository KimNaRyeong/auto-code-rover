If you run makemigrations on such a machine it will fail while attempting to check the migrations consistency, which is quite annoying. The solution seems to either add a django.db.backends.dummy backend for such cases or start a database server locally.\nI'd like to add a flag to skip the consistency check in these situations, or fail gracefully if the connection to the database isn't available.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n### 1. Code Around `loader.check_consistent_history()` in `makemigrations.py`\n\nThe provided code snippet reveals a section of the `handle` method within the `makemigrations` management command. It shows the process that executes before creating new migrations, specifically focusing on checking the consistency of the migration history for each database alias. The check is not performed if the database engine is set to `'django.db.backends.dummy'`.\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?** This part iterates over each database connection defined (or just the default one if no database routers are used). It checks if there's at least one model that should be migrated per app per database. If such models exist, it calls `loader.check_consistent_history(connection)` to ensure that the migration history is consistent in the database.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug:** The issue at hand is related to this exact process, where running `makemigrations` can fail due to this consistency check requiring an active database connection. This is problematic in environments where the database is not accessible.\n\n- **Intended behavior given the issue description:** Ideally, there should be a way to skip this consistency check through a command-line argument, allowing `makemigrations` to execute without requiring a database connection. This would be especially useful in environments where the database is not readily accessible or in scenarios where the developer knows the history is consistent and just needs to generate migration files.\n\n### 2. `add_arguments` in `makemigrations.py`\n\nThe search results for the `add_arguments` method provided details on how arguments are added to the `makemigrations` command. This method initializes the command's options (flags that can be passed in through the command line).\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?** It specifies what command-line arguments `makemigrations` can accept, such as `--dry-run`, `--merge`, `--empty`, a specific migration name, and options for suppressing input or headers, among others.\n\n- **Relationship to the bug:** Since the proposed solution involves adding a new flag to skip database consistency checks, this method would need to be modified to accept the new flag.\n\n- **Intended behavior given the issue description:** To accommodate the feature request, a new argument would be introduced here (e.g., `--skip-check`), which dictates whether the `loader.check_consistent_history(connection)` should be called. The presence of this flag would conditionally bypass the consistency check loop.\n\n### Proposed Next Steps\n\nGiven the analysis, the proposed next steps would include:\n\n1. **Modifying the `add_arguments` method:** Introduce a new flag (for instance, `--skip-db-check`) that allows users to explicitly opt out of the database consistency checks.\n\n2. **Updating the `handle` method logic:** Introduce a condition around the database consistency checks that checks if the `--skip-db-check` flag has been set. If the flag is present, the consistency check (`loader.check_consistent_history(connection)`) should be skipped.\n\nThese changes would address the issue by providing the desired flexibility to work in environments where a database connection is not available without compromising the integrity checks for those who do not use the new flag."

This flag will allow users to skip the database consistency check when running the `makemigrations` command. The intended behavior is to preserve existing functionality while providing an option to bypass the consistency check if this new flag is set. This requires adding a few lines to define the new flag in the argument parser setup.\n\n#### Location 2:\n**File:** `django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py`\n\n**Class:** `Command`\n\n**Method:** `handle`\n\n**Intended Behavior:** In the `handle` method, the logic that calls `loader.check_consistent_history(connection)` should now also conditionally check if the `--skip-db-check` argument was provided by the user. If the argument is present (and presumably set to True), the method should skip the entire block of code that performs the consistency check (lines 93 to 101 in the current context). The behavior for users not utilizing the new flag should remain unchanged, ensuring that the database consistency check is performed by default. This change ensures that developers working in environments where the database is not accessible can still create migration files without modifying their database settings or setup."
