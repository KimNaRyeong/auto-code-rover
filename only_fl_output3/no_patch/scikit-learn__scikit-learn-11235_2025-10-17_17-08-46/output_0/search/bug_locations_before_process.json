        "intended_behavior": "In the `partial_fit` method, when handling the dense case, we need to align the behavior with the sparse case for when `with_mean=False` and `with_std=False`. Specifically, this means ensuring that: - `self.mean_` is set to `None` directly within this method when `with_mean=False` and `with_std=False`, to signal that no mean subtraction should be performed, aligning with the no-op behavior indicated in the issue description. - Properly manage and update `self.n_samples_seen_` in both sparse and dense cases to ensure that repeated calls to `fit` or `partial_fit` do not result in errors related to the existence or state of this attribute. This could involve better checks around the initialization and conditional updates of `self.n_samples_seen_` such that it is robust against multiple `fit` invocations without leading to failure scenarios like attempting to delete a non-existent attribute."
