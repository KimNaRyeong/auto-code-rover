It would be more logical and naturel to use the normal python of doing that by implementing the iter function like that:\ndef __iter__(self):\nfor page_num in self.page_range:\nyield self.page(page_num)\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we'll need to gather more context around specific elements mentioned in the issue description. Here's a plan to use the provided search APIs to collect sufficient code context:\n\n1. Since the issue mentions a `Paginator` object directly, we should start by searching for the class definition to understand its current structure and check if the `__iter__` method has been implemented yet or not. We need to understand the structure and current methods of the Paginator class.\n\n2. The issue also explicitly talks about implementing the `__iter__` method to iterate through all the pages using `page_range`. It's valuable to see how `page_range` is currently implemented or used within the Paginator class.\n\n3. Implementing the `__iter__` method would likely call the `page()` method on each iteration. Hence, we need to get details on the `page()` method itself to ensure the proposed changes align with its current behavior and signature.\n\nBased on this plan, here are the specific API calls we should make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Paginator\")`: This call will help us locate the Paginator class in the project to understand its current implementation.\n\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"page_range\", \"Paginator\")`: This will give us insights into how the `page_range` is currently defined within the Paginator class, which is crucial for the proposed `__iter__` implementation.\n\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"page\", \"Paginator\")`: With this, we can gather details on the `page` method that the new `__iter__` method will use to yield each page. \n\nThese calls together will provide a comprehensive view of the Paginator class's current state and how the proposed changes can be integrated."
