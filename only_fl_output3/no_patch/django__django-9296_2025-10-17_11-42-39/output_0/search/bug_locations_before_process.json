        "intended_behavior": "Implement the `__iter__` method to enable natural Python iteration over all pages in a Paginator object. This method should iterate through the entire page range (using the existing `page_range` property) and yield each page (utilizing the existing `page` method for each page number). This implementation would allow users to conveniently iterate over pages in a Paginator object using a simple for-loop, enhancing the Paginator class's usability and making it more Pythonic in its iteration process."
