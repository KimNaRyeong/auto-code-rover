This script checks if the problem with the probability density function (PDF) of the Matrix Normal Distribution in Sympy is present. It calculates the PDF for a given Matrix Normal Distribution and compares the bottom part of the PDF to what is expected (`2*pi`). If the PDF does not match with the expected theoretical value, indicating that the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace detailing the problem. If the PDF is as expected, indicating that the issue has been fixed, it prints a message saying no issue is detected and exits with code `0`.
