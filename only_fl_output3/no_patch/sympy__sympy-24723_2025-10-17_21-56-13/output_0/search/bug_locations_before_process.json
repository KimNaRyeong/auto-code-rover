        "intended_behavior": "The method responsible for computing the PDF of the `MatrixNormal` distribution should be reviewed and adjusted to ensure that the probabilistic density function's constant is accurately represented according to the mathematical formula provided in the issue description. This includes correct use of \u03c0 (pi) and the exponential function to ensure the constant part of the PDF is `1 / (2\u03c0)` as per the mathematical standard. Besides, any function that contributes to calculating the PDF's constant part should ensure it doesn't introduce inaccuracies or misrepresentations of the formula. The fix should preserve the general functionality for computing PDFs while correcting the specific constant issue."
