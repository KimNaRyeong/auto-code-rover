The method is responsible for defining command-line arguments that are applicable to management commands. Including `--skip-checks` here would allow users to specify the option when running any management command, effectuating the proposal to skip system checks selectively. This change should preserve all existing functionalities of the `add_arguments` method while introducing the new command-line option."

        "intended_behavior": "A review and modification might be required within the execution flow of commands, potentially in methods that are responsible for invoking system checks before the main command execution (e.g., `handle` or another relevant method). The intended behavior is to check for the `--skip-checks` option and, if present, bypass the system check procedures. This logic should only affect the path where system checks are performed, without altering other functionalities of the command execution process."
