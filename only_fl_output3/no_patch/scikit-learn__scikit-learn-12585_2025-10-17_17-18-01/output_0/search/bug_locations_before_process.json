        "intended_behavior": "Within the `clone` function, the code should be enhanced to handle cases where the `estimator` argument can be a type (a class) rather than an instance. Specifically, the modification might look something like adding a condition to check if `estimator` is a class type and, if so, handle it appropriately without attempting to call `get_params()`. This adds support for cloning estimator types (classes), enabling users to store and clone the types without initializing them, thereby allowing for greater flexibility in designing wrappers or meta-estimators in scikit-learn. The existing functionality for instances should remain unaffected, preserving the current capabilities for cloning instances of estimators with their parameters intact.\nThe adjustment aims at enhancing the `clone` function's robustness, enabling it to distinguish and correctly handle both instances and types of estimators. This approach extends the usability of the `clone` function, aligning with scikit-learn's flexible and modular design principles without breaking existing contracts or functionalities."
