Based on your request, here's a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the described issue with using the `clone` function from scikit-learn. This script specifically targets the problem where cloning fails for parameters that are estimator types, not instances. The script raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, correctly prints out the stack trace of the issue, and exits with code 0 if the issue is fixed or not encountered.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    from sklearn.base import clone
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

    try:
        # Attempt to clone while passing a class rather than an instance as a parameter
        # This simulates the scenario where `clone` fails on estimator types
        clone(StandardScaler, safe=False)
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Raise AssertionError to indicate the presence of the described issue
        raise AssertionError("The issue was successfully reproduced.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
        print("The issue was not encountered. Exiting with code 0, indicating the issue is fixed.")
        exit(0)  # Exit with code 0, indicating the issue is fixed or not encountered as expected
    except AssertionError as e:
        # Catch the AssertionError to handle the case where the issue is successfully reproduced
        print(f"AssertionError occurred: {e}")
        exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero code to indicate the presence of the issue
```

To execute this script, save it as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project and run it using the command:
```sh
python3 reproducer.py
```

This script checks for the specific problem where scikit-learn's `clone` function fails with estimator types as parameters, demonstrating how to catch and report the issue in a structured manner.
