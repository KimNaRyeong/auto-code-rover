        "intended_behavior": "Within this file, the logic responsible for parsing database schema information and generating the corresponding Django model fields needs to be adjusted. Specifically, this adjustment should enable the detection of foreign keys pointing to unique fields that are not the primary key of the related table. The existing functionality for processing foreign keys should be preserved. This includes properly generating models with foreign keys that reference the primary key of another table. Enhance the inspection logic to: 1. Detect if a foreign key references a unique field other than the primary key in the related table. 2. Accurately map this relationship in the generated Django model, possibly by using a more nuanced representation of `ForeignKey` relationships that includes specifying the `to_field` parameter when necessary (e.g., `ForeignKey(to='related_model', to_field='unique_field_name')`). 3. Ensure that this detection and mapping mechanism does not interfere with the standard behavior for foreign keys referencing primary keys, maintaining backward compatibility and expected functionality across Django's diverse user base and use cases. This fix should thereby ensure that models generated by the `inspectdb` command reflect the actual database schema more accurately, specifically in cases where foreign keys target unique constraints that are not the primary key of the related table."
