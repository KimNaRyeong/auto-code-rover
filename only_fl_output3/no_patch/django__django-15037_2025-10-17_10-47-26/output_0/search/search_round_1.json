        "content": "Analyzing the results from the queries executed:\n\n1. **Search for `inspectdb` Method/Class**: The search for `inspectdb` as a method or class didn't yield any results. This suggests that `inspectdb` is likely a command or a feature implemented as part of a larger system rather than a distinct class or method. From the context, knowing that Django has a command named `inspectdb`, it's reasonable to infer that we're dealing with Django's command for introspecting databases and generating model code. Therefore, the actual implementation should be within a command file rather than a standalone method or class named directly after `inspectdb`. The result indicating `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py` as containing relevant matches confirms this inference.\n\n2. **Search for Code Containing `ForeignKey`**: The search returning 155 snippets of code containing `ForeignKey` scattered across various Django components demonstrates the widespread use of foreign key relationships throughout Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system. Most notably, the mention of `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py` among these results is directly relevant to the issue at hand. This file likely contains the logic for the `inspectdb` command, which is directly responsible for the bug described: improperly handling foreign keys to unique fields during model generation.\n\nGiven the context, let's address the guiding questions:\n\n1. **What do these parts of the code do?** \n   \n   - They define, use, or manipulate foreign key relationships within Django's ORM, including but not limited to model definition, serialization, admin interfaces, and migrations. Specifically, `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py` is expected to contain the logic that reads a database schema and generates Django model code that reflects that schema.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between these parts of the code and the bug?**\n   \n   - The core of the bug relates to how `inspectdb` interprets and transforms foreign key relationships from database schema to Django model fields. The issue surfaces when `inspectdb` encounters a foreign key that references a unique field other than the primary key but fails to preserve this reference accurately in the generated model. Instead, it appears to default to associating the foreign key with the primary key of the referenced table.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   \n   - The expected behavior is for `inspectdb` to correctly identify and replicate foreign key relationships in the generated Django models, even when these relationships target unique fields that are not the primary key. This would entail generating a model field that not only marks itself as a ForeignKey in Django but also correctly identifies the target field in the related model based on unique constraints, not merely assuming it to be the primary key.\n\nTo further understand how `inspectdb` handles these scenarios and how it might be failing to do so correctly, the subsequent logical steps involve deeper examination of `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py`. Here, inspecting the specific implementation details, such as how foreign key relationships are detected and written out into model definitions, will be crucial. \n\nTherefore, a relevant follow-up action would be to:\n- `search_code_in_file(\"ForeignKey\", \"django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py\")` to see exactly how foreign keys are handled within the context of the `inspectdb` command in Django. This would provide direct insights into the current handling mechanisms and aid in pinpointing where modifications are required to address the issue described."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Specifically, this adjustment should enable the detection of foreign keys pointing to unique fields that are not the primary key of the related table.\n   - The existing functionality for processing foreign keys should be preserved. This includes properly generating models with foreign keys that reference the primary key of another table.\n   - Enhance the inspection logic to:\n     1. Detect if a foreign key references a unique field other than the primary key in the related table.\n     2. Accurately map this relationship in the generated Django model, possibly by using a more nuanced representation of `ForeignKey` relationships that includes specifying the `to_field` parameter when necessary (e.g., `ForeignKey(to='related_model', to_field='unique_field_name')`).\n     3. Ensure that this detection and mapping mechanism does not interfere with the standard behavior for foreign keys referencing primary keys, maintaining backward compatibility and expected functionality across Django's diverse user base and use cases.\n   - This fix should thereby ensure that models generated by the `inspectdb` command reflect the actual database schema more accurately, specifically in cases where foreign keys target unique constraints that are not the primary key of the related table."
