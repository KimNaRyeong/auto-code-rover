        "content": "To address the issue related to handling foreign keys to specific fields in `inspectdb`, the following inquiries using the APIs seem most relevant:\n\n1. We need to find where `inspectdb` is implemented or where it's mostly referred to, assuming it might be a command-line command or part of a larger library, possibly Django based on familiarity with terms like \"model\" and context around database handling. We should look for a class or function that deals with converting database tables into models.\n\n2. The description suggests the problem lies with how foreign key relationships are established during model generation, specifically targeting a unique field other than the primary key. So, we should look for where foreign keys are being handled in the code.\n\nHere are the API calls that would provide necessary context:\n\n- **Search for `inspectdb` class or method**: It's unclear whether `inspectdb` is a class or a method, so we will search for both. \n  - `search_method(\"inspectdb\")`\n  - `search_class(\"inspectdb\")`\n\n- **Search for code related to foreign key handling**: Assuming the foreign key handling might involve specific methods or classes linked with model relationships or the creation of foreign keys in models generated from database tables.\n  - `search_code(\"ForeignKey\")`\n  - `search_method(\"add_foreign_key\")` // This is a guess, based on common naming conventions for methods dealing with foreign key setup.\n  \nThese searches should provide a comprehensive scope of where changes might need to be integrated to address the foreign key to a specific field issue described."
