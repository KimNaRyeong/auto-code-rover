        "intended_behavior": "In the process of generating form fields from models, particularly when handling ForeignKey fields with limit_choices_to specified, the code should include a step to filter out duplicate choices. This might mean adjusting the logic that evaluates limit_choices_to to ensure that any queryset results are rendered distinct. This adjustment would preserve the intended functionality of using limit_choices_to to limit the available choices for a field in a form, ensuring that each choice is unique, even when the underlying limit_choices_to criteria involves complex joins that could potentially lead to duplicate entries."
