        "content": "To start addressing the issue described, we need more context about where and how `limit_choices_to` is implemented and used within the ForeignKey field. Understanding how form fields are generated from models, especially those involving ForeignKeys with specified `limit_choices_to` criteria, is crucial. Given that the issue mentions a problem occurring with a `Q` object leading to duplicated form options, locating the part of the code handling this logic will be our priority.\n\nLet's begin by getting more context on how ForeignKey fields are handled when generating form fields, particularly focusing on any part of the code that deals with limiting choices, possibly involving `Q` objects.\n\nHere are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ForeignKey\")`: To find the definition or usage of ForeignKey class which could potentially be the place where `limit_choices_to` is handled.\n2. `search_method(\"formfield\")`: Since the issue mentions form fields, locating the `formfield` method in the context of ForeignKey fields might provide insight into how choices are filtered and why duplicates might occur.\n3. `search_code(\"limit_choices_to\")`: Investigate how and where `limit_choices_to` is used throughout the project to understand its application and potential issues.\n\nThese searches aim to uncover the relevant sections of code that will help address the reported issue."
