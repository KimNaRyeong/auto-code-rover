        "content": "Given the issue is to deprecate `Model.Meta.index_together` in favor of `Model.Meta.indexes`, we need to understand how `index_together` is currently implemented and used across the model classes, and how `Model.Meta.indexes` is supposed to replace it. Let's proceed by searching for usages of \"index_together\" and then examining how the \"indexes\" attribute and Index class are used.\n\n1. **Search for `index_together` usage in class Meta:**\n   We need to search for where `index_together` is used within any `Meta` class inside model classes, as this will give us examples of current implementations that need to be deprecated.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"index_together\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for examples of `indexes` attribute usage within Model.Meta:**\n   To understand how to replace `index_together` with `indexes`, we should look for existing usages of `indexes` within `Meta` classes. This will help in crafting the patch by providing a template for how replacements should be structured.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"Meta: indexes\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for the Index class definition and usage:**\n   Since the `Index` class is suggested as part of the replacement for `index_together`, understanding how the `Index` class is defined and used is critical. We should look at the class definition and examples of its instantiation.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"Index\")\n   search_code(\"models.Index\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches will provide a comprehensive overview of how `index_together` is currently used and what needs to be done to migrate to `Model.Meta.indexes` using the `Index` class."
