        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, let's address each part to understand its impact on the issue and the next steps for deprecating `Model.Meta.index_together` in favor of `Model.Meta.indexes`.\n\n### 1. `index_together` Usage in the Codebase\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\nThe results from `search_code(\"index_together\")` indicate that the `index_together` attribute is utilized across various parts of the Django framework, including migration state management, autodetection of changes for migrations, model operations, and schema management for database backends. This shows that `index_together` is an integral part of model definition, influencing migration generation and database schema creation.\n\n**Relation to the bug/issue:**\nAs the goal is to deprecate `Model.Meta.index_together`, the widespread use of `index_together` revealed by the search results means we need to carefully update these pieces of the codebase to support `Model.Meta.indexes` and ensure backward compatibility until `index_together` is fully deprecated.\n\n**Intended behavior post-deprecation:**\nAny functionalities currently relying on `index_together` should be modified to achieve the same results using `Model.Meta.indexes` and the `Index` class, without affecting the Django framework's ability to generate migrations and manage database schemas effectively.\n\n### 2. Search for `Meta: indexes` Usage\n\nThis search did not return any results, which could be due to the specificity of the search query. It's still important to understand how the `indexes` attribute within the `Meta` class of models is proposed to be used for defining indexes on the models.\n\n### 3. `Index` Class Definition and Usage\n\n**What does this part of the code do?**\nThe `Index` class defines how custom database indexes can be created using Django models. The class constructor and methods demonstrate flexibility in defining indexes, including expressions, fields, naming, database tablespace, operation classes, condition, and included fields.\n\n**Relation to the bug/issue:**\nUnderstanding the `Index` class is crucial for replacing `index_together`, as it offers the necessary functionality to create complex database indexes. The examples from `search_code(\"models.Index\")` show how the `Index` class is used in migration operations, which can be a basis for understanding how to convert `index_together` definitions to use `Model.Meta.indexes` with the `Index` class.\n\n**Intended behavior post-deprecation:**\nModels will define indexes in the `Meta` class using the `indexes` attribute, which will consist of `Index` instances configured to match the desired database indexes previously achieved using `index_together`.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the lack of direct examples for `Meta: indexes`, a useful next step would be to search more broadly for `indexes` usage within model `Meta` classes to gather examples of how indexes are defined using the new preferred method. This would provide clear guidance on how to transition from `index_together` to `Model.Meta.indexes`.\n\n- **Search for broader usage of `indexes` within models:**\n  \n  ```python\n  search_code(\"indexes =\")\n  ```\n\nThis search could uncover examples of `indexes` attribute usage that were not caught by the initial, more specific query. Understanding these examples is essential for crafting the patch to deprecate `index_together`."

Based on the issue description and the context obtained, the locations that need attention for deprecation involve not just direct bug fixes but modifications to accommodate the transition from using `index_together` to `Model.Meta.indexes`. Here, we detail the locations and their intended behavior post-modification:\n\n**Location 1:**\n- File: `django/db/models/options.py`\n- Description of Intended Behavior: This file likely contains the implementation details of how `index_together` is interpreted and translated into SQL schema statements. The intended behavior would involve ensuring that any functionality parsing or utilizing `index_together` also supports or is migrated to an implementation that leverages `Model.Meta.indexes` with the `Index` class. Essentially, where `index_together` is parsed, it should either be translated to an equivalent `indexes` attribute containing `Index` instances or, if feasible, raise deprecation warnings suggesting the migration to `indexes`.\n\n**Location 2:**\n- File: `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`\n- Description of Intended Behavior: Given this file's role in detecting changes for migrations, it should correctly identify changes from `index_together` to `Model.Meta.indexes` as part of the migration generation process. The intended behavior is to adapt the change detection logic to recognize when `index_together` is replaced with `indexes` and generate the appropriate migration operations to reflect this change in the database schema, without causing errors or missing the transition.\n\n**Location 3:**\n- File: `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`\n- File: `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py`\n- Description of Intended Behavior: These files are responsible for generating the SQL statements to adjust the database schema based on migrations. The intended behavior here is to ensure that the schema generation logic can translate `indexes` attributes (using `Index` instances) into correct SQL statements, ensuring functionality equivalence with what was previously achieved with `index_together`. Moreover, any specific backend adaptations (like for SQLite3) that handle `index_together` specially will need to ensure compatibility or appropriate translation to the use of `indexes`.\n\n**General Intended Behavior Across Identified Locations:**\nAcross all these locations, the fundamental intended behavior is to enable the Django framework to treat `indexes` (comprising `Index` instances) as the standard method for defining model indexes, thereby deprecating `index_together`. This involves ensuring that all functionalities, from migrations to schema generation, that previously relied on `index_together`, now seamlessly work with `indexes`, offering a clear, migration path for developers to update their models without losing existing functionality or facing migration issues."
