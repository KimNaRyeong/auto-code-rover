And apparently there was no test for the init parameter with other estimator than default.\n*Edit* Also accept initial estimator which does not support sample weights as long as the gradient boosting is not fitted with sample weights\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described regarding gradient boosting with an sklearn estimator as the initialization, let's gather more context by making the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the Gradient Boosting class to understand how it's implemented and interacts with initial estimators.\n   - `search_class(\"GradientBoostingClassifier\")`\n   - `search_class(\"GradientBoostingRegressor\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions that the problem arises when `init` is set to a sklearn estimator, we should look for how this `init` parameter is handled. This likely involves looking into both the `__init__` method where parameters are set and any method responsible for initializing or fitting the model with the `init`.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"GradientBoostingClassifier\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"GradientBoostingRegressor\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"GradientBoostingClassifier\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"GradientBoostingRegressor\")`\n\n3. The issue description mentions a problem with the shape of the `predict` output. It would be beneficial to review the `predict` method implementation for both classifiers and regressors to identify any specific handling or expectations related to the shape of its output, particularly when an initializer is used.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"predict\", \"GradientBoostingClassifier\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"predict\", \"GradientBoostingRegressor\")`\n\n4. It might also be useful to verify if there's a specific place in the code where initial estimators are checked for compatibility with sample weights, as the comment toward the end suggests adjusting behavior based on whether the initial estimator supports sample weights.\n   - `search_code(\"sample_weights\")`\n\nThis series of API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how gradient boosting is implemented in the context of initialization with an sklearn estimator, the handling of predictions, and the integration of sample weight support, all of which are relevant to resolving the described issue."
