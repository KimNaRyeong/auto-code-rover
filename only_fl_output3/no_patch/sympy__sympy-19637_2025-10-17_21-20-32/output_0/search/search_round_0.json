        "content": "To understand the context of the issue and gather enough information for resolving it, let's perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. Since the issue occurs with the `kernS` function/reference, we need to find out where it is defined and how it is used. Thus, calling:\n   - `search_method(\"kernS\")`\n\n2. The error message suggests that `kern` is referenced before assignment, which likely happens near or within the `kernS` functionality. To understand the usage context of `kern` and see if it\u2019s a local variable issue or a missing import, we perform a code snippet search:\n   - `search_code(\"kern\")`\n\n3. Given that `from sympy.core.sympify import kernS` is mentioned, it's crucial to inspect the specific file for a broader context that includes `kernS`:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"kernS\", \"sympy/core/sympify.py\")`\n\nThese calls should provide the necessary information to understand the cause of the 'kern referenced before assignment' issue and guide the next steps for a resolution."
