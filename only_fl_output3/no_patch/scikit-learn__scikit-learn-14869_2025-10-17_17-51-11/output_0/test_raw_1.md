This script tries to pinpoint the potential problem with using HistGradientBoostingClassifier with `loss='categorical_crossentropy'` on binary classification. It uses an `assert` statement to explicitly check whether the predictions match the expected outcome for a binary classification task. If the assertion fails, it prints a stack trace that includes information about where the error occurred. If everything runs as expected (meaning the predictions are correct and no exceptions are thrown), it prints a message indicating the issue was not detected.

If run in an environment where the issue is present, this script should raise an `AssertionError` and print the stack trace. However, if the underlying problem is fixed (or if there was no problem with the `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` using `categorical_crossentropy` for binary classification in the first place), the script will exit quietly with code 0, indicating no issues were found.
