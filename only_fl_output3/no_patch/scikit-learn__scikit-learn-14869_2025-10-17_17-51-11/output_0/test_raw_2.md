This revised version includes more precise handling and explicit checks that may surface the issue described. The script now does a better job at raising an `AssertionError` only when the predictions do not match expectations for binary classification when using `categorical_crossentropy`. Moreover, it includes a fallback to catch and report other unexpected errors, thus providing a clearer picture of any failures encountered during execution.
