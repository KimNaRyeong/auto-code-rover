Specifically, it could incorporate a check to: 1. Detect when the classification is binary but `categorical_crossentropy` is selected. 2. Either automatically switch to `binary_crossentropy` with a warning that informs the user of the adjustment or raise an informative error explaining why `categorical_crossentropy` is not suitable for binary classification, guiding the user to select `binary_crossentropy` or let the `loss` parameter remain 'auto' for automatic handling."
