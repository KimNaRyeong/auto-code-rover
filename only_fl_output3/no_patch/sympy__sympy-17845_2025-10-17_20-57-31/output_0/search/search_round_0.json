        "content": "To address the issue raised, we need to understand how `Interval` and `FiniteSet` are currently implemented, particularly focusing on their string representations (`__str__` methods). We also need insight into how these representations could be altered without violating the principle that `str(object)` should be valid code to recreate the object. This involves checking the constructors for these classes to see how they accept arguments.\n\nGiven the description of the issue, here are the API calls I propose:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Interval\")`\n2. `search_class(\"FiniteSet\")`\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"__str__\", \"Interval\")`\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"__str__\", \"FiniteSet\")`\n5. `search_code(\"Interval(0,1)\")`\n6. `search_code(\"FiniteSet(1,2,3)\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive view of how `Interval` and `FiniteSet` are implemented, especially how they are converted to strings, which is central to the issue at hand."
