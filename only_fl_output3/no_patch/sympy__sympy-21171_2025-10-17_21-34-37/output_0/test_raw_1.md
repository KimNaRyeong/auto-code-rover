Given your clarification and the requirement to accurately reflect the conditions that lead to the exception being raised, I'll revise the approach based on the input you provided. I'll include explicit steps to ensure the issue is detected properly or confirm the resolution. Please note that this script will try to simulate the error as closely as possible within a standalone context, aiming for the original issue to be effectively reproduced or confirmed as resolved.

```python
# reproducer.py
from sympy import *
from sympy.physics.continuum_mechanics.beam import Beam
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Setup the symbolic variables as in the issue description
    E, L, F = symbols("E, L, F")
    B, H = symbols("B, H")
    I = B * H**3 / 12  # Moment of inertia
    
    # Define beam with parameters sourced from above
    b2 = Beam(L, E, I)
    b2.apply_load(-F, L / 2, -1)
    b2.apply_support(0, "fixed")
    R0, M0 = symbols("R_0, M_0")
    b2.solve_for_reaction_loads(R0, M0)
    
    # This operation is expected to potentially trigger the issue
    try:
        b2.shear_force()
        print("The issue is fixed. No exception was raised.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit indicating success as the issue is presumed fixed
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Explicitly raise an assertion error to indicate the bug's presence
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script targets the recreation of the specified issue, capturing the TypeError associated with an unexpected keyword argument 'exp'. Should this error not occur (indicating a potential fix for the issue), it exits with code 0, signaling standard execution flow. The inclusion of the custom stack trace output function facilitates detailed diagnostic output, particularly useful if the script is used within a broader debugging or verification process regarding the resolution of the reported issue.
