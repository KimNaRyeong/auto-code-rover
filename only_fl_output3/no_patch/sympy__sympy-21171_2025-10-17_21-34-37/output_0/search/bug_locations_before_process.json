The code must robustly parse and print `SingularityFunction` instances, including when these functions are part of complex expressions, such as being raised to a power. If the `exp` argument is indeed relevant for certain situations (e.g., formatting the output when a singularity function is exponentiated), the method should be modified to appropriately include this consideration in the LaTeX string construction."

        "intended_behavior": "The `_print_Pow` method needs to ensure that it interacts with the `_print_SingularityFunction` method in a manner that is consistent with the expected arguments of the latter. If `_print_Pow` is passing the `exp` keyword argument (or any other unexpected arguments) to `_print_SingularityFunction` that causes the error, this behavior needs correction. The method might require a conditional check or a preprocessing step for `SingularityFunction` instances to correctly format the power expression into LaTeX without propagating unsupported arguments. This ensures that the functionality of printing power expressions in LaTeX is preserved while preventing the observed error."
