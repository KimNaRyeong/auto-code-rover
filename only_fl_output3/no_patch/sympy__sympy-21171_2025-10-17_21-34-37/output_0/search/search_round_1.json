        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the API calls yields essential insights into the components involved in the bug described in the issue.\n\n### Analysis of `SingularityFunction` Class\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `SingularityFunction` class in `sympy/functions/special/singularity_functions.py` represents mathematical singularity functions, which often appear in mechanical engineering problems, particularly in the analysis of beam problems. The methods within the class, such as `eval`, `fdiff`, and rewrites to `Piecewise` or `Heaviside` functions, are focused on evaluating these functions, their derivatives, and representations in different forms that might be useful in various computations or simplifications.\n\n#### Relationship to the Bug\nThe issue involves an error when trying to print a `SingularityFunction` using LaTeX notation. While the `SingularityFunction` class defines the mathematical behavior of these functions, the issue arises not in the definition or operation of these functions per se but in their representation as LaTeX strings.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior would involve the `SingularityFunction` being correctly converted into a LaTeX string when `sympy` attempts to print the result within a Jupyter Notebook. This conversion process is failing due to an unexpected keyword argument, implying a disconnect between the expectations of the printing function and the actual implementation.\n\n### Analysis of `_print_SingularityFunction` Method\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `_print_SingularityFunction` method(s), particularly within `sympy/printing/latex.py`, are responsible for converting `SingularityFunction` instances into LaTeX code. These methods are part of the larger printing machinery in `sympy` that allows mathematical expressions to be displayed in human-readable formats.\n\n#### Relationship to the Bug\nThe bug directly involves this method, as indicated by the error message, which suggests that an invalid parameter (`'exp'`) is being passed to `_print_SingularityFunction`. This indicates a potential issue with the method signature or how arguments are processed within the method.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nThe intended behavior of `_print_SingularityFunction` is to take a `SingularityFunction` object and return a LaTeX string representation of that object. For the method to function properly, it either needs to correctly handle the `exp` argument or avoid receiving this argument altogether, depending on how the LaTeX printer was designed to process function powers.\n\n### Analysis of `_print_Pow` Method\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nMethods named `_print_Pow` across various printers in `sympy` are responsible for printing expressions raised to a power. In the context of the LaTeX printer (`sympy/printing/latex.py`), this method should be handling the conversion of power expressions to their corresponding LaTeX representation.\n\n#### Relationship to the Bug\nGiven the traceback, the error occurs when the `_print_Pow` method attempts to process a `SingularityFunction` raised to a power. This suggests that there's a misunderstanding or misimplementation in how `_print_Pow` calls the `_print_SingularityFunction` method regarding handling the exponent part (`exp`) of the power expression.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\nThe `_print_Pow` method is intended to properly handle instances where a `SingularityFunction` is raised to a power, ensuring that the power expression is correctly translated into LaTeX code. This includes managing how the exponent is passed and represented, possibly avoiding passing unsupported arguments to `_print_SingularityFunction` or adapting the latter to handle such situations gracefully.\n\n---\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps might involve reviewing the signatures and implementations of `_print_SingularityFunction` and `_print_Pow` in `latex.py` to ensure they align with the expectations of power expressions involving `SingularityFunction`s and correcting the argument mismatch error. This would likely involve inspecting how the exponent argument is passed to `_print_SingularityFunction` and ensuring it's either properly utilized or not passed in scenarios that it cannot handle."

The code must robustly parse and print `SingularityFunction` instances, including when these functions are part of complex expressions, such as being raised to a power. If the `exp` argument is indeed relevant for certain situations (e.g., formatting the output when a singularity function is exponentiated), the method should be modified to appropriately include this consideration in the LaTeX string construction.\n\n**Location 2:**\n- **File:** `sympy/printing/latex.py`\n- **Class:** (Global scope, no specific class for printer methods)\n- **Method:** `_print_Pow`\n\n**Intended Behavior:** The `_print_Pow` method needs to ensure that it interacts with the `_print_SingularityFunction` method in a manner that is consistent with the expected arguments of the latter. If `_print_Pow` is passing the `exp` keyword argument (or any other unexpected arguments) to `_print_SingularityFunction` that causes the error, this behavior needs correction. The method might require a conditional check or a preprocessing step for `SingularityFunction` instances to correctly format the power expression into LaTeX without propagating unsupported arguments. This ensures that the functionality of printing power expressions in LaTeX is preserved while preventing the observed error.\n\nThe resolution should ensure the LaTeX printer can handle `SingularityFunction` objects, both standalone and as parts of expressions (like being exponentiated), without throwing TypeError exceptions. This involves potentially updating how arguments are passed between these methods or refining the handling of specific cases within the methods themselves."
