As other compatibility layers have been cleaned up, these shims can be deprecated for removal.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue regarding the deprecation of certain functions in the `django.utils.translation` module, specifically `ugettext()`, `ugettext_lazy()`, `ugettext_noop()`, `ungettext()`, and `ungettext_lazy()`, let's start by understanding where these functions are defined and used in the Django project.\n\nFirst, we need to locate these functions or any references to them in the codebase. Given their nature, it's likely they are defined in a file related to translations, potentially within `django.utils.translation`. Thus, we'll start with searching for these methods to find where they are defined and possibly where they are referenced:\n\n1. `search_method(\"ugettext\")`\n2. `search_method(\"ugettext_lazy\")`\n3. `search_method(\"ugettext_noop\")`\n4. `search_method(\"ungettext\")`\n5. `search_method(\"ungettext_lazy\")`\n\nFollowing this, we will also need to understand how these methods are currently being imported or utilized across the project to understand the potential impact of deprecating them. It might also be useful to find any documentation or comments related to these methods for additional context on their planned deprecation:\n\n1. `search_code(\"from django.utils.translation import ugettext\")`\n2. `search_code(\"from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy\")`\n3. `search_code(\"from django.utils.translation import ugettext_noop\")`\n4. `search_code(\"from django.utils.translation import ungettext\")`\n5. `search_code(\"from django.utils.translation import ungettext_lazy\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive overview of where and how these functions are used within the Django project, setting the stage for planning their deprecation."
