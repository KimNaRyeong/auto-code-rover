Creating a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that reproduces the reported issue involves attempting to dynamically analyze the code for the trigger of the `unused-import` false positive in relation to type comments. However, due to the nature of the linting process which is static analysis, it's not possible to directly reproduce linting behavior with a runtime script that checks the linting issue and throws an `AssertionError` based on the linting result.

Linting tools like `pylint` analyze the code without executing it, so they don't follow the same execution path as a Python script would. This means the task cannot be accomplished in the exact manner described (using assertions based on dynamic code execution to catch a static analysis issue).

Instead, to "simulate" a script that would serve the purpose of highlighting whether the issue is resolved or not, you could create a script that runs `pylint` on a small piece of code and checks its output for the presence of the specific `unused-import` issue. Please note that this script itself won't directly execute within the standard Python execution model to trigger an `AssertionError`, but it will execute `pylint` and parse its output to see if the problem persists.

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def run_pylint_on_code(code: str):
    """Run pylint on the provided code."""
    with open("temp_code.py", "w") as tmp_file:
        tmp_file.write(code)

    result = subprocess.run(["pylint", "temp_code.py"], capture_output=True, text=True)
    return result.stdout

def check_for_specific_issue(pylint_output: str, issue_code: str):
    """Check for a specific issue code in pylint output."""
    if issue_code in pylint_output:
        raise Exception(f"Detected pylint issue: {issue_code}")

def main():
    code_to_test = """
\"\"\"Docstring.\"\"\"

import abc
from abc import ABC

X = ...  # type: abc.ABC
Y = ...  # type: ABC
"""

    issue_code = "W0611"

    pylint_output = run_pylint_on_code(code_to_test)

    try:
        check_for_specific_issue(pylint_output, issue_code)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with an error code to indicate the issue is present.
    else:
        print("No issue detected.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with 0 to indicate the issue is fixed/not present.

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script works by:
1. Writing a temporary Python file (`temp_code.py`) with the code snippet you provided.
2. Running `pylint` on this file and capturing its output.
3. Checking if the specific `unused-import` issue code (`W0611`) is present in the `pylint` output.
4. Raising an exception if the issue is detected, which in turn prints a stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function.

**Notes:**
- This approach requires `pylint` to be installed and accessible in the environment where the script runs.
- The script assumes that the issue code to look for (`W0611`) is known and static. If different issues or dynamic issue checking is needed, the script would need adjustments.
- Remember to delete `temp_code.py` or modify the script to clean up after itself if necessary.
