        "content": "To address the issue described about the `unused-import` false positive when using a module in a type comment, it's essential to understand how the pylint tool checks for unused imports and how type comments are parsed and considered in the context of usage. Considering this, we will need to gather information from the pylint project's codebase focusing on:\n\n- How pylint determines if an import is used or unused.\n- The handling of type comments and their influence on the detection of used imports.\n\nGiven this, the following API calls would be beneficial:\n\n1. `search_code(\"unused import\")` - This call will help us find the logic or functions associated with the detection of unused imports.\n2. `search_code(\"type comment\")` - This will provide context on how pylint handles type comments and if it considers them when inspecting for usage of imports.\n3. `search_method(\"visit_import\")` - Since pylint uses the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) for analysis, this call can reveal how import statements are visited and potentially marked as unused.\n4. `search_method(\"visit_comment\")` - If pylint has a specific method to visit comments, it might give insight into how type comments are parsed or ignored during analysis."
