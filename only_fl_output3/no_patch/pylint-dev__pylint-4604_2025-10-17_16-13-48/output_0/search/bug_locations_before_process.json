        "intended_behavior": "The adjusted or newly implemented logic should include a mechanism to: Recognize and parse type comments for variable type annotations. Consider any imports referenced within type comments as 'used' thereby not triggering the 'unused-import' warning for such cases. This behavior would need to be carefully integrated to ensure that it does not interfere with the existing functionality of identifying truly unused imports. The solution must accurately differentiate between type comment usages and other contexts where an import might not be directly invoked in the executable code but is still considered as being used (e.g., in docstrings or other form of comments for documentation purposes)."
