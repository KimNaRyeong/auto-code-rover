Given the limitations and assumptions in the previous attempts, creating a Python script (`reproducer.py`) that simulates a pylint static analysis environment and raises an `AssertionError` based on pylint's static issue detection (specifically, an unused-import false positive for type comments) is inherently challenging due to the runtime vs. lint-time distinction.

However, we can draft a conceptual approach that executes pylint within a Python script and checks its output for specific issues, raising an AssertionError if the issue is present. This script cannot strictly trigger the linting issue from code execution but can manipulate and analyze pylint's output programmatically.

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def run_pylint_and_check_issue(filename):
    try:
        output = subprocess.check_output(['pylint', filename], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, text=True)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        output = e.output  # Get output even if pylint exits with non-zero (indicating lint issues)

    return output

def main():
    code = """\"\"\"Docstring.\"\"\"

import abc
from abc import ABC

X = ...  # type: abc.ABC
Y = ...  # type: ABC
"""
    filename = 'temp_reproducer.py'

    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(code)

    pylint_output = run_pylint_and_check_issue(filename)

    if 'unused-import' in pylint_output:
        try:
            assert 'unused-import' not in pylint_output, "False positive for unused-import"
        except AssertionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(1)  # Exiting with code 1 to indicate the issue was reproduced
    else:
        print('No issue detected.')
        sys.exit(0)  # Exiting with code 0 to indicate the issue was not reproduced

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Please note**:
- Ensure `pylint` is installed and available in your environment before running this script.
- This script works by writing a temporary Python file named `temp_reproducer.py`, running pylint against it, and parsing the output to check for the `unused-import` issue.
- It expects the presence of this specific issue and attempts an assertion check based on its existence in the pylint output, raising an AssertionError accordingly.
- The script cleans up by writing to a temporary file but does not explicitly delete it; consider adding file deletion logic if necessary.

The actual process of catching lint issues through dynamic runtime scripts is unconventional and presents practical challenges due to the nature of static code analysis vs. runtime code execution. This example aims to bridge that gap in a rudimentary way by focusing on the output analysis of pylint execution.
