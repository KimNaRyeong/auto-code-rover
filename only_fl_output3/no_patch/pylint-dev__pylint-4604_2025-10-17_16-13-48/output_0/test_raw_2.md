Creating a standalone Python script to programmatically reproduce a pylint issue—specifically, an unused-import false positive in the context of type comments—can be challenging due to the nature of linting versus runtime behavior. However, we can approximate this by writing a script that generates a python file with the problematic code, runs pylint on it, checks the output for the specific warning, and behaves as specified (raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, exit with code 0 if it is fixed).

Here's how we could structure such a script `reproducer.py`:

```python
import subprocess
import sys

# Function to print the stacktrace as specified
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_pylint_output_for_unused_import(output):
    """
    This function checks if the pylint output contains the specific unused import warning.
    """
    return "unused-import" in output and "import abc" in output

def main():
    test_code = '''\"\"\"Docstring.\"\"\"

import abc
from abc import ABC

X = ...  # type: abc.ABC
Y = ...  # type: ABC
'''

    # Writing the test case to a python file
    test_file = 'test_code.py'
    with open(test_file, 'w') as file:
        file.write(test_code)

    # Running pylint on the generated file
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(['pylint', test_file], check=True, capture_output=True, text=True)
        pylint_output = result.stdout
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        pylint_output = e.output

    # Checking if pylint's output contains the unused-import issue
    if check_pylint_output_for_unused_import(pylint_output):
        print("The issue is present.")
        raise AssertionError("False positive for unused-import detected.")
    else:
        print("No issue detected.")
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exiting with code 1 to indicate the issue was reproduced
```

### Note:
- Ensure pylint is installed and accessible in your environment (`python -m pip install pylint`).
- This script dynamically creates another Python file with the snippet mentioned in your issue description, runs pylint on that file, and analyzes the output to detect if the `unused-import` false positive issue exists.
- The script assumes that the false positive related to `unused-import` will be clearly identifiable in the pylint output with both the mention of "unused-import" and the line "import abc".
- If pylint's behavior has changed or the environment setup is incorrect (e.g., pylint is not installed), the script may not work as expected. This example assumes a basic environment where `subprocess.run` can successfully call pylint.
- The script will attempt to exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed (i.e., the specified false positive does not appear in pylint's output). If the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace for debugging purposes.
