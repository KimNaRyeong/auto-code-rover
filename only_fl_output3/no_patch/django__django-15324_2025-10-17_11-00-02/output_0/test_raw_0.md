Below is the `reproducer.py` script that you can use to reproduce the issue described. This script makes a POST request to a Django server with a file-upload that contains a null byte in the file extension. When the issue is present, an `AssertionError` should be raised due to the unexpected handling of the file name with a null byte, and it will print a stack trace of the issue using the provided `print_stacktrace` function.

```python
import io
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def make_bad_request():
    contents = io.StringIO("." * (1024 * 1024 * 3))  # 3MB of dots
    files = {"docfile": (b"bogus.txt\x00", contents, "text/plain")}
    try:
        response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/", files=files)
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Expected issue with null byte in file extension not handled correctly.")
    else:
        # If the request was successful or an error different from ValueError occurred,
        # we assume the issue is fixed or the server responded differently than expected.
        if response.status_code == 500:
            print("Issue reproduced. Server responded with a status code 500.")
        else:
            print("The issue seems to be resolved. Server responded with a status code other than 500.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        make_bad_request()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    else:
        exit(0)
```
This script should be executed in the root directory of your Django project where it can access the server running at `http://localhost:8000/`. If the server encounters an unhandled exception due to the null byte in the file extension, an `AssertionError` will be raised, indicating that the issue is present.

Please ensure that you have a working Django environment and the server is running before executing this script. Additionally, modify the URL in the `requests.post()` call if your Django server is running on a different address or port.
