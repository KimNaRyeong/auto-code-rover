To address the requirements and ensure that we faithfully reproduce the issue described, here's a revised, standalone Python script named `reproducer.py`. This script attempts to upload a file with a null byte in its name to a Django application. In the case of encountering an issue, it will print the stack trace and exit with code 1. Conversely, if the application handles the upload without crashing, it will exit with code 0, indicating that the issue has been resolved.

```python
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_upload():
    try:
        # Prepare a file-like object containing dummy data
        contents = "." * (1024 * 1024 * 2)  # Approx. 2MB
        # Simulate a file name that includes a null byte character
        files = {'docfile': ('file_with_null_byte.\x00txt', contents, 'text/plain')}
        
        # Replace "http://localhost:8000/" with the actual URL where your Django app is hosted
        response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/", files=files)
        
        # If the server returns a 500 Internal Server Error, it indicates the issue is present
        if response.status_code == 500:
            raise ValueError("Server encountered an internal error, possibly due to the null byte in filename.")
        else:
            print("No error encountered. The issue might be resolved.")
            exit(0)
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        # Handle any request-related errors
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle any other exceptions and print the stack trace
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An error occurred that likely indicates the presence of the issue.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_upload()
```

This script is executed in the context of having a Django server running locally (or on a specified host) that handles file uploads. Before running this script:

1. Ensure your Django application is running and accessible at the specified URL.
2. Adjust the URL in the `requests.post` call to match where your application accepts file uploads.

To execute, save this script as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project and run it using Python 3:
```
python3 reproducer.py
```
This script checks for a `500 Internal Server Error` as a sign that the issue with handling null bytes in file extensions exists. If the Django application is properly handling or sanitizing file names to avoid this error, the script will not raise an `AssertionError`, and it will exit with code 0.
