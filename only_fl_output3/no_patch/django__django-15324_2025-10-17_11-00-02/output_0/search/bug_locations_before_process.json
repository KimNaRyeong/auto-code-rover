If null bytes are found, the method should handle this gracefully, either by removing the null bytes or by generating an error message indicating the issue with the file name. This ensures that the process does not proceed to the point of attempting to create a temporary file with an invalid name that leads to a crash."

        "intended_behavior": "Within the TemporaryFile class, ensure that any methodology used for handling file extensions (whether during creation, opening, or any other operation) includes checks or sanitization for null bytes within the file extensions. This could involve stripping out null bytes before proceeding with the temporary file's creation or handling. This adjustment would prevent errors related to invalid file names on the file system and ensure that Django can gracefully handle files with problematic extensions."
