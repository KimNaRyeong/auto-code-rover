Given the requirements and the feedback, let's revise the approach to reproducing the issue. The problem with the initial attempt was related to connecting to the Django server rather than the issue itself. We'll ensure that this version more correctly simulates the uploading of a file with a null byte in its filename extension to a Django server. We assume your Django server is correctly set up and running before executing this script.

To accurately reproduce and handle the issue as described, the code below is designed to mimic the problematic file upload and catch the ValueError exception resulting from Django' attempt to handle a file with a null byte in the filename extension. Please replace the placeholder url `"http://localhost:8000/"` with the correct one if your Django application is hosted on a different address.

```python
import io
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def send_malformed_request():
    try:
        # Generate a large string as file contents
        contents = "." * (1024 * 1024 * 2.5)  # ~2.5MB
        file_name = b"file_with_null_byte.\x00txt"  # Filename containing a null byte
        files = {"docfile": (file_name, contents, "text/plain")}
        # Attempt to send the request to the localhost Django server
        response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/", files=files)
        # Check for a successful HTTP response indicating the issue did not occur
        if response and response.status_code == 200:
            print("The issue appears to be resolved.")
            exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating success/no error
        else:
            raise AssertionError("Expected the issue to be resolved, but it was not.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("An error occurred that likely indicates the presence of the issue.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        send_malformed_request()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        exit(1)
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:
        print("Could not connect to the Django server. Ensure it is running and accessible.")
        exit(1)
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
```

Before running this script, ensure your Django application is running and accessible. The script now catches the `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` to provide a clearer message if it cannot connect to the server, addressing the previous execution's issue. It still uses `print_stacktrace` to output more detailed error information and exits with code 1 when it catches specific exceptions that indicate the presence of the initial issue or connectivity problems.
