        "content": "Given the requirements and the feedback, let's revise the approach to reproducing the issue. The problem with the initial attempt was related to connecting to the Django server rather than the issue itself. We'll ensure that this version more correctly simulates the uploading of a file with a null byte in its filename extension to a Django server. We assume your Django server is correctly set up and running before executing this script.\n\nTo accurately reproduce and handle the issue as described, the code below is designed to mimic the problematic file upload and catch the ValueError exception resulting from Django' attempt to handle a file with a null byte in the filename extension. Please replace the placeholder url `\"http://localhost:8000/\"` with the correct one if your Django application is hosted on a different address.\n\n```python\nimport io\nimport requests\n\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef send_malformed_request():\n    try:\n        # Generate a large string as file contents\n        contents = \".\" * (1024 * 1024 * 2.5)  # ~2.5MB\n        file_name = b\"file_with_null_byte.\\x00txt\"  # Filename containing a null byte\n        files = {\"docfile\": (file_name, contents, \"text/plain\")}\n        # Attempt to send the request to the localhost Django server\n        response = requests.post(\"http://localhost:8000/\", files=files)\n        # Check for a successful HTTP response indicating the issue did not occur\n        if response and response.status_code == 200:\n            print(\"The issue appears to be resolved.\")\n            exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating success/no error\n        else:\n            raise AssertionError(\"Expected the issue to be resolved, but it was not.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise AssertionError(\"An error occurred that likely indicates the presence of the issue.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        send_malformed_request()\n    except AssertionError as error:\n        print(error)\n        exit(1)\n    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:\n        print(\"Could not connect to the Django server.

The script now catches the `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` to provide a clearer message if it cannot connect to the server, addressing the previous execution's issue. It still uses `print_stacktrace` to output more detailed error information and exits with code 1 when it catches specific exceptions that indicate the presence of the initial issue or connectivity problems."
