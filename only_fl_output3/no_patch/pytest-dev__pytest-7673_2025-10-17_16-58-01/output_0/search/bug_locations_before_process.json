        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the code within `set_level` method of the `LogCaptureFixture` class needs to be modified to ensure that the handler's initial log level is preserved correctly across multiple `set_level` calls within the same test. The intention is to make the handling of `_initial_handler_level` mimic the behavior of `_initial_logger_levels`. Currently, the handler's level is directly set with each call to `set_level`, which leads to the last level set being the one that's restored at the end of the test. This behavior is incorrect when `set_level` is called multiple times, as it should restore the handler's level to what it was before any `set_level` calls were made. To correct this, the handler's initial level should only be set if it has not already been set during the current test. This can be achieved by introducing a conditional check that only assigns `self._initial_handler_level` if it hasn't been previously assigned. This modification checks if `_initial_handler_level` has already been set. If not, it assigns it; otherwise, it leaves it unchanged, ensuring that the handler's original level is correctly restored at the end of the test. This change preserves the existing functionality of being able to set and temporarily modify the log level for tests, while also ensuring that the teardown correctly restores the logger's original state, thereby resolving the reported issue."
