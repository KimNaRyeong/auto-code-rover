What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `set_level` method of the `LogCaptureFixture` class in `src/_pytest/logging.py` is designed to temporarily set the logging level of a specified logger (or the root logger if no logger is specified) for the duration of a test. This method performs several key actions:\n- It retrieves the logger object based on the provided logger name or the root logger if no name is given.\n- It saves the current logging level of the specified logger to `_initial_logger_levels` using `setdefault` method, ensuring that if the level is already set, it doesn't overwrite it. This allows for restoration of the logger's level after the test.\n- It sets the new logging level for both the logger object and the handler associated with `LogCaptureFixture` (`self.handler`), changing the behavior of logging output for the test's duration.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe bug described in the issue revolves around the incorrect restoration of handler levels when `caplog.set_level` is invoked multiple times within a test. The provided context shows that `self._initial_handler_level` is directly set to the handler's level every time `set_level` is called. Unlike `_initial_logger_levels`, which uses `setdefault` to only capture the first set level within a test context, `_initial_handler_level` is overwritten with each call to `set_level`. This means it fails to preserve the handler's original level before any `set_level` calls within a test, leading to incorrect restoration at the end of the test.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior would be to ensure that after all test manipulations, the logger and handler levels are restored to their original states before the test began, irrespective of the number of times `caplog.set_level` was called. Specifically, for the handler:\n- The initial level of `self.handler` before any `set_level` calls should be saved in a way that subsequent calls to `set_level` do not overwrite this saved level.\n- After the test concludes and teardown procedures restore levels, `self.handler`'s level should revert to this initially saved level, providing a consistent starting state for subsequent tests.\n\nIdentifying this intended behavior points towards a solution that mimics the `setdefault` use in `_initial_logger_levels` but applied to handling `_initial_handler_level`, thereby preventing overwrites on multiple `set_level` calls."

The intention is to make the handling of `_initial_handler_level` mimic the behavior of `_initial_logger_levels`.\n\nCurrently, the handler's level is directly set with each call to `set_level`, which leads to the last level set being the one that's restored at the end of the test. This behavior is incorrect when `set_level` is called multiple times, as it should restore the handler's level to what it was before any `set_level` calls were made.\n\nTo correct this, the handler's initial level should only be set if it has not already been set during the current test. This can be achieved by introducing a conditional check that only assigns `self._initial_handler_level` if it hasn't been previously assigned. Here's a proposed modification to implement the intended behavior:\n\n```python\n442         if not hasattr(self, '_initial_handler_level'):\n443             self._initial_handler_level = self.handler.level\n444         self.handler.setLevel(level)\n```\n\nThis modification checks if `_initial_handler_level` has already been set. If not, it assigns it; otherwise, it leaves it unchanged, ensuring that the handler's original level is correctly restored at the end of the test. This change preserves the existing functionality of being able to set and temporarily modify the log level for tests, while also ensuring that the teardown correctly restores the logger's original state, thereby resolving the reported issue."
