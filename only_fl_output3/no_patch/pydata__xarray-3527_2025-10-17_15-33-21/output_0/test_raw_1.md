Based on your request to create a standalone python file `reproducer.py` to specifically reproduce the issue of `DatasetGroupBy` not implementing `quantile` and to handle the issue accordingly, the corrected script provided below addresses the core issue. It attempts to access the `quantile` method on a `DatasetGroupBy` object, expects an `AttributeError`, and uses your provided function to print the stack trace clearly if an unexpected exception occurs. The script exits with code 0 if the `AttributeError` is caught, indicating the issue is present, aligning with the original issue description. If the method exists (indicating the issue has been resolved), it exits with code 1.

```python
import xarray as xr
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        ds = xr.Dataset(data_vars={"a": ("x", list("abcd"))}, coords={"x": range(4)})
        # Attempt to access quantile method on DatasetGroupBy
        quantile_method = ds.groupby(ds.x % 2 == 0).quantile
    except AttributeError as e:
        # Expected outcome if quantile is not implemented for DatasetGroupBy
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit code 0 to indicate the issue is present
    except Exception as e:
        # Any other exception is unexpected
        print("An unexpected error occurred:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    # If no AttributeError, it means `quantile` is defined for DatasetGroupBy
    # Hence, the expected issue is no longer present
    print("Issue appears to be resolved: `quantile` exists for DatasetGroupBy objects.")
    sys.exit(1)  # Exiting with code 1 to indicate the absence of the issue

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script should be executed in the environment where the `xarray` package and its dependencies are installed. It assumes that the absence of the `AttributeError` directly correlates to the issue being fixed. Ensure that the environment used to test this script matches the specifications of the issue (i.e., the correct `xarray` version is installed).
