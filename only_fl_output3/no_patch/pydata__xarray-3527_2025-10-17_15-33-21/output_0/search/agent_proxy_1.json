Specifically, it should:\n    - Compute the qth quantile for each variable in the dataset, respecting the groups defined by the `DatasetGroupBy` object.\n    - Accept the same parameters for quantile calculation as `DataArrayGroupBy.quantile`, including `q`, `dim`, `interpolation`, and `keep_attrs`.\n    - Use similar logic for handling the grouping, applying the quantile function to each group, and consolidating the results back into a dataset. This might involve iterating over each variable in the dataset, applying the quantile operation group-wise, and then combining these results while preserving dataset attributes and dimensionality as much as possible.\n    - Ensure that the new `quantile` method integrates seamlessly with the existing dataset groupby functionality, providing users a consistent and expected functionality across both `DatasetGroupBy` and `DataArrayGroupBy` objects."
