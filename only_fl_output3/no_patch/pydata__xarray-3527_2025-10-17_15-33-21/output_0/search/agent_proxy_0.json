Given the context of the issue, it's also relevant to see if the `DataArrayGroupBy` class has a `quantile` method and how it's implemented there, since the issue description hints that `quantile` works for `DataArrayGroupBy` but not for `DatasetGroupBy`.\n\nGiven this, the appropriate API calls would be:\n\n1. `search_class(\"DatasetGroupBy\")` - To find the class definition and relevant files for `DatasetGroupBy`.\n2. `search_class(\"DataArrayGroupBy\")` - To find the class definition and relevant files for `DataArrayGroupBy`.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"quantile\", \"DataArrayGroupBy\")` - To understand how `quantile` is implemented or defined in `DataArrayGroupBy`.\n4. `search_method_in_class(\"quantile\", \"DatasetGroupBy\")` - Although this might return no results due to the issue described, it's worth trying to check if there are any stubs or incorrect implementations."
