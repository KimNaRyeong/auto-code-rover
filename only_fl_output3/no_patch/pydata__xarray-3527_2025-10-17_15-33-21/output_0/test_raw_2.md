To ensure the Python script accurately reproduces the issue with `DatasetGroupBy` objects not implementing the `quantile` function as described, we will modify the script accordingly. This revised version checks for the existence of the `.quantile` method on a grouped dataset and raises an `AssertionError` if the attribute does not exist, to match your requirements:

```python
import xarray as xr
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        ds = xr.Dataset(data_vars={"a": ("x", list("abcd"))}, coords={"x": range(4)})
        # Ensure AttributeError is raised for DatasetGroupBy not implementing quantile
        assert hasattr(ds.groupby(ds.x % 2 == 0), 'quantile'), \
            "DatasetGroupBy object does not have a 'quantile' method."
        
    except AssertionError as e:
        print("Test Failed: Issue is present.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit code 0 to indicate the issue is present
    
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred, which could indicate a problem outside of the originally reported issue.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # An error code indicating unexpected failures

    # No exceptions encountered: the issue has been resolved
    print("Test Passed: Issue appears to be resolved as 'quantile' exists for DatasetGroupBy objects.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exiting with code 0 signifying no error

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script now specifically checks for the presence of the `quantile` method on a `DatasetGroupBy` object from the `xarray` library, raising an `AssertionError` if it is not present, which should capture the essence of the reported issue. When the problem is present (i.e., `quantile` method does not exist), the script ensures to exit with code 0 after printing a relevant stack trace. Conversely, if the issue is fixed (i.e., no `AssertionError` is raised because the `quantile` method exists), it still exits with code 0 but indicates through printed messages that the issue is resolved.
