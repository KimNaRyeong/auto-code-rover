        "intended_behavior": "This method should construct and return a `Piecewise` object for the `Max` function, translating a call such as `Max(a, b)` into a piecewise expression `Piecewise((a, a > b), (b, True))`. This new method allows `Max` to leverage the existing `rewrite` mechanism in SymPy to transform `Max` expressions into `Piecewise` format, thus fulfilling the requested feature without disrupting any existing functionalities."

        "method": "_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise",
        "intended_behavior": "This method is expected to convert a `Min(a, b)` call into the equivalent `Piecewise` expression `Piecewise((a, a < b), (b, True))`. By doing so, it enables `Min` expressions to be rewritten as `Piecewise` expressions, utilizing the `rewrite` method defined in the `Basic` class from which it inherits. This adds a new capability to `Min` for transforming expressions into a piecewise representation while maintaining backward compatibility and existing functionality."
