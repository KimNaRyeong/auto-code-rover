This indicates they are part of SymPy, a Python library for symbolic mathematics. They are likely to represent the maximum and minimum functions, respectively, as used in mathematical expressions.\n\n   - **Intended Behavior Related to the Issue**: The issue involves adding a method or modifying an existing one so that these functions can be rewritten as `Piecewise` expressions. Currently, there's no explicit mention of a `rewrite` method for `Piecewise` within the `Max` or `Min` class definitions. This suggests the task involves implementing such functionality.\n\n2. **The `rewrite` Method**:\n   \n   The `rewrite` method was found in several files, but most importantly, it also appears in `sympy/core/basic.py`, which suggests that this method is a core functionality of SymPy objects, providing a way to rewrite expressions in alternate forms.\n\n   - **Relationship with the Bug**: The issue at hand is a request to implement the functionality for rewriting `Max` and `Min` functions as `Piecewise` expressions. Given that `rewrite` is a core method, the solution likely involves extending or utilizing this functionality within the `Max` and `Min` classes to handle the specific case of rewriting to `Piecewise` expressions.\n\n3. **Next Steps for Addressing the Issue**:\n   \n   Given the information obtained, the next step would involve:\n   \n   - Exploring the `rewrite` method implementation details within `sympy/core/basic.py` to understand its interface and how it can be extended or specialized within the `Max` and `Min` classes.\n   - Considering the implementation of other `_eval_rewrite_as_X` methods in the `Max` and `Min` classes, which suggests a pattern where rewrite rules are implemented as separate methods. Following this pattern, we'd need to implement `_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise` methods for both `Max` and `Min`.\n\nTo gain more context on how the `rewrite` method is currently implemented and potentially how to extend it for this specific use case, additional information about the `rewrite` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` would be beneficial. Specifically, understanding the general structure and expected behavior of rewrite methods could guide the implementation for `Min` and `Max`.\n\nBased on this analysis, further action should involve:\n- Investigate the `rewrite` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` to gather insights on its design and how it can be specialized for `Max` and `Min`."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This method should enable any `Max` function call to be rewritten as a `Piecewise` expression, following the format `Piecewise((a, a>b), (b, True))` for `Max(a, b)`. This preserves the existing functionality while adding the capability to rewrite `Max` expressions in a piecewise manner.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: File: sympy/functions/elementary/miscellaneous.py, Class: Min\n    - **Intended Behavior**: Implement a new method `_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise` within the `Min` class. Similar to `Max`, this method would allow `Min` function calls to be rewritten as `Piecewise` expressions. The logical structure would be parallel to that of `Max`, ensuring `Min(a, b)` could be transformed into an appropriate `Piecewise` statement that accurately represents the `Min` functionality in a piecewise context."
