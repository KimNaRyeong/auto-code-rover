Below is a Python script named `reproducer.py`. This script is designed to reproduce the issue mentioned. It evaluates `Max(a, b).rewrite(Piecewise)` and asserts that the output matches an expected `Piecewise` expression. If the issue is present (i.e., the function does not perform as expected), the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace. Conversely, if the issue is fixed, the script will exit with code 0, indicating success.

```python
from sympy import Max, Symbol, Piecewise

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_piecewise_rewriting_of_max():
    a, b = Symbol('a'), Symbol('b')
    expected_piecewise_expression = Piecewise((a, a>b), (b, True))
    rewritten_expression = Max(a, b).rewrite(Piecewise)

    try:
        assert rewritten_expression == expected_piecewise_expression, \
            f"Rewritten expression {rewritten_expression} does not match expected {expected_piecewise_expression}"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_piecewise_rewriting_of_max()
    except AssertionError:
        # Exit with a non-zero code to indicate failure
        exit(1)
    # Exits with 0 when successful
    print("The issue is fixed.")
    exit(0)
```

This script checks if the SymPy functionality for rewriting `Max` instances to `Piecewise` expressions works as expected. If the functionality does not work correctly (i.e., the result of the `rewrite` method does not match the expected `Piecewise` expression), the script will identify that the issue is still present, providing detailed debugging information for further investigation.
