Based on your requirements for a reproducible test that prints a stack trace upon failure and exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed, here is a revised Python standalone script named `reproducer.py`. This script is designed to check whether the sum of feature importances in a `GradientBoostingRegressor` model equals 1, and if not, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints a stack trace.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn import datasets
    from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor

    # Corrected to ensure data load works across different sklearn versions.
    try:
        from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
        X, Y = load_boston(return_X_y=True)
    except ImportError:
        boston = datasets.load_boston()
        X, Y = (boston.data, boston.target)

    n_estimators = 720
    params = {'n_estimators': n_estimators, 'max_depth': 6, 'learning_rate': 0.1}
    clf = GradientBoostingRegressor(**params)
    clf.fit(X, Y)

    feature_importance_sum = np.sum(clf.feature_importances_)
    print(f"At n_estimators = {n_estimators}, feature importance sum = {feature_importance_sum:.6f}")

    try:
        assert abs(feature_importance_sum - 1.0) <= 1e-6, "Feature importance sum is not equal to 1.0"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Ensure non-zero exit if the issue is present

    # Ensure we exit with 0 when the issue is not present
    print("No issue detected.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

_Notes:_
- This script attempts to import `load_boston` in a way that is aware of potential future deprecations/removals in `sklearn`. If the direct `load_boston()` function fails (due to removal or changes in future versions of `sklearn`), it falls back to the traditional import path.
- The assertion has been adjusted to consider floating-point arithmetic by allowing a tiny margin of error (`1e-6`).
- If the environment does not exhibit the reported issue, the script exits with code 0, signaling that no problem was detected.
- When an AssertionError is raised, indicating that the feature importances' sum does not equal 1.0, the script captures and prints the stack trace for debugging purposes and exits with code 1 to reflect an error state.
