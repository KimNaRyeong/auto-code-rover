Given your request and the details provided, here's how you can create a standalone `reproducer.py` file aimed to reproduce the given issue with feature importances in Gradient Boosting models not summing up to 1. The script checks this condition and will print a detailed stack trace if an `AssertionError` is raised due to the feature importances sum deviating from 1.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn import datasets
    from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor

    # Load the dataset. 
    # Note: Future versions may deprecate or change the loading function.
    try:
        X, Y = datasets.load_boston(return_X_y=True)
    except AttributeError:
        boston = datasets.load_boston()
        X, Y = (boston.data, boston.target)

    n_estimators = 720
    params = {'n_estimators': n_estimators, 'max_depth': 6, 'learning_rate': 0.1}
    clf = GradientBoostingRegressor(**params)
    clf.fit(X, Y)

    feature_importance_sum = np.sum(clf.feature_importances_)

    try:
        # Assert that the sum of feature importances should be equal (or very close) to 1
        assert abs(feature_importance_sum - 1.0) <= 1e-6, f"Feature importance sum is not equal to 1.0, found {feature_importance_sum}"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with a non-zero code to indicate an issue

    # If the issue is fixed, the script will reach here without any assertion error.
    print("Feature importance sum correctly equals 1.0")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script attempts to systematically check for the exact issue described and should be executable in any standard Python 3 environment where `scikit-learn` and its dependencies are correctly installed. Note that the script catches the `AssertionError` when the sum of feature importances does not equate exactly to 1, proceeding to provide a detailed traceback of the error, as requested. Exit code 0 indicates the absence of the issue, aligning with your specifications.
