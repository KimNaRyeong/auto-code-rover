        "intended_behavior": "The method (or property) for `feature_importances_` must ensure that the calculation of feature importances accurately reflects the relative contribution of each feature to the model, normalized such that their sum equals 1 across the entire ensemble of trees. This involves either revising the aggregation logic to mitigate floating-point precision errors or introducing a normalization step that accurately adjusts for the total sum, especially when dealing with a large number of estimators or deep trees. The update should ensure that the method remains computationally efficient even with large ensembles and maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality."

        "method": "fit",
        "intended_behavior": "While the `fit` method itself may not directly calculate `feature_importances_`, it's crucial to ensure that during the fitting process, all components contributing to the calculation of feature importances are handling large estimator numbers and deep tree structures correctly. This includes ensuring that any data structures or algorithms used during the fit process do not introduce cumulative precision errors that could impact the feature importance calculation. Additionally, consider implementing checks or warnings when the potential for such precision errors becomes significant due to parameter choices, guiding users towards configurations less susceptible to this issue."
