        "content": "<issue>Bug in Gradient Boosting: Feature Importances do not sum to 1\n#### Description\nI found conditions when Feature Importance values do not add up to 1 in ensemble tree methods, like Gradient Boosting Trees or AdaBoost Trees.\nThis error occurs once the ensemble reaches a large number of estimators.  The exact conditions depend variously.  For example, the error shows up sooner with a smaller amount of training samples.  Or, if the depth of the tree is large.\nWhen this error appears, the predicted value seems to have converged.  But it\u2019s unclear if the error is causing the predicted value not to change with more estimators.  In fact, the feature importance sum goes lower and lower with more estimators thereafter.\nConsequently, it's questionable if the tree ensemble code is functioning as expected.\nHere's sample code to reproduce this:\n``` python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import datasets\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor\nboston = datasets.load_boston()\nX, Y = (boston.data, boston.target)\nn_estimators = 720\n# Note: From 712 onwards, the feature importance sum is less than 1\nparams = {'n_estimators': n_estimators, 'max_depth': 6, 'learning_rate': 0.1}\nclf = GradientBoostingRegressor(**params)\nclf.fit(X, Y)\nfeature_importance_sum = np.sum(clf.feature_importances_)\nprint(\"At n_estimators = %i, feature importance sum = %f\" % (n_estimators , feature_importance_sum))\n```\n_Output:_\n```\nAt n_estimators = 720, feature importance sum = 0.987500\n```\nIn fact, if we examine the tree at each staged prediction, we'll see that the feature importance goes to 0 after we hit a certain number of estimators.  (For the code above, it's 712.)\nHere's code to describe what I mean:\n``` python\nfor i, tree in enumerate(clf.estimators_):\nfeature_importance_sum = np.sum(tree[0].feature_importances_)\nprint(\"At n_estimators = %i, feature importance sum = %f\" % (i , feature_importance_sum))\n```\n_Output:_\n```\n...\nAt n_estimators = 707, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 708, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 709, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 710, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 711, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 712, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 713, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 714, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 715, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 716, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 717, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 718, feature importance sum = 0.000000\n...\n```\nI wonder if we\u2019re hitting some floating point calculation error.\nBTW, I've posted this issue on the mailing list [Link](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/scikit-learn/2016-September/000508.html).  There aren't a lot of discussion, but others seem to think there's a bug here too.\nHope we can get this fixed or clarified.\nThank you!\n-Doug\n#### Versions\nWindows-7;'Python', '2.7.9 ;'NumPy', '1.9.2';'SciPy', '0.15.1';'Scikit-Learn', '0.16.1'\n</issue>"

This entails understanding how feature importances are calculated and aggregated across trees in an ensemble, and if there's a specific reason why these importances might not sum to 1, especially with a high number of estimators or certain other conditions. \n\nGiven the description, it mentions the `GradientBoostingRegressor` class specifically, and the code examples provided deal directly with the calculation of feature importances as well as the iteration through individual trees in the ensemble. \n\nThe APIs to call for gathering more context will be:\n\n1.

        "content": "The provided result from searching for the `GradientBoostingRegressor` class gives us a starting point. The class inherits from `BaseGradientBoosting` and `RegressorMixin`, indicating that the methods responsible for calculating feature importances and fitting the model might not be directly defined within `GradientBoostingRegressor` but rather in its superclass, `BaseGradientBoosting` or even in a mixin. This would explain why the searches for `feature_importances_` and `fit` within `GradientBoostingRegressor` returned no results.\n\n### Analysis of Current Context\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The snippet defines the `GradientBoostingRegressor` class, listing its initialization parameters and showing that it supports specific loss functions. Although it doesn't directly show methods for calculating feature importances or fitting, the presence of initialization parameters for the model suggests customization of the tree building process. Parameters such as `learning_rate`, `n_estimators`, and `max_depth` are directly related to how the model trains and its capacity, which could influence how feature importances are calculated or aggregated.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Given that the bug involves the sum of feature importances not equaling 1 under specific conditions (e.g., a large number of estimators), the initialization parameters and the inherited nature of the `GradientBoostingRegressor` suggest that the issue might stem from how the ensemble is built or how feature importances are aggregated in its base classes. If the aggregation or normalization of feature importance scores is handled by a method in a superclass or if there's a floating-point precision issue influenced by the depth of the tree or the number of estimators, those could be paths to explore.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Ideally, regardless of the number of estimators or the depth of the trees, the sum of feature importances across all features should equal 1. This implies that there needs to be either a normalization step that correctly adjusts these importance scores post-training or a method of aggregation that ensures this property is maintained despite large numbers of estimators or deep trees.\n\n### Next Steps for More Context\n\nGiven this analysis, additional context is needed from the underlying methods or classes that `GradientBoostingRegressor` relies upon. Specifically, we should look into the `BaseGradientBoosting` class to understand how feature importances are calculated and the model is fitted. Also, considering that feature importances might not be a direct method but a property calculated elsewhere, we should explore relevant methods or properties in base classes or mixins. \n\nThe necessary API calls are:\n\n- `search_class(\"BaseGradientBoosting\")`: To get an overview of the base class where actual implementation details might reside.\n- `search_code(\"feature_importances_\")`: Since searching within the class directly did not yield results, searching the entire codebase might locate where this property is implemented or referenced.\n- `search_method(\"fit\")`: To find how models are trained and see if there's a connection between the fitting process and the calculation of feature importances that could affect their sum."
