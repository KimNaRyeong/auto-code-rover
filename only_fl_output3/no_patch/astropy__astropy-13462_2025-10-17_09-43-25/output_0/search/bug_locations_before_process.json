        "intended_behavior": "The method `two_sum` should reliably return the sum of two floating-point numbers (a, b) in a manner that is not sensitive to the order of the operands, ensuring numerical stability even for very large or very small values. This means, for any inputs `a` and `b`, `two_sum(a, b)` should produce the same numerical result as `two_sum(b, a)`, within the floating-point precision limits. To resolve the issue, the implementation might need to be reviewed to ensure it correctly handles edge cases that could lead to a `nan` output or significant error discrepancies when the operands are swapped. This may involve refining the calculation of `ea` and `eb` to better capture and compensate for floating-point arithmetic errors."
