        "intended_behavior": "Currently, this method determines the formatter based on whether the `format` argument is a string, using `ticker.FormatStrFormatter` for strings. To resolve the issue, this decision-making process should be enhanced or modified to support new-style format strings (`.format()` or f-strings). The `__init__` method should either directly support new style formats or leverage a mechanism that can dynamically determine and apply the appropriate formatting strategy, preserving the ability to use a callable directly as the formatter, which aligns with the existing enhanced flexibility mentioned in the issue."

        "intended_behavior": "This method should continue to function as it does by passing the colorbar's formatter to the long axis. However, ensuring that the formatter which is passed is compatible with or capable of new-style formatting is essential. Since this method itself might not need direct modification, ensuring that the formatter set during the `__init__` or potentially revised formatting mechanisms can seamlessly interact with existing `update_ticks` logic is necessary. Essentially, the handling and application of the formatter must be consistent with new-style formatting expectations without disrupting the current functionality."
