Right now one can pass a callable directly (although that's not documented), and the default behaviour from #16715 is triggered. However, I guess making this change for format strings would imply a deprecation cycle, as it breaks current behaviour. Another option would be to check in `Axis._set_formatter`  for what kind of string format we've been passed (unsure how, although there must be way).\n### Additional context and prior art\n_No response_\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### Code Snippet from `colorbar.py` around line 489\n\nThe provided code snippet within the `__init__` function of the `Colorbar` class checks if the `format` parameter is a string. If so, it uses the `ticker.FormatStrFormatter` to handle the format, otherwise, it assumes the format is a Formatter object or `None`. This is indicative of the old style formatting mentioned in the issue - reliance on `ticker.FormatStrFormatter` which uses Python's older `%`-format strings.\n\n1. **Functionality**: This part of the code is responsible for setting the formatting of tick labels on the colorbar. It decides between using a predefined string format or a Formatter object based on the type of the `format` argument passed to the Colorbar's initializer.\n2. **Relation to the issue**: The issue suggests moving away from this old style string formatting (presumably '%'-style) to newer style formatting (`.format()` method or f-strings). The presence of `ticker.FormatStrFormatter` suggests the use of the old style.\n3. **Intended Behavior Post-Issue Resolution**: Following the resolution of the issue, the colorbar should ideally handle format strings in a manner consistent with the new style introduced in #16715, likely requiring its default formatter to accommodate or seamlessly integrate with the newer formatting styles, without explicitly relying on `ticker.FormatStrFormatter` for string types.\n\n#### Code Snippet from `update_ticks` method in `colorbar.py`\n\nThe `update_ticks` method sets up ticks and tick labels using the colorbar's locator and formatter. It specifically assigns the formatter to the colorbar's long axis.\n\n1. **Functionality**: This method ensures the colorbar's ticks are updated with the correct locator and formatter. It is crucial for maintaining the appearance and correctness of tick labels on the colorbar.\n2. **Relation to the issue**: Since the issue discusses passing the colorbar's formatter to the long axis, the mention of `self._long_axis().set_major_formatter(self.formatter)` in this method is directly relevant. The existing mechanism here is in line with what the issue suggests should be preserved or modified to support new-style format strings.\n3. **Intended Behavior Post-Issue Resolution**: The method should continue passing the formatter to the long axis, but the mechanism for defining and using this formatter may need to encompass new-style formatting capabilities. The change might involve ensuring the formatter object is capable of understanding and applying these new style formats, depending on how the underlying `Axis` class handles its `_set_formatter` logic (which, as noted, couldn't be found in the current context).\n\n#### Failed to Find `Axis._set_formatter`\n\nDespite the search for `Axis._set_formatter` yielding no results, it's central to understanding how the `Axis` class manages formatter setting and consequently how changes could affect or improve colorbar formatting consistency with the rest of the matplotlib library.\n\nGiven the absence of direct information about `Axis._set_formatter`, it might be necessary to:\n\n- **Explore Alternate Strategies**: Reviewing the documentation or source code directly for `Axis` and any formatter functionality it uses could provide insights. Understanding the `Axis` implementation and its formatter handling behavior would offer clarity on how to integrate new-style formatters or how the `Axis` class discriminates between formatter types.\n- **Further Investigation Needed**: Since the direct search for `Axis._set_formatter` was unfruitful, exploring related methods in `Axis` class, or how formatter objects are generally handled across `matplotlib`, could provide alternative paths to implementing the desired enhancement.\n\nThe investigation points towards the need for a nuanced approach to formatter functionality, ensuring consistent and modern formatting capabilities across different aspects of the `matplotlib` library, specifically within the colorbar component and its interaction with the `Axis` class's formatting behaviors."

To resolve the issue, this decision-making process should be enhanced or modified to support new-style format strings (`.format()` or f-strings). The `__init__` method should either directly support new style formats or leverage a mechanism that can dynamically determine and apply the appropriate formatting strategy, preserving the ability to use a callable directly as the formatter, which aligns with the existing enhanced flexibility mentioned in the issue.\n\n- **Location 2**: \n  - **File**: `lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py`\n  - **Class**: `Colorbar`\n  - **Method**: `update_ticks`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: This method should continue to function as it does by passing the colorbar's formatter to the long axis. However, ensuring that the formatter which is passed is compatible with or capable of new-style formatting is essential. Since this method itself might not need direct modification, ensuring that the formatter set during the `__init__` or potentially revised formatting mechanisms can seamlessly interact with existing `update_ticks` logic is necessary. Essentially, the handling and application of the formatter must be consistent with new-style formatting expectations without disrupting the current functionality.\n\nThe resolution strategy involves ensuring backwards compatibility while enabling the use of new-style format strings, which might include defining a new formatter class or adapting existing ones to intelligently handle both old and new format strings, depending on the underlying capabilities and design choices of the matplotlib project. This preserves the existing functionality of allowing callable objects as formatters, while addressing the need for modernization and consistency in formatting conventions across the library."
