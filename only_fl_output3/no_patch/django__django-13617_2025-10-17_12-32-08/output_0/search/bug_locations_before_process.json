        "intended_behavior": "Implement or modify logic to accurately group by annotations involving subqueries without redundantly evaluating the subquery within the `GROUP BY` clause. Ensure that `GROUP BY` recognizes and appropriately handles annotations by making use of aliases for subqueries when available, avoiding the direct inclusion of subquery expressions in the `GROUP BY` clause. This behavior is crucial for preserving performance and ensuring accurate query results. The specific reference to the handling within the `group_by` logic suggests a need to enhance the handling of `Ref` objects and annotation names in constructing the `GROUP BY` clause. The annotations identified by `Ref` objects should be seamlessly integrated into the `GROUP BY` without necessitating a reevaluation of the subqueries they encompass."

        "intended_behavior": "Enhance the `resolve_expression` method or related mechanisms within the `Ref` class to ensure that references to annotated fields, especially those involving subqueries, are correctly resolved when building the `GROUP BY` clause. The method should account for the context in which a `Ref` object is being resolved, particularly ensuring that when used within a `GROUP BY` context, it does not lead to the reevaluation of its corresponding subquery but instead leverages any available alias. This adjustment ensures efficiency and accuracy in the generated SQL queries, addressing the performance concerns raised in the bug report."
