        "content": "<issue>[Napoleon] Retrieve type of attributes from type hints when using google-style\nFollowing [google style guide for classes](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#384-classes), I added an `Attributes:` section my classes docstring. As I have [PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/) annotations (because I use `attrs`), I did not add types in the docstring., as per the style guide.\nWhen generating the documentation with `.. automodule::` from `autodoc`, with `napoleon`, the attributes are not typed. I tried using the `:undoc-members:` flag of `automodule`, but this resulted in duplicated attributes: one with the explanation, the other with the type-hint.\nWhile it is possible to not use type hints with `attrs` and replace `attr.s(auto_attribs=True)` by `attr.ib()`, this is not an option for e.g. [`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html). I also tried `napoleon_use_ivar=True`, which silenced sphinx's warnings but still resulted in two definition of the attribute in the documentation.\nIt would be nice if `napoleon` (or `autodoc`) extracted the type hint of the class, or merged the attributes when using `:undoc-members:`. That would avoid duplicated types definitions in either the code or the doc. Currently, either the code has an annotation and a type in the docstring, or the generated documentation has two entry for each attribute.\nThis might be related to #7582  and #4074 .\n**Additional info**\n- sphinx version `3.2.1`\n- [`conf.py`](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/docs/conf.py)\n- [code being autodocumented](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/src/pheres/exceptions.py)\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n1. **Sphinx Extensions Configuration**: The `conf.py` file lists several Sphinx extensions, including `sphinx.ext.autodoc`, which is relevant to the issue. The `autodoc` extension is used for pulling in documentation from docstrings, and this directly relates to the problem description where `napoleon` is failing to merge attribute descriptions with type annotations from the source code. However, the `sphinx.ext.napoleon` extension, crucial for interpreting Google-style docstrings, is not explicitly listed here. It is worth noting that it might be included implicitly or the configuration segment provided does not cover its inclusion. This discrepancy could influence how type hints and docstrings are interpreted and merged in the documentation.\n\n2. **Napoleon Use Ivar Setting**: The `napoleon_use_ivar` setting was not found in the `conf.py` snippet provided. This setting influences how instance variables (ivars) are documented, potentially addressing the issue of duplicated attribute documentation by merging the type hint and the attribute description into one. The absence of this setting in the provided configuration snippet suggests it might not have been explored as a solution or was not deemed relevant but contradicts the issue description. This discrepancy needs clarification, as adjusting or adding this setting could be part of the solution.\n\n3. **PheresBaseException Class**: The failure to locate the `PheresBaseException` class in `exceptions.py` hinders directly examining the specific use case described. This class likely serves as a concrete example where the documentation generation issue is evident. Inspection of such a class would offer insights into how attributes are declared, annotated, and described within its docstrings\u2014a critical context for diagnosing the documentation issue as described.\n\nGiven these analyses, the intended behavior of the code involved should be the proper merging or alignment of attribute descriptions from docstrings with their type annotations in the generated documentation, avoiding duplication while preserving detailed documentation. To further address the gaps:\n\n- Since `sphinx.ext.napoleon` was not directly confirmed in the provided `extensions` list, clarifying its inclusion and configuration within `conf.py` could be valuable.\n- Exploring the configuration around `napoleon_use_ivar`, given its potential relevance, could offer a path to resolving the issue.\n- Given the failure to locate `exceptions.py`, seeking any file that might demonstrate the issue\u2014such as a different class or module where type hints and docstrings are both used\u2014would be beneficial.\n\nConsidering the next steps, it could be helpful to make additional API calls targeting these areas, for example:\n\n- `search_code(\"sphinx.ext.napoleon\", \"conf.py\")` to verify the inclusion and setup of the Napoleon extension.\n- An alternative approach to locate the problematic class or another representative sample could involve searching for attributes or classes known to be part of the affected documentation space, though specific queries would depend on additional knowledge of the codebase's structure."

This is crucial to ensure that Napoleon correctly interprets Google-style docstrings and merges attribute descriptions with type hints. The intended behavior is to adjust the Sphinx configuration, either by ensuring `sphinx.ext.napoleon` is enabled (if it's not already) and possibly leveraging the `napoleon_use_ivar` setting to instruct Napoleon to properly merge attribute documentation with type hints, thus avoiding any duplication and preserving the benefits of type annotations in the documentation. This adjustment aims to address the issue of duplicated attributes in auto-generated documentation when using docstrings alongside PEP 526 type annotations.\n   \n   Since the actual faulty behavior is more conceptual and configuration-based rather than a distinct code bug, the prescribed solution involves configuration adjustments rather than code changes to specific classes/methods. Given the issue described, resolving it revolves around modifying project documentation configuration settings rather than altering functional software code.\n"
