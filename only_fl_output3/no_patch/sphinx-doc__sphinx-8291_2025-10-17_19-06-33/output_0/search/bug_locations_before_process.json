        "intended_behavior": "The intended fix is to modify the `conf.py` file by explicitly including the `sphinx.ext.napoleon` extension within the `extensions` list. Adding `sphinx.ext.napoleon` will enable the Napoleon Sphinx extension which is essential for correctly processing Google style docstrings and integrating them with PEP 526 type annotations. In addition, the configuration should explore and if necessary, enable the `napoleon_use_ivar` setting to true (`napoleon_use_ivar = True`). This will ensure that instance variables are documented according to their type hints, potentially resolving the issue of duplicated attribute documentation. By making these adjustments, the Sphinx documentation build process should ideally combine the type hints and attribute descriptions into a single, unified documentation entry for each attribute, adhering to the project's documentation standards while eliminating the redundancy and inconsistency currently observed."
