        "content": "To gather the sufficient code context needed to address the issue described, let's plan out which parts of the codebase we need to inspect and then proceed with the appropriate API calls. \n\nFrom the description, it seems like the issue is related to the Django development server (`runserver`) not closing connections properly when it's running without threading (`--nothreading`). The problem seems to be associated with the handling of `keep-alive` HTTP connections. Therefore, key areas to investigate include:\n\n1. The `runserver` command itself to check how it's initialized and how it handles the `--nothreading` option.\n2. The Django WSGI server implementation, as it's directly involved in managing the requests and connections.\n3. The handling of `keep-alive` connections, particularly how and when connections are closed.\n\nGiven this, here are the searches we should conduct:\n\n- Since `runserver` is a Django command, it might be part of a class that extends Django's `BaseCommand`. Thus, searching for the `runserver` command implementation might be a good start.\n- The WSGI server in Django is another critical component. It's where the details of request handling, threading, and connection management are implemented. We need to find which class(es) are responsible for this.\n- Lastly, we need to find where and how `keep-alive` connections are managed, especially in the context of threading or non-threading mode. This might not be directly referenced as \"keep-alive\" in the code, but could be related to connection handling or socket management.\n\nBased on these considerations, let's invoke some specific search API calls:\n\n1. Search for the \"runserver\" command within Django's command classes.\n2. Search for classes or methods that might represent the WSGI server or are related to the handling of HTTP connections in Django.\n3. Look for any explicit mentions of \"Connection: keep-alive\" or socket handling with `\"--nothreading\"` option.\n\nTherefore, the API calls we should start with are:\n\n- `search_method(\"handle\")` - Assuming `handle` might be part of how commands are processed, such as the `runserver` command.\n- `search_class(\"WSGIHandler\")` - To get information on the WSGI handler which might be managing connections.\n- `search_code(\"Connection: keep-alive\")` - To find direct references to how `keep-alive` connections are handled.\n- `search_code(\"--nothreading\")` - To find any code that specifically manages or checks for the `--nothreading` option.\n\nThese calls should give us a better understanding of how the `runserver` command works, especially in non-threaded mode, and how connections are managed in detail. This context will be essential for pinpointing the code locations that need to be patched to resolve the issue."
