        "intended_behavior": "The `as_relational` method should be modified to accurately represent the range when the step size is not 1. This involves adding an additional condition to the method's return value that checks if the value of `x` fits in the sequence generated by the range, considering both the start and the step. This means the method needs to include a modulus condition in the logical expression it returns, making sure that `x` starts from the same modulus as the Range\u2019s start relative to the step. Specifically, the method should return a logical expression that includes `& Eq(Mod(x, self.step), self.start % self.step)` when the range's step is not 1. This condition ensures that `x` aligns with the range's step and start values, accurately reflecting ranges with steps other than 1 while preserving the existing functionality for ranges with a step of 1."
