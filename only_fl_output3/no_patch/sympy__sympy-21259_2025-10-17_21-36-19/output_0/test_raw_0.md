Here's a Python script named `reproducer.py` that you can use to reproduce the issue. This script utilizes the `sympy` library to create a `Range` object, then attempts to convert it to a relational form, verifying whether it matches the expected output that accounts for all conditions described in the issue. If the output does not match the expected conditions (which includes checking the modulus of `x` with respect to the step size), it raises an `AssertionError`.

```python
import sympy
from sympy import symbols, Range, Eq, Mod, floor

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_as_relational():
    x = symbols('x')
    range_obj = Range(3, 11, 2)
    expected_relational = (x >= 3) & (x <= 9) & Eq(x, floor(x)) & Eq(Mod(x, 2), 1)
    calculated_relational = range_obj.as_relational(x)
    # The assertion checks if the condition accurately represents the range steps and start value
    assert calculated_relational == expected_relational, "The generated relational representation is incorrect."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        check_as_relational()
        print("No issues found. The issue is likely fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with nonzero code to indicate failure/assertion error status
    except Exception as e:  # Catching any other unexpected errors
        print_stacktrace(e)
```

This script expressly checks the issue where `Range` objects should be correctly represented as relational expressions. When executed, if the condition in `check_as_relational` function is not met, it means the representation is incorrect according to the specified issue, prompting an `AssertionError` and printing the relevant stack trace. When the representation matches the expected condition (i.e., includes the modulus check), it indicates that the original issue has been fixed, and the script will complete successfully with a message and exit with code 0.
