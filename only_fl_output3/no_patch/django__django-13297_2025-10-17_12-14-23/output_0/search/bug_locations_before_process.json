        "intended_behavior": "The `get_context_data` method should ensure that any `kwargs` passed to it, particularly those intended to be used in database queries (e.g., `offer_slug`), are explicitly cast to the correct data type before being used. Since the issue arises from a `SimpleLazyObject` causing type errors when used in database operations, the method should either eagerly evaluate such objects or convert them using a suitable method (e.g., calling `str()` on `offer_slug`). This approach should maintain existing functionality by allowing `offer_slug` to be correctly utilized in querying the database without raising type-related errors. The addition of explicit type casting or evaluation ensures compatibility with the underpinning database operations, effectively resolving the issue encountered after the Django 3.1 update."
