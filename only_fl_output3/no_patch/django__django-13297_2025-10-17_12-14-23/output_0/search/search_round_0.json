        "content": "To effectively understand and resolve the issue described, we need to gather specific information about the implementation details of the affected classes and methods within the project. Based on the information provided in the issue description, the following API calls will be essential for assembling the necessary code context:\n\n1. **Search for the `TemplateView` and `Account` classes** to understand the inheritance and any overridden methods that may be relevant to the issue. Given that `TemplateView` is likely part of Django's generic views, we're more interested in its usage within the project. As for the `Account` model, understanding its schema and any custom methods is crucial for dealing with the slug filtering correctly.\n   \n   - `search_class(\"TemplateView\")`\n   - `search_class(\"Account\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `OfferView` class** to examine how it's currently implemented and to identify any potential areas that may contribute to the issue aside from the `get_context_data` method.\n\n   - `search_class(\"OfferView\")`\n\n3. **Search for usages of `get_context_data` method** across the project. This can help in identifying if the issue described is localized to the `OfferView` or if it's a more widespread issue affecting other views as well.\n\n   - `search_method(\"get_context_data\")`\n\n4. **Search for the `get_object_or_404` method usage** to ensure we're not missing any custom implementations or wrappers around this method that might be relevant to the issue at hand.\n\n   - `search_method(\"get_object_or_404\")`\n\nBy executing these API calls, we aim to gather a comprehensive understanding of how the `OfferView` class interacts with both the `TemplateView` and `Account` models, the specifics of the `get_context_data` method's usage in the project, as well as any potential peculiarities in the usage of `get_object_or_404`. This information will be pivotal in crafting an effective patch for the described issue."
