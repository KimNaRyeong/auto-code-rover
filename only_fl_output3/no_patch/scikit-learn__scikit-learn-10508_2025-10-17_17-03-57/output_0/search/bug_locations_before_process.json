        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue with transforming empty lists, particularly after fitting the `LabelEncoder` with string labels, the `transform` method needs a modification. The adjustment should ensure the method returns an empty array immediately upon receiving an empty list as input, bypassing the rest of the method's logic which involves type casting that leads to the observed error. This change preserves the existing functionality when operating on non-empty lists or arrays, maintaining backward compatibility while ensuring the method's robustness across input types. The introduction of an early return for empty inputs would look like the following pseudo-code implemented at the beginning of the `transform` method. This change ensures that when `transform` is called with an empty list or array, it seamlessly returns an empty array of the same data type as the `classes_` attribute of the `LabelEncoder` instance. This approach avoids the type casting error and aligns with the expected behavior for handling empty input lists across different data types."
