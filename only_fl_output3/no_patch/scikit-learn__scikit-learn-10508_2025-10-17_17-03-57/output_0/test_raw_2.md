Given your updated request, here is an adjusted standalone Python script `reproducer.py` that is designed to reproduce the specific issue with `LabelEncoder` transforming empty lists for different datatype inputs. This script raises an `AssertionError` if the issue occurs and prints a clear stack trace of the issue. When the issue is resolved, it exits with code 0. Please use this script in the root directory of your project and execute it as specified.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_label_encoder_empty_transform():
    from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
    le = LabelEncoder()
    
    # Fit with integers
    le.fit([1, 2])
    try:
        result = le.transform([])
        assert len(result) == 0, "Expected empty array when transforming empty list after fitting with integers."
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error when transforming empty list after fitting with integers:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Transformation with integer fitting failed.")

    # Reset and test with strings
    le.fit(["a", "b"])
    try:
        result = le.transform([])
        # If it reaches this point without error, it's considered successfully handling empty lists
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error when transforming empty list after fitting with strings:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Transformation with string fitting failed.")

def main():
    try:
        test_label_encoder_empty_transform()
        print("No issue detected.")
    except AssertionError:
        # If an assertion is raised, it means we've detected the issue.
        exit(1)  # Exit with error

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

When running this file, ensure you have the specified versions of Python and scikit-learn as per the described environment: Python 3.6.3 and scikit_learn 0.19.1. This script is designed to closely mirror the behavior described in the issue, checking both numeric and string cases to validate the expected functionality of the `LabelEncoder.transform` method with empty lists.
