        "content": "To address the issue described, where logging output needs to include the database alias, especially pertinent when working with database routing, we would look towards the logging functionality within Django's database backend. This could be implemented or affected in several places, including where database connections are handled, where queries are executed, and where logging is configured.\n\nBased on this, here are the API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the class responsible for handling database backend connections in Django. This could involve classes like `BaseDatabaseWrapper` which might be in a file associated with database backends.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"BaseDatabaseWrapper\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since logging configuration and execution could be part of the Django database operations, it's essential to find where Django configures its logging for database operations. This would likely be in a method that deals with executing queries or logging in the database backend.\n   ```\n   search_method(\"log\")\n   search_method(\"execute\")\n   ```\n\n3. To get more specific regarding where the database alias might be included or could be included in the logging output, it would be useful to look into how Django currently logs database operations. Identifying a method or code snippet that performs the logging would provide a clear starting point for modifying the logging to include the database alias.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"logger.info\")\n   search_code(\"logger.debug\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches aim to provide a comprehensive context surrounding database logging and execution within Django, focusing on where the database alias can be incorporated into the logs to address the issue described."
