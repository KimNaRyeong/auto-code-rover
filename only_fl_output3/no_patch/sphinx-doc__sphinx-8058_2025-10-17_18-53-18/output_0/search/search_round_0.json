        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue on allowing more compaction in gettext builder for the Sphinx project, specifically for the use case described by the OKFN people, we need to focus on how the gettext builder operates within Sphinx. Since the issue mentions `gettext_compact` as a feature or functionality that needs enhancement, we should start by searching for methods related to this. Additionally, analyzing how message catalogs are currently handled would be essential. So, let's begin by looking for any classes or methods related to gettext compilation or compaction within the Sphinx project.\n\n1. Search for the method or functionality named `gettext_compact` in the entire codebase to understand its current implementation and where it's used.\n2. Search for classes or methods that handle the compilation or merging of message catalogs. Since the specific class or method names are not provided in the issue, we will search for keywords related to the functionality, such as \"gettext builder\" or \"message catalog\".\n\nBased on these requirements, the API calls can be:\n\n- search_method(\"gettext_compact\")\n- search_class(\"GettextBuilder\")\n- search_method(\"merge_catalogs\")"
