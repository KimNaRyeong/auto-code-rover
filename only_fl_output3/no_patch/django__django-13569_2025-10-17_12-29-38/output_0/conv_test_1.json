The aggregation with Count produces a GROUP BY clause on related.id.\n>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('rc').values('id', 'rc')\n<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 2}]>\nThis also works as expected (at least to me). Although there is an aggregation, ordering by related means that the grouping will be broken down.\n>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('related').values('id', 'rc')\n<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 1}, {'id': 1, 'rc': 1}]>\nBut the following seems wrong to me.\n>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc')\n<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 1}, {'id': 1, 'rc': 1}]>\nThe random function call has nothing to do with the aggregation, and I see no reason it should break it. Dumping the query seems that indeed the random call breaks the group by call: (I simpilfied the table names a little)\n>>> print(Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc').query)\nSELECT \"thing\".\"id\", COUNT(\"related\".\"id\") AS \"rc\" FROM \"thing\" LEFT OUTER JOIN \"related\" ON (\"thing\".\"id\" = \"related\".\"thing_id\") GROUP BY \"thing\".\"id\", RANDOM() ORDER BY RANDOM() ASC\nI dug into the SQL compiler, and it seems to me the problem is inside django.db.models.sql.compiler.get_group_by, where the compiler combines all non-aggregate, non-ref order_by expressions into group_by. I patched it like this\nfor expr, (sql, params, is_ref) in order_by:\n\tif expr.contains_aggregate:\n\t\tcontinue\n\tif is_ref:\n\t\tcontinue\n\texpressions.extend([\n\t\texp for exp in expr.get_source_expressions()\n\t\tif not isinstance(exp, Random)\n\t])\nand things seem to work correctly. No failed tests against SQLite3 with default settings.\n"

If the issue exists (i.e., the aggregation is indeed broken by `order_by('?')`), it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace indicating where the issue occurred. \n\nEnsure Django's settings are properly configured for your environment. This includes setting up a database backend that is supported and accessible from your execution context. Remember, altering database connections or data within a live or production database for testing purposes is not recommended; always use development or testing databases to avoid unintended data loss or corruption."
