Below is a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the reported issue related to the Django ORM. This script tests the behavior of `order_by('?')` in a Django project context, specifically when used in conjunction with queryset aggregation. It raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, indicating the random ordering breaks the expected aggregation behavior. 

Ensure you have Django installed in your environment and your project is properly set up to use Django ORM. Modify the `DATABASES` setting in your project's `settings.py` to use the correct database backend and credentials as needed for testing.

```python
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Count


def setup_django_environment():
    settings.configure(
        INSTALLED_APPS=(
            'reproducer',  # Registering this script as an app for Django to recognize the models
        ),
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': 'db.sqlite3',
            }
        },
        USE_TZ=True,
    )
    django.setup()


class Thing(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        app_label = 'reproducer'


class Related(models.Model):
    thing = models.ForeignKey(Thing, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='related')

    class Meta:
        app_label = 'reproducer'


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def check_issue():
    # Setting up Django environment
    setup_django_environment()

    # Make migrations and migrate models (Note: Normally, use Django management commands instead)
    from django.core.management import call_command
    call_command('migrate', verbosity=0)

    # Creating test data
    t = Thing.objects.create()
    _ = [Related.objects.create(thing=t) for _ in range(2)]

    try:
        # Case where the issue is present
        result = list(Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc'))
        assert len(result) == 1 and result[0]['rc'] == 2, "Aggregation is broken by order_by('?')"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e


if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        check_issue()
        print("The issue is fixed, no assertion error raised.")
    except AssertionError:
        import sys
        sys.exit(1)
```

When you run this script (`python3 reproducer.py`), it will attempt to reproduce the described issue by performing ORM operations that simulate the reported case. If the issue exists (i.e., the aggregation is indeed broken by `order_by('?')`), it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace indicating where the issue occurred. 

Ensure Django's settings are properly configured for your environment. This includes setting up a database backend that is supported and accessible from your execution context. Remember, altering database connections or data within a live or production database for testing purposes is not recommended; always use development or testing databases to avoid unintended data loss or corruption.
