        "intended_behavior": "The goal is to prevent `Random()` from influencing the construction of the `GROUP BY` clause in queries that use `.annotate()` with random ordering (`order_by('?')`). This means adjusting the `get_group_by` method to specifically check for `Random` expressions when assembling expressions for the `GROUP BY` clause. Exclude `Random` from contributing to the `GROUP BY` expressions added due to `order_by('?')`. Retain any other logic for handling the diversity of `order_by` expressions that ought to influence `GROUP BY` due to legitimate relationships to the aggregate or group by fields. Ensure that `Random` orderings can still be used for their intended purpose of randomizing result order without unintended side effects on query semantics, particularly aggregation semantics."
