The aggregation with Count produces a GROUP BY clause on related.id.\n>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('rc').values('id', 'rc')\n<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 2}]>\nThis also works as expected (at least to me). Although there is an aggregation, ordering by related means that the grouping will be broken down.\n>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('related').values('id', 'rc')\n<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 1}, {'id': 1, 'rc': 1}]>\nBut the following seems wrong to me.\n>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc')\n<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 1}, {'id': 1, 'rc': 1}]>\nThe random function call has nothing to do with the aggregation, and I see no reason it should break it. Dumping the query seems that indeed the random call breaks the group by call: (I simpilfied the table names a little)\n>>> print(Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc').query)\nSELECT \"thing\".\"id\", COUNT(\"related\".\"id\") AS \"rc\" FROM \"thing\" LEFT OUTER JOIN \"related\" ON (\"thing\".\"id\" = \"related\".\"thing_id\") GROUP BY \"thing\".\"id\", RANDOM() ORDER BY RANDOM() ASC\nI dug into the SQL compiler, and it seems to me the problem is inside django.db.models.sql.compiler.get_group_by, where the compiler combines all non-aggregate, non-ref order_by expressions into group_by. I patched it like this\nfor expr, (sql, params, is_ref) in order_by:\nif expr.contains_aggregate:\ncontinue\nif is_ref:\ncontinue\nexpressions.extend([\nexp for exp in expr.get_source_expressions()\nif not isinstance(exp, Random)\n])\nand things seem to work correctly. No failed tests against SQLite3 with default settings.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insight into the nature of the issue with `order_by('?')` breaking queryset aggregation in Django and how it relates to the behavior defined in the source code.\n\n### 1. Analysis of `SQLCompiler` class\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `SQLCompiler` class in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` is responsible for translating Django ORM query expressions into SQL queries. This includes assembling the SELECT statement, handling JOIN operations, and determining the GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses among other things.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nThe `get_group_by` method within this class is directly related to the bug. This method generates the GROUP BY clause of the SQL query. From the issue description, the unexpected behavior occurs when `order_by('?')` (a random ordering) is used; this seems to impact how the GROUP BY clause is constructed, particularly in the presence of aggregation operators like `Count()`.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nIdeally, the addition of a random ordering (`order_by('?')`) should not affect the outcome of an aggregation, such as counting related models. The intended behavior would ensure that the GROUP BY clause correctly groups the relevant fields\u2014irrespective of the ordering applied\u2014such that the aggregation reflects the actual data relationships without duplication or incorrect breakdowns.\n\n### 2. Analysis of `get_group_by` method in `SQLCompiler`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThis method constructs the GROUP BY clause, considering various factors from the query, such as fields specified in `.values()`, `.annotate()`, and `.order_by()` methods. It's designed to handle a wide array of complex cases, adapting the GROUP BY clause based on the query's construction to ensure accurate results.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nGiven the bug description, it's clear that the method fails to handle a random ordering scenario properly with aggregation. The `order_by('?')` seems to incorrectly influence the grouping logic, leading to an unexpected alteration in the aggregation result (splitting aggregated counts).\n\n#### Intended behavior\nThe function should discern between orderings that affect grouping (like fields) and those that should not (like random). It implies that the presence of `Random` in ordering should not introduce additional, unintended columns into the GROUP BY clause which could distort the aggregate calculations.\n\n### 3. Analysis of `Random` usage in the codebase\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nOccurrences of `Random` in the codebase, notably within `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` and `django/db/models/functions/__init__.py`, define or reference the random ordering functionality. `Random` is a function used to introduce randomness into query results.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\nBased on the issue, the use of `Random()` in an order by expression improperly influences the aggregation process due to its inclusion in the GROUP BY clause, as seen in the SQL output from the issue description.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nThe correct handling of `Random` should ensure it does not lead to an unintended GROUP BY behavior. Specifically, when used in `order_by`, `Random` should not alter the logic of aggregation\u2014meaning it should not add itself to the GROUP BY clause, leading to incorrect aggregate results.\n\n### Next Steps in Analysis\nGiven this analysis, the next steps might involve examining more closely the internal logic that adds expressions to the `GROUP BY` clause within `get_group_by`. Specifically, how order by expressions, particularly `Random`, are treated in contributing to the `GROUP BY` logic. Adjusting this handling could resolve the described issue, ensuring that random ordering does not break queryset aggregations."

        "content": "### 1. Do we need more context?\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided information, additional context is not necessary for identifying the bug location and suggesting a fix. The descriptions and code snippets provided give enough insight into how the `get_group_by` method works and how it interacts with random orderings like `Random()`. The behavior of the system in response to such orderings, especially in aggregation contexts, is clear from the described issue and the analyzed method's logic.\n\n### 2. Where are bug locations?\n\n#### Bug Location 1:\n- **File:** `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`\n- **Class:** `SQLCompiler`\n- **Method:** `get_group_by`\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\nThe goal is to prevent `Random()` from influencing the construction of the `GROUP BY` clause in queries that use `.annotate()` with random ordering (`order_by('?')`). This means adjusting the `get_group_by` method to specifically check for `Random` expressions when assembling expressions for the `GROUP BY` clause. \n\nTo address this issue without disrupting existing functionality, the method should be enhanced to:\n\n- Exclude `Random` from contributing to the `GROUP BY` expressions added due to `order_by('?')`.\n- Retain any other logic for handling the diversity of `order_by` expressions that ought to influence `GROUP BY` due to legitimate relationships to the aggregate or group by fields.\n- Ensure that `Random` orderings can still be used for their intended purpose of randomizing result order without unintended side effects on query semantics, particularly aggregation semantics.\n\nSpecifically, the patch mentioned in the issue could serve as a basis for the intended behavior. This involves filtering out the `Random` expression from those collected for `GROUP BY` when it comes solely from `order_by('?')`, ensuring that it doesn't inadvertently break the aggregation grouping logic. Thus, for any expression considered in `order_by`, if it's identified as a `Random` instance, it should not lead to adding anything to the GROUP BY clause that would otherwise not be there, carefully preserving the intended data aggregation behavior.\n\nIn essence, you safeguard the aggregate counts or other similar operations from being influenced by an unrelated ordering directive, particularly one that is intended solely to randomize output order, not to semantically alter the dataset's groupings or how it is aggregated."
