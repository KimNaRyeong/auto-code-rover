Given the feedback and the need to ensure proper Django setup, let's modify the approach to include a correct setup of the Django environment within the script. Please ensure that Django is installed in your Python environment. Here is an updated standalone `reproducer.py` script. This version makes sure that Django models and settings are configured correctly before executing any ORM operations. 

```python
import os
import sys
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Count

# Configure Django settings
def setup_django_environment():
    settings.configure(
        INSTALLED_APPS=['__main__'],  # Register this script as an app
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': ':memory:',  # Using in-memory database for simplicity
            }
        },
        USE_TZ=True,
    )
    django.setup()

setup_django_environment()

# Definition of the Django models inline
class Thing(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'


class Related(models.Model):
    thing = models.ForeignKey(Thing, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='related')
    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'

# Function to print the stack trace
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Check if the issue is reproducible
def check_issue():
    # Create tables for our models
    from django.core.management import call_command
    call_command('migrate', verbosity=0)

    # Creating test data
    t = Thing.objects.create()
    [Related.objects.create(thing=t) for _ in range(2)]

    # Main test logic to reproduce the reported issue
    try:
        result_query = Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc')
        result_list = list(result_query)
        # The expected result is one entry with a count of 2, not multiple entries with a count of 1.
        assert len(result_list) == 1 and result_list[0]['rc'] == 2, "Random ordering broke aggregation"
        print("No AssertionError raised. The issue seems to be fixed.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise  # Reraise the assertion error to indicate the issue is present

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        check_issue()
        sys.exit(0)
    except AssertionError:
        sys.exit(1)
```

This script initializes a minimal Django environment with an in-memory SQLite database to avoid any external dependencies or configurations. It defines two simple models, `Thing` and `Related`, to mimic the structure described in your issue representation, and then performs the ORM operations which were problematic according to your description.

When you execute this script (`python3 reproducer.py`), it will attempt to reproduce the issue. If the issue still exists as described, the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace, exiting with code 1. If the problem has been fixed and the assertion passes, it will exit with code 0 indicating success. 

Make sure to run this script in an environment where Django is installed, and no other Django project settings are being inadvertently used.
