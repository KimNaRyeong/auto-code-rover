That would prevent having do to the manual and error prone options['skip_checks'] dance. In all cases that should be done in a different PR.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about the `Command` class, and specifically, look into where `requires_system_checks` is currently being used and understand the existing implementations to see how to best introduce `required_system_checks = '__all__'` or similar. Based on the description provided in the issue, here are the API calls that would help gather the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for the `Command` class in the codebase**: To get an overview of where the `Command` class is defined and how it is structured, which could give us insights into where `requires_system_checks` is currently implemented.\n   \n   `search_class(\"Command\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `requires_system_checks` attribute in the codebase**: To understand how and where `requires_system_checks` is currently used throughout the project. This can help in identifying the points of change for the introduction of `required_system_checks`.\n\n   `search_code(\"requires_system_checks\")`\n\n3. **Search for a method that might be checking this attribute's value**: If there's a specific method or function that reads or evaluates the `requires_system_checks` attribute, understanding its logic will be crucial for modifying or enhancing it to support the new `required_system_checks` attribute.\n\n   `search_method_in_class(\"handle\", \"Command\")`\n\nThis comprehensive search should yield sufficient context to understand how `requires_system_checks` is used within the `Command` class and throughout the project. Based on this information, a strategy can be devised to replace `requires_system_checks` with `required_system_checks` in a way that supports both specifying no checks (`[]`) and all checks (`'__all__'`), along with allowing a subset of checks through tags."
