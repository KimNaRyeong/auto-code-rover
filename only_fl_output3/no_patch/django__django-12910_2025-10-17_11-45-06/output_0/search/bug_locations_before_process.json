        "intended_behavior": "This file and class likely contain the implementation and usage of the `requires_system_checks` attribute. The intended behavior here would be to update the `BaseCommand` class to support the new `required_system_checks` attribute, which can take the values `['__all__']`, `[]`, or a list of specific system check tags. The class should interpret `__all__` as requiring all system checks (mimicking the current `True` value behavior), an empty list `[]` as bypassing all system checks (akin to `False`), and a list of specific tags as requiring only those checks. Methods within `BaseCommand` that make use of `requires_system_checks` should be updated or extended to interpret `required_system_checks` correctly while maintaining backward compatibility for subclasses not yet updated to use the new attribute."
