        "intended_behavior": "The method should be updated to correctly handle `Pow` expressions with `evaluate=False`, especially for expressions where the base is 1 and the exponent is a negative or fractional rational number. The fix should prevent infinite recursion by properly managing these specific cases without altering the method's ability to handle all other `Pow` expressions as it currently does. This might involve adding a specific condition to check for `evaluate=False` conditions and ensuring that expressions are formatted into LaTeX without re-entering the `_print_Pow` or `_print_Mul` methods in a way that could lead to recursion."

        "method": "_print_Mul",
        "intended_behavior": "In this method, the intended behavior should be revised to ensure that it can gracefully handle the conversion of `Mul` expressions involving reciprocal powers (like those created by `Pow(Rational(1, n), -1, evaluate=False)`) into their correct LaTeX representation. This involves ensuring that the method does not misinterpret such expressions in a way that would trigger infinite recursion. Instead, it should recognize and correctly format them, possibly by identifying and special-casing the handling of multiplicative inverses of rational powers when `evaluate=False` is specified, thus preserving the existing functionality while resolving the recursion issue."
