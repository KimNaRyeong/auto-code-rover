        "intended_behavior": "This method is likely responsible for dynamically creating named tuple classes that represent rows in a query result set when `values_list(named=True)` is used. The intended behavior here should ensure that these dynamically created named tuple classes are pickleable. This might involve ensuring the named tuple classes conform to Python's expectations for pickleability, perhaps by standardizing the way they are defined or by explicitly implementing or facilitating serialization methods like `__getstate__` and `__setstate__`, or using the `__reduce__` method to provide a way for the pickle module to serialize these objects. The implementation should maintain the existing functionality of allowing users to access query results as named tuples while ensuring these objects are fully compatible with Python's pickling processes."
