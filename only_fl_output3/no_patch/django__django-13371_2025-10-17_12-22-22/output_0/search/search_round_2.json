Named tuples in Python are indeed pickleable by default, suggesting that the way Django dynamically creates this `Row` namedtuple might be unconventional or involves some complexity that affects its pickleability.\n\n2. **`values_list` Method in `QuerySet` Class**\n\n   The `values_list` method returns a clone of the queryset with the `_iterable_class` attribute set based on the `named` and `flat` parameters. If `named=True`, it uses `NamedValuesListIterable`, which likely constructs the named tuples (`Row`). The fact that there's a clear distinction in iterable class based on these parameters indicates the potential for custom handling that might introduce pickling issues, especially if the `Row` namedtuple is not a straightforward namedtuple or requires additional context to be pickleable.\n\n   The method itself does a principal job of altering the queryset's returning structure, which is key to understanding why the `Row` objects it returns are not pickleable. Since the bug involves a failure to pickle these `Row` objects, the connection likely lies in how these objects are generated and managed within these custom iterables (`NamedValuesListIterable`).\n\n3. **Non-existence of `__reduce__` Method for `QuerySet` and `Row`**\n\n   The absence of a custom `__reduce__` method for either `QuerySet` or the (non-found) `Row` class could be part of the pickle issue. Typically, custom objects that don't naturally support pickling need to implement `__reduce__` to provide instructions on how to pickle them. The absence of a `__reduce__` method in both the searched contexts suggests that if `Row` requires a custom approach to be pickleable, it's not implemented properly or at all.\n\n**Conclusions and Next Steps:**\n\n- Since `Row` might be synonymous with a dynamically created namedtuple and no direct definition is available, understanding how `NamedValuesListIterable` creates and handles these named tuples is crucial. Given this, we should look into the `NamedValuesListIterable` class for clues on how `Row` instances are constructed and whether there's a gap in making them pickleable:\n  ```\n  search_class(\"NamedValuesListIterable\")\n  ```\n\n- Additionally, understanding more about the scenario wherein the pickling error occurs could benefit from inspecting how Django caches or specifically how it uses pickle with query results. This might involve searching for any custom pickle handling in Django's ORM caching or in connection with `QuerySet` results:\n  ```\n  search_code(\"pickle\")\n  ```\n\nThese steps aim to directly address the potential causes identified from the context we've collected and analyzed."

        "content": "From the collected context, here's an analysis focusing on addressing the issue with pickleability of the `django.db.models.query.Row` objects:\n\n### Analysis of `NamedValuesListIterable` Class\n\n1. **What This Part of The Code Does:**\n   \n   The `NamedValuesListIterable` class, as discovered in `django/db/models/query.py`, is likely a specialized iterable that's employed when `values_list(..., named=True)` is invoked on a Django QuerySet. It hints at being responsible for constructing named tuple (`Row`) objects out of the query results. Unfortunately, the provided snippet cuts off before showing us how `create_namedtuple_class` is implemented or how `__iter__` works, which are critical to understanding the full picture.\n\n2. **Relationship to The Bug:**\n\n   Given that `NamedValuesListIterable` is responsible for creating named tuples (referred to as `Row` in the issue description), it's a central figure in understanding why these `Row` objects might not be pickleable. The method `create_namedtuple_class`, suggested by the context and its naming conventions, probably dynamically generates a namedtuple class based on the queried fields. The bug could stem from how these classes are defined and if there's something in their creation or handling that prevents pickling, such as dynamic attributes or missing pickle support.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior:**\n\n   The intended behavior would be that `Row` objects created by `NamedValuesListIterable` are fully pickleable, adhering to the general expectations for named tuples in Python. This ensures they can be serialized and deserialized without errors, which is crucial for caching mechanisms or any form of data persistence that relies on pickling.\n\n### Analysis of `pickle` Usage Throughout Django\n\nWhile the specific details of where `pickle` is directly related to `NamedValuesListIterable` or `Row` creation were not pinpointed from the search results, the wide usage across Django suggests that:\n\n1. **Django extensively employs pickling** for caching, sessions, and possibly for the internal representation of model instances and query results. This widespread use underscores the importance of ensuring all components, especially those related to database queries and results, are compatible with pickling.\n\n2. The bug's nature means there's a disconnect between how Django expects its components to interact with Python's pickling mechanism and how `Row` instances, in particular, are being handled.\n\n### Conclusion and Forward Path\n\nGiven the snippet from `NamedValuesListIterable` and the broad usage of pickle across Django, the bug likely resides in how the dynamic named tuples are created in such a way that prevents standard pickling, possibly due to dynamic class creation or how field names are translated into class attributes.\n\n#### Necessary Further Actions:\n\n1. **Inspect `create_namedtuple_class` and `__iter__` implementations in `NamedValuesListIterable`**:\n   - Understanding these methods will likely reveal how `Row` is structured and point towards why it's not pickleable.\n   - A potential fix could involve ensuring that `Row` classes define or simulate essential pickling methods (`__getstate__` and `__setstate__`), or possibly defining them in a manner that aligns more closely with how Python expects named tuples to be pickled.\n\n2. **Explore Django's Caching and Pickle Handling**:\n   - Given the widespread use of pickling, it's worth examining how Django caches queryset results, particularly named tuples, to identify if there's a common serialization pattern that `NamedValuesListIterable` fails to adhere to.\n   - Investigate documented cases or tests related to pickling other Django models or query results to understand if there's a prescribed serialization strategy that `Row` instances are missing.\n\nThis analysis highlights the need to dive deeper into how `NamedValuesListIterable` functions and to ensure its consistency with Django's overall serialization and pickling protocols."

The intended behavior here should ensure that these dynamically created named tuple classes are pickleable. This might involve ensuring the named tuple classes conform to Python's expectations for pickleability, perhaps by standardizing the way they are defined or by explicitly implementing or facilitating serialization methods like `__getstate__` and `__setstate__`, or using the `__reduce__` method to provide a way for the pickle module to serialize these objects. The implementation should maintain the existing functionality of allowing users to access query results as named tuples while ensuring these objects are fully compatible with Python's pickling processes.\n\n**Rationale**: The crux of the issue seems to be that `Row` objects generated by `NamedValuesListIterable` fail during pickling, likely due to how these objects are dynamically created. Ensuring pickleability without altering their intended use requires a delicate balance, likely necessitating modifications to the way these objects declare their pickleable state or are instantiated. Given the context, adding or modifying methods in `NamedValuesListIterable` to handle serialization properly is the most direct way to address the reported issue."
