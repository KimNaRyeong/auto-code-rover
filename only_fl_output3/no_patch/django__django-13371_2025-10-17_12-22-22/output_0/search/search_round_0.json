        "content": "To address the issue with `django.db.models.query.Row` not being pickleable, particularly after the introduction of the named parameter in `QuerySet.values_list()` from Django 2.0, we need to gather more information about the implementation details of `Row` and the `values_list()` method. This will help us understand how `Row` is defined and why it's failing the pickle operation. Following are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. Search for the class `Row` to understand its structure and any potential reasons it might not be pickleable:\n   ```\n   search_class(\"Row\")\n   ```\n\n2. Search for the `values_list` method within the `QuerySet` class to see how named tuples (`Row`) are being created and returned:\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"values_list\", \"QuerySet\")\n   ```\n\n3. Given that the issue mentions `django.db.models.query` failed during pickling, we should also look into how Django typically manages pickle operations for custom objects, which could involve special methods like `__reduce__`. This makes it pertinent to search for any existing implementation or usage of such methods within the `QuerySet` class or related to `Row` class:\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"__reduce__\", \"QuerySet\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"__reduce__\", \"Row\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls are chosen to get a broad yet relevant overview of the components involved in the issue, specifically focusing on the creation, structure, and serialization concerns of `Row` objects."
