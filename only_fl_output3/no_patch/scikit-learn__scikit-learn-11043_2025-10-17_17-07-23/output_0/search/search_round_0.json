As noted in #10648, it can be easy for users to miss that they need to set validate=False to pass through a DataFrame without converting it to a NumPy array. I think it would be more user-friendly to have `validate='array-or-frame'` by default, which would pass through DataFrames to the function, but otherwise convert its input to a 2d array. For strict backwards compatibility, the default should be changed through a deprecation cycle, warning whenever using the default validation means a DataFrame is currently converted to an array.\nDo others agree?\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue mentioned, we need to find the location of the `FunctionTransformer` class and the method or attribute associated with the validation process, specifically where the conversion of input types (DataFrame to array) is handled or determined. Let's perform some API calls to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the `FunctionTransformer` class to identify in which file it is located:\n   - `search_class(\"FunctionTransformer\")`\n\n2. Once we locate the file containing the `FunctionTransformer` class, we need to identify how the validation process is implemented or where the decision to convert DataFrames to arrays by default is made. It's likely related to a method that is used for validating the input before applying the transformation, or a parameter that specifies the input handling. So, we should look for methods or parameters involved in validation. We can start by searching for \"validate\" within the class to find relevant methods or attributes:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"validate\", \"FunctionTransformer\")`\n\n3. The issue description mentions the default behavior and suggests a change in how inputs are handled based on their type, implying there's a parameter or method handling this logic. It may be helpful to directly search for code snippets setting or checking the `validate` parameter in the `FunctionTransformer` class to understand its current implementation:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"validate=\", \"<file_path_of_FunctionTransformer>\")`\n     - Note: The `<file_path_of_FunctionTransformer>` placeholder should be replaced with the actual file path found from the first search.\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive understanding of how `FunctionTransformer` currently handles DataFrame inputs and how the `validate` parameter is implemented, helping to craft a solution for the issue reported."
