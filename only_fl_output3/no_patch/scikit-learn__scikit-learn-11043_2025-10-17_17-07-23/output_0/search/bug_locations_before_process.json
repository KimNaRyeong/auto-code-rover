        "intended_behavior": "The `_transform` method needs to be enhanced to support a new way of handling the `validate` parameter. Instead of a binary choice (validate or not), there should be a third option, such as `validate='array-or-frame'`. When this option is selected, the method should:\n      - Check the type of the input `X`. If `X` is a Pandas DataFrame, it should bypass the `check_array` conversion to keep the DataFrame intact.\n      - If `X` is not a DataFrame (e.g., a NumPy array or list), the existing validation logic should apply, potentially converting it into a NumPy array if `validate` is true.\n      - This behavior should preserve backward compatibility by maintaining the current default action (`validate=True`) but should also introduce the flexibility to handle DataFrames and arrays differently based on the new setting without altering the method's signature or expected input/output types for existing cases."
