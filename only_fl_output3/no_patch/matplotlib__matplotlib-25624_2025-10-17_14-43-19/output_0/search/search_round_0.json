This involves understanding how `kwargs` passed to `tight_layout` are processed and how the `figure.autolayout` setting interferes with this process.\n\nGiven the details from the issue, the following API calls would provide valuable context:\n\n1. Search for the `tight_layout` method within the codebase to understand its implementation details and how it handles `kwargs`.\n2. Search for references to the `figure.autolayout` setting to understand where and how it's checked or modified in relation to `tight_layout`.\n\nBased on this, the first set of API calls I would make are:\n\n- `search_method(\"tight_layout\")`\n- `search_code(\"figure.autolayout\")`"
