        "intended_behavior": "The `tight_layout` method should be adjusted to check if `figure.autolayout` is `True` and still apply `kwargs` pertaining to padding (`pad`, `w_pad`, `h_pad`) or any other layout constraints explicitly defined by the user. This means ensuring that even when `figure.autolayout` is enabled, user specifications via `tight_layout` are prioritized or melded with the automatic layout adjustments. The intended behavior is to allow the explicit `tight_layout` configurations provided by the user to coexist with or override the `figure.autolayout` settings when necessary, without disabling `autolayout` globally. The code changes should ensure that explicit `kwargs` provided to `tight_layout` are respected and applied to the layout computation."
