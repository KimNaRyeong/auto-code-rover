        "intended_behavior": "The `get_change_message` method should be updated to ensure that it favors verbose names over technical field names when constructing the change message. This involves:\n  - When iterating over `sub_message['changed']['fields']`, the method should check if the field names have corresponding verbose names defined and use those instead. This likely requires accessing the model's field definition to retrieve the verbose name if it exists.\n  - Preserve the existing functionality for logging added and deleted messages as well as handling cases where verbose names are not defined. For fields without explicit verbose names, the original field name should continue to be used.\n  - This change will improve the readability of the admin change history by displaying more user-friendly messages that reflect the field's verbose name, thus making it easier for non-developers to understand the changes made to model instances."
