The occurrence of `LogEntry` across the codebase:\n- It is found in several files related to Django\u2019s admin system, particularly in `django/contrib/admin/models.py` and `django/contrib/admin/options.py`.\n- Given the issue description, `LogEntry` is likely involved in tracking changes to model instances within the Django admin. The way it records and displays change messages is directly related to the bug. Specifically, `LogEntry` seems to be the model or mechanism through which changes (such as updates to fields) are logged in the admin's history.\n\n### 2. The usage of `models.DateTimeField` in the codebase:\n- It is widespread across various Django components, but its mention in `django/contrib/admin/models.py` appears most relevant to the issue. This indicates that `DateTimeField` (and potentially other field types) could include or support verbose names, which should be utilized in change messages.\n- The link between `DateTimeField` and the issue is about ensuring that such field types respect verbose names when logging changes in the admin history.\n\n### 3. The `get_change_message` method in `django/contrib/admin/models.py`:\n- The method seems to construct a human-readable message from JSON, indicating what changes were made to a model instance. This method attempts to translate changes into a user-friendly format, combining field names and other details into a structured message.\n- This method's relationship to the bug is crucial. The issue describes a shortfall in how changes are displayed\u2014using technical field names instead of human-readable verbose names. The logic in `get_change_message` responsible for formatting these messages likely needs adjustment to prioritize verbose names over field names, as described in the issue.\n- The intended behavior, according to the issue description, would involve modifying `get_change_message` to interpret and utilize the verbose names of model fields when available. This would make the change history in the admin more understandable to end-users by showing \"Changed date published.\" instead of \"Changed pub_date.\", aligning with Django's philosophy of making the framework friendly for developers and administrators.\n\nTo further progress towards a resolution, understanding how `get_change_message` retrieves and utilizes model field names and verbose names in constructing its message is key. It appears that changes might be necessary either in how `get_change_message` parses its `change_message` JSON to extract field names or in how it retrieves and applies verbose names to those field names during its message construction."

Bug Location 1: \n- File: django/contrib/admin/models.py\n- Class: LogEntry\n- Method: get_change_message\n- Intended Behavior: The `get_change_message` method should be updated to ensure that it favors verbose names over technical field names when constructing the change message. This involves:\n  - When iterating over `sub_message['changed']['fields']`, the method should check if the field names have corresponding verbose names defined and use those instead. This likely requires accessing the model's field definition to retrieve the verbose name if it exists.\n  - Preserve the existing functionality for logging added and deleted messages as well as handling cases where verbose names are not defined. For fields without explicit verbose names, the original field name should continue to be used.\n  - This change will improve the readability of the admin change history by displaying more user-friendly messages that reflect the field's verbose name, thus making it easier for non-developers to understand the changes made to model instances."
