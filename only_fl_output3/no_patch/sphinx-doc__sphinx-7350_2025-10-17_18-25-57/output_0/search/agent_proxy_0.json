            "content": "To get more context of the project related to the bug, we should understand how attributes and directives are handled, particularly within the `sphinxcontrib-napoleon` package, focusing on parsing and indexing operations. We need to check how the `:noindex:` option is supposed to work with the `Attributes:` directive and why it might be ignored. Here are the API calls to perform:\n\n1. **Search for the class in `sphinxcontrib-napoleon` that handles the Attributes directive.** Given the nature of the issue, it's likely that there's a specific class responsible for parsing and interpreting directives including `Attributes:` in the Sphinx Napoleon extension. Let's start by getting an overview of classes that could be directly involved:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_class(\"Napoleon\")\n```\n\n2. **Search for methods that handle options or indexing for directives.** Methods within the responsible class that parse or apply options to directives, specifically looking for anything that handles indexing or `:noindex:`, could be directly tied to the reported issue. Assuming we find a class like `NapoleonDirective` or similar from the first call, we would need to look for methods that handle these operations:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_method_in_class(\"parse_directive_options\", \"NapoleonDirective\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"handle_noindex_option\", \"NapoleonDirective\")\n```\n\nThis example assumes we found a class named `NapoleonDirective` or any class related to parsing directives. If such a class does not exist or is named differently, the method search would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\n3. **Search for the code snippet where the `Attributes:` directive is handled.** To understand how specifically `Attributes:` are processed and why `:noindex:` might be overlooked, let's locate the handling in code. Since the directive's syntax is quite specific, searching for the string \"Attributes:\" should help us find relevant sections of the code where it's parsed or interpreted:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_code(\"Attributes:\")\n```\n\nThese API calls will provide us with a better understanding of where and how `Attributes:` are processed, where `:noindex:` should be applied, and possibly hint at why it might not be functioning as expected."
