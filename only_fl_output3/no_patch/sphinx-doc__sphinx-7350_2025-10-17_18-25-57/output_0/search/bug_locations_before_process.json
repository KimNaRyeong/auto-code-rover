        "intended_behavior": "This method currently handles `:noindex:` for general directives. Given the issue with `Attributes:` being ignored by the `:noindex:` option, it suggests that `Documenter` or similar classes responsible for processing docstring directives into reStructuredText might need to be adjusted or extended to ensure `Attributes:` directives within Napoleon-parsed docstrings respect the `:noindex:` option. Specifically, when processing `Attributes:` directives, the presence of the `:noindex:` option should prevent these attributes from being added to the index."
