This could involve ensuring the environment variable DJANGO_AUTORELOAD_ENV is always correctly set and used to consistently trigger the reload process. Additionally, the subprocess invocation logic should be reviewed to ensure it does not contribute to intermittent reload failures."

Its behavior should ensure that the reload loop is robust against failures to detect file changes or to restart the server. Enhancements here could include better error handling, more precise control over signal handling for cleanup and restart, and improvements in how DJANGO_AUTORELOAD_ENV and file change signals are used to maintain a responsive and reliable reload process."
