It seems to work consistently once on a file, but multiple changes to the same file will not necessarily trigger a reload. It's definitely a change in the behavior to previous versions of Django (up to 2.1.7)\nI'm not using watchman.\nI'm running runserver in a python 3.7 slim docker container like ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001\nAs a workaround I have tried to add an edit a different .py -- that doesn't seem to help consistently. I've also noticed that the problem seems to sometimes go away by itself -- perhaps there is some change to the timing of the autoreloader which is not clear? For example and ignore interval of a certain duration.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the reported issue with the Django 2.2 autoreloader, let's focus on finding relevant sections of the Django project related to the autoreload mechanism. Since the issue mentions that the autoreloader is failing intermittently and there has been a change in behavior since upgrading to Django 2.2, it would be useful to examine the autoreloader code and any related configurations or methods. Here are some specific API calls that could help us gather the necessary information:\n\n1. Search for the class that handles the autoreloader functionality to understand how it has been implemented or has changed in Django 2.2.\n2. Search for any relevant methods that might relate to detecting file changes or triggering the reload.\n\nBased on this, here are the API calls I would use:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Autoreloader\")`\n2. `search_method(\"watch_files\")`\n\nThese calls are designed to locate the parts of the Django codebase that could be responsible for the behavior described in the issue, focusing on the autoreloader's implementation and its mechanism for watching file changes for potential leads on the intermittent failure."
