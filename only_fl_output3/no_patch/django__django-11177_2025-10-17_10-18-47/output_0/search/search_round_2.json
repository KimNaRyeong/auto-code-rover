It seems to work consistently once on a file, but multiple changes to the same file will not necessarily trigger a reload. It's definitely a change in the behavior to previous versions of Django (up to 2.1.7)\nI'm not using watchman.\nI'm running runserver in a python 3.7 slim docker container like ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001\nAs a workaround I have tried to add an edit a different .py -- that doesn't seem to help consistently. I've also noticed that the problem seems to sometimes go away by itself -- perhaps there is some change to the timing of the autoreloader which is not clear? For example and ignore interval of a certain duration.\n</issue>"

Considering this, we should revise our approach to locate the relevant parts of Django's infrastructure that handle autoreloading and file watching, given the issue at hand.\n\nThe Django development server (`runserver`) uses an autoreload mechanism to detect changes in the code and restart the server automatically. This feature is crucial for development efficiency, as it saves developers from manually restarting the server upon every change. The issue description suggests that this autoreload behavior has changed or is not functioning correctly after upgrading to Django 2.2, specifically that it does not always detect changes to `.py` files.\n\nGiven the failure to find specific classes or methods, here are some alternate approaches and API calls:\n\n1. The autoreload functionality may be part of Django's command-line utilities or development server setup. Therefore, we can search for code snippets related to Django's runserver command or configurations related to autoreloading.\n\n2. Since the detailed mechanism was not found under direct names, Django's implementation likely involves a more integrated or lower-level mechanism for file change detection and server restarting. It's possible that this involves some form of event loop or signal listening, especially for file system changes.\n\nThus, alternate API calls could be:\n- `search_method(\"runserver\")`: To find the runserver command implementation, which may include autoreload setup or configuration.\n- `search_code(\"AUTORELOAD\")`: To search for constants or configurations related to autoreloading that might not be encapsulated within a single class or method.\n- `search_code(\"file_changed\")`: Since detecting file changes is at the heart of the issue, this can lead to relevant code managing such detections.\n\nThese adjusted API calls aim to broaden the search to capture Django's autoreload mechanism's implementation details, focusing on configuration and runtime behaviors that could be related to the observed intermittent failure."

The references to `AUTORELOAD` in this file, and the snippets provided, give us insights into how Django manages the autoreload process, particularly in development environments. Analyzing these results, we can deduce the roles of the highlighted parts of the code:\n\n1. **Signal Definitions and Autoreload Environment Variable**: The first snippet introduces signals and an environment variable relevant to autoreloading. The signal `file_changed` might be emitted when a file change is detected, triggering the autoreload process. The environment variable `DJANGO_AUTORELOAD_ENV` is used to indicate whether the autoreload process should be active.\n\n2. **Restarting the Reloader**: The second snippet, `restart_with_reloader`, outlines how Django attempts to restart its reloader process. It sets the mentioned environment variable before initiating a subprocess call, presumably to restart the server with the autoreload option enabled.\n\n3. **Running with Reloader**: The third snippet shows `run_with_reloader`, which seems to be the entry point for starting the autoreload process. It sets up a signal handler for termination signals and checks the environment variable before proceeding to watch for file changes and keep the server running in a state that supports autoreload.\n\n**Relation to the Bug**:\nThe reported issue mentions intermittent failures of the autoreloader to detect changes in `.py` files, which suggests there might be problems in how file change signals are detected or propagated, how the environment is managed, or how the reloader process decides to restart (or not).\n\n**Intended Behavior**:\nThe intended behavior of this part of the code should be to reliably detect all file changes under the development server's watch and to restart the server efficiently each time changes are detected. This means ensuring that the detection of file changes is both comprehensive and accurate, avoiding missed changes due to timing issues or the state of the detection mechanism. It potentially requires refinement in the logic governing file change detection, signal handling, or subprocess management for server restarts.\n\nGiven the insight from the snippets, we should focus on:\n- Enhancing the reliability of the `file_changed` signal to ensure it captures every relevant file modification event without missing any.\n- Reviewing the conditions under which the `DJANGO_AUTORELOAD_ENV` environment variable is set and checked, ensuring it correctly facilitates the restart process.\n- Improving the subprocess restart logic in `restart_with_reloader` and the server run logic in `run_with_reloader` to address any inefficiencies or failures in restarting the server upon detecting file changes.\n\nTo further refine the diagnosis and craft a solution, a deeper review of the code around these areas would be required, potentially needing adjustments to signal handling, file watching mechanisms, and the management of environment states and subprocesses for server restarts."

It may involve adjustments in how file change detection events are debounced or coalesced to ensure that each valid change is captured and triggers a reload, without missing or skipping over rapid sequential changes.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - File: `django/utils/autoreload.py`\n  - Method: `restart_with_reloader`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** The mechanism for restarting the server (particularly how the environment is managed and subprocess is called) might need refinement to address any edge cases where the server does not restart or does so inefficiently after a file change is detected. This could involve ensuring the environment variable `DJANGO_AUTORELOAD_ENV` is always correctly set and used to consistently trigger the reload process. Additionally, the subprocess invocation logic should be reviewed to ensure it does not contribute to intermittent reload failures.\n\n- **Location 3:**\n  - File: `django/utils/autoreload.py`\n  - Method: `run_with_reloader`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** This method sets up and manages the autoreload process. Its behavior should ensure that the reload loop is robust against failures to detect file changes or to restart the server. Enhancements here could include better error handling, more precise control over signal handling for cleanup and restart, and improvements in how `DJANGO_AUTORELOAD_ENV` and file change signals are used to maintain a responsive and reliable reload process.\n\nThese locations and adaptations aim to directly address the report of intermittent autoreload failures, focusing on ensuring that file changes are always detected and lead to a consistent and reliable server reload process in Django's development server environment."
