It seems to work consistently once on a file, but multiple changes to the same file will not necessarily trigger a reload. It's definitely a change in the behavior to previous versions of Django (up to 2.1.7)\nI'm not using watchman.\nI'm running runserver in a python 3.7 slim docker container like ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001\nAs a workaround I have tried to add an edit a different .py -- that doesn't seem to help consistently. I've also noticed that the problem seems to sometimes go away by itself -- perhaps there is some change to the timing of the autoreloader which is not clear? For example and ignore interval of a certain duration.\n</issue>"

Since the issue mentions that the autoreloader is failing intermittently and there has been a change in behavior since upgrading to Django 2.2, it would be useful to examine the autoreloader code and any related configurations or methods. Here are some specific API calls that could help us gather the necessary information:\n\n1. Search for the class that handles the autoreloader functionality to understand how it has been implemented or has changed in Django 2.2.\n2. Search for any relevant methods that might relate to detecting file changes or triggering the reload.\n\nBased on this, here are the API calls I would use:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Autoreloader\")`\n2. `search_method(\"watch_files\")`\n\nThese calls are designed to locate the parts of the Django codebase that could be responsible for the behavior described in the issue, focusing on the autoreloader's implementation and its mechanism for watching file changes for potential leads on the intermittent failure."

        "content": "Given that our initial queries did not return results for \"Autoreloader\" or \"watch_files\", it suggests that Django may not explicitly name its autoreload functionality or file watching methods in those specific terms, or perhaps these implementations are part of a larger mechanism not directly exposed by their names. Considering this, we should revise our approach to locate the relevant parts of Django's infrastructure that handle autoreloading and file watching, given the issue at hand.\n\nThe Django development server (`runserver`) uses an autoreload mechanism to detect changes in the code and restart the server automatically. This feature is crucial for development efficiency, as it saves developers from manually restarting the server upon every change. The issue description suggests that this autoreload behavior has changed or is not functioning correctly after upgrading to Django 2.2, specifically that it does not always detect changes to `.py` files.\n\nGiven the failure to find specific classes or methods, here are some alternate approaches and API calls:\n\n1. The autoreload functionality may be part of Django's command-line utilities or development server setup. Therefore, we can search for code snippets related to Django's runserver command or configurations related to autoreloading.\n\n2. Since the detailed mechanism was not found under direct names, Django's implementation likely involves a more integrated or lower-level mechanism for file change detection and server restarting. It's possible that this involves some form of event loop or signal listening, especially for file system changes.\n\nThus, alternate API calls could be:\n- `search_method(\"runserver\")`: To find the runserver command implementation, which may include autoreload setup or configuration.\n- `search_code(\"AUTORELOAD\")`: To search for constants or configurations related to autoreloading that might not be encapsulated within a single class or method.\n- `search_code(\"file_changed\")`: Since detecting file changes is at the heart of the issue, this can lead to relevant code managing such detections.\n\nThese adjusted API calls aim to broaden the search to capture Django's autoreload mechanism's implementation details, focusing on configuration and runtime behaviors that could be related to the observed intermittent failure."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).
