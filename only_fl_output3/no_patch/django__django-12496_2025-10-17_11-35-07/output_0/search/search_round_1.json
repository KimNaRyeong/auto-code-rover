This situation occurs *only* if we define a custom primary key in a parent model (eg. as an UUID field).\nAn example *without* custom primary key (correct behavior):\nclass Parent(models.Model):\ntitle = models.TextField()\nclass Child(Parent):\nbody = models.TextField()\n>> Child.objects.create()\n1. INSERT INTO \"app_parent\" (\"title\") VALUES ('') RETURNING \"app_parent\".\"id\"\n2. INSERT INTO \"app_child\" (\"parent_ptr_id\", \"body\") VALUES (1, '')\nAn example *with* custom primary key (incorrect behavior):\nclass Parent(models.Model):\nid = models.UUIDField(\nprimary_key=True,\ndefault=uuid.uuid4,\neditable=False\n)\ntitle = models.TextField()\nclass Child(Parent):\nbody = models.TextField()\n>> Child.objects.create()\n1. UPDATE \"app_parent\" SET \"title\" = '' WHERE \"app_parent\".\"id\" = 'd750cfdd-ae7b-48a6-a2e0-d49e70e28686'::uuid\n2.

To understand how the inheritance is implemented and if there's any specific handling or custom save methods that might affect this behavior:\n   - `search_class(\"Parent\")`\n   - `search_class(\"Child\")`\n\n2. Since the issue might be related to how instances of these models are created or saved, it is essential to check for custom save methods or creation methods within both models:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"save\", \"Parent\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"save\", \"Child\")`\n\n3. Additionally, it would be beneficial to look into how Django's ORM handles the `create` method for models, especially in cases with custom primary keys. However, specific internal ORM methods like `_save_table` might be more directly involved in the problem described, but without knowledge of Django's internal method names, a general search is a starting point:\n   - `search_method(\"create\")`\n\n4. Finally, to find any snippets where `Child.objects.create()` specifically is called, as it might give insight into any preprocessing or handlers that impact the behavior observed:\n   - `search_code(\"Child.objects.create()\")`\n\nThese API calls are designed to provide a broad context around the creation and saving mechanisms of the models in question, how they interact with Django's ORM, and potentially identify the code leading to the unwanted update query."

        "content": "Analyzing the results from the search API calls gives us a few insights and also points towards necessary next steps to gather more context:\n\n### Analysis of Results\n\n#### 1. Classes and Methods Not Found\nThe API search did not find the classes `Parent` and `Child` or the `save` method within them. This could imply several things:\n- The issue might be described at a high level, using illustrative class names that do not directly correspond to the actual codebase's class names.\n- There might be a miscommunication or misunderstanding about the names of the classes involved in the issue.\n\nGiven these possibilities, it becomes evident that without direct access to the class names used in the issue, we might need to explore related system components or functionalities more generically.\n\n#### 2. `create` Method Searches\nThe search for the `create` method across the codebase returned 22 matches across various files related to Django's own ORM and sessions backend, among others. This is important because:\n- It underscores the complexity and widespread use of creation patterns within Django's framework, making the pinpointing of the issue more challenging without more specific context.\n- Some of these files (`django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`, in particular) likely contain crucial logic related to how model instances are created and how inheritance relationships are handled, which is directly related to the reported issue.\n\n#### 3. Intended Behavior vs. Issue Description\nBased on the issue description, the intended behavior for the creation of model instances with multi-inheritance, especially when a custom primary key is involved, should ideally involve no unnecessary updates to the parent model with empty values. This points towards a potential mismanagement in how Django handles inheritance with custom primary keys during object creation.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context\n\nGiven the analysis and gaps identified:\n1. **Direct Focus on Django ORM Handling**: \n   - Further investigate the files `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`, as they likely involve logic for model creation. This would entail making API calls such as:\n     - `search_method_in_file(\"create\", \"django/db/models/query.py\")`\n     - `search_method_in_file(\"create\", \"django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py\")`\n\n2. **Investigate Generic Model Instance Creation and Inheritance Handling**:\n   - Since class names `Parent` and `Child` might be placeholders or illustrative, investigate how Django's ORM system generally handles model inheritance and instance creation. This could mean exploring django documentation or source code comments related to model creation, inheritance, and especially modifications when a custom primary key is involved.\n\n3. **Review Django ORM Optimization for Custom Primary Keys**:\n   - Explore if there are optimizations or notable behaviors within Django's ORM when dealing with custom primary keys. This could involve API searches related to `UUIDField` usage within model definitions or inheritance patterns.\n\nBy following these steps, we may uncover more pertinent information related to the described issue, helping in forming a more comprehensive strategy for addressing the bug."

Ideally, the creation process should involve a single insert operation for both parent and child models without triggering a redundant update operation for filling parent fields. This would require an intelligent inspection of the model\u2019s primary key during the creation to ensure all necessary fields are populated in the initial INSERT operation.\n\n   - **Bug Location Hypothetical 2:**\n     - **File:** `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`\n     - **Class/Method:** Any method handling the relationship between inherited models and especially those managing the setting of foreign keys in multi-table inheritance could be relevant.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Ensure that during the creation of a child model object, the handling of the parent's primary key is done in a manner that doesn't require subsequent updates to populate or correct the parent model fields. This might involve pre-calculating or ensuring the UUID or custom primary keys are adequately considered in the initial INSERT logic.\n\n**Note:** Real resolution requires narrowing down the exact implementation details within Django's source or the specific project code (if modifications have been made) to ascertain the correct interventions. The above hypothetical locations are deduced logically from the described issue and suggest areas to investigate. Further context is required for precise action."
