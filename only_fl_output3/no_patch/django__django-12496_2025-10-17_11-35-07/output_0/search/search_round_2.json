INSERT INTO \"app_parent\" (\"title\") VALUES ('') RETURNING \"app_parent\".\"id\"\n2.

Classes and Methods Not Found\nThe API search did not find the classes `Parent` and `Child` or the `save` method within them. This could imply several things:\n- The issue might be described at a high level, using illustrative class names that do not directly correspond to the actual codebase's class names.\n- There might be a miscommunication or misunderstanding about the names of the classes involved in the issue.\n\nGiven these possibilities, it becomes evident that without direct access to the class names used in the issue, we might need to explore related system components or functionalities more generically.\n\n#### 2. `create` Method Searches\nThe search for the `create` method across the codebase returned 22 matches across various files related to Django's own ORM and sessions backend, among others. This is important because:\n- It underscores the complexity and widespread use of creation patterns within Django's framework, making the pinpointing of the issue more challenging without more specific context.\n- Some of these files (`django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`, in particular) likely contain crucial logic related to how model instances are created and how inheritance relationships are handled, which is directly related to the reported issue.\n\n#### 3. Intended Behavior vs. Issue Description\nBased on the issue description, the intended behavior for the creation of model instances with multi-inheritance, especially when a custom primary key is involved, should ideally involve no unnecessary updates to the parent model with empty values. This points towards a potential mismanagement in how Django handles inheritance with custom primary keys during object creation.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context\n\nGiven the analysis and gaps identified:\n1. **Direct Focus on Django ORM Handling**: \n   - Further investigate the files `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`, as they likely involve logic for model creation. This would entail making API calls such as:\n     - `search_method_in_file(\"create\", \"django/db/models/query.py\")`\n     - `search_method_in_file(\"create\", \"django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py\")`\n\n2. **Investigate Generic Model Instance Creation and Inheritance Handling**:\n   - Since class names `Parent` and `Child` might be placeholders or illustrative, investigate how Django's ORM system generally handles model inheritance and instance creation. This could mean exploring django documentation or source code comments related to model creation, inheritance, and especially modifications when a custom primary key is involved.\n\n3. **Review Django ORM Optimization for Custom Primary Keys**:\n   - Explore if there are optimizations or notable behaviors within Django's ORM when dealing with custom primary keys. This could involve API searches related to `UUIDField` usage within model definitions or inheritance patterns.\n\nBy following these steps, we may uncover more pertinent information related to the described issue, helping in forming a more comprehensive strategy for addressing the bug."

Ideally, the creation process should involve a single insert operation for both parent and child models without triggering a redundant update operation for filling parent fields.

This might involve pre-calculating or ensuring the UUID or custom primary keys are adequately considered in the initial INSERT logic.\n\n**Note:** Real resolution requires narrowing down the exact implementation details within Django's source or the specific project code (if modifications have been made) to ascertain the correct interventions.

It marks the current `QuerySet` instance for writing, creates an object of the model associated with the `QuerySet`, and saves it to the database with `force_insert=True` to ensure it's an insert operation rather than an update.\n\n#### Relationship to the Bug:\nThe method directly handles object creation and saving to the database, which is central to the issue. The issue arises when creating a child model that inherits from a parent with a custom primary key, leading to an unnecessary update query on the parent model. The use of `force_insert=True` during the save() operation is proper; however, the bug may lie in how the parent and child models are linked, especially with custom primary keys, not being fully addressed in this process.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior would be to ensure that when a child model is created, it does not trigger an unnecessary update on the parent model. This might require enhanced handling for inheritance cases with custom primary keys to ensure that the initial insert correctly bridges the child with its parent without the need for subsequent updates.\n\n### Analysis of `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` Results:\n\n#### What do these parts of the code do?\nBoth highlighted methods deal with creation operations through related managers, which are typically used for managing database records in relations like one-to-many or many-to-many.\n\n1. `create` within `RelatedManager` likely facilitates creating objects in a one-to-many relationship, setting the foreign key on the new object to link it with the parent (the instance on which `create` is called).\n2. The `create` method within `ManyRelatedManager` handles object creation in the context of a many-to-many relationship. It creates a new object, adds it to the relationship, and might handle additional defaults for the through table.\n\n#### Relationship to the Bug:\nThese methods are involved in creating related objects. While not directly addressing the issue of unnecessary updates, they show the mechanisms through which Django handles related object creation, which could have implications for how inherited objects (such as those in multi-inheritance scenarios with custom PKs) are managed.\n\n#### Intended Behavior:\nConsidering the issue, an intended behavior amendment could involve ensuring related object creation within inheritance chains respects initial insert logic without triggering redundant updates, specifically honoring custom primary key attributes without overwriting or emptying parent data.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile neither set of methods directly addresses the issue of redundant updates when using custom primary keys in inherited models, they indicate areas where Django handles database record creation. The problem might not lie within these methods themselves but in how Django's ORM framework orchestrates object creation and saving across related models, especially in inheritance scenarios. Further investigation into how inheritance with custom primary keys is managed by Django might reveal more direct intervention points or necessitate changes in these or related methods to resolve the described issue."

However, with the provided search results and established understanding of Django's model handling mechanisms, we can suggest a potential bug location and propose an intended behavior that could mitigate the issue:\n\n### 1. **do we need more context:** \nEmpty - Based on the provided search results and the analysis, we have enough context to hypothesize about the possible bug location and intended behavior modifications.\n\n### 2. **where are bug locations:**\n\n- **Bug Location 1:**\n  - **File:** `django/db/models/query.py`\n  - **Class:** `QuerySet`\n  - **Method:** `create`\n\n- **Intended Behavior:** \n  The `create` method should include improved handling for objects that are part of a multi-table inheritance chain, where one or more parents have a custom primary key (e.g., a UUIDField). Specifically, when creating an instance of a child model, Django should optimally manage the insert process to prevent unnecessary updates to the parent model's record after its initial insertion. This could involve a pre-check to assess the inheritance chain of the model being created and to prepare all related data for a streamlined insert operation that doesn't necessitate follow-up updates to correct or complete the record linkage in the database.\n\n- **Rationale:**\n  The method is directly responsible for creating new model instances and saving them to the database. The issue described involves an unnecessary update operation on the parent model when a child model is created. Enhancing this method to more carefully handle the creation of instances within a multi-table inheritance framework, especially considering custom primary keys, could eliminate the unwanted update.\n\nThis proposed change aims to preserve existing functionality by maintaining the method\u2019s primary role in object creation while augmenting it to consider the specifics of inheritance patterns and custom primary keys more fully. This approach would minimize the impact on models and applications not involved in the described problematic scenario, maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring that enhancements are targeted and effective within the precise context of the issue.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWithout direct access to the filesystem for further exploration or more specific details from the Django internals beyond the provided context, this hypothesis suggests a starting point for investigation and potential resolution. Further examination by a developer familiar with Django's ORM system would be required to implement and test the proposed changes effectively."
