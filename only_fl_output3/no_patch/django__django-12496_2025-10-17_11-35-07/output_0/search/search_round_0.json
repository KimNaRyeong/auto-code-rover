This situation occurs *only* if we define a custom primary key in a parent model (eg. as an UUID field).\nAn example *without* custom primary key (correct behavior):\nclass Parent(models.Model):\ntitle = models.TextField()\nclass Child(Parent):\nbody = models.TextField()\n>> Child.objects.create()\n1. INSERT INTO \"app_parent\" (\"title\") VALUES ('') RETURNING \"app_parent\".\"id\"\n2. INSERT INTO \"app_child\" (\"parent_ptr_id\", \"body\") VALUES (1, '')\nAn example *with* custom primary key (incorrect behavior):\nclass Parent(models.Model):\nid = models.UUIDField(\nprimary_key=True,\ndefault=uuid.uuid4,\neditable=False\n)\ntitle = models.TextField()\nclass Child(Parent):\nbody = models.TextField()\n>> Child.objects.create()\n1. UPDATE \"app_parent\" SET \"title\" = '' WHERE \"app_parent\".\"id\" = 'd750cfdd-ae7b-48a6-a2e0-d49e70e28686'::uuid\n2. INSERT INTO \"app_parent\" (\"id\", \"title\") VALUES ('d750cfdd-ae7b-48a6-a2e0-d49e70e28686'::uuid, '')\n3. INSERT INTO \"app_child\" (\"parent_ptr_id\", \"body\") VALUES ('d750cfdd-ae7b-48a6-a2e0-d49e70e28686'::uuid, '')\nPython 3.6, PostgreSQL 9.6\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient code context for resolving the issue related to the child model updating the parent model with empty fields, making an extra query in multi-inheritance when the parent model has a custom primary key, I would perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. To understand how the inheritance is implemented and if there's any specific handling or custom save methods that might affect this behavior:\n   - `search_class(\"Parent\")`\n   - `search_class(\"Child\")`\n\n2. Since the issue might be related to how instances of these models are created or saved, it is essential to check for custom save methods or creation methods within both models:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"save\", \"Parent\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"save\", \"Child\")`\n\n3. Additionally, it would be beneficial to look into how Django's ORM handles the `create` method for models, especially in cases with custom primary keys. However, specific internal ORM methods like `_save_table` might be more directly involved in the problem described, but without knowledge of Django's internal method names, a general search is a starting point:\n   - `search_method(\"create\")`\n\n4. Finally, to find any snippets where `Child.objects.create()` specifically is called, as it might give insight into any preprocessing or handlers that impact the behavior observed:\n   - `search_code(\"Child.objects.create()\")`\n\nThese API calls are designed to provide a broad context around the creation and saving mechanisms of the models in question, how they interact with Django's ORM, and potentially identify the code leading to the unwanted update query."
