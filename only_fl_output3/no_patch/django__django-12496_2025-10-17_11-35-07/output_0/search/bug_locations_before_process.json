        "intended_behavior": "The `create` method should include improved handling for objects that are part of a multi-table inheritance chain, where one or more parents have a custom primary key (e.g., a UUIDField). Specifically, when creating an instance of a child model, Django should optimally manage the insert process to prevent unnecessary updates to the parent model's record after its initial insertion. This could involve a pre-check to assess the inheritance chain of the model being created and to prepare all related data for a streamlined insert operation that doesn't necessitate follow-up updates to correct or complete the record linkage in the database."
