Given the context and requirements, we can fine-tune the approach to safely recreate the Django setup within a standalone file for a more accurate reproduction of the issue you're experiencing, considering the failure of the initial attempt. The revised approach involves creating and migrating models programmatically to ensure the database tables exist and are ready for the operations. Ensure Django is installed in your environment, or install it via `pip install django`.

extra UPDATE query when a child model with a multi-table inheritance from a
parent model with a custom primary key field is created.

This script is now designed to handle initial migration executions to avoid the previously encountered error where the database tables were not found. It configures Django settings on the fly, checks for and applies migrations as necessary, and then proceeds to test for the issue by observing the SQL queries executed during the creation of a child model instance. This should more reliably reproduce the problem if it exists or exit gracefully if the issue is fixed.
