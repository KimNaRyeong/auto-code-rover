To understand how `TfidfVectorizer` is implemented and see if the `copy` parameter is indeed ignored or mishandled, let's look for the `TfidfVectorizer` class definition in the `text.py` file:\n\n```python\nsearch_class_in_file(\"TfidfVectorizer\", \"sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py\")\n```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a specific `copy=False` parameter used in a method call, it will be beneficial to examine the context around where this parameter is used. Thus, we should retrieve the code around the line 1692 in the `text.py` file to see how `copy=False` is applied and whether there's an oversight regarding the handling of the `copy` parameter:\n\n```python\nget_code_around_line(\"sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py\", 1692, 5)\n```\n\nThese API calls will help in gathering sufficient information for resolving the reported issue by giving insights into the class implementation and the specific context of the `copy` parameter usage."
