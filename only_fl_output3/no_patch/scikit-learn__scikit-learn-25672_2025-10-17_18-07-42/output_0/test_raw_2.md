Certainly, here is a standalone `reproducer.py` Python file that adheres to your specified requirements. This script attempts to execute the functionality that should raise an `AssertionError` if the issue regarding NDCG score handling binary relevance with a single-element list is present.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys

    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', f"line {line_number}", file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_ndcg_issue():
    from sklearn.metrics import ndcg_score

    y_true = [[1]]
    y_pred = [[0]]

    try:
        # This should raise an exception if the issue is present.
        score = ndcg_score(y_true, y_pred)
        # If the program reaches this point without an error, the issue is presumably fixed.
        print("NDCG score calculated successfully. Issue might be fixed.")
        return True
    except ValueError as e:
        print("NDCG score computation failed as expected with a single-element list.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred, not related to the NDCG issue.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

def main():
    issue_fixed = check_ndcg_issue()
    if issue_fixed:
        exit(0)
    else:
        raise AssertionError("The issue with NDCG score and binary relevance with a single-element list is still present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code attempts to compute the NDCG score with a single-element list as described in your issue. If the computation fails specifically with the expected `ValueError` about the format support (`binary` type in this context), it prints the traceback as requested and concludes that the issue is present, raising an `AssertionError`. Conversely, if the score is calculated without raising the specific `ValueError`, it considers the issue fixed and exits with code 0 (success). 

Remember, the actual handling of the exception and conclusion about whether the issue is fixed might need adjustments based on the specific behavior and changes in the error message or the criteria used to detect the error in future versions of scikit-learn.
