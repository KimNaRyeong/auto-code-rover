        "content": "To get more context of the project related to the issue described, the following API calls would be particularly useful:\n\n1. **Search for the method where the issue occurs**: The traceback and the issue description indicate that the error is thrown by the `ndcg_score` method, and also mention a private method `_check_dcg_target_type` where the exception is raised. We'll start by locating `ndcg_score`.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"ndcg_score\")\n```\n\n2. **Search for the method `_check_dcg_target_type`**: Since this method is directly involved in raising the exception mentioned in the issue, it's important to understand its implementation and how it's used within the context.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"_check_dcg_target_type\")\n```\n\n3. **Search for code that directly mentions the error message**: The given error message is very specific, and by finding where it is located in the codebase, we can quickly navigate to the logic that needs adjustment. This approach helps in directly going to the conditional or logic that throws this error.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"Only ('multilabel-indicator', 'continuous-multioutput', 'multiclass-multioutput') formats are supported. Got binary instead\")\n```\n\n4. **Context around the area where the error is thrown**: If we know the file path and approximate line number (from the traceback or after finding the error message in the codebase), we could look at the context around it. However, as the line number is not specified in the issue, this step will require the file path from previous searches. Let's assume we would perform this action after knowing the exact location of the error message or the `_check_dcg_target_type` method.\n\nThe first three steps are crucial to understanding the issue in depth and preparing for a fix. The fourth step is hypothetical and dependent on the outcomes of the initial searches."
