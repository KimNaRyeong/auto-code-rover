        "intended_behavior": "Before proceeding to the computation of NDCG or calling `_check_dcg_target_type(y_true)`, add a check for binary relevance with single-element lists, since NDCG does not conceptually apply to such scenarios. If a single-element, binary relevance is detected, the method should raise a ValueError with a clear and user-friendly error message explaining why such input is not supported. This should be done in a way that preserves existing functionality for all other valid inputs (e.g., non-single-element or non-binary relevance cases). This involves introducing a condition that checks for the shape and content of `y_true` to determine if it's binary with a length of 1. This behavior is important to resolve the issue as it directly addresses the user's confusion and the lack of clarity the current error message provides. It ensures that users will have a better understanding of why their input is not accepted and what conditions are supported by the `ndcg_score` method."
