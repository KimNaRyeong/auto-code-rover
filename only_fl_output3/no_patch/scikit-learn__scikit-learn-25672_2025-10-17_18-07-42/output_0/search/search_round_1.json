        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### `ndcg_score` Method\nThis is the method where the issue originally occurs. It computes the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), a measure of ranking quality. The parameters it accepts include true labels or scores `y_true`, predicted scores `y_score`, and optional arguments like `k` for considering the top-k scores, `sample_weight` for sample weights, and `ignore_ties` to assume no ties in scores for efficiency.\n\n- **Relation to the Bug**: The issue is triggered when computing the NDCG score for binary relevance (0 or 1) with a single element in `y_true`. According to the issue description, the computation does not make sense for a single prediction, and the method should raise an error when `y_true` is a list of length 1. The actual exception is raised within this method by a call to `_check_dcg_target_type(y_true)`.\n\n- **Intended Behavior**: Based on the issue description, the method should explicitly check for the case where `y_true` has a length of 1 and throw a meaningful error before proceeding to `_check_dcg_target_type`. Currently, it handles arrays of shape `(n_samples, n_labels)` without directly addressing the single-element case in relation to binary relevance.\n\n#### `_check_dcg_target_type` Method\nThis private method checks if the target type in `y_true` is supported for DCG/NDCG calculations. It raises a ValueError if the target type is not one of the supported formats (`multilabel-indicator`, `continuous-multioutput`, `multiclass-multioutput`).\n\n- **Relation to the Bug**: This method is directly involved in the issue as it is where the exception for unsupported formats is raised. The error occurs because the format of `y_true` is identified as `binary`, which is not supported according to the method's logic.\n\n- **Intended Behavior**: While this method correctly identifies unsupported target types, the issue suggests that there needs to be a more explicit handling or messaging when dealing with binary targets especially for single-element `y_true` inputs. However, according to the user's expectation mentioned in the issue, this might not be the spot for fixing the issue but rather for improving error messaging. The real fix might involve preemptive checks in `ndcg_score` or reconsidering support for binary relevance scores.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the collected context and intended behaviors, it seems that both the understanding of the bug and the scope for a possible fix have been established. The issue does not stem from the type check itself but rather from the lack of handling specific cases like single-element, binary relevance inputs before reaching `_check_dcg_target_type`.\n\nA potential patch may involve modifying `ndcg_score` to:\n1. Explicitly check for `y_true` length and if it's a binary relevance when called, before proceeding to other validations.\n2. Improve the error message in `_check_dcg_target_type` or before calling it, to provide guidance when unsupported scenarios are encountered, such as the single-element binary relevance case.\n\nTo dive deeper or implement a fix, we'd typically look into modifying the `ndcg_score` method within `sklearn/metrics/_ranking.py`, making sure that there's logic to handle the described case or to throw a more descriptive error early on. There isn't an immediate need for additional context from the codebase based on the analysis of the issue and the current understanding of related methods."

If a single-element, binary relevance is detected, the method should raise a ValueError with a clear and user-friendly error message explaining why such input is not supported. This should be done in a way that preserves existing functionality for all other valid inputs (e.g., non-single-element or non-binary relevance cases). This involves introducing a condition that checks for the shape and content of `y_true` to determine if it's binary with a length of 1.\n        - This behavior is important to resolve the issue as it directly addresses the user's confusion and the lack of clarity the current error message provides. It ensures that users will have a better understanding of why their input is not accepted and what conditions are supported by the `ndcg_score` method."
