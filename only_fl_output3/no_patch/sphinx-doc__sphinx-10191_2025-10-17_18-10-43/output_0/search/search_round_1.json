The bug is specifically related to the rendering of footnotes in the LaTeX PDF output generated by Sphinx.\n\nGiven the problem's nature, we should focus on how Sphinx handles footnotes for LaTeX output.

Here are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. Search for the class or method that handles `rst` parsing or footnote processing. This guessing approach steps into identifying parsers or transformers related to footnote management:\n   - `search_method(\"footnote\")`\n   - `search_class(\"Footnote\")`\n\n2.

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### The `LaTeXBuilder` class (`sphinx/builders/latex/__init__.py`)\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n   The `LaTeXBuilder` class is responsible for building LaTeX documents from the source, which likely includes `.rst` files. The `write` method specifically processes each document described in `self.document_data`, combines them with relevant settings (like theme, document class, etc.), and finally compiles them into LaTeX files. Significant steps include assembling the document tree (`doctree`), post-processing images, setting document metadata (title, author, etc.), and writing the output to files.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   Given that the issue is with footnotes not being correctly rendered (appearing as `?` and lacking hyperlinks) in the PDF output, the `LaTeXBuilder`'s methods and how they handle `doctree` manipulations, including references, are crucial to understanding the bug. The process likely involves translating `rst` footnote references into LaTeX, where the issue may arise.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   Ideally, the `LaTeXBuilder` should correctly identify footnote references in the `.rst` files, translate them into the equivalent LaTeX commands that correctly reference the footnotes within the document such that they appear correctly numbered and linked in the PDF output. Any reference in the text should point to the correct footnote section at the bottom of the page or document.\n\n#### The `visit_footnote_reference` methods in various writers (`sphinx/writers/latex.py`, etc.)\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n   Methods named `visit_footnote_reference` across different Sphinx writers (`latex.py`, `texinfo.py`, `text.py`, and even within transforms in `latex/transforms.py`) are likely involved in processing footnote references during the document building phase. These methods probably define how footnote references are to be handled and converted into output-specific formats (e.g., LaTeX or text).\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   Since the methods are specifically about footnote references\u2014which are at the heart of the reported issue\u2014these parts of the code are directly related to the problem. The way these methods process and translate footnote references into LaTeX format is likely where the bug originates, especially if the LaTeX output does not match expected behavior (e.g., missing hyperlinks, incorrect rendering as `?`).\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   The intended behavior would be to ensure that any footnote references in the source `.rst` files are accurately transformed into their LaTeX counterparts, allowing for correct rendering in the final PDF. This includes maintaining link integrity, so references in the text correctly jump to their corresponding footnotes.\n\n### Next Steps based on Analysis\n\nGiven the analysis and to further narrow down the problem's source concerning the issue with footnotes in LaTeX PDF output, we should make additional API calls focusing on:\n\n- The contents and implementation of `visit_footnote_reference` within `sphinx/writers/latex.py`. Given that the issue is with LaTeX output, looking directly at how LaTeX handling is implemented for footnotes could provide crucial insights:\n  - `search_method_in_file(\"visit_footnote_reference\", \"sphinx/writers/latex.py\")`\n- Investigate transforms related to LaTeX that may affect footnote references, considering the mention of `sphinx/builders/latex/transforms.py` having matches for `visit_footnote_reference` methods:\n  - `search_code(\"visit_footnote_reference\", \"sphinx/builders/latex/transforms.py\")`\n\nThis approach aims to drill down into how Sphinx is translating rst footnote syntax into LaTeX and identify potential missteps or omissions causing the reported error."

The method must generate LaTeX commands that accurately link the text's footnote reference to the actual footnote entry at the document's end or the page bottom. This ensures that the references are not rendered as a `?` in the PDF output but as the intended numeral or symbol, with a working hyperlink that navigates to the footnote's content when clicked. The preservation of existing functionality includes maintaining correct referencing across multiple references to the same footnote and ensuring that this behavior is consistent across all scenarios, including singular and multiple uses of the same footnote.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `sphinx/builders/latex/transforms.py`\n  - **Class:** Uncertain without further context but involves the processing or transformation specifically related to LaTeX output.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Any class or method within this file that deals with transforming footnote references for LaTeX output needs to ensure that the transformation process correctly handles footnotes, especially when they are referred to multiple times within the document. The transformation should maintain link integrity and ensure the rendering of footnotes and their references follows LaTeX best practices, effectively resolving the issue where footnotes are not correctly mirrored in the LaTeX PDF output as expected. This includes ensuring that back-references from the footnote to the text are correctly established and that any peculiarities related to LaTeX handling of footnotes are appropriately addressed.\n\nThese locations are critical for resolving the issue with footnotes in the LaTeX PDF output. By ensuring these parts of the code correctly handle footnote references and their translation to LaTeX, the problematic rendering of footnotes as `?` and the missing hyperlinks should be resolved, aligning the PDF output with the expected behavior described in the Sphinx documentation and common LaTeX practices."
