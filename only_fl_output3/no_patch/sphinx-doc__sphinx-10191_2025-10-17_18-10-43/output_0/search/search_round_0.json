        "content": "To address the issue described, where alternating multiply referred footnotes produce a \"?\" in the PDF output from `rst` files using Sphinx, we need to gather relevant context from the project's codebase. The bug is specifically related to the rendering of footnotes in the LaTeX PDF output generated by Sphinx.\n\nGiven the problem's nature, we should focus on how Sphinx handles footnotes for LaTeX output. The process likely involves parsing `rst` files, identifying footnote syntax, and then converting it to the appropriate LaTeX commands during the document build process. Here are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. Search for the class or method that handles `rst` parsing or footnote processing. This guessing approach steps into identifying parsers or transformers related to footnote management:\n   - `search_method(\"footnote\")`\n   - `search_class(\"Footnote\")`\n\n2. Since the issue occurs during the LaTeX PDF generation, we need to look into the classes or methods responsible for LaTeX document building or conversion:\n   - `search_class(\"LaTeXBuilder\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"write\", \"LaTeXBuilder\")`\n\n3. We should also look into how references to footnotes are managed and rendered, especially for LaTeX output, since the issue mentions missing hyperlinks and erroneous rendering:\n   - `search_method(\"visit_footnote_reference\")`\n   - `search_method(\"latex_visit_footnote_reference\")`\n\nLet's execute these API calls to gather detailed code context that might contain clues or direct us to the problematic areas in the codebase related to the issue at hand."
