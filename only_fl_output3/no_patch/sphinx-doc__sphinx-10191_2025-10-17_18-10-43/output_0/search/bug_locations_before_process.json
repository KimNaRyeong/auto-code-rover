The method must generate LaTeX commands that accurately link the text's footnote reference to the actual footnote entry at the document's end or the page bottom. This ensures that the references are not rendered as a `?` in the PDF output but as the intended numeral or symbol, with a working hyperlink that navigates to the footnote's content when clicked. The preservation of existing functionality includes maintaining correct referencing across multiple references to the same footnote and ensuring that this behavior is consistent across all scenarios, including singular and multiple uses of the same footnote."

        "intended_behavior": "Any class or method within this file that deals with transforming footnote references for LaTeX output needs to ensure that the transformation process correctly handles footnotes, especially when they are referred to multiple times within the document. The transformation should maintain link integrity and ensure the rendering of footnotes and their references follows LaTeX best practices, effectively resolving the issue where footnotes are not correctly mirrored in the LaTeX PDF output as expected. This includes ensuring that back-references from the footnote to the text are correctly established and that any peculiarities related to LaTeX handling of footnotes are appropriately addressed."
