However, since the data is not processed directly by `AdaBoost*` but by its base estimator (on which `fit`, `predict_proba` and `predict` may be called), we should not need to constrain the data that much, allowing for `X` to be a list of text blobs or similar.\nSimilar may apply to other ensemble methods.\nDerived from #7767.\n</issue>"

The validation process for `X` in AdaBoost and other ensemble methods.\n2. How `X` is passed to the base estimator by AdaBoost.\n3. If there's a common pattern in ensemble methods for handling `X`, which might also require updates.\n\nGiven this, appropriate API calls might include:\n\n- search_class(\"AdaBoostClassifier\")\n- search_class(\"AdaBoostRegressor\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"AdaBoostClassifier\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"AdaBoostRegressor\")\n- search_code(\"check_array\")\n- search_method(\"check_X_y\")\n\nThese API calls aim to find the relevant location in the code where `X` is validated or processed before being passed to the base estimator, as well as to identify common utility methods or patterns used across ensemble methods for handling input validation."
