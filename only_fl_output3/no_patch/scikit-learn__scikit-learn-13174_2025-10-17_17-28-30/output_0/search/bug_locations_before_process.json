        "intended_behavior": "Modify the fit method to support a more flexible handling of the X parameter. It should dynamically adjust or bypass certain input validation checks based on the capabilities of the base estimator. For instance, if the base estimator can handle text inputs directly, the fit method should not strictly require X to be numeric arrays or sparse matrices. This requires preserving existing functionality for scenarios where X needs to adhere to the current restrictions, effectively making this additional flexibility an extension rather than a replacement of the existing input validation."

        "method": "fit",
        "intended_behavior": "Similar to AdaBoostClassifier, the fit method within AdaBoostRegressor should also be modified to allow more flexibility in the type of data X can represent. For base estimators capable of processing non-numeric arrays or non-standard data types (like text blobs), the method should conditionally relax the input validation constraints. This adaptation should be implemented in a way that default input type checks remain in place for base estimators that require numeric arrays or sparse matrix inputs, thereby maintaining the existing functionality intact."
