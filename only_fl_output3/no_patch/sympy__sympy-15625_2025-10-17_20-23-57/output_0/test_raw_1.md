Considering the feedback and requirements, let's correct the initial approach and ensure it accurately attempts to reproduce the problem within a standalone environment. To satisfy the dependencies such as `nbformat` and `nbconvert`, make sure they are installed in your environment. However, this script won't handle installations; it presumes that required libraries are present.

The corrected `reproducer.py` script is as follows:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        import nbformat
        from nbconvert import PDFExporter
        from nbconvert.preprocessors import ExecutePreprocessor

        # Create a notebook object
        nb = nbformat.v4.new_notebook()
        nb.cells.append(nbformat.v4.new_code_cell("""
import sympy as sp
sp.init_printing()
1
        """))

        # Execute the notebook
        ep = ExecutePreprocessor(timeout=600, kernel_name='python3')
        ep.preprocess(nb, {'metadata': {'path': './'}})

        # Convert notebook to LaTeX
        exporter = PDFExporter()
        exporter.exclude_input = True
        body, res = exporter.from_notebook_node(nb)

        # Check for the problematic LaTeX pattern
        if "$$\\begin{equation*}" in body or "\\end{equation*}$$" in body:
            raise AssertionError("Detected invalid LaTeX equation delimiters that could result in LaTeX compilation errors.")
        
        print("Test passed: No invalid LaTeX equation delimiters detected.")

    except AssertionError as ae:
        print(ae)
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Requirements:
- This script requires `ipython`, `nbformat`, `nbconvert`, and their dependencies to be installed. You can install these using pip:

  ```sh
  pip install ipython nbformat nbconvert
  ```

- The script also assumes that a LaTeX distribution is installed on your system because `nbconvert`'s `PDFExporter` requires `pdflatex`, `xelatex`, or another LaTeX processor to convert a notebook to PDF.

### How the script works:
- It programmatically creates a Jupyter notebook with a code cell that should trigger the LaTeX issue.
- It then attempts to execute and convert the notebook to PDF, capturing the conversion output as a string.
- It checks for the presence of problematic LaTeX syntax in the generated document.
- If the bad syntax is found, the script raises an `AssertionError`.
- If any unexpected error occurs, it prints a detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function.

Make sure to execute this script in an environment where all the required dependencies (`ipython`, `nbformat`, `nbconvert`, and a LaTeX distribution) are properly installed and set up.
