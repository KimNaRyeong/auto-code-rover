        "intended_behavior": "The code within these `convert` methods should examine how mathematical expressions, specifically those which do not need to be enclosed within a `$$...$$` (display math mode) for LaTeX, are processed. The intended behavior would be to ensure that when converting expressions that are standalone and not part of an inline mathematical flow, they are correctly wrapped to avoid LaTeX compilation errors. This might involve: directly wrapping expressions with `$\textbackslash displaystyle ...$` when it's determined that an expression is being outputted in a context that would typically involve `$$...$$`, particularly focusing on ensuring that any usage of environments like `equation*` respects LaTeX's mode expectations. Implementing or modifying a conditional logic that decides on the correct wrapping based on the output context (inline vs. display math), and possibly the nature of the expression itself, ensuring it maintains compatibility with both the LaTeX compilation process and the intended display format in the converted document."
