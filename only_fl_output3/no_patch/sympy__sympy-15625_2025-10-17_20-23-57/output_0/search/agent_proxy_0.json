Here are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. Search for any code snippet related to the LaTeX conversion settings or functions within Jupyter notebooks or nbconvert tool that might include `equation*` or `$$` to understand how the wrapping is currently implemented.\n2. Since the issue mentions that this behavior should be changed to use `$\\displaystyle ...$` instead, we should also look for any code handling or formatting LaTeX output.\n\nGiven this, the following search API calls are appropriate:\n- search_code(\"$$\\begin{equation*}\")\n- search_code(\"$\\displaystyle\")\n\nThese searches will help us find relevant parts of the codebase where the incorrect LaTeX wrapping is applied and where we need to apply changes."
