This file likely handles LaTeX representations of symbolic mathematics in Python, using the SymPy library, which is often used in Jupyter notebooks for displaying math-oriented outputs. Considering the nature of the issue related to LaTeX output generation, this file seems to be a promising area to investigate. \n\n1. **sympy/printing/latex.py**: This part of the codebase is responsible for converting SymPy expressions into LaTeX code. Given the context of the issue, it's likely that this conversion process is relevant to how mathematical expressions are formatted when nbconvert transforms Jupyter notebooks into LaTeX documents or PDFs. The `convert` method(s) found here might deal with transforming expressions into LaTeX strings, potentially including decisions about how to wrap these expressions for display.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug**: The bug occurs when LaTeX code generated from a Jupyter notebook contains math environments improperly wrapped with `$$...$$`, causing LaTeX compilation errors. Since `sympy/printing/latex.py` contains functionalities related to generating LaTeX representations, any logic within this file that affects how expressions are wrapped for display could be directly related to the issue. Specifically, the methods named `convert` may contain or invoke the code segment responsible for the questionable wrapping.\n\n3. **Intended behavior**: The intended correction, as described in the issue, involves changing the wrapping from `$$...$$` to `$\\displaystyle ...$` for expressions intended to be displayed in LaTeX documents. Thus, the relevant portion(s) of code within `sympy/printing/latex.py` should ensure expressions are wrapped in a way that is compatible with LaTeX's math environments, avoiding the `$$...$$` wrapping for equation environments and instead using `$\\displaystyle ...$`. This change aims to preserve the functional intent of rendering mathematical expressions correctly while ensuring compatibility with LaTeX compilation processes.\n\nConsidering the current understanding and the nature of `sympy/printing/latex.py`, it seems prudent to investigate how the `convert` methods within this file contribute to LaTeX code generation. Further examination of these methods should reveal precisely how expressions are formatted for LaTeX and allow identification of where adjustments are needed to resolve the issue. Additional API calls to inspect these methods closely could provide the exact implementation details necessary for devising a resolution:\n- search_method_in_file(\"convert\", \"sympy/printing/latex.py\")"

Based on the analysis of the results and the nature of the issue, it's clear that a detailed inspection of `sympy/printing/latex.py` is required, but without the results from a closer examination of the `convert` methods within this file, proposing specific bug locations is speculative. However, considering the issue's description and the part of the codebase that has been highlighted, a probable bug location and its intended behavior can be outlined as follows:\n\n**Probable Bug Location**:\n- **File**: `sympy/printing/latex.py`\n- **Class/Method**: Within methods named `convert` that handle the transformation of expressions into LaTeX strings.\n\n**Intended Behavior**:\n- The code within these `convert` methods should examine how mathematical expressions, specifically those which do not need to be enclosed within a `$$...$$` (display math mode) for LaTeX, are processed. The intended behavior would be to ensure that when converting expressions that are standalone and not part of an inline mathematical flow, they are correctly wrapped to avoid LaTeX compilation errors. This might involve:\n  - Directly wrapping expressions with `$\\displaystyle ...$` when it's determined that an expression is being outputted in a context that would typically involve `$$...$$`, particularly focusing on ensuring that any usage of environments like `equation*` respects LaTeX's mode expectations.\n  - Implementing or modifying a conditional logic that decides on the correct wrapping based on the output context (inline vs. display math), and possibly the nature of the expression itself, ensuring it maintains compatibility with both the LaTeX compilation process and the intended display format in the converted document.\n  \n**Summary**:\nWhile specific methods within `sympy/printing/latex.py` have not been pinpointed due to the lack of detailed examination results, the overarching theme remains to modify the wrapping logic of mathematical expressions for LaTeX generation, ensuring error-free compilation and alignment with best practices in LaTeX syntax. This involves replacing incorrect double dollar signs `$$...$$` with `$\\displaystyle ...$` for standalone expressions, thus resolving the noted issue."
