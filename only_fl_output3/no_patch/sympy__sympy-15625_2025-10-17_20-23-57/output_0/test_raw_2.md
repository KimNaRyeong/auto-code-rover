Certainly! Below is an updated approach for generating a standalone script that does not rely directly on `nbformat` or `nbconvert` modules, thus avoiding the issue encountered with the `ModuleNotFoundError`. Instead, this version of the script will simulate the process more manually, aiming to capture the essence of the problem by directly interfacing with the necessary components (e.g., `sympy` for LaTeX generation and then examining the output for the known LaTeX issue). This should make the script more focused on the reproduction attempt while avoiding external module dependencies that were not properly addressed in the previous attempt.

Please ensure that `sympy` and any other required modules are installed in your execution environment before running this script.

```python
import subprocess
import tempfile
import os

def main():
    try:
        # Use Sympy to generate LaTeX code which simulates the Jupyter notebook output
        import sympy as sp
        sp.init_printing(use_latex='mathjax')
        expr = sp.sympify("1")
        latex_code = sp.latex(expr, mode='equation*')

        # Prepare the LaTeX document as a string
        document_template = r'''
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}
%s
\end{document}
'''

        # Insert the generated latex code into the document
        document_content = document_template % latex_code

        # Create a temporary file for the LaTeX document
        with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, suffix=".tex") as temp_tex_file:
            temp_tex_file.write(document_content.encode('utf-8'))
            temp_tex_path = temp_tex_file.name

        # Compile the LaTeX document to PDF
        latex_cmd = ['pdflatex', '-interaction=nonstopmode', temp_tex_path]
        proc = subprocess.run(latex_cmd, cwd=os.path.dirname(temp_tex_path), capture_output=True, text=True)
        
        # Check for errors indicating the LaTeX issue
        if "LaTeX Error: Bad math environment delimiter." in proc.stdout or "LaTeX Error: Bad math environment delimiter." in proc.stderr:
            raise AssertionError("LaTeX compilation error due to bad math environment delimiter.")

        print("No issue found - the LaTeX syntax inconsistency might have been resolved.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise
    
    finally:
        # Clean up the temporary file
        if 'temp_tex_path' in locals() and os.path.exists(temp_tex_path):
            os.remove(temp_tex_path)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script manually generates a LaTeX document containing Sympy output, then attempts to compile it to PDF. If the known LaTeX error occurs, it raises an `AssertionError`. Otherwise, it indicates no issue was found. This approach assumes a LaTeX installation (such as TeX Live or MiKTeX) is available and that `pdflatex` can be called from the command line. Ensure you have the necessary software installed and available in your environment's PATH.
