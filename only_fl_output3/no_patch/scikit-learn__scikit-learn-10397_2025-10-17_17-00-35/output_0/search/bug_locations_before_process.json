        "intended_behavior": "During initialization of a `_BaseRidgeCV` instance, all values within the `alphas` tuple should be converted to floats. This ensures that downstream operations, particularly those that are sensitive to the type of `alphas` (like exponentiation or divisions that might result in floats or require float inputs), do not raise errors due to integer inputs. This conversion could be implemented as a simple one-liner using a comprehension or `map`, ensuring that all elements of `alphas` are floats right as they are passed to the instance."

        "intended_behavior": "Before any operation involving `alphas` is performed within the `fit` method, ensure that `alphas` have been converted to floats. This acts as a secondary safeguard in case `alphas` are directly manipulated or reassigned within any point before reaching or within the `fit` method itself. It would involve checking the type of `alphas` elements and converting them if necessary. Although ideally, the conversion in `__init__` should suffice, ensuring this within `fit` might protect against future code modifications that bypass `__init__` or reassign `alphas` post-initialization."
