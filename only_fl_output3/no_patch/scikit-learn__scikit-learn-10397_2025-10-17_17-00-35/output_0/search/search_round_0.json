        "content": "To address the issue related to `RidgeCV`'s handling of integers in the `alpha` parameter causing a `ValueError`, I propose to use the search APIs as follows:\n1. To understand how the `RidgeCV` class is implemented and to see if there's an explicit handling or conversion of the `alphas` parameter, we should start by looking up the `RidgeCV` class definition. This will give us insights into where the issue might be rooted in the project's code base.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"RidgeCV\")\n```\n\n2. Given that the error is thrown during the `fit` method operation, we should look into how `fit` is implemented within the `RidgeCV` class. This information will be crucial in identifying the operation that leads to the error when handling integer values in the `alphas` parameter.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"RidgeCV\")\n```\n\n3. The issue specifically mentions a `ValueError` concerning integer powers. Therefore, it might be useful to search the codebase for any operations or functions that raise this specific error, which could be directly related to the handling of the `alphas` parameter or a related computational step inside the `fit` method. This might lead us to the exact point in the code where the issue occurs.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"Integers to negative integer powers are not allowed\")\n```\n\nThese API calls are aimed at:\n- Locating the precise code within the `RidgeCV` class definition and its `fit` method that deals with the `alphas` parameter.\n- Identifying the exact operation or computational step that triggers the `ValueError`.\n- Understanding the context around the problem to guide a potential fix, such as converting integers in the `alphas` parameter to floats internally."
