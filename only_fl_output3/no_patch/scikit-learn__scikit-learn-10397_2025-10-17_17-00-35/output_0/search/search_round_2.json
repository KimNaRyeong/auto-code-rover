This will give us insights into where the issue might be rooted in the project's code base.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"RidgeCV\")\n```\n\n2.

This could imply that the `RidgeCV` class inherits its `fit` method from a parent class, given the object-oriented nature of Python.

Exploring the `_BaseRidgeCV` class to understand how it handles the `fit` method, particularly how it processes the `alphas` parameter.

The class initializer (`__init__`) method defines `alphas` as a tuple with float values by default, and there's a `fit` method available that takes `X`, `y`, and optionally `sample_weight` as its parameters.\n\n2. **Result of search_code(\"alphas=\"):** The search has found multiple snippets containing `alphas=` across various files but most importantly within `sklearn/linear_model/ridge.py` which is directly related to our issue. This hints at multiple points where `alphas` is a significant parameter, not just within `RidgeCV` but possibly in related classes or functions.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?** The `_BaseRidgeCV` class provides a foundation for Ridge regression with cross-validation, including handling the `alphas` parameter which likely influences the regularization strength during model fitting. The `alphas` parameter seems to be pivotal for determining how the regularization term is weighted in the regression.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?** Since `_BaseRidgeCV` directly manages the `alphas` parameter and given that the issue arises when integers are provided in the `alphas` list, it's likely that somewhere within this handling, the code does not accommodate integer values appropriately for all operations (e.g., operations that might involve exponentiation with negative powers in Python which is not allowed for integers). The `fit` method is where this issue likely surfaces because it is where the `alphas` values are utilized to fit the regression model.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?** The intended behavior would be for `_BaseRidgeCV` to gracefully handle `alphas` values that are integer, by either:\n   - Explicitly converting any integer values in the `alphas` parameter to float before performing operations that do not permit integer inputs.\n   - Implementing a check or a warning that guides the user to provide `alphas` in float if an operation within the `fit` process cannot operate on integers, although the former solution is preferable for user-friendliness and backward compatibility.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\n- The code should ensure all values within the `alphas` parameter are converted to floats before any operations are performed on them. This behavior should be implemented in such a way that it preserves the functionality of the code for legacy users (e.g., by silently converting integers to floats without requiring any action from the user). This can likely be achieved in the initialization stage (`__init__` method of `_BaseRidgeCV`) or at the very beginning of the `fit` method where `alphas` are first utilized."

This ensures that downstream operations, particularly those that are sensitive to the type of `alphas` (like exponentiation or divisions that might result in floats or require float inputs), do not raise errors due to integer inputs. This conversion could be implemented as a simple one-liner using a comprehension or `map`, ensuring that all elements of `alphas` are floats right as they are passed to the instance.\n  \n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File:** `sklearn/linear_model/ridge.py`\n  - **Class:** `_BaseRidgeCV`\n  - **Method:** `fit`\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Before any operation involving `alphas` is performed within the `fit` method, ensure that `alphas` have been converted to floats. This acts as a secondary safeguard in case `alphas` are directly manipulated or reassigned within any point before reaching or within the `fit` method itself. It would involve checking the type of `alphas` elements and converting them if necessary. Although ideally, the conversion in `__init__` should suffice, ensuring this within `fit` might protect against future code modifications that bypass `__init__` or reassign `alphas` post-initialization.\n\nThese modifications will ensure that the code is robust against the type of inputs provided to `alphas`, hence addressing the reported issue without disrupting the existing functionality for current users of the library."
