Based on your request, here is a standalone `reproducer.py` file designed to reproduce the reported issue. When executing this script in an environment where the issue is present, it should raise an `AssertionError`. When the issue is fixed, it exits with code 0.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_issue():
    from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeCV
    from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

    try:
        X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=2, noise=0.1)
        # Attempt to fit the RidgeCV model with integer alphas
        ridge = RidgeCV(alphas=[1, 10, 100, 1000]).fit(X, y)
        print("Test passed: No issue detected with integer alphas in RidgeCV.")
        exit(0)
    except ValueError as e:
        if "Integers to negative integer powers are not allowed" in str(e):
            print("Test failed: Issue detected!")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("Issue present: Integers in RidgeCV alphas cause ValueError.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(1)
```

This script specifically checks for the issue regarding integer `alphas` in the `RidgeCV` model from the `sklearn.linear_model` module. If the issue is present (i.e., an exception is raised with the message "Integers to negative integer powers are not allowed"), it will catch the `ValueError`, print a detailed stack trace, raise an `AssertionError`, and exit with code 1 to indicate failure. If the issue is not encountered (no exception is raised when fitting the model), it will print a success message and exit with code 0, indicating that the issue is either fixed or not present. This behavior ensures clear feedback on whether the specific concern being tested for is encountered.
