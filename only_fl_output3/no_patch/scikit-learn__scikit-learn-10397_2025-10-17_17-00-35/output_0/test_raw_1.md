Given the failure in reproducing the original issue due to an environment setup problem rather than the issue itself, we should ensure that the environment is correctly configured with all necessary dependencies installed, including a correctly built version of scikit-learn. Assuming the environment is correctly set up, I will re-provide the `reproducer.py` content as requested but please note that the test failure you experienced is related to the build state of scikit-learn rather than the issue with integers in `RidgeCV` alphas.

However, revisiting the request, it's important to create a script that accurately reproduces the reported issue under the correct conditions. Here is how you can structure `reproducer.py` to test for the issue, ensuring you have a working scikit-learn environment:

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_issue():
    from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeCV
    from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

    try:
        X, y = make_regression()
        # Attempt to fit the RidgeCV model with integer alphas
        ridge = RidgeCV(alphas=[1, 10, 100, 1000]).fit(X, y)
        print("Issue seems to be fixed as no exception was raised.")
    except ValueError as e:
        if "Integers to negative integer powers are not allowed" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("Issue present: Integers in RidgeCV alpha cause ValueError.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        # Exiting with 1 to indicate failure in case the issue is present
        exit(1)
    # Exiting with 0 to indicate success (i.e., issue is fixed or not encountered)
    exit(0)
```

This script checks for the specific issue you've mentioned. It assumes the environment where it's being run has a correctly built and installed version of scikit-learn. If you're still facing the ImportError, ensure scikit-learn is correctly installed in your environment. For issues related to environment setup, it's advisable to reinstall scikit-learn or consult its documentation for troubleshooting the build process.
