This requires searching for these specific LaTeX commands in the codebase to get an idea of where and how they are used.\n   \n2. **Identify Locations for Potential Helper Function Implementation**: The issue suggests creating a helper function like `print_text` to standardize the printing of text in LaTeX. To design this solution well, understanding where LaTeX printing routines are commonly implemented (e.g., in specific classes or files) is crucial. I'll look for patterns in usage that might indicate a centralized location or common classes where such a helper function could be beneficial.\n\nGiven these objectives, I will make the following API calls:\n\n- `search_code(code_str=\"\\\\mathrm\")`: To get context on how and where `\\mathrm` is used throughout the project.\n- `search_code(code_str=\"\\\\text\")`: To get context on how and where `\\text` is used throughout the project.\n\nThese searches should give us a comprehensive overview of the usage patterns for `\\mathrm` and `\\text` in the project, leading to more informed decisions about implementing a solution."
