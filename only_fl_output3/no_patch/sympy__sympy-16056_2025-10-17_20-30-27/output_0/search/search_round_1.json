It seems like there should be one that is standard and that it should be possible to change that by configuration.\n### \\text\n* **Pro** adapts the font to the used math-font, not necessarily a Roman font\n* **Con** Relies on the `amsmath` (or some other `ams*` package\n### \\mathrm\n* **Pro** works in default LaTeX without importing any packages\n* **Con** always gives a Roman (Serif) font, even if the current math font is not Roman\nSome quick grep:ing tells us that there are 123 instances of `\\mathrm` and 46 instances of `\\text` in the .py-files.\nIdeally, this should be configurable, but even then we need to decide on a standard. Personally, I will set it to `\\text` the second it is implemented, but the package dependency may be confusing for newer users. (It seems like both options works in e.g. iPython but I have not explicitly tested, just not noted any issue.)\nProbably the easiest way to implement it is to add a helper function `print_text` or something so people do not have to test at every single instance.\n</issue>"

This requires searching for these specific LaTeX commands in the codebase to get an idea of where and how they are used.\n   \n2. **Identify Locations for Potential Helper Function Implementation**: The issue suggests creating a helper function like `print_text` to standardize the printing of text in LaTeX. To design this solution well, understanding where LaTeX printing routines are commonly implemented (e.g., in specific classes or files) is crucial. I'll look for patterns in usage that might indicate a centralized location or common classes where such a helper function could be beneficial.\n\nGiven these objectives, I will make the following API calls:\n\n- `search_code(code_str=\"\\\\mathrm\")`: To get context on how and where `\\mathrm` is used throughout the project.\n- `search_code(code_str=\"\\\\text\")`: To get context on how and where `\\text` is used throughout the project.\n\nThese searches should give us a comprehensive overview of the usage patterns for `\\mathrm` and `\\text` in the project, leading to more informed decisions about implementing a solution."

Specifically, it mentions `\\\\mathrm{erf}(z)`, `\\\\mathrm{Ei}(z)`, and `\\\\mathrm{li}(z)` functions.\n\n1. **Purpose**: These portions of code are documenting the internal workings and purposes of helper classes for special functions. The use of `\\mathrm` here doesn't affect the runtime execution but instead is meant to clearly communicate mathematical functions in a specific font style (Roman) within the documentation.\n   \n2. **Relation to the Issue**: The use of `\\mathrm` in these contexts shows its necessity for mathematical notation consistency in documentation. However, it reflects a specific choice of typographical style rather than a functional difference that affects calculations or results.\n   \n3. **Intended Behavior**: Since this usage is in documentation, the intended behavior is to maintain clear and consistent notation. The choice between `\\mathrm` and `\\text` here would largely be stylistic, affecting how the documentation is rendered rather than the operation of the code itself.\n\n### Context Analysis for `\\text`\n\nThe search for `\\text` returned snippets from the file `sympy/integrals/meijerint_doc.py`, relating to the generation of documentation strings for Meijer G-functions. The `\\text` command is used to include textual descriptions within mathematical expressions in LaTeX format, specifically for generated symbols and conditions.\n\n1. **Purpose**: This code dynamically generates documentation strings that describe the integration calculations and conditions under which certain formulas apply. The use of `\\text` ensures that the textual components within these mathematical expressions are rendered correctly according to the surrounding math font.\n   \n2. **Relation to the Issue**: The usage here shows the necessity for textual representation within mathematical expressions to adapt to the current math-font settings. This adaptability is a significant consideration for documentation and interface consistency, which might be preferable in many contexts within the project.\n   \n3. **Intended Behavior**: The intended behavior in this context is to generate readable, high-quality documentation strings that incorporate text descriptions seamlessly within mathematical notation, with the font adapting to the math-font settings.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe issue centers on standardizing the way textual elements within LaTeX expressions are handled across the project, potentially through a helper function, and considering making this configurable. The examples shown emphasize the distinction between `\\mathrm` for ensuring a specific font style (Roman) versus `\\text` for adapting text to the current math-font, which could influence the decision on a project-wide standard and how to implement it for both functional and stylistic consistency in mathematical expressions and documentation. Given the contexts, moving towards a configurable approach that defaults to `\\text` but allows for `\\mathrm` when explicitly desired (or in documentation where the font style should be consistent) might offer the flexibility needed to satisfy both presentational quality and backward compatibility with existing LaTeX standards and package dependencies."

Key files include `sympy/functions/special/error_functions.py` and `sympy/integrals/meijerint_doc.py`.\n  \n  **Intended Behavior**: The introduction of a helper function, potentially in a commonly used base or utilities class/file, to abstract the choice between `\\mathrm` and `\\text` based on a project-wide configuration setting. This helper function would accept text to be outputted in LaTeX format and dynamically choose between `\\mathrm` and `\\text` depending on the user or project configuration. This ensures that:\n  \n  - The font style adapts to the used math-font when desirable (default behavior can use `\\text` for adaptability).\n  - LaTeX printing is still possible without additional package dependencies unless explicitly configured to require them (fallback or configurable option to use `\\mathrm`).\n  \n  This approach maintains existing functionality by providing backward compatibility (using `\\mathrm` where no package is available or desired) and enhances the project by allowing dynamic configuration for LaTeX printing preferences (favoring `\\text` for font adaptability)."
