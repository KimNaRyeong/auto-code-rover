It seems like there should be one that is standard and that it should be possible to change that by configuration.\n### \\text\n* **Pro** adapts the font to the used math-font, not necessarily a Roman font\n* **Con** Relies on the `amsmath` (or some other `ams*` package\n### \\mathrm\n* **Pro** works in default LaTeX without importing any packages\n* **Con** always gives a Roman (Serif) font, even if the current math font is not Roman\nSome quick grep:ing tells us that there are 123 instances of `\\mathrm` and 46 instances of `\\text` in the .py-files.\nIdeally, this should be configurable, but even then we need to decide on a standard. Personally, I will set it to `\\text` the second it is implemented, but the package dependency may be confusing for newer users. (It seems like both options works in e.g. iPython but I have not explicitly tested, just not noted any issue.)\nProbably the easiest way to implement it is to add a helper function `print_text` or something so people do not have to test at every single instance.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue regarding `\\mathrm` vs. `\\text` in LaTeX printing routines and their usage, I will perform a series of API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the Usage of `\\mathrm` and `\\text`**: Since the issue description mentioned that these are used in various places, we need to understand the context in which they are used. This requires searching for these specific LaTeX commands in the codebase to get an idea of where and how they are used.\n   \n2. **Identify Locations for Potential Helper Function Implementation**: The issue suggests creating a helper function like `print_text` to standardize the printing of text in LaTeX. To design this solution well, understanding where LaTeX printing routines are commonly implemented (e.g., in specific classes or files) is crucial. I'll look for patterns in usage that might indicate a centralized location or common classes where such a helper function could be beneficial.\n\nGiven these objectives, I will make the following API calls:\n\n- `search_code(code_str=\"\\\\mathrm\")`: To get context on how and where `\\mathrm` is used throughout the project.\n- `search_code(code_str=\"\\\\text\")`: To get context on how and where `\\text` is used throughout the project.\n\nThese searches should give us a comprehensive overview of the usage patterns for `\\mathrm` and `\\text` in the project, leading to more informed decisions about implementing a solution."
