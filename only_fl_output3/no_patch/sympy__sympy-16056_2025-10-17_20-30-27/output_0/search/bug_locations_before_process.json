This helper function would accept text to be outputted in LaTeX format and dynamically choose between `\\mathrm` and `\\text` depending on the user or project configuration. This ensures that:\n\n- The font style adapts to the used math-font when desirable (default behavior can use `\\text` for adaptability).\n- LaTeX printing is still possible without additional package dependencies unless explicitly configured to require them (fallback or configurable option to use `\\mathrm`).\n\nThis approach maintains existing functionality by providing backward compatibility (using `\\mathrm` where no package is available or desired) and enhances the project by allowing dynamic configuration for LaTeX printing preferences (favoring `\\text` for font adaptability)."
