Given the feedback and aiming for an accurate test reproduction of the issue within the constraints specified, I'll adjust the script accordingly. The correction will include a more explicit means to launch Sphinx, accounting for environments where `sphinx-build` might not be directly accessible in the system's PATH or where Sphinx might not be installed globally but within a virtual environment. To streamline the script's execution in such scenarios, Python's subprocess module can be used to explicitly invoke Sphinx via the Python executable.

This script assumes Sphinx is installed in the same Python environment as where the script is executed. If it's not found, it suggests Sphinx might not be installed or not accessible in the current environment, guiding towards resolution.

    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

This revised script aims to directly address the execution context for Sphinx via Python, enhancing compatibility across environments. If Sphinx is correctly set up in the environment from which this script operates, it will proceed to test for the presence of the issue as initially described. Remember, successful execution of this script relies on having Sphinx installed in the current Python environment.
