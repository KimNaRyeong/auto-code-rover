To create a standalone Python file `reproducer.py` that reproduces the described issue with string formatting errors when passing floats as values in {% blocktrans %} tags, we'll simulate a minimal environment that closely mirrors a real Django setup. This involves setting up a dummy translation mechanism without a full Django project. Note that achieving the exact behavior requires simulating parts of Django's template rendering and localization system, which is quite complex. However, for demonstration purposes, a simplified approach is taken here:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def gettext(singular, plural, number):
    translations = {
        "%(counter)s mile away": ["На расстоянии %(counter)s мили", "На расстоянии %(counter)s миль", "На расстоянии %(counter)s миль"],
    }
    try:
        if number == 1:
            return singular % {'counter': number}
        else:
            return plural % {'counter': number}
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

def simulate_blocktrans_behavior():
    person_distance_in_miles = 2.5  # Simulate a float value coming from somewhere, like a database or calculation

    # Normally done by Django's template filter `floatformat` when rendering a template
    # Here we manually format the float to simulate the behavior.
    formatted_distance = "{:.0f}".format(person_distance_in_miles)

    # This simulates the use of {% blocktrans %} with `count` and a float value formatted to a string.
    try:
        # Attempt to reproduce the issue using a simplified gettext call
        message = gettext(
            singular="%(counter)s mile away",
            plural="%(counter)s miles away",
            number=int(formatted_distance)  # Casting to int as suggested as a workaround
        )
        print(message)
        assert False, "Issue should have raised a TypeError"
    except TypeError:
        print("TypeError correctly raised due to passing non-int to formatted string requiring an int.")
        assert True
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        simulate_blocktrans_behavior()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    exit(0)
```

This script tries to replicate the Django `{% blocktrans %} ... {% endblocktrans %}` behavior in a very simplified version using just Python's standard capabilities. The `gettext` function is a highly simplified stand-in for the i18n translation lookup that Django performs during template rendering. This particular reproducer focuses on demonstrating the TypeError when formatting strings and how the script's execution behaves in response to that error.
