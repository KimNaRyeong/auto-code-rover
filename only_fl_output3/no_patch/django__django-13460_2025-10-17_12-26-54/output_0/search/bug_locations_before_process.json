To resolve the issue, `floatformat` could either enforce a numeric-string conversion that always results in a `gettext`-friendly format (e.g., avoiding localization formats that `gettext` may misinterpret as format specifiers), or it could provide clear documentation and/or error handling advising developers on how to format floats for internationalization contexts, preserving the existing functionality while ensuring usability within translation workflows."

        "intended_behavior": "Within the processing of translation tags, specifically cases that handle numbers or formatted strings (like those affected by `floatformat`), `do_translate` (or a closely related function that processes `{% blocktrans %}` tags involving numeric values) should actively check for value types and their compatibility with `gettext` string formatting. If a potential type incompatibility is detected (e.g., a formatted number that could cause format string issues), the function should either correct the formatting or raise a clear, actionable error message. This behavior would prevent `TypeError` from occurring due to type mismatches in translation strings, without altering the core functionality of Django's translation system."
