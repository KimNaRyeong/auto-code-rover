The following search API calls may provide the necessary insights:\n\n1. To understand how Django's `{% blocktrans %}` template tag is implemented and how it handles variables like `counter`, we should look into the corresponding Django code for blocktrans processing. Although the exact class or method names are not provided, we can infer from Django's naming conventions and documentation.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"{% blocktrans count counter=person.distance_in_miles|floatformat:0 %}\")\n```\n\n2.

This involves understanding how Django uses `gettext` for translation, specifically with pluralization.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"do_translate\")\n```\n\n3. The issue description suggests that actively checking the type's compatibility with the string format could be a potential solution. Therefore, we need to see if there's an existing utility or method in Django that deals with type checking or casting before translation occurs. This is a bit speculative since we don't have specific method names, but based on the description, a method that involves type casting or validation before translation could exist.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"floatformat\")\nsearch_method(\"gettext\")\n```\n\nThese API calls are designed to gather information about how the `{% blocktrans %}` template tag works, how Django interacts with `gettext` for translations (especially with numbers), and if there's a mechanism for type checking or conversion before translation, which could be leveraged or improved to address this issue."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insight into how Django handles translations, formatting, and potential causes of the reported issue. Let's break down the results:\n\n### `do_translate` in `django/templatetags/i18n.py`\n\n1. **Purpose:** This method is responsible for marking strings for translation, processing them for the current language, and supporting variable translations and contextual translations. It directly interacts with template tags, such as `{% translate %}`, and potentially `{% blocktrans %}` which is closely related.\n2. **Relation to the Bug:** The bug occurs during the rendering of a `{% blocktrans %}` with a float formatted value. Although `do_translate` specifically pertains to the `{% translate %}`, the underlying mechanisms of translation and variable handling may share commonalities, including how types and formatting are managed before translation.\n3. **Intended Behavior:** The method should allow translation of dynamic content in templates, including proper handling of different data types (e.g., floats) and their formatting. Given the issue, the intended behavior would include either converting types appropriately before passing them to `gettext` or ensuring that the formatting of variables does not lead to type-related errors during translation.\n\n### `floatformat` Filter in Django\n\n1. **Purpose:** The `floatformat` template filter, found in `django/template/defaultfilters.py`, is used to format float variables within templates. It converts a floating point number to a string, allowing for rounding or trimming to a specified number of decimal places.\n2. **Relation to the Bug:** The issue specifically mentions that using `floatformat` with a float in a `{% blocktrans %}` tag results in an error. The use of `floatformat` should translate the float to a string that `gettext` can process without type errors.\n3. **Intended Behavior:** When `floatformat` is applied to a float in the context of a `{% blocktrans %}` tag, it should ensure the float is formatted as a string in a way that is compatible with the `gettext` function, avoiding type errors during string formatting.\n\n### `gettext` Method Variants in Django\n\n1. **Purpose:** Different variants of the `gettext` method (found in `django/utils/translation/trans_real.py`, `django/utils/translation/__init__.py`, and `django/utils/translation/trans_null.py`) handle the actual translation of strings marked for translation, using the current or default translation object as appropriate.\n2. **Relation to the Bug:** The reported `TypeError` occurs because `gettext`'s string formatting fails when a float is passed. This indicates a possible mismatch or oversight in type handling between `floatformat`'s output and `gettext`'s input expectations.\n3. **Intended Behavior:** `gettext` should either gracefully handle various data types formatted as strings, or there should be a check ensuring that types passed to `gettext` are compatible with its formatting capabilities. For non-string inputs that can't be naturally handled, an explicit conversion or error message guiding the developer could be ideal.\n\nBased on these observations, the problem seems to lie at the intersection of data type formatting by `floatformat` and type expectations of the `gettext` method. A potential fix should ensure that any value passed to `gettext` through a `blocktrans` tag is appropriately typed and formatted to prevent `TypeError`. This could involve better type management within the translation tags or a pre-validation step to ensure compatibility before invoking `gettext`."

To resolve the issue, `floatformat` could either enforce a numeric-string conversion that always results in a `gettext`-friendly format (e.g., avoiding localization formats that `gettext` may misinterpret as format specifiers), or it could provide clear documentation and/or error handling advising developers on how to format floats for internationalization contexts, preserving the existing functionality while ensuring usability within translation workflows.\n\n**Bug Location 2:**\n   - **File:** `django/templatetags/i18n.py`\n   - **Function:** `do_translate`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Within the processing of translation tags, specifically cases that handle numbers or formatted strings (like those affected by `floatformat`), `do_translate` (or a closely related function that processes `{% blocktrans %}` tags involving numeric values) should actively check for value types and their compatibility with `gettext` string formatting. If a potential type incompatibility is detected (e.g., a formatted number that could cause format string issues), the function should either correct the formatting or raise a clear, actionable error message. This behavior would prevent `TypeError` from occurring due to type mismatches in translation strings, without altering the core functionality of Django's translation system.\n\nThese changes aim to ensure that Django's template engine handles floats within translation tags in a robust, error-resistant manner, thereby addressing the issue without negatively impacting existing functionalities or performance."
