        "content": "<issue>Float constructor should allow to set binary precision\nI discussed this in some other issues, but I don't think I've opened an issue for it.\nThe Float constructor only allows you to set the decimal precision. It then converts this to binary precision and saves that in `Float._prec`.\nThe problem here is that there are fewer decimal precisions than binary precisions. For example:\n```\nIn [9]: Float(1.0, 15)._prec\nOut[9]: 53\nIn [10]: Float(1.0, 16)._prec\nOut[10]: 56\n```\nSo for instance, if you had a float that used 54 binary digits, it would be difficult to create a Float from it. I'm not even sure if it's possible, since in the current constructor, the `prec` argument overrides the fourth argument of a tuple input.\nOne issue here is that everywhere else in the\u00a0Sympy and mpmath code, `prec` refers to binary precision and `dps` refers to decimal precision. But currently, the second argument to `Float` is called `prec`, but refers to the decimal precision. So ideally, it should be\n```\nFloat(s, dps=15, prec=53)\n```\nwhere `Float(s, prec=54)` would override the default value of `dps=15`, and calling both (even consistently), like `Float(s, dps=15, prec=54)` would be an error.\nSince the keyword argument name has to change, it would be a backwards compatibility break for anyone who calls Float like `Float(s, prec=20)`.  Ideally this would require a deprecation cycle, but it's not possible to detect if someone is calling `Float(s, prec=20)` meaning the old way (20 decimal digits) or the new way (20 binary digits). The good news is that `N` and `evalf` call this argument `n`, so there's no need to change things there.\n</issue>"

It has several methods and properties, including special methods for arithmetic operations, comparison, and formatting, among others. The class stores the floating-point value and its precision in binary digits (`_prec`).\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   The issue centers around the constructor of the `Float` class, more specifically, how it handles and interprets the precision of floating-point numbers. Though the API call to find the `__init__` method explicitly failed, it's evident that the construction and manipulation of `Float` objects are closely related to the issue, as it deals with precision conversion and storage.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   The intended behavior would be to allow users to specify either binary precision directly (`prec`) or decimal precision (`dps`), handling these inputs distinctly and correctly, which could involve modifying or extending the constructor's capabilities.\n\n### Analysis of Usage of `_prec`\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n   The `_prec` attribute is used extensively across various parts of the Sympy library, including simplification, assumptions handling, printing, and within the core `Float` implementation. It likely represents the binary precision of floating-point numbers in these contexts.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   The handling and interpretation of `_prec` are central to the bug since `_prec` is meant to store binary precision, but there's a mismatch in expectations when using the constructor of `Float`. This discrepancy leads to potential confusion and misuse, affecting how precision is managed across Sympy.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   Ideally, all manipulations and references to `_prec` throughout the code should align with the clarified constructor behavior, distinguishing between binary and decimal precision while maintaining backward compatibility as much as possible.\n\n### Analysis of Handling of Precision (`prec=`)\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n   The search results for `prec=` show that this keyword is used in a variety of contexts throughout the Sympy library, not just in the construction of `Float` objects but also in functions and methods related to physics, geometry, simplification, etc., indicating its importance in controlling the precision of calculations.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   The issue mentioned clarifies a specific problem with the use of `prec` in the `Float` constructor, where it is ambiguously used to denote decimal precision, contrasting the more common use of `prec` elsewhere in the library to denote binary precision.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   The use of `prec` across the library, especially within the `Float` constructor, should be standardized to eliminate confusion. This might involve renaming the parameter in the `Float` constructor to match the established binary/decimal precision convention (`dps` for decimal, `prec` for binary) and ensuring that handling is consistent and logical throughout the codebase, including error handling when both `prec` and `dps` are specified.\n\n---\n\nGiven this analysis, further steps to address the issue might involve detailed examination and potentially refactoring of the `Float` class constructor to correctly interpret and prioritize `prec` and `dps` arguments. Adding clear documentation and error messages to guide user input might also be necessary."

To resolve the issue, the constructor's parameters should be adjusted to include both `dps` and `prec` as keyword arguments, with a clear distinction between their purposes:  \n\n   - `dps` should specify the decimal precision of the float.  \n   - `prec` should specify the binary precision directly.  \n\n   If both `dps` and `prec` are provided, the method should raise an error to prevent ambiguity. This approach will address the current confusion and maintain the precision semantics used elsewhere in SymPy and mpmath.  \n\n   Additionally, the internal handling of these parameters should prioritize `prec` if both are provided (though, as mentioned, ideally, providing both should raise an error), and update the `_prec` attribute accordingly. This change ensures that the `Float` class behavior aligns with the proposed functionality, preserving the existing functionality while incorporating the new precision handling capability.\n\n   Incorporating this change requires a careful approach to maintain backward compatibility as much as possible, possibly through deprecation warnings if the old `prec` parameter usage is detected."
