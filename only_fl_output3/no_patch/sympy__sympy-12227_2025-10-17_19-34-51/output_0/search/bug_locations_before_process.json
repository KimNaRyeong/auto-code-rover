        "intended_behavior": "The constructor of the Float class should be modified to accurately distinguish between binary precision (prec) and decimal precision (dps). To resolve the issue, the constructor's parameters should be adjusted to include both dps and prec as keyword arguments, with a clear distinction between their purposes:\n\n- dps should specify the decimal precision of the float.\n- prec should specify the binary precision directly.\n\nIf both dps and prec are provided, the method should raise an error to prevent ambiguity. This approach will address the current confusion and maintain the precision semantics used elsewhere in SymPy and mpmath.\n\nAdditionally, the internal handling of these parameters should prioritize prec if both are provided (though, as mentioned, ideally, providing both should raise an error), and update the _prec attribute accordingly. This change ensures that the Float class behavior aligns with the proposed functionality, preserving the existing functionality while incorporating the new precision handling capability.\n\nIncorporating this change requires a careful approach to maintain backward compatibility as much as possible, possibly through deprecation warnings if the old prec parameter usage is detected."
