To effectively reproduce the described issue and ensure the test script raises an `AssertionError` when the issue is present (and not otherwise), the script needs to check the behavior of the `Float` constructor specifically with respect to handling binary and decimal precision. Given the nature of the issue, the key is demonstrating that specifying a decimal precision doesn't accurately reflect or allow setting of the exact binary precision needed.

By incorporating direct assertions related to binary precision, we can force an `AssertionError` when the constructor doesn't work as desired (i.e., not allowing direct setting of binary precision), and ensure the script exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed (through a hypothetical interface update allowing for explicit binary precision setting).

Let's modify the script considering these points:

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_float_constructor_binary_precision():
    from sympy import Float, S
    try:
        # The issue is that we cannot directly set the binary precision,
        # and the conversion from decimal to binary precision is not one-to-one.
        
        # Attempt to set binary precision implicitly through decimal precision
        # and verify if the retrieved binary precision matches.
        
        f1 = Float(S(1)/3, 15)  # Attempt with decimal precision
        f2_prec_expected = 53   # Binary precision expected after setting decimal precision 15

        assert f1._prec == f2_prec_expected, f"Expected binary precision {f2_prec_expected}, got {f1._prec}"

        print("Issue appears to be unresolved; test did not fail as expected.")

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)  # Expected failure path for the issue reproduction
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit successfully since the issue is reproduced

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_float_constructor_binary_precision()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

sys.exit(1)  # If we reach here, there was an unexpected issue running the test
```

This script focuses on capturing the specific confusion between decimal precision and binary precision in the `Float` constructor as described in the original issue. The test deliberately targets the core of the issue, which is the inability to properly set binary precision directly and checks for the exact `AssertionError` to validate the problem.
