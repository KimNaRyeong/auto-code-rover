        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how `matplotlib` deals with constrained layouts, especially focusing on how it calculates the space needed for wrapped titles. Since the bug is related to the constrained layout not leaving enough space for wrapped titles, it's crucial to look at the implementation details of both the layout management and how titles are handled, especially when wrapped. \n\nBased on the issue description, the following API calls would be relevant to get sufficient context:\n1. **Search for the constrained layout implementation**: Since the issue mentions the problem occurs with the constrained layout, understanding how this layout is implemented can provide insights into where the calculation might be lacking in terms of space for wrapped titles.\n    - `search_method(\"constrained_layout\")`\n\n2. **Search for how titles are set and handled when wrapping is enabled**: Since the issue specifically arises with titles that are wrapped, it's necessary to look into how titles are set with wrapping and how their dimensions are calculated.\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"set_title\", \"Axes\")`\n    - `search_code(\"wrap=True\")`\n\n3. **Search for suptitle handling in figures**: The issue also mentions that the `fig.suptitle` with `wrap=True` doesn't leave enough space, so understanding how super titles are handled in figures would be beneficial.\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"suptitle\", \"Figure\")`\n\n4. **Look into how text wrapping is calculated**: Given that explicit new lines don't cause the issue, it suggests that the automatic wrapping calculation might be misestimating the required space.\n    - `search_code(\"get_window_extent\")`\n\nThese searches aim to gather code context related to the constrained layout's space calculation, setting titles with wrapping on axes and figures, and how text wrapping might affect layout space calculations."
