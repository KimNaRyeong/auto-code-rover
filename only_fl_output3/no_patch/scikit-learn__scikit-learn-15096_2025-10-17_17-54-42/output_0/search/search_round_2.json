I set the param grid by inputing transformers or estimators at different steps of the pipeline, following the Pipeline documentation:\n> A step\u2019s estimator may be replaced entirely by setting the parameter with its name to another estimator, or a transformer removed by setting to None.\nI couldn't figure why dumping cv_results_ would take so much memory on disk. It happens that cv_results_['params'] and all cv_results_['param_*'] objects contains fitted estimators, as much as there are points on my grid.\nThis bug should happen only when n_jobs = 1 (which is my usecase).\nI don't think this is intended (else the arguments and attributes _refit_ and _best_\\__estimator_ wouldn't be used).\nMy guess is that during the grid search, those estimator's aren't cloned before use (which could be a problem if using the same grid search several times, because estimators passed in the next grid would be fitted...).\n#### Version: 0.19.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the information gathered from the API calls, let's dive into the context and functionality of each part to understand their relationship with the reported issue.\n\n### 1. GridSearchCV Class Context\nThe `GridSearchCV` class extends `BaseSearchCV` and is designed for fitting and evaluating a model by searching over specified parameter values for an estimator. The class initialization parameters include `estimator`, `param_grid`, and `n_jobs`, among others, which are directly relevant to the reported issue.\n\n**Relation to the bug:** The issue describes a problem where `cv_results_['params']` and all `cv_results_['param_*']` objects contain fitted estimators when they should only include parameters used for evaluation. The presence of `GridSearchCV` and its parameters in the context of this problem suggests that the mechanism for handling estimator instances during the search might be cloning them incorrectly or not at all before fitting, leading to the unexpected storage of fitted models in the results.\n\n**Intended behavior:** The expected behavior would involve `GridSearchCV` utilizing clones of estimator parameters for each point in the parameter grid, ensuring that only the parameter configurations (and not the fitted estimators themselves) are stored in `cv_results_`. This would prevent the significant increase in memory usage when dumping `cv_results_`.\n\n### 2. clone Function Context\nThe `clone` function is crucial for creating a new estimator with the same configuration as an existing one without copying attached dataset. It deeply copies the model parameters, facilitating a clean setup for each grid search iteration.\n\n**Relation to the bug:** Since the `clone` function is designed to replicate estimators without their fitted data, the issue could arise from either the `clone` function not being called when it should be or the cloning process somehow retaining fitted estimator states, contrary to expectations.\n\n**Intended behavior:** The correct use of the `clone` function within `GridSearchCV` should ensure that each parameter grid point evaluated uses a fresh copy of the estimator, thus preventing any cross-contamination of state between grid search iterations. Each grid point's fit should not affect the others, and the memory footprint should be limited to the parameters themselves, not the potentially large fitted models.\n\n### Additional Analysis Required\nAlthough the method `fit` in the `GridSearchCV` class was not directly retrieved, understanding its implementation is critical since it would be where the cloning and fitting processes occur. Given that the `fit` method wasn't found in the original search, exploring how `GridSearchCV` invokes fitting processes and specifically how it handles the cloning of estimators for each grid point could further illuminate the cause of the issue.\n\nAdditionally, inspecting any modifications or overrides to the `fit` method from `BaseSearchCV`, if `GridSearchCV` inherits behaviors that might circumvent cloning or improper handling of params, could be insightful. It would also be worth verifying if `n_jobs = 1` affects the behavior of estimator handling uniquely, as suggested by the issue description.\n\nGiven the collected context and analysis, the next steps might include:\n- Investigating `BaseSearchCV` for inherited behaviors, specifically around the `fit` process and cloning.\n- Exploring how `n_jobs` parameter affects the grid search process in `GridSearchCV`.\n- Verifying the cloning process's correctness within the grid search to ensure parameters are handled as expected, without keeping fitted instances in the results collection.\n\nThis analysis sets the stage for a deeper dive to locate the exact source of the bug, with a focus on ensuring that `GridSearchCV` correctly clones estimators before fitting them in the context of a grid search."

The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This is to prevent fitted estimators from being saved inadvertently in `cv_results_['params']` and `cv_results_['param_*']` objects. Specifically, the cloning process should be verified or adjusted to ensure it is performed before any fitting operation during the grid search iterations, especially when `n_jobs = 1`. The cloned estimator should then be fitted with the training data, ensuring that only parameter configurations\u2014not fitted models\u2014are stored in the `cv_results_`. This approach will preserve the existing functionality for hyperparameter tuning while resolving the memory issues caused by storing fitted models in the results.\n   \n   In summary, the `fit` method of `GridSearchCV` needs to ensure all estimators are cloned using the `clone` function from `sklearn.base` before fitting, regardless of the `n_jobs` setting. This step ensures that the grid search process retains its intended behavior of evaluating different parameter combinations without mistakenly storing bulky fitted estimators, thus minimizing the memory footprint and maintaining the integrity of the `cv_results_` structure."

        "content": "After reviewing the collected context, let\u2019s delve into the analysis for each part of the code to determine its function, relationship with the bug, and the intended behavior relative to the issue description.\n\n### Analysis of the `fit` Method in `GridSearchCV`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `fit` function in `GridSearchCV` orchestrates the entire grid search process. This involves:\n- Preparing the cross-validation (CV) splits from the input data `X`, `y`, and `groups`.\n- Cloning the base estimator for safety and to ensure that the original estimator is not altered during the grid search process.\n- Launching parallel jobs, if specified, to conduct the fitting and scoring of each parameter combination in the grid across all CV splits. This is done through `_fit_and_score` with cloned estimators to prevent data leakage and ensure independence between CV folds.\n- Collecting and formatting the results into the `cv_results_` attribute, which includes scores, timings, and parameter settings for each grid point.\n- Identifying the best parameter set based on the selected metric and refitting the best model on the entire dataset if `refit` is True.\n\n#### Relationship with the Bug\n\nThe crucial elements in relation to the bug include the mechanisms of cloning and fitting estimators (`clone(base_estimator)`), and how results are stored and managed (`self.cv_results_ = results`). Since the issue reports that `cv_results_['params']` retains references to fitted estimators, the problem likely resides in how each estimator's fit is managed or how their parameters are stored post-fit, indicating that despite cloning, the estimator's state might be incorrectly preserved in `cv_results_`.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\n\nThe intended behavior should ensure that `cv_results_` only retains the parameter settings used for each grid point without holding onto references to the actually fitted estimators. This means:\n- **Cloning process**: Ensure it effectively prevents any carried-over state from one fit to another, making sure that `clone` creates a truly fresh instance of the estimator for each grid search iteration.\n- **Storing parameters**: Review how parameter settings are copied and ensure that they do not inadvertently contain references to fitted model instances. This might involve deep copying parameter values or correctly handling estimator parameters to ensure they're not storing complex objects (like fitted estimators) directly in `cv_results_`.\n\n### Analysis of the Occurrences of `n_jobs` in `GridSearchCV`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThese snippets relate to the initialization and use of the `n_jobs` parameter within `GridSearchCV`, which controls the number of parallel jobs to run during the search. `n_jobs` affects how `fit` leverages parallel processing, potentially impacting the isolation between parallel processes and how they interact with the cloning and fitting of estimators.\n\n#### Relationship with the Bug\n\nGiven that the bug manifests with `n_jobs = 1`, suggesting that the parallelization is not the root cause but how resources are managed in a single-threaded context. The handling of cloned estimators in a non-parallel or minimal parallel environment might not adequately isolate each fit, possibly due to the way memory or estimator references are managed.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\n\nThe handling of `n_jobs` should ensure that even when running sequentially (`n_jobs = 1`), each estimator is cloned, fitted, and disposed of correctly without influencing others. This involves:\n- Making sure that the `Parallel` utility (or its absence, in the case of `n_jobs = 1`) does not affect the cloning and fitting isolation.\n- Ensuring result compilation (`self.cv_results_`) correctly aggregates only the necessary information (params and scores) without including any stateful objects derived from the fitting process.\n\n---\nGiven these analyses, it\u2019s clear that while we\u2019ve pinpointed potential locations and conceptual flaws linked to the bug, a deeper dive into how exactly parameters are copied and stored in `cv_results_` could further elucidate the specific mechanic failure. The next steps would involve patching these identified methods to preserve functionality while adhering more closely to the intended behaviors outlined."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue.

This implies enhancing the mechanism that extracts parameters from the estimator for storage in `cv_results_` to ensure it decouples the parameter data from the actual estimator instances which might be stateful after fitting. A safe and deep copy of parameter values should be made when collecting the results for `cv_results_`, ensuring that only immutable, serializable data reflecting the configuration\u2014not the state\u2014of used estimators are stored. This ensures the serialized `cv_results_` is compact and does not unexpectedly increase in size due to storing complex objects like fitted estimators.\n\n**Clarifications and Rationalizations**:\n- **Preserving existing functionality**: This adjustment aims to address the memory size issues and unintended behavior reported without altering the core functionality and purpose of `GridSearchCV`. Users will continue to benefit from the detailed cross-validation results for hyperparameter tuning, with the added improvement of reduced memory footprint and storage size when handling `cv_results_`.\n- **Correctness and Efficiency**: Ensuring that `cv_results_` contains only parameters and not actual estimator instances also aligns with the principle of correctness and efficiency. It prevents potential bugs related to undesired mutations of estimator instances post-fitting and optimizes the use and handling of system resources.\n\nBy rectifying the method of storing parameter settings in `cv_results_`, the issue reported should be resolved, ensuring `GridSearchCV` operates as intended and within expected resource utilization norms."
