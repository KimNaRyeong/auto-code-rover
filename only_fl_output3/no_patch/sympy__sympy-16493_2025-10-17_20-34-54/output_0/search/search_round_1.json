The mention of a pull request (PR) https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/15271 suggests that this change is indeed recent, or it pertains to a very specific part of the project. Since direct method search yielded no results, I will proceed with an alternative strategy:\n\n1. **Search by Code Snippet Related to the PR Number**: Sometimes, the commit messages or comments within the code might mention the PR number. Searching for the PR number itself or a snippet of code that mentions it could help locate the relevant files or code.\n\n2. **Broaden the Search to Classes or Files That May Contain the Method**: If the `.replace_with_arrays` method pertains to a specific functionality (like matrix operations, transformations, etc.), it's logical to search for classes or files that might deal with such functionality.\n\n3. **Manual Identification and Inspection**: Without specific names of classes or files to target, searching broadly for keywords like \"replace\" and \"arrays\" could also yield potential leads, though this approach may return a large volume of unrelated code.\n\nBased on these strategies, let's perform a couple of targeted search API calls:\n\n1. **Search for Code Snippet Mentioning the PR Number**: This could help identify files or code comments referencing the PR where the method was introduced.\n\n2. **Search for Keywords \"replace\" and \"arrays\"**: This broad search might help in identifying potential classes or methods that are related to the functionality of `.replace_with_arrays`.\n\nSince the first strategy requires knowledge about the content of the PR (which I cannot directly retrieve or analyze), I'll proceed with the second strategy to potentially identify related classes or methods:\n\n- `search_code(\"replace\")`\n- `search_code(\"arrays\")`"

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.
