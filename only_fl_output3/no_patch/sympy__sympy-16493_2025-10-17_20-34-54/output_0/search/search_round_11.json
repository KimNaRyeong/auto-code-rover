Since the direct search did not yield results and the broad search returns an overwhelming amount of data, a more targeted approach is needed. It is crucial to focus on files that are more likely to contain matrix or array-related operations. \n\nBased on the general structure and function naming conventions observed in SymPy, and considering where a `replace_with_arrays` method might logically be found, files under the `sympy/matrices` domain stand out as the most probable locations for relevant code. \n\nTo refine the search and get closer to the specific code context needed:\n1. Investigate files related to matrix functionality, given the method name suggests working with arrays or similar data structures. The relevant files might be those within the `sympy/matrices` folder, such as `matrices.py`, `sparse.py`, `common.py`, etc.\n2. Look for methods or classes that typically deal with \"replacement\" or \"substitution\" operations within matrices, as they are likely to have contextual relevance to the `.replace_with_arrays` method.\n\nGiven this analysis and the need to further refine our search scope based on the probable relevance to the issue at hand, the next step is to directly investigate the `matrices` related files mentioned in the search result. Here are the most relevant API calls that would help narrow down the search, focusing specifically on the `sympy/matrices` area:\n\n- search_code_in_file(\"replace_with_arrays\", \"sympy/matrices/matrices.py\")\n- search_code_in_file(\"replace_with_arrays\", \"sympy/matrices/sparse.py\")\n- search_code_in_file(\"replace_with_arrays\", \"sympy/matrices/common.py\")\n\nThese targeted searches will likely provide the specific locations necessary to understand the `replace_with_arrays` method's context and its interactions, allowing for a focused analysis of how to address making the `indices` parameter optional."
