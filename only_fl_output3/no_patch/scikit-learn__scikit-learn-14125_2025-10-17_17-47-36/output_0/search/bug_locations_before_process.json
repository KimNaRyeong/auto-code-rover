        "intended_behavior": "The `type_of_target` method should be modified to remove the check for `SparseSeries` since it is deprecated. Instead, the method should properly handle a `pandas.Series` with sparse values. This involves ensuring that checks or functionality that previously depended on `SparseSeries` being identified are updated or removed. The updated method should seamlessly work with sparse data represented in the new recommended format (i.e., a `Series` with sparse values), without throwing errors or rejecting the data type. The intended behavior change assures that `type_of_target` remains a robust method for identifying the type of target provided to it, including when the targets are represented in a sparse format using the updated pandas data structure."
