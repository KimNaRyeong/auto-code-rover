A potential fix could involve updating the import paths to match the current structure of the `py` library, or conditionally importing based on version checks if the `py` library's version is indeed central to the issue. It could also involve modifying the benchmarking functionality to not depend on the specific, possibly deprecated, modules or classes from `py` library, hence preserving the existing functionality of benchmarking in `sympy` while ensuring compatibility with the current and future versions of dependencies."
