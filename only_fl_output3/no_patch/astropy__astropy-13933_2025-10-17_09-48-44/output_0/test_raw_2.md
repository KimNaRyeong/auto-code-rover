Given the confusion and the requirement to provide a revised version of `reproducer.py`, I'll include the requested stack trace printing functionality directly within the script to ensure any exception raised by the attempt to use `to_string` on a pickled and unpickled `Angle` object is caught and displayed effectively. This ensures that if the script fails due to the issue described, it will raise an `AssertionError` showing the issue is present or print a detailed stack trace utilizing the provided function.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import pickle
    import astropy.coordinates as coord
    import astropy.units as u

    # Create an Angle object and serialize (pickle) it.
    ang = coord.Angle(0.25 * u.hourangle)
    serialized_ang = pickle.dumps(ang)

    # Deserialize (unpickle) the Angle object.
    pang = pickle.loads(serialized_ang)

    try:
        # The original Angle should work to be converted to string
        ang_string = ang.to_string()

        # Attempt to convert the unpickled Angle to string, which is expected to fail and raise an exception.
        pang_string = pang.to_string()

        # If pang.to_string() does not raise an exception, we assert to ensure the behavior is unexpectedly correct,
        # raising an AssertionError if they diverge.
        assert ang_string == pang_string, "The to_string outputs are not the same. Issue present."

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # If an error occurs because of the bug, exit with status code 1.

    # If no exception is raised, prints success message.
    print("Success: The issue is not reproduced. Pickled and unpickled objects behave as expected.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script will attempt to reproduce the issue by serializing and then deserializing an `Angle` object, followed by making a call to `.to_string()` method. The expected behavior is to correctly output the string representation of the angle both before and after pickling without raising an exception. If an exception is raised during the `pang.to_string()` call, which is indicative of reproducing the issue, it will be caught, and the stack trace will be printed as asked. If the script exits with code 1, the issue is successfully reproduced, showing that the bug detailed in the description exists. If it prints the success message and exits with code 0, it indicates the issue might have been resolved or is not present under the tested conditions.
