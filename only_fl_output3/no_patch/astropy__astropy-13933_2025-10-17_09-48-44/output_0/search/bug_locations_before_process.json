        "intended_behavior": "The `to_string` method should ensure that after an `Angle` object is unpickled, it retains its ability to correctly represent its value in sexagesimal notation when the unit is either `hourangle` or `degree`. This suggests that the method correctly interacts with the unit attribute of the `Angle` object post-unpickling, without loss of information or misinterpretation of its unit's ability to be represented in sexagesimal notation.\n\nTo resolve the issue, it might be necessary to verify and ensure that the unit of the `Angle` object, once unpickled, is correctly identified and processed within the `to_string` method. This could involve checking how the unpickling process affects the properties of the `Angle` object, specifically the unit, and if required, implementing a mechanism to correctly re-associate or validate the unit's compatibility with sexagesimal notation post-unpickling.\n\nThe intended change must preserve the existing functionality of the `to_string` method, allowing for both unpickled and newly instantiated `Angle` objects to be correctly represented in either decimal or sexagesimal notation based on their units and provided method arguments. This involves ensuring that any fix does not alter the behavior for objects that have not been through the pickling process, maintaining backward compatibility and existing functionality for existing users of the method."
