This updated script, when run via `python3 reproducer.py` in the root directory of the project, aims to reproduce the issue described where calling `to_string` on an Angle object fails after pickling and unpickling. The `print_stacktrace` function is used to provide a detailed traceback upon encountering errors. It checks for equality in string representations before and after pickling to confirm if the issue is present, resulting in an assertion error if they diverge or if any exception occurs linked to the issue. If the problem persists, the script will indicate failure by printing a stack trace and exiting with code 1. Otherwise, it will print a success message and exit with code 0, suggesting the issue might be resolved or not present.
