The script `reproducer.py` is designed to reproduce the issue described. It attempts to pickle and unpickle an `astropy.coordinates.Angle` object and then call the `to_string` function on both the original and unpickled object. The script uses an `assert` statement to ensure that both the original and the unpickled object can correctly produce a string representation without throwing a `ValueError`. In the case where the issue surfaces as described, the script catches the exception and prints a stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. It will exit with code `1` to indicate failure due to the issue being present. If no issue is encountered, it prints a success message and exits with code `0`, indicating the problem has been resolved or does not exist in the tested environment.
