I'll perform the following search API calls to gather necessary code context:\n\n- `search_method(\"run_pyreverse\")`: This will help us understand how `run_pyreverse` is currently implemented within the `pylint` framework, which is crucial for understanding the existing mechanism for triggering `pyreverse`.\n- `search_class(\"PNG\")`: Since the desired solution mentions `pylint.PNG`, we need to check if this is an existing constant representing the output format or if a new constant needs to be introduced.\n- `search_code(\"pyreverse -o png -p\")`: This search is aimed at locating where in the codebase the pyreverse CLI is being interpreted or handled directly, which might provide insights into how command line arguments are currently processed.\n- `search_method(\"pyreverse\")`: Although it's part of the desired solution and might not exist yet, this search is to ensure there's no existing method by this name that could be related or potentially repurposed for this functionality."
