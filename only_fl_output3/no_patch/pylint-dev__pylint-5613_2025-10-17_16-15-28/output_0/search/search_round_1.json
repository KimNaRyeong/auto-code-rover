It imports `PyreverseRun` from `pylint.pyreverse.main` and executes it with arguments passed through `sys.argv[1:]`.\n   - **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n     The issue described is related to the cumbersome way of invoking `pyreverse` by manipulating `sys.argv`. Currently, `run_pyreverse` directly takes arguments from `sys.argv`, which aligns with the problem statement seeking a more straightforward API.\n   - **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n     Ideally, this method (or a similar one) should provide a way to programmatically set options for `pyreverse` without the need for `sys.argv` manipulation, as indicated in the desired solution.\n\nGiven the insights:\n\n- Since there was no class `PNG` or code related to `pyreverse -o png -p`, it's likely that these functionalities are implicit or handled in a more generalized manner not specifically tied to `PNG` as an output format in the codebase.\n- The inability to find an existing method `pyreverse` suggests there's room to create such an API method, fulfilling the user's request for a more accessible interface.\n\nTo move forward, more context around how `pyreverse` options are processed and how output formats are handled is needed. Given the findings, relevant next steps could include:\n\n- Investigating `PyreverseRun` class to understand its constructor and execution flow. This could reveal how arguments are parsed and used, providing a clue on how to incorporate the new API.\n- Since `PNG` class or constant was not found, more information is needed on how `pyreverse` manages output formats (`-o png`). It would be beneficial to better understand the mechanism of specifying output formats.\n\nHence, the next set of API calls should focus on:\n\n- `search_class(\"PyreverseRun\")`: To get insights into its construction and methods, which could help in crafting the new API.\n- `search_code(\"output format\")` or something equivalent (like `search_code(\"-o png\")`): Since the former search did not yield results for `pyreverse -o png -p`, it might be necessary to understand how output formats are generally handled, but given the explicit nature of the string, this might need some rephrasing or generalization in search keywords.\n"

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This could involve creating a new function in `pylint/__init__.py` or within the `PyreverseRun` class that accepts these arguments directly and invokes the pyreverse tool accordingly. This method should maintain the existing functionality for users who prefer the CLI while providing a more Pythonic way for programmatic usage.\n\n   - **Location 2:** To accurately specify this location, more context is needed on how `PyreverseRun` is structured and operates. However, once `PyreverseRun` is understood:\n     - **Intended Behavior:** If adjustment within `PyreverseRun` is necessary to facilitate the new, more Pythonic API, ensure it can process input parameters (such as `output`, `project`, and `files`) directly in a method, without relying on `sys.argv`. This adjustment should seamlessly integrate with existing mechanisms that handle arguments and options within `PyreverseRun`, enhancing its flexibility for both CLI and programmatic usage."
