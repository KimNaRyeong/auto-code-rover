Below is the `reproducer.py` file designed to replicate the described issue. When you run this script, it attempts to use the current awkward method for invoking `pyreverse` through `pylint`, as highlighted in the issue. It then checks for the existence of a more direct and user-friendly API for calling `pyreverse`. The assertion fails because, as of the last update, `pylint` doesn't provide such an API, demonstrating the issue. Ensure `pylint` is installed in your environment before running this script.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_current_pyreverse_method():
    import pylint
    import sys

    name = "TestProject"
    files = ["file1.py", "file2.py"]

    sys.argv = 'pyreverse -o png -p'.split() + [name] + files
    try:
        pylint.run_pyreverse()
    except SystemExit as se:
        print("SystemExit caught as expected with the current method.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)

def check_desired_solution():
    import pylint

    name = "TestProject"
    files = ["file1.py", "file2.py"]

    try:
        # Attempt to use the desired, more intuitive API.
        pylint.pyreverse(output=pylint.PNG, project=name, files=files)
        return True
    except AttributeError as e:
        print("Desired method not available.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    return False

def main():
    run_current_pyreverse_method()  # Run current method to demonstrate it works albeit in a quirky way.

    # Assert that the new, cleaner API exists. This will raise an AssertionError if the issue is still present.
    assert check_desired_solution(), "The more intuitive API for pyreverse does not exist."

    print("The issue is fixed, exiting with code 0.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    exit(0)
```

This script precisely targets your requirements by attempting to execute the existing cumbersome procedure and checking for a wished for simpler, more direct API. The `assert` statement will trigger an `AssertionError` if the new API doesn't exist, fulfilling its role to raise an alert when the problem persists. If the problem is fixed, it'll quietly exit with a status code of 0, indicating success.
