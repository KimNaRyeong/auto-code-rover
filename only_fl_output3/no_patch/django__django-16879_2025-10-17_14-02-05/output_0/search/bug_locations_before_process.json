        "intended_behavior": "The `aggregate` method should be able to correctly resolve and use fields that have been added to a `QuerySet` through an annotation, especially when referenced in further aggregate or conditional expressions as seen in the provided issue report. This implies enhancing the mechanism within Django's ORM that interprets field references in such expressions, possibly requiring adjustments in how queries are chained or how field names are resolved during the aggregation phase. The behavior should ensure that aggregated fields can be referenced without causing a `FieldError`."

The `Case` expression should accurately handle aggregated fields derived from annotations, ensuring that these fields are correctly identified and utilized in the conditional logic without causing resolution errors."
