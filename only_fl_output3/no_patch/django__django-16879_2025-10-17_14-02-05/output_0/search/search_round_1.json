To avoid a zero division problem, we were using a Case-When clause over that field. It works well on any 4.1 and prior versions but stopped working since 4.2, raising a FieldError like:\nCannot resolve keyword 'sum_total_objs' into field\nThe bug is reproducible with an extra test on the django aggregation test suite:\ndef test_referenced_group_by_aggregation_over_annotation(self):\ntotal_books_qs = (\nBook.objects.filter(authors__pk=OuterRef(\"pk\"))\n.order_by()\n.values(\"pk\")\n.annotate(total=Count(\"pk\"))\n.values(\"total\")\n)\nannotated_authors = Author.objects.annotate(\ntotal_books=Subquery(total_books_qs.annotate(\ntotal_books=F(\"total\")\n).values(\"total_books\")),\ntotal_books_a=Subquery(total_books_qs.filter(\nname__istartswith=\"a\"\n).annotate(\ntotal_books_a=F(\"total\")\n).values(\"total_books_a\")),\n).values(\n\"pk\",\n\"total_books\",\n\"total_books_a\",\n).order_by(\"-total_books\")\ntotals = annotated_authors.aggregate(\nsum_total_books=Sum(\"total_books\"),\nsum_total_books_a=Sum(\"total_books_a\"),\na_over_total_rate=Case(\nWhen(\nsum_total_books=0,\nthen=0,\n),\ndefault=Round(\n(Sum(\"total_books_a\") / Sum(\"total_books\")) * 100, 2\n),\noutput_field=FloatField(),\n),\n)\nself.assertEqual(totals['sum_total_books'], 3)\nself.assertEqual(totals['sum_total_books_a'], 0)\nself.assertEqual(totals['a_over_total_rate'], 0)\nThanks for the support!\n</issue>"

The information provided suggests changes or bugs in the handling of aggregated fields used in further annotations or aggregations, especially concerning the Sum, Case, and When expressions.\n\nFirst, let's get more context on how the Case-When clause and aggregation over annotations are implemented in the Django ORM. This will require examining both the classes and methods that process these operations. We specifically need to look into the `aggregate` and `annotate` methods of the QuerySet class, as well as the implementation details of the `Sum`, `Case`, `When`, and possibly `Subquery` classes since these are directly used in the provided code examples.\n\n1. **Search for the QuerySet class where `annotate` and `aggregate` methods are defined**: Since these methods are central to the issue, understanding any changes or the way they handle references to aggregated fields in version 4.2 will be crucial.\n\n2. **Search for the Sum, Case, and When class definitions**: These classes are essential for constructing the described queries, and any changes in their behavior or interaction with other parts of the ORM could lead to the observed issue.\n\n3. **Search for any utility functions or methods that might be involved in resolving field names within queries**: Based on the error message provided, there could be an issue with how field names (like 'sum_total_objs') are resolved when used in expressions.\n\nHence, the relevant API calls are:\n\n- `search_class(\"QuerySet\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"annotate\", \"QuerySet\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"aggregate\", \"QuerySet\")`\n- `search_class(\"Sum\")`\n- `search_class(\"Case\")`\n- `search_class(\"When\")`\n- `search_code(\"Cannot resolve keyword into field\")`"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the search results:\n\n1. **QuerySet Class**: The `QuerySet` class is central to Django's ORM. It provides a way to create, retrieve, update, or delete database queries. The methods `annotate` and `aggregate` found within it are particularly relevant to the issue at hand.\n\n   - **`annotate` Method**: The method is used to add additional details or aggregations to each item in the query set. From the code snippet, `annotate` seems straightforward, ensuring that combined queries are not supported and then delegating to `_annotate` with the given arguments. The issue could be related to how annotated fields are handled or referenced in subsequent aggregates or annotations, especially across version changes.\n   \n   - **`aggregate` Method**: This method performs calculations over a query set, returning a dictionary of name-value pairs. The method validates that values are expressions and manages default aliasing for the aggregates. The reference to `self.query.chain().get_aggregation` suggests that the aggregation undergoes a transformation which, in version 4.2, could be handling references to annotated fields differently, leading to the described error.\n\n2. **Sum Class**: Represents an aggregate function generating a sum over a given field. It is straightforward and seems unchanged, but the issue might not directly relate to this class unless there are version-specific changes in how aggregate expressions are parsed or executed within the ORM.\n\n3. **Case and When Classes**: These classes provide conditional expressions allowing complex annotations and aggregates. The `Case` class allows for conditional aggregation which, given the issue, may not be correctly identifying or using aggregated fields in version 4.2 in the way it did in prior versions. Especially, changes in how expressions are resolved or compiled could potentially lead to such errors.\n\nFrom the issue description, the intended behavior is to use aggregated fields within further aggregate or conditional expressions without error, the same way it worked in Django <= 4.1. The error message implied by the issue (\"Cannot resolve keyword 'sum_total_objs' into field\") hints at a failure in the ORM's ability to correctly interpret or resolve these fields in complex queries post-annotation or aggregation in version 4.2.\n\nGiven this analysis, a couple of areas stand out for further investigation:\n\n- The mechanism for resolving field references in aggregate and annotation expressions might have changed in version 4.2, affecting how names like `sum_total_objs` are interpreted.\n- The interaction between `Subquery`, `Sum`, and conditional expressions (`Case`, `When`) could have been affected.\n\nConsidering the lack of results for the direct error message search, other potential API calls to gather more context could be:\n- Examining changes between versions 4.1 and 4.2 related to `QuerySet`, `aggregate`, and `annotate` methods, possibly by looking at Django's version control diffs or release notes.\n- Investigating how field references are resolved within expressions, requiring insights into internal methods like `resolve_expression` within the `Case` class or looking into the `Query` class that `QuerySet` interacts with.\n\nUnfortunately, without direct access to version control diffs or history through the given API, specific calls to further investigate these aspects cannot be made directly. However, a deeper look into the `Query` class or exploring the handling and chaining of expressions might shed light on where the regression was introduced."

However, without the ability to make those specific search API calls here, we'll proceed with the given context to hypothesize potential bug locations and the intended behavior to resolve the issue: \n\n### Bug Locations:\n\n**Location 1:**\n- **File:** `django/db/models/query.py`\n- **Class:** `QuerySet`\n- **Method:** `aggregate`\n\n**Intended Behavior:** The `aggregate` method should be able to correctly resolve and use fields that have been added to a `QuerySet` through an annotation, especially when referenced in further aggregate or conditional expressions as seen in the provided issue report. This implies enhancing the mechanism within Django's ORM that interprets field references in such expressions, possibly requiring adjustments in how queries are chained or how field names are resolved during the aggregation phase. The behavior should ensure that aggregated fields can be referenced without causing a `FieldError`.\n\n**Location 2:**\n- **File:** `django/db/models/expressions.py`\n- **Class:** `Case`\n\n**Intended Behavior:** Given the error seems to relate to the handling of the `Case` expression, specifically in version 4.2, any adjustment or improvement in expression resolution or compilation that was changed from version 4.1 to 4.2 should be revisited. The `Case` expression should accurately handle aggregated fields derived from annotations, ensuring that these fields are correctly identified and utilized in the conditional logic without causing resolution errors.\n\n**General Intention Across Bug Locations:** \nThe overarching goal is to restore or ensure compatibility of Django's ORM features related to field resolution in annotations and aggregations, maintaining or enhancing the ORM's robustness in handling complex query constructs without regression from earlier versions. Any fix should preserve existing functionalities and behaviors for users not affected by this issue while correcting the regression observed in version 4.2.\n\n### Additional notes:\nWithout access to Django's version history or release notes through the provided API calls, these bug locations are hypothesized based on the nature of the issue described and the implications of how Django's ORM handles aggregation and annotation expressions. Direct inspection of changes made to relevant methods and classes between versions 4.1 and 4.2, particularly those affecting expression parsing and field resolution, would be the most effective approach for locating and resolving the issue accurately."
