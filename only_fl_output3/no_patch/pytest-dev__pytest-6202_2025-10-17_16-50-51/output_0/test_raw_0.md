To create a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` that reproduces the issue described and tests for its resolution would involve executing a pytest test programmatically, capturing the output, and then checking if the replacement of "`.["` with "`[`" occurs in the function name within test report headlines. Given the specific nature of the bug—it hinges on how pytest formats its output for test parametrization labels—the script would simulate this behavior by defining a test with similar characteristics and then running pytest on this test.

Here's how you might write such a script:

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Creates a temporary test file
    test_file_content = """
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("a", ["..["])
def test_boo(a):
    assert 0
"""
    test_file_name = "temp_test_bug_reproducer.py"
    with open(test_file_name, 'w') as f:
        f.write(test_file_content)

    # Running pytest on the created test file
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(["pytest", test_file_name, "-v"], text=True, capture_output=True, check=True)
        output = result.stdout + result.stderr
        
        # Inspecting output for the specific formatting issue
        if "test_boo[.[]" in output:
            print("The issue is present. '\.[ ' is incorrectly replaced with '[ '.")
        else:
            print("The issue has been fixed. The output format is correct.")
            sys.exit(0)

    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print("An error occurred while running pytest.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script dynamically creates a Python test file that triggers the formatting issue in pytest's output, runs pytest against this file, and checks the output for the specific string manipulation error. If the unwanted replacement is detected in the output, it concludes the issue is present; otherwise, it assumes the issue has been resolved. It uses a direct string match strategy for simplicity, but more sophisticated parsing could provide better robustness against varying outputs or environments.

Be aware that the script assumes `pytest` is installed and available in your environment's path. It may need adjustments based on the specific environment or pytest version.
