Given the requirements and the complexity of the issue (which revolves around how pytest parses and modifies test names during reporting), it's clear that to directly reproduce and assert the behavior within a Python script without relying on pytest's command-line execution and parsing its output can be quite intricate. However, we can create a script that programmatically uses pytest to execute a test function defined within the script and then inspect the output for evidence of the issue. Here's a simplified approach to doing this:

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def execute_test():
    # Create a test file dynamically
    test_content = """
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("a", ["..["])
def test_boo(a):
    assert 0
    """

    file_name = "test_issue_reproducer.py"
    with open(file_name, "w") as f:
        f.write(test_content)

    # Run pytest on the test file
    try:
        subprocess.check_output(["pytest", file_name], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        output = e.output.decode()
        # Check if the issue is present in the output
        if ".[" in output and not "[.[]" in output:
            print("The issue is present.")
            raise AssertionError("Output did not replace '.[' with '[' correctly.")
        else:
            print("The issue seems to be fixed.")
    finally:
        # Clean up after the test
        subprocess.call(["rm", file_name])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        execute_test()
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        sys.exit(0)
```

This script attempts to dynamically create a pytest test file that should trigger the issue when executed. If the output from pytest shows that the parameterized test name has been modified incorrectly (transforming `..[` into `.[]`), it confirms the presence of the bug. On the other hand, a correct execution with no unwanted modifications in the test name indicates that the issue might have been fixed. The script uses a `try/finally` block to ensure cleanup happens by removing the dynamically created test file, regardless of the test outcome. Note that for simplicity and compatibility, it assumes that `pytest` is installed and available in the system's PATH where the script is run.
