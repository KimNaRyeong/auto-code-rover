To reproduce the issue in a `reproducer.py` file and manage the output correctly, taking into account your requirement for error handling and checking for the presence of the issue as well as correcting for the subprocess failure that occurred in the previous run, you'll need a slightly different approach. Here is an updated version that includes a better error handling mechanism:

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    test_content = """
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("a", ["..["])
def test_boo(a):
    assert 0
"""

    # Write the test content to a python script file.
    test_script = 'temp_test_bug_reproduction.py'
    with open(test_script, 'w') as f:
        f.write(test_content)

    # Execute the pytest command in a subprocess and handle possible errors.
    try:
        command = ["pytest", "-v", test_script]
        result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True)
        output = result.stdout + result.stderr

        # Checking the output for the presence of the issue.
        if "test_boo[.[]" in output:
            print("The issue is not fixed yet. We expected 'test_boo[..[]'.")
        else:
            print("The issue seems to be fixed.")
            sys.exit(0)

    except Exception as e:
        print("Failed to run the pytest command properly.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

    finally:
        # Clean up by removing the created script file.
        subprocess.run(["rm", test_script])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This version adds a `finally` block to ensure cleanup occurs by removing the temporary test script that's been created, irrespective of whether the test execution is successful or not. It tries to run pytest on the dynamically generated test file and checks the output for the presence of the issue. If the specific string manipulation error (i.e., the undesired alteration of the test name) is present in pytest's output, it reports that the issue is not fixed yet. If the command fails for any reason, it will now catch the exception, print a stack trace, and exit with status 1 to indicate an error state.

Again, this script assumes that `pytest` (and Python 3) is installed and available in the execution environment's PATH. Adjustments might be necessary depending on the specific setup or if running in a different environment than a conventional command-line interface.
