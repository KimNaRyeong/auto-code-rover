        "intended_behavior": "The `sympify` function should include enhanced input validation or sanitation to prevent `eval` from executing arbitrary code that does not represent valid symbolic expressions. One approach could involve more stringent checks on the inputs to ensure they conform to expected patterns before passing to `eval`, or potentially utilizing a safer evaluation strategy that does not involve `eval` for untrusted input. For handling the conversion of objects through `__repr__`, a safer parsing mechanism or explicit conversion protocols could be implemented to avoid evaluating potentially malicious code."

        "method": "parse_expr",
        "intended_behavior": "When handling the conversion of string expressions to SymPy objects, `parse_expr` should ensure that only valid mathematical expressions are evaluated, particularly when `eval` is invoked. This can be achieved by improving the pre-evaluation filtering process, more sophisticated parsing that better discriminates between mathematical expressions and code, or by applying transformations designed to mitigate the risks associated with `eval`. Care should be taken to preserve the ability to parse and transform legitimate mathematical notations into their SymPy equivalents while safeguarding against execution of unintended operations."
