        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, we need to target specific aspects of the bug report related to the implementation of `__eq__`, the use of `eval` in sympy's comparison operations, and how `sympy.Symbol` objects handle equality checks. Based on the issue details, let's make the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the class definition of `Symbol` to understand how symbols are implemented and possibly to find the `__eq__` method implementation:\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Symbol\")\n```\n\n2. Look into the file where the `sympify` function is located since the stack trace mentions it and it seems to be a key part of the comparison logic:\n```python\nsearch_method(\"sympify\")\n```\n\n3. Investigate the `parse_expr` function in the `sympy_parser.py` file as it's directly mentioned in the trace and seems to be involved in the evaluation that causes the error:\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"parse_expr\", \"sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py\")\n```\n\n4. Lastly, to understand the context of the error and how `eval` is being used, search directly for the usage of `eval` within the context where the issue arises. This will help in understanding the decision behind using `eval` and how it's being secured or misused:\n```python\nsearch_code(\"eval(\")\n```\n\nThese calls aim to cover both the high-level understanding of how sympy handles symbol equality checks and the detailed implementation logic that leads up to the bug. This information will be crucial for crafting a patch that avoids the unsafe evaluation of representations."
