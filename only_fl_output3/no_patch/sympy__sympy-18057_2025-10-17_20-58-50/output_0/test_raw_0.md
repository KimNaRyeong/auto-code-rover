Certainly, below is the `reproducer.py` script designed to raise an `AssertionError` if the bug described in the issue is present. It will demonstrate the attempt to evaluate representations (`repr`) in SymPy's `__eq__` method, which can result in unwanted behavior, and will use the provided function to print the stack trace for clarity.

```python
import sympy

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    """
    Function to print the stack trace of an exception.
    """
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class C:
    def __repr__(self):
        return 'x.y'

try:
    _ = sympy.Symbol('x') == C()
except AttributeError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise AssertionError("Sympy incorrectly attempts to eval reprs in its __eq__ method.")

try:
    assert sympy.Symbol('x') != C(), "Equality comparison between Symbol and C should not be equal."
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    exit(1)  # Exits with code 1 if the issue is present

print("Test passed, issue is fixed.")
exit(0)  # Exits with code 0 when issue is fixed
```

This script carefully encapsulates the described issue into an actionable Python file. If executed in the root directory of a project where this SymPy behavior is unchanged, it is expected to raise an `AssertionError` indicating that SymPy incorrectly evaluates `repr` strings in its equality checks. If the issue is fixed, the script will instead confirm the problem's resolution and exit gracefully with code 0.
