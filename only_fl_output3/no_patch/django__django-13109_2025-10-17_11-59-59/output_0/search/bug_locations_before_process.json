        "intended_behavior": "The `validate` method should ensure the existence of a related model instance using the base manager (`_base_manager`) rather than the default manager (`_default_manager`). This modification would accommodate scenarios where the default manager is overridden to exclude certain instances which should nonetheless be considered valid in contexts where all instances of the related model are acceptable (e.g., a form allowing users to select from all articles, including archived ones). Specifically, the code change will adjust the queryset instantiation in line 917 to use `self.remote_field.model._base_manager.using(using).filter(...)`, ensuring that validation does not exclude instances filtered out by the default manager's custom queryset. This change preserves the existing functionality of ensuring that a valid instance exists for the ForeignKey relation but broadens the validation to include all possible instances, respecting the explicit intent in cases where `_base_manager` is more appropriate for the validation context."
