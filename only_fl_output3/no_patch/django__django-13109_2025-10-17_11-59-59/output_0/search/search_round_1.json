This is because the ForeignKey validation always uses _default_manager instead of _base_manager. The user facing error message is \"article instance with id 123 does not exist.\" (quite confusing to typical users). The code for this validation is here:\n\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/94f63b926fd32d7a7b6e2591ef72aa8f040f25cc/django/db/models/fields/related.py#L917-L919\nThe FavoriteAriclesForm is specifically designed to use a different manager, but the ForeignKey validation makes this difficult.\nIn this example scenario, it is not acceptable to change the model's default manager as the default should avoid archived articles in other typical scenarios.\nSuggested solution: the ForeignKey validation should use the _base_manager instead which does not include the default filters.\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### Analysis of `ForeignKey.validate()` Code Snippet\n\n##### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe method `ForeignKey.validate()` in Django's ORM is responsible for ensuring that the value provided for a `ForeignKey` field exists in the related model's database table. This validation process uses the default manager of the related model to perform a database query, checking if there's a corresponding record with the given value (usually the primary key of the related model).\n\nThe critical lines are:\n- **Line 917**: It uses `_default_manager` of the related model to construct a query set (`qs`), filtering for records where the foreign key field matches the provided `value`.\n- **Line 920**: Applies any additional filters specified in `ForeignKey`'s `limit_choices_to` option.\n- **Lines 921-927**: If no records exist that match the query, a `ValidationError` is raised, indicating the foreign key value doesn't correspond to a valid record in the related model.\n\n##### Relationship to the Bug\n\nThe submitted issue describes a scenario where `ForeignKey.validate()` fails for valid instances of the related model that are excluded by the default manager's queryset. Specifically, if the default manager applies a filter (e.g., `archived=False` in the `ArticleManager`), any instances excluded by this filter (e.g., archived articles) will cause `ForeignKey.validate()` to raise a `ValidationError`, even when such instances are valid choices from a broader perspective (e.g., when using a form that should allow selecting archived articles).\n\n##### Intended Behavior\n\nThe intended behavior, as suggested by the issue, is for `ForeignKey.validate()` to use the base manager (`_base_manager`) instead of the default manager (`_default_manager`) for validation. The base manager doesn't apply any custom filters defined in the model's managers, ensuring all instances of the related model are considered during validation. This change would allow forms or other Django components that explicitly wish to include typically-excluded instances (like archived articles) to do so without validation errors.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven the analysis, the focus should now shift towards:\n\n1. **Understanding Model and Manager Definitions**: Despite the initial search not finding `ArticleManager` and `FavoriteAricles` classes, it's essential to acquire context on how models and their managers (especially custom managers) are typically defined and used in Django. This understanding can help in proposing changes or enhancements to the `ForeignKey.validate()` method that considers different manager use cases.\n\n2. **Exploring Possible Solutions**: Contemplating how to modify `ForeignKey.validate()` to use `_base_manager` instead of `_default_manager` for validation purposes, considering the implications of such a change on existing Django applications and ensuring backward compatibility where possible.\n\n#### Further Context Gathering\n\nGiven the issue description involves custom model managers and a specific form usage scenario, additional context might include:\n\n- Looking into other parts of the Django ORM codebase where `_base_manager` is used to understand its intended applications fully.\n- Reviewing documentation or source code comments regarding the design decisions behind Django's use of `_default_manager` for `ForeignKey.validate()`.\n\nHowever, without direct references to the `ArticleManager` and `FavoriteAricles` classes in the issue's codebase, actionable next steps are somewhat speculative and would largely involve proposing hypothetical changes to the Django codebase outlined in the snippet provided."

This modification would accommodate scenarios where the default manager is overridden to exclude certain instances which should nonetheless be considered valid in contexts where all instances of the related model are acceptable (e.g., a form allowing users to select from all articles, including archived ones). Specifically, the code change will adjust the queryset instantiation in line 917 to use `self.remote_field.model._base_manager.using(using).filter(...)`, ensuring that validation does not exclude instances filtered out by the default manager's custom queryset. This change preserves the existing functionality of ensuring that a valid instance exists for the ForeignKey relation but broadens the validation to include all possible instances, respecting the explicit intent in cases where `_base_manager` is more appropriate for the validation context."
