Apologies if there is a duplicate somewhere, I scoured all the issues for this problem and I couldn't find it mentioned yet.

The `where` keyword argument was added to `np.mean` and all the other `np.reduce`-based functions in version 1.20.0 of numpy,
but it doesn't seem to work yet with `astopy.units.Quantity`.

Does anyone know if there is some limitation in `astropy.units.Quantity` that is preventing this feature from being implemented?

If not, I could put some time towards updating `astropy.units.Quantity` to support this feature.
