        "intended_behavior": "The `get_aggregation` method should correctly handle queries involving annotations that use fields from parent models, without dropping vital `INNER JOIN` operations needed for accessing these inherited fields. This requires a nuanced adjustment to when and how `inner_query.default_cols` is set to `False`, especially in the presence of inherited model fields in annotations. Specifically, the condition for setting `default_cols` to `False` and adjusting the `group_by` clause needs refinement to ensure that necessary joins are retained. The intended adjustment would enable the method to detect when an annotated field comes from a parent model and ensure that operations which would typically drop `INNER JOIN` clauses, such as setting `default_cols` to `False`, are only executed when they do not compromise the ability to access these fields.\n\nThis means the method must effectively distinguish between inherited model fields and those directly belonging to the model in question when making decisions about query modifications in the context of annotations. The underlying logic should be adapted to maintain all necessary joins for inherited fields in annotated queries, ensuring the aggregation operations, like counting, can be conducted without errors stemming from unavailable fields due to prematurely dropped joins. This adjustment preserves the existing functionality while extending it to correctly support use cases involving inherited model fields in annotations."
