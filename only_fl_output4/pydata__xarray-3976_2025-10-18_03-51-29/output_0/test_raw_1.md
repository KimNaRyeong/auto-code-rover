Given the clarification and the requirements, here is how you would structure the `reproducer.py` file to encapsulate the testing logic accurately, handle the issue reproduction, and ensure clear error reporting following your directives:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_inplace_addition():
    import numpy as np
    import xarray as xr

    n = 5

    d1 = np.arange(n)
    np.random.shuffle(d1)
    A = xr.DataArray(np.ones(n), coords=[('dim', d1)])

    d2 = np.arange(n)
    np.random.shuffle(d2)
    B = xr.DataArray(np.ones(n), coords=[('dim', d2)])

    try:
        A += B  # This is the operation that is expected to work
        print("Test passed, in-place addition succeeded.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("In-place addition failed when it should succeed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_inplace_addition()
    except AssertionError as e:
        # If an AssertionError is caught, print the error message and exit with code 1.
        print(e)
        exit(1)
    # If no exception occurs, exit with code 0 to indicate success.
    exit(0)
```

This script is designed to perform an in-place addition of two `xarray.DataArray` instances where each has the same dimension but in a different order of indices. It encapsulates the main test logic in the `test_inplace_addition` function and properly uses the `print_stacktrace` function to report exceptions with enhanced details. If the issue is successfully reproduced (meaning an error occurs), it will print the stack trace and raise an `AssertionError`. Conversely, if the operation completes without raising an exception, it indicates that the issue is resolved, and the script will exit with a status code of 0, denoting success.
