        "intended_behavior": "The code that accesses `__wrapped__` should first check if the attribute exists. This could be implemented by either using `getattr` with a default value or explicitly checking the presence of the `__wrapped__` attribute on an object before accessing it. This adjustment is necessary to prevent `KeyError` when the attribute is not present on an object that is being inspected during the test collection or execution process. The existing functionality, which likely aims to introspect or modify test functions (potentially for unwrapping decorators), should be preserved while making it robust against the absence of `__wrapped__`."

        "intended_behavior": "The code related to function unwrapping or manipulation that uses `__wrapped__` should implement safer access patterns. As in the previous location, using `getattr(obj, '__wrapped__', default)` or a similar check will ensure that `KeyError` is not raised. This file's role in smoothing over compatibility issues suggests it might be dealing with a variety of Python versions and their nuances in handling wrapped functions. Thus, enhancing robustness here is crucial. The amendment should not alter the core functionality intended by these compatibility layers but should ensure they are fault-tolerant to differences in object attributes, particularly `__wrapped__`."
