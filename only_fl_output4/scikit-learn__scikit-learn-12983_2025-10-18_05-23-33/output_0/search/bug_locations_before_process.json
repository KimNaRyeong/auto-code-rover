        "intended_behavior": "The constructor (__init__) should validate the `init` parameter to ensure it can accommodate sklearn estimators correctly. Further, methods that utilize the `init` estimator for making initial predictions or setting the initial stage must ensure the output shape of these predictions aligns with the expected shape for the gradient boosting process to continue seamlessly. This might involve reshaping or appropriately aggregating the outputs from the `init` estimator. Additionally, if `init` does not support sample weights, the integration logic should handle this gracefully, allowing the gradient boosting model to be trained without passing sample weights to the `init` estimator."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to `GradientBoostingClassifier`, the handling of the `init` parameter needs to be adjusted to ensure compatibility with sklearn estimators that are used as the initial model. The code needs to ensure that the shape and scale of the initial predictions from the `init` estimator are compatible with the boosting process. It should also account for the possibility of the `init` estimator not supporting sample weights, by either not passing sample weights to it or providing a workaround that doesn\u2019t compromise the performance and functionality of the gradient boosting regressor."
