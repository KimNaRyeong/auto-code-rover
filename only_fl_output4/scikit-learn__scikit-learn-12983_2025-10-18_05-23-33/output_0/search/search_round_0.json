And apparently there was no test for the init parameter with other estimator than default.\n*Edit* Also accept initial estimator which does not support sample weights as long as the gradient boosting is not fitted with sample weights\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather context relevant to the issue described, we should focus on the gradient boosting component of the project, specifically regarding its handling of the `init` parameter, which can be an sklearn estimator. The issue mentions problems with the predict output not having the expected shape when `init` is set to an sklearn estimator and the need to handle initial estimators that do not support sample weights. Therefore, we need to look at where gradient boosting handles the `init` parameter, how it interacts with provided initial estimators, and any relevant prediction methods that might affect the output shape. \nLet's carry out the following search API calls to gather the necessary information:\n\n1. search_class(\"GradientBoostingClassifier\")\n2. search_class(\"GradientBoostingRegressor\")\n3. search_method(\"predict\")\n4. search_method(\"fit\")\n5. search_code(\"init parameter\")\n\nThese searches are aimed at getting us closer to the code handling for gradient boosting classifiers and regressors, their fit and predict methods (which are likely involved given the issue description), and direct references to handling the `init` parameter across the codebase. Since the issue does not specify which exact class (classifier or regressor) the bug affects, investigating both is a logical step."
