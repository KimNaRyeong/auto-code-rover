If you run makemigrations on such a machine it will fail while attempting to check the migrations consistency, which is quite annoying. The solution seems to either add a django.db.backends.dummy backend for such cases or start a database server locally.\nI'd like to add a flag to skip the consistency check in these situations, or fail gracefully if the connection to the database isn't available.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue, we need to understand the context and implementation details of the `makemigrations` command and any related checks, especially the `loader.check_consistent_history()` method mentioned in the issue description. We need to gather the surrounding context of where `check_consistent_history()` is called in `makemigrations.py` and also understand how `makemigrations` operates in general. Here are the API calls that would help gather the relevant information:\n\n1. `search_code_in_file(\"loader.check_consistent_history()\", \"django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py\")`: This will help us locate the exact place where the consistency check is done.\n\n2. `get_code_around_line(\"django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py\", 93, 10)`: This should give us a good overview of the code block that initiates the database consistency checks, considering the specific lines mentioned in the issue.\n\n3. `search_method_in_file(\"handle\", \"django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py\")`: To understand how the `makemigrations` command is structured, we need to look at the `handle` method, as it's typically where the command's logic starts in Django management commands.\n\n4. `search_class(\"MigrationLoader\")`: Since the `loader.check_consistent_history()` method is mentioned, it would be useful to get a sense of what the `MigrationLoader` class does, especially how it relates to migration consistency checks. \n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive view of how `makemigrations` operates, particularly around performing database consistency checks, and aid in assessing how a new flag could be integrated to skip these checks or handle them more gracefully."
