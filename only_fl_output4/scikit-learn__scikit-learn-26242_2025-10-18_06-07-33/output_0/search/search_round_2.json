Because there are also validators in place, old code that explicitly defined `base_estimator=None` stopped working.\nA solution that fixes the deprecation is to add a possible `None` to a list allowed values in `_parameter_constraints`; I will do that in a PR.\n### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier\nclf = AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator=None)\nclf.fit([[1]], [0])\n```\n### Expected Results\nNo error is thrown.\n### Actual Results\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\nFile \"/Users/marko/opt/miniconda3/envs/orange310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sklearn/ensemble/_weight_boosting.py\", line 124, in fit\nself._validate_params()\nFile \"/Users/marko/opt/miniconda3/envs/orange310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sklearn/base.py\", line 600, in _validate_params\nvalidate_parameter_constraints(\nFile \"/Users/marko/opt/miniconda3/envs/orange310/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sklearn/utils/_param_validation.py\", line 97, in validate_parameter_constraints\nraise InvalidParameterError(\nsklearn.utils._param_validation.InvalidParameterError: The 'base_estimator' parameter of AdaBoostClassifier must be an object implementing 'fit' and 'predict' or a str among {'deprecated'}.

This indicates that part of the bug description might refer to changes or deprecations not directly visible in the constructor's signature.\n   - The method `_validate_params` wasn't found within the `AdaBoostClassifier`, suggesting that parameter validation might be inherited or delegated to another method or class.\n\n2. **Relationship Between the Code and the Bug**:\n   - Considering the error message and the issue description, the validation of the `base_estimator` parameter fails when it is set to `None`. Given that the `AdaBoostClassifier` constructor has a `base_estimator` parameter with a default value of `\"deprecated\"`, and there isn't a direct `_validate_params` method in `AdaBoostClassifier`, the validation logic that triggers the error is likely implemented elsewhere. \n   - The absence of `_validate_params` in `AdaBoostClassifier` leads to the likelihood that parameter validation, particularly for deprecated parameters, is a concern of a base class or utility function.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior**:\n   - The intended behavior for handling the `base_estimator=None` argument should involve recognizing `None` as an acceptable value, especially for cases where users want to rely on default estimators. This adjustment mainly relates to supporting backward compatibility and easing the transition for users dealing with deprecation warnings.\n   \nGiven these observations and questions generated from the analysis, it seems necessary to explore further into how `AdaBoostClassifier` inherits or delegates its parameter validation mechanism. It's also crucial to understand the default behavior when `base_estimator` is `None` and how the new `estimator` parameter expectation plays into this.\n\nTo gain more context, additional API call(s) should aim at uncovering the mechanism of parameter validation and handling of `base_estimator` and `estimator`. Relevant API calls could include:\n- Investigating the inheritance hierarchy of `AdaBoostClassifier` to identify where `_validate_params` could be implemented or utilized. This may involve looking into base classes such as `BaseWeightBoosting`.\n- Exploring where `validate_parameter_constraints` is used within `sklearn/base.py` and `sklearn/utils/_param_validation.py` to understand its role in parameter validation. \n\nNext steps should include:\n- search_method_in_class(\"_validate_params\", \"BaseWeightBoosting\")\n- get_code_around_line(\"sklearn/base.py\", 600, 10)"

        "content": "Analyzing the new context:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The provided code snippet comes from within `BaseEstimator`'s `_validate_data` function, not `_validate_params` as initially sought. This code is responsible for validating input data (`X`, `y`) according to specific requirements (like checking for consistent length, ensuring it's in an appropriate format, etc.). It allows for the possibility of different validation parameters for `X` and `y`, which is not directly related to parameter validation for constructors but rather to input data for methods such as `fit`.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - While this snippet is focused on validation of method inputs rather than constructor parameter validation, it illustrates the general approach of scikit-learn towards validating inputs. However, this part of the code does not directly relate to the handling of deprecated or None parameters in constructors, which is the core issue in the bug report. The attempt to find a direct link to `_validate_params` handling in `BaseWeightBoosting` or its subclasses (like `AdaBoostClassifier`) was unfruitful, suggesting that parameter validation might follow a different code path or be implemented in a less direct manner.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - While this specific snippet doesn't directly correspond to the area of the bug, the intended behavior we're seeking in the context of the bug would involve the AdaBoostClassifier (or its parent classes) correctly handling deprecated parameters and allowing for a `None` value as valid for the `base_estimator` in a backward-compatible manner. This would presumably involve updating the parameter validation logic to treat `None` as an acceptable value for `base_estimator` during the deprecation period and ensuring that downstream functionality defaults to an appropriate action when `base_estimator` is `None`.\n\nGiven that the search for `_validate_params` in `BaseWeightBoosting` did not return results, and the `_validate_data` function from `BaseEstimator` does not address our issue, it seems we need to explore another angle perhaps more closely related to how deprecated parameters are handled or where the specific validation for `AdaBoostClassifier` parameters is conducted, which might not be straightforwardly named `_validate_params`.\n\nGiven these insights, the focus should potentially shift towards:\n1. Finding where parameter validation particularly regarding allowable values (including `None` for deprecated parameters) is implemented for scikit-learn's classifiers, specifically `AdaBoostClassifier`.\n2. Understanding how scikit-learn plans deprecation warnings and transitions for constructor parameters since an overarching understanding could pinpoint where adjustments for the `base_estimator=None` scenario should be made.\n\nGiven the unsuccessful search for direct references, our next logical steps could include a broader examination:\n- Investigating deprecation handling mechanisms in scikit-learn.\n- Searching for any constructors or methods specifically designed to transition from `base_estimator` to `estimator` parameters within the AdaBoostClassifier or its base classes.\n\nHowever, as per the instructions provided, we are analyzing the collected context and have not been prompted to issue more API calls at this moment. Therefore, I will focus on deducing potential bug fixes based on the bug description and the scikit-learn patterns observed so far.\n\n### Conclusions for Bug Locations and Intended Behavior\n\nGiven no direct findings from `_validate_params` or the specific handling of the `base_estimator` within `AdaBoostClassifier`, the actual bug fixes would likely involve:\n- **Bug Locations**: The file `sklearn/ensemble/_weight_boosting.py` as it contains the definition of `AdaBoostClassifier`. Since direct validation routines were not found, the logical assumption is that either the constructor needs adjustment to properly forward or interpret `base_estimator=None` or nearby utility/validation functions (not directly observed) should be updated.\n  \n- **Intended Behavior**: Proper handling of `base_estimator=None` to interpret it as using the default estimator without throwing an error. This would involve ensuring that deprecated parameter handling machinery in scikit-learn accepts `None` as a valid transitional value and has clear transitional logic to the `estimator` parameter (if it's reintroduced or clarified in operation to align with the issue description). This might also require updating documentation or examples to demonstrate the intended usage of deprecated and transitional parameters."

When `base_estimator=None` is encountered, the behavior should default to using the standard default estimator without raising an error, preserving backward compatibility while adhering to the deprecation path. The handling of `base_estimator=\"deprecated\"` should also ensure a clear warning is provided, guiding the users toward the new `estimator` parameter use, if applicable, or confirming that `None` remains a valid input to select the default estimator automatically. This change would involve ensuring that any checks or validations that happen either at construction or during the call to `_validate_estimator` do not invalidate `None` as an entry for `base_estimator` during the period that this deprecation warning is meant to guide user transition. Additional comments or documentation should be added explaining that `None` is explicitly allowed to ensure that there is no confusion for future maintainers of the codebase."
