The `frac` function causing the issue is probably defined elsewhere, likely in a context that deals directly with mathematical operations on symbolic expressions.\n   - This part of the code is not directly related to the bug, as the issue is caused by a `TypeError` within the numerical and symbolic computation part of SymPy, rather than its LaTeX parsing features.\n\n2. **Occurrences of `zoo` in the codebase:**\n   - The search for `zoo` yielded multiple appearances across various files, indicating that `zoo` (which represents a complex infinity in SymPy) is a fundamental constant used throughout the library in different contexts, from integrals to special functions and series expansions.\n   - The relationship between these appearances of `zoo` and the bug is indirect. Knowing where `zoo` is defined (`sympy/core/numbers.py`) and how it's handled in various contexts could suggest how functions like `frac` are expected to treat special symbolic constants. However, without a specific implementation detail in the error context, this broad search provides background rather than pinpoint insight into the bug.\n\n3. **Code around `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py` line 311:**\n   - This part of the code deals with evaluating the fractional part of a given argument. It checks for specific conditions such as the argument being `Infinity`, `NegativeInfinity`, `NaN`, and `ComplexInfinity`, returning early in these cases with specific outputs. For `ComplexInfinity`, it returns `None`, which is the direct cause of the `TypeError` mentioned in the issue since further code attempts to perform operations with `None` as if it were a numeric type. \n   - The relationship between this code part and the bug is direct. The `None` returned for `S.ComplexInfinity` leads to the `TypeError` when attempting to add `None` to `Zero`.\n   - Given the issue description, the intended behavior seems to be that calling `frac` with `zoo` (`S.ComplexInfinity`) should either result in a symbolic representation of the operation, a specific value representing the fractional part of complex infinity (if mathematically defined), or at least not result in a `TypeError`. Currently, it appears there is an assumption that a `None` return value can be mathematically operated on, which is not the case.\n\nConsidering this analysis, the next steps toward resolving the bug could involve adjustments in how symbolic constants like `zoo` are handled in the `frac` function's evaluation logic, specifically ensuring it does not lead to operations on `None`. A patch might involve defining a more appropriate return value for `frac(zoo)` or introducing error handling that produces a more informative error message."

Currently, it returns `None` when it encounters `S.ComplexInfinity`, leading to a `TypeError` downstream when trying to perform mathematical operations with `None`.\n\nTo resolve the issue while preserving the existing functionality of the code, the `eval` method should be modified to:\n- Either return a more informative error or message when `frac` is called with `zoo`, explicitly stating that the operation is undefined or not supported. This is under the assumption that a fraction part of a complex infinity (`zoo`) does not have a meaningful mathematical definition. \n- Or, if there's a convention or mathematical basis on which to define the fractional part of `zoo`, return that value instead of `None`.\n\nThe existing checks and functionality for other types of arguments should remain unaffected by this change. The solution should solely add to or modify the branch dealing with `S.ComplexInfinity`, ensuring that any return value is consistent with the types expected by the rest of the SymPy framework and avoids causing `TypeError`."
