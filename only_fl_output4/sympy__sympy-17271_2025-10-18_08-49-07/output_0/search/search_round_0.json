This will help understand their intended behavior and how they interact. I'll also use the `get_code_around_line` API to see the code around the specified lines in the error message, which should provide insight into how the `frac` function is handling its arguments, especially when one of those arguments is `zoo`.\n\nHere are the API calls I'll make:\n\n1. `search_method(\"frac\")`: To find the definition and usage of the `frac` function.\n2. `search_code(\"zoo\")`: To locate where the `zoo` constant is defined and how it's generally used within the library.\n3. `get_code_around_line(\"sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py\", 311, 10)`: This will give us the relevant code context around the lines mentioned in the issue description, helping to understand why `NoneType` and `'Zero'` are being operated on."
