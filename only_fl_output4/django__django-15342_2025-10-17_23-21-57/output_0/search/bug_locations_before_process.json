        "intended_behavior": "The `get_field` method in the `ModelState` class should be modified to handle the case where a model explicitly defines a field named `_order` without using the `order_with_respect_to` meta option. Currently, the method erroneously assumes the presence of `order_with_respect_to` if `_order` is accessed, leading to a crash. To resolve the issue, the method should:\n\n- Check if `field_name` is `_order`. If so, it should then check whether the model's options include `order_with_respect_to`.\n- If `order_with_respect_to` is not present, the method should directly attempt to return the `_order` field from the model state's fields if it exists, instead of trying to map `_order` to another field name.\n- This ensures that models explicitly defining an `_order` field can still successfully retrieve it without requiring `order_with_respect_to`.\n- The solution should preserve the original functionality for models that do use `order_with_respect_to`, automatically mapping `_order` to the appropriate field.\n\nIn summary, the code modification aims to provide a more robust handling of `_order` by considering both use cases: when it's part of the model's ordering mechanism through `order_with_respect_to`, and when it's explicitly defined as a separate field. This approach eliminates the KeyError and allows both scenarios to function as intended during migration operations like `makemigrations`."
