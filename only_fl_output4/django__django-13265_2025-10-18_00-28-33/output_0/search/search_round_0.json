        "content": "Based on the description of the issue, we need to gather more context around the following areas:\n1. The `LookImage` model class, especially its `Meta` class where the `order_with_respect_to` and `indexes` are defined.\n2. The `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` migration operations to understand their implementation and order of execution in relation to when the `_order` field gets created.\n\nLet's proceed with specific API calls to get the necessary context:\n\n1. To get details about the `LookImage` class definition, we can search for the class in the codebase.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"LookImage\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a problem with migration operations `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex`, specifically related to the `_order` field and how these operations are ordered, we should look for these in the migration files. Migration operations might not be directly searchable through class or method API calls because they are typically declared in a declarative manner in migration files. However, since we don't have direct API calls for searching in migration files or their specific operations by name, we will look for usages of the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` operations in the codebase to understand how and where they're typically used. This could give us insight into whether there's a common pattern or requirement for the order of these operations that's being violated in the submitted issue.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"AlterOrderWithRespectTo\")\n   search_code(\"AddIndex\")\n   ```\n\nThe objective of these searches is to gather sufficient information and code context around how `order_with_respect_to` and associated index operations are handled in the model's migrations to address the issue of the `_order` field not being created when expected."
