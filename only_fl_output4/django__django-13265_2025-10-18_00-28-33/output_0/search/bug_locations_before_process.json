        "intended_behavior": "This code should ensure the creation of the `_order` field or acknowledge its presence before generating `AddIndex` migration operations involving the `_order` field. A validation or reordering mechanism might be needed to check if `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` is declared before any `AddIndex` operation that uses the `_order` column. This could involve adjusting the migration dependency graph or adding checks during the migration operation generation phase to preserve the functionality while preventing the race condition error."

        "intended_behavior": "Modification here should ensure that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operations are prioritized, or trigger the implicit creation of the `_order` field in a way that it's recognized as existing by the time `AddIndex` is processed. This could involve implementing a pre-check in the `AddIndex` operation that ensures dependencies like `_order` are addressed first or provide a clear error message guiding the developer to adjust the migration order manually. Additionally, documentation within the code could be updated to highlight this requirement for developers."
