        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides an overview of how the Django framework handles model fields, checks for system integrity, and resolves expressions\u2014with a specific focus on the context related to the issue at hand.\n\n### Analysis of _gen_cols in Query\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe method `_gen_cols` within the `Query` class is responsible for iterating over expressions (presumably column expressions in this case) and yielding each expression if it's an instance of `Col`. If not, it recursively yields from any source expressions found within the given expression. This likely serves to flatten out a nested structure of expressions to a sequence of column expressions, facilitating the handling of columns in a query.\n\n#### Relationship with the bug\n\nConsidering the issue is about adding system checks for invalid model field names in functional indexes, this method (`_gen_cols`) is directly relevant because it deals with the collection of columns (fields) from expressions. The challenge mentioned in the issue is identifying invalid fields in functional indexes, which implies an interaction with expressions (potentially complex ones) representing those indexes.\n\n#### Intended behavior\n\nGiven the issue description, the intended behavior would involve integrating a step where, as expressions (representing fields in functional indexes) are resolved or collected, there's a verification process to ensure they correspond to valid model fields. This might involve catching situations where a `FieldError` could be thrown due to invalid field references in those expressions and providing feedback through system checks.\n\n### Next Steps Based on Analysis\n\nGiven the detailed understanding of how `_gen_cols` works and its relevance to the issue, a logical next step could involve exploring how system checks are implemented\u2014particularly those that validate model field references in the context of expressions and indexes. The relationship between system checks (`check` methods across various modules) and how fields are represented and validated (evident from the context where `FieldError` is involved) suggests a path forward:\n\n1. **Enhance Existing Checks or Create New Ones:** By leveraging the mechanism that traverses expressions for collecting columns (as seen in `_gen_cols`), inject logic to validate field references against the model's field definitions. This would ideally happen in conjunction with the existing system's check framework.\n\n2. **Handling FieldError More Gracefully:** Since `FieldError` instances signal invalid field references, ensuring that these errors contribute to constructive feedback in system checks (rather than simply causing unhandled exceptions) is crucial. This might require adjustments in places where expressions are evaluated or resolved (as indicated by `resolve_expression` findings).\n\n3. **Explore Further Context:** Given the unsuccessful search for `#26167`, further attempts could involve checking related documentation, commit history, or external discussions for additional clues on previous attempts to address similar issues.\n\n4. **Deepen Understanding of System Checks:** Given the breadth of methods named `check`, focusing on those directly related to models, fields, and indexes could uncover existing patterns or templates for implementing the intended checks.\n\nIn summary, the gathered code context sketches a path forward, emphasizing areas requiring attention while resolving the reported issue. Additional investigation, especially into the existing framework for system checks and how expressions are evaluated and used within the framework, would be instrumental in crafting an effective resolution."

To resolve the issue, the intended behavior should include a step where each field referenced within an expression (especially in the context of functional indexes) is validated against the set of existing model fields. This validation step should be capable of catching and reporting any references to non-existent fields, contributing to a system check mechanism that can preemptively notify developers of misconfigured functional indexes. This enhancement must preserve the method's ability to traverse and yield column expressions but with added validation to catch misconfigurations earlier in the development process.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** django/core/checks/model_checks.py (Assuming based on context and naming convention; note that the exact file may vary as this is a logical deduction.)\n  - **Class:** (Assumed or new class/method related to model checks, e.g., `ModelIndexChecks` or a similar system checks class)\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Given the issue's implication that system checks for invalid model field names in functional indexes are lacking, a new method or enhancing an existing one here should be responsible for invoking checks against all models' indexes defined in Meta classes. This method should leverage Django\u2019s system check framework to verify that no functional indexes reference invalid fields. The check should catch instances where expressions forming part of an index reference fields not defined on the model, leveraging the logic from `_gen_cols` or similar to resolve expressions to their constituent fields. The check's outcome would ideally be a warning or error within the Django check framework that informs the user of misconfigured indexes, particularly those that might otherwise lead to runtime errors.\n  \nThese enhancements should integrate seamlessly with the existing system checks and expression resolution mechanisms, improving the robustness of model configuration and the clarity of developer feedback when issues are detected."
