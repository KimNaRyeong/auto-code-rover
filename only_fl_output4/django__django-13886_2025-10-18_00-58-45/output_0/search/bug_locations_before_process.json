        "intended_behavior": "While the `_gen_cols` method effectively iterates through expressions to yield column objects, the resolution lacks a step for validating the existence or validity of model fields referenced in those expressions. To resolve the issue, the intended behavior should include a step where each field referenced within an expression (especially in the context of functional indexes) is validated against the set of existing model fields. This validation step should be capable of catching and reporting any references to non-existent fields, contributing to a system check mechanism that can preemptively notify developers of misconfigured functional indexes. This enhancement must preserve the method's ability to traverse and yield column expressions but with added validation to catch misconfigurations earlier in the development process."

        "intended_behavior": "Given the issue's implication that system checks for invalid model field names in functional indexes are lacking, a new method or enhancing an existing one here should be responsible for invoking checks against all models' indexes defined in Meta classes. This method should leverage Django\u2019s system check framework to verify that no functional indexes reference invalid fields. The check should catch instances where expressions forming part of an index reference fields not defined on the model, leveraging the logic from `_gen_cols` or similar to resolve expressions to their constituent fields. The check's outcome would ideally be a warning or error within the Django check framework that informs the user of misconfigured indexes, particularly those that might otherwise lead to runtime errors."
