This is not straightforward because resolving expressions with non-existent throws FieldError, so we cannot just collect columns from Query._gen_cols().\nFollow up to #26167.\nI attached tests.\n</issue>"

The focus is on finding related classes, methods, and code snippets mentioned or implicated by the issue description.\n\n1. The issue mentions \"system checks\" related to \"invalid models fields in functional indexes.\" A logical starting point would be to look for any existing system checks implementations related to models or indexes, particularly those in Meta class definitions.\n\n   - `search_code(\"class Meta:\")`\n   - `search_method(\"check\")`\n\n2. Since the issue involves \"resolving expressions with non-existent throws FieldError\", it implies that there might be existing methods that deal with resolving expressions or related functionality. Identifying these could provide insight into where the new checks could be integrated.\n\n   - `search_code(\"FieldError\")`\n   - `search_method(\"resolve_expression\")`\n\n3. The issue follows up to \"#26167\", which suggests there might be relevant changes or discussions in previous commits or issues that could provide context or solution hints.\n\n   - `search_code(\"#26167\")`\n\n4. The issue mentions \"collect columns from Query._gen_cols()\" which indicates that there might be a specific method `_gen_cols` in a `Query` class or similar that's related to the functionality in question.\n\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"_gen_cols\", \"Query\")`\n\nEach of these searches aims to provide a comprehensive background to approach the issue effectively, targeting different aspects of the implementation that could be related to adding the intended system checks."
