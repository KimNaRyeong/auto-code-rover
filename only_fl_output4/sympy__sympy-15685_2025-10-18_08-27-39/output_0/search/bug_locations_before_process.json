        "intended_behavior": "The `scale_factor` should be made private (changing it to `_scale_factor`) to encapsulate its functionality and reduce direct public access. This change must be accompanied by ensuring all internal accesses and modifications of `scale_factor` use the new private name. This will involve updating existing methods in the `Quantity` class that directly interact with `scale_factor`, such as `set_scale_factor`, `convert_to`, and potentially any others that read or modify this property. Additionally, accessors (getter and setter methods) for the now-private `_scale_factor` should be added to enable controlled access and mutation of this property. These accessors should ensure that any adjustments or calculations related to the scale factor are done internally, presenting a consistent and correct interface reflecting SI units to the user."

        "method": "convert_to",
        "intended_behavior": "The `convert_to` method should be reviewed and possibly adjusted to ensure that conversions between units correctly account for the `scale_factor`, especially in contexts involving conversions that have historically led to unexpected results, like the ohm/1000 issue. This may involve ensuring that the `scale_factor` is used precisely during the conversion process, potentially incorporating more detailed logic to handle cases where the straightforward application of `scale_factor` would lead to incorrect outcomes. The main goal is to make the method's behavior consistent with user expectations in SI units, without exposing internal adjustments or workarounds necessary to achieve this goal."
