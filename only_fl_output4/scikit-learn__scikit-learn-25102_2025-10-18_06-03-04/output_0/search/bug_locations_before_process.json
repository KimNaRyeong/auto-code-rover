The class should potentially include a new method or extend existing ones to support a new parameter or mechanism for preserving original dtypes. This addition should respect the configuration specified by users to either retain the original dtypes upon output or default to the current behavior. This enhancement must ensure compatibility with all transformers using this mixin, safeguarding against any unintended side effects."

This implementation should be careful to only alter dtypes that can safely be preserved post-transformation, potentially leaving others as is or documenting behavior when certain dtypes cannot be preserved (e.g., due to transformation logic that inherently changes data characteristics)."

The modification needs to ensure that dtype preservation settings (which could be introduced as part of the estimator's configuration or a global setting) are respected and applied correctly when wrapping the data. This means integrating dtype handling logic that aligns with the adjustments made in _wrap_in_pandas_container for a seamless transition of dtypes from input to output."
