This script aims to reproduce the issue where dtypes are converted to `np.float64` in a pandas DataFrame output by scikit-learn transformers, contrary to the expected preservation of original dtypes like `np.float16` or `category`. 

The script checks if the output from the `SelectKBest` transformer preserves the `np.float16` dtype for a float column and `category` dtype for a categorical column. Given the current functionality (as of the provided information's knowledge cutoff date), this script will raise an `AssertionError` because these dtypes are not preserved after transformation. This behavior exemplifies the issue.

The script uses a hypothetical example where `.set_output(transform="pandas")` might specify the desired output format, including dtype preservation, though such a method is not currently available. This choice is made to fit the specific requirements and simulate the issue while also providing a basis for testing against future improvements or changes that might address this issue.
