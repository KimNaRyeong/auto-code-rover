This script now attempts to reproduce the issue by checking if the dtypes are preserved after transformation with `SelectKBest`. However, as the issue noted, dtype conversion is not currently an option within sklearn transformers, so the expected output is based on an illustration of how dtypes might be preserved if the feature were implemented. It's designed to exit with code 1 (indicating failure/error presence) if the dtypes are not preserved as outlined or an exception occurs, and code 0 if the issue is fixed and dtypes are preserved as expected (though the script as written expects failure given the current sklearn behavior).
