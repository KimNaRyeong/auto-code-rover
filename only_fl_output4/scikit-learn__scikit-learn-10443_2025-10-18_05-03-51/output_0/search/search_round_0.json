        "content": "To address the reported issue, I need to examine how `dtype` is handled within the `TfidfVectorizer` class and its relevant methods like `fit` or `fit_transform`. First, I'll look into the `TfidfVectorizer` class and any methods within it that might be relevant to processing the `dtype`. Given the nature of the issue, I suspect the actual handling of `dtype` may occur deeper in the implementation, possibly within methods that `TfidfVectorizer` relies on from its parent class or related utility functions. Here are the search API calls I plan to make:\n\n1. `search_class(\"TfidfVectorizer\")`: This will help me find where the `TfidfVectorizer` class is defined in the codebase.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"TfidfVectorizer\")`: Even though the issue may not directly stem from this method, it's a good starting point to understand how `dtype` could be processed or passed along.\n3. `search_method_in_class(\"fit_transform\", \"TfidfVectorizer\")`: Similar reason as above; to see if `dtype` is properly considered within this method.\n4. `search_code(\"dtype\")`: Since the issue revolves around the handling of the `dtype` parameter, this broad search should help identify where and how `dtype` is being used across the project, especially in contexts related to feature extraction or vectorization. \n\nThese actions will give us a comprehensive overview of how `dtype` is handled within `TfidfVectorizer` and any potentially relevant points in the code where this issue could be addressed."
