This adjustment will ensure that the transformation utilities that rely on this parameter correctly apply the specified `dtype` throughout the TF-IDF calculation process."

        "intended_behavior": "Inside `fit_transform`, after the call to `super().fit_transform(raw_documents)` and the fitting of the internal `_tfidf` with `X`, ensure the `transform` method invoked on `_tfidf` respects the `dtype` specified during the class initialization. This may involve ensuring that downstream methods or utilities that perform the actual data transformations (like those in `_tfidf.transform`) receive and correctly implement the `dtype`. The key is to confirm and possibly adjust how `dtype` is passed to and used by these underlying methods to ensure the output matrix `X` reflects the specified `dtype`."
