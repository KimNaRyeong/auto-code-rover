        "content": "<issue>Feature/docs: how should url converters decline to match for a named route?\nDescription\nIt is sometimes convenient to have multiple instances of a named route, where the correct one is chosen based on whether the URL converters to_url call succeeds. For example, the attached file has routes like this:\npath('export/foo/<foo:obj>', index, name='export'),\npath('export/bar/<bar:obj>', index, name='export'),\nI then wanted to put {% url \"export\" some_foo_or_bar %} in a generic export template and have the correct URL inserted.\nMy first attempt to do this was to raise ValueError in to_url for non-matching values, hoping that it would work the same as to_python where the docs specify that \"A ValueError is interpreted as no match.\"\nThat didn't work -- nothing catches the ValueError in to_url -- so I found the workaround demonstrated in the attachment: if to_url returns an empty string (or some string that doesn't match the converter's regex), then the later regex check in _reverse_with_prefix will detect the non-match and everything seems to work out.\nSo this is either a feature request or a documentation check. I'm thinking either:\n_reverse_with_prefix could be updated so to_url works the same as to_python, and a ValueError indicates no match (which I think just means wrapping try: ... except ValueError: continue around the appropriate line), or\nthe docs could be updated to indicate that, in to_url, a converter should return a non-regex-matching string such as the empty string in order to decline a match.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the search results, let\u2019s analyze the returned context concerning the issue described:\n\n### Analysis of `to_url` Method Search Results\n\n- **Found in File:** `django/urls/converters.py` (6 matches)\n- **Analysis:**\n  - **What it does:** The `to_url` method is likely a part of custom URL converter definitions in Django, as specified in the `urls/converters.py` file. Converters are used in Django to specify how dynamic parts of a URL (path converters) are converted to their URL string representations.\n  - **Relationship to the bug:** The issue arises when trying to use these converters in a way that expects a `ValueError` thrown in `to_url` to signal a non-match, similar to how a `ValueError` in `to_python` signals a non-match during URL resolution.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Ideally, raising a `ValueError` in `to_url` would indicate that the current converter cannot handle the given value, allowing Django to continue trying other routes or converters until a match is found or all possibilities are exhausted.\n\n### Analysis of `_reverse_with_prefix` Search Results\n\n- **Found in Files:** `django/urls/base.py` and `django/urls/resolvers.py`\n- **Analysis:**\n  - **What it does:** `_reverse_with_prefix` is a method used internally by Django's URL routing system to attempt to reverse-resolve views to URL patterns. It factors in any namespacing and prefixing that might be part of the URL pattern definition.\n  - **Relationship to the bug:** This method is central to the issue described because it's responsible for figuring out the correct URL pattern to use when multiple named routes are present. According to the issue, the current implementation does not handle `ValueError` thrown from `to_url` as an indication that the match should be declined.\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Modifying `_reverse_with_prefix` to catch `ValueError` thrown by `to_url` and continue trying other routes could achieve the behavior requested in the issue. This would align the handling of `to_url` errors with the described expectations.\n\n### Analysis of `path` Method Search Results\n\n- **Found in Various Files:** Largely unrelated to the issue context, as the results refer to files handling file paths (in migrations, file storage, and management commands) instead of URL path definitions within Django\u2019s routing system.\n- **Analysis:**\n  - These results do not directly pertain to the issue at hand, which involves the `path` function used in URL confs to define route patterns. The result indicates a misunderstanding or a misdirection in the search query due to the generic nature of the term \"path.\"\n  - **Intended Behavior:** We were hoping to find context around how Django\u2019s `path` function uses converters and interacts with the routing system, specifically how it might relate to handling `to_url` conversion failures. However, the search results did not provide useful information in this direction.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nGiven the analysis above, the core of the issue revolves around the handling of `to_url` within the URL routing and resolution machinery of Django, specifically in how `_reverse_with_prefix` processes or fails to process `ValueError` as a signal from `to_url`.\n\n**Next Step:**\n- We should consider making a further precise search to explore the internal mechanism of how Django\u2019s URL routing system (particularly within `django/urls/resolvers.py`) manages the conversion failures in `to_url` and how it proceeds with route matching when converters decline compatibility. This would involve looking directly into the implementation details of `_reverse_with_prefix` within `django/urls/resolvers.py` to uncover how it iterates over potential matches and handles exceptions."

To address the issue, this method should be modified to catch `ValueError` exceptions raised by `to_url` methods of URL converters. When a `ValueError` is caught, the method should interpret this as a signal that the current pattern is not a match and continue trying other patterns within the URLResolver. This modification should preserve the existing functionality of matching URLs to view functions while also enabling the use of `ValueError` in `to_url` to gracefully decline matches that are not appropriate for the given inputs. This change requires a careful implementation to ensure that other types of legitimate errors are not inadvertently swallowed, possibly through specific handling or logging of these cases.\n  \nThis modification directly targets the behavior described in the issue, where the developer expected that raising a `ValueError` in a `to_url` method would indicate a failure to match a URL pattern, similar to how `to_python` behaves. Integrating this change should allow URL converters more flexibility in determining whether they can handle a given input, improving Django's URL routing system's versatility and developer experience."
