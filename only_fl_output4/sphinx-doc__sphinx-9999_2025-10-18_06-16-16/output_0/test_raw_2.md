To accurately address the task at hand, considering the Sphinx and LaTeX specific nature of the issue, let's create a `reproducer.py` script that attempts to simulate the reported issue. This script will need to dynamically create a minimal Sphinx project with the provided RST snippet. It will then build this project with Sphinx, targeting LaTeX output to check if the newline separation issue occurs. Note, this approach assumes that `sphinx` and the necessary LaTeX tools are installed in the environment where this script runs.

Here is a conceptual framework for such a script. Please adjust paths and specific execution details according to your environment and needs.

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

This script attempts to encapsulate the creation of a minimal Sphinx project, inserting a content snippet that should trigger the issue, and then running Sphinx to generate LaTeX output. The script assumes you have a check ready for the specific issue you're looking to reproduce, which will likely involve parsing the generated LaTeX file for expected output patterns or inconsistencies. 

Please ensure Sphinx, LaTeX, and necessary dependencies are properly installed and configured in your environment before running this script. Additionally, the cleanup mechanism and specific error checks need to be tailored to your specific context and what you consider a successful reproduction of the issue.
