Certainly! Below is a standalone Python script designed to reproduce the issue described. This script will attempt to build a minimal Sphinx project that includes the reStructuredText snippet causing the issue. It will then check the generated LaTeX file for the expected behavior (terms separated by a newline in the case of the glossary entries and the absence of unnecessary new lines for the simple indentation issue). If the issue is present, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace.

Please ensure you have Sphinx installed in your environment (`pip install sphinx`) before running this script.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

This script performs the following steps:
1. Creates a basic Sphinx project with a single `index.rst` containing the problematic reStructuredText.
2. Configures the Sphinx project with minimal settings required to generate a LaTeX document.
3. Builds the LaTeX document using Sphinx.
4. Checks the generated `.tex` file for the presence of the issue.
5. Raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is detected, printing a detailed stack trace.

Before running the script, ensure Sphinx is correctly installed and accessible in your Python environment. The script assumes the Sphinx `sphinx-build` command is available on the system path.
