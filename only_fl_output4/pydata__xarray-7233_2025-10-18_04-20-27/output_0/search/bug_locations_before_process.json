        "intended_behavior": "The `construct` method must be adjusted to ensure that non-dimensional coordinates are preserved as coordinates in the output dataset, not demoted to variables. While performing the coarsening operation and restructuring data into new dimensions, the method should explicitly check and maintain the status of existing coordinates. It should differentiate between non-dimensional coordinates and data variables throughout the process, ensuring that the metadata integrity (specifically, the distinction between coordinates and variables) is maintained. This fix should be applied in a way that does not affect the primary functionality of coarsening data but simply ensures the metadata is handled correctly."
