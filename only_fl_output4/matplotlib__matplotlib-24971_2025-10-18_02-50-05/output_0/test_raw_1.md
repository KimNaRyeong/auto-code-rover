Given the requirements, let's attempt another version of the `reproducer.py` with a slight modification in the approach to make sure that the `AssertionError` is raised under the correct circumstances when the issue is indeed present.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_images_identical(img1_path, img2_path):
    from skimage.metrics import structural_similarity as ssim
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    img1 = plt.imread(img1_path)
    img2 = plt.imread(img2_path)
    
    # Convert to grayscale to focus on structure
    img1_gray = img1.mean(axis=2)
    img2_gray = img2.mean(axis=2)
    
    similarity_index = ssim(img1_gray, img2_gray)
    
    if similarity_index < 1.0:
        raise AssertionError(f"Images are not identical, SSIM: {similarity_index}")

def main():
    import matplotlib
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    # Ensure the settings from previous figures are not affecting the new test
    plt.close('all')
    matplotlib.rcParams.update(matplotlib.rcParamsDefault)

    arr = np.arange(100).reshape((10, 10))

    matplotlib.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use'] = True

    fig, ax_dict = plt.subplot_mosaic('AB;AC', figsize=(6, 9), width_ratios=[3, 2],
                                      layout='compressed')

    for key in ["B", "C"]:
        ax_dict[key].imshow(arr)
    
    fig.savefig("test1.png", bbox_inches="tight")
    fig.clf()  # Clear the figure to mimic the state before the second save
    
    # Re-create the figure setup before second save
    fig, ax_dict = plt.subplot_mosaic('AB;AC', figsize=(6, 9), width_ratios=[3, 2],
                                      layout='compressed')

    for key in ["B", "C"]:
        ax_dict[key].imshow(arr)

    fig.savefig("test2.png", bbox_inches="tight")
    
    try:
        check_images_identical("test1.png", "test2.png")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError:
        exit(1)
    exit(0)
```

This version attempts to explicitly separate the creation and saving of the first and second figures by clearing the figure after the first save (`fig.clf()`) and re-creating the setup for the second figure. This approach is intended to closely mimic potential real-world usage where the figure might be modified or recreated between saves, which could lead to discrepancies not caught by simpler tests. 

Please note that the use of `skimage.metrics.structural_similarity` for comparing the images is to closely evaluate the similarity between the two images beyond simple pixel equality, which allows for a more nuanced comparison, especially in cases where minor rendering differences might not be visually perceptible but could still indicate a bug.
