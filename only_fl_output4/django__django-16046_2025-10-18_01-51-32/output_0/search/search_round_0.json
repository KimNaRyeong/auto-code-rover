This would involve:\n\n1. Identifying the file and method where the offending line is part of. Since the description doesn't provide specific details about the file or class containing the code, we should first search for the code snippet provided.\n2. Once we know where the code resides, we can retrieve more of the surrounding code to understand the context better and how the check is performed.\n\nBased on the problem description, the first step is to use the provided code snippet to locate it within the project. The specific string we are interested in is `if str_number[0] == \"-\"`. The search will help us identify the file and potentially the method or class containing it. \n\nLet's proceed with the call:\n\n- `search_code(\"if str_number[0] == \\\"-\\\"\")`"
