However, `type(BaseClass.baseclass_class_property)` returns the type of the returned object, since essentially, a `@classmethod@property` ends up behaving like a class attribute. So Sphinx doesn't really have a chance to extract the docstring.\n**EDIT 2:** Seems like this will get fixed in python 3.10, cf. https://bugs.python.org/issue43682.\n> Static methods (`@staticmethod`) and class methods (`@classmethod`) now inherit the method attributes (`__module__`, `__name__`, `__qualname__`, `__doc__`, `__annotations__`) and have a new __wrapped__ attribute.\nI will try to test this with the beta release.\n-----\n### Describe the bug\n> Changed in version 3.9: Class methods can now wrap other descriptors such as property().\nThat is, since python version 3.9 we can write code like\n```python\nclass A:\n@classmethod\n@property\ndef f(cls):\n\"\"\"Some class property.\"\"\"\nreturn \"property\"\n```\nHowever, sphinx does not seem to document any such methods (regular `@property` decorated methods get documented just fine.)\n### How to Reproduce\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/randolf-scholz/sphinx_demo\ncd sphinx_demo/docs\nmake html\n# open _build/html/dummy_module.submodule.html\n```\nThe following methods were erroneously not documented:\n- `MetaClass.metaclass_class_property`\n- `MetaClass.metaclass_abstract_class_property`\n- `BaseClass.baseclass_class_property`\n- `BaseClass.baseclass_abstract_class_property`\n- `SubClass.subclass_class_property`\n- `SubClass.subclass_abstract_class_property`\n### Expected behavior\nMethods that are decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property` should be documented appropriately.\n### Your project\nhttps://github.com/randolf-scholz/sphinx_demo\n### Screenshots\n_No response_\n### OS\nUbuntu 20.04.2 LTS\n### Python version\n3.9.6\n### Sphinx version\n4.0.3\n### Sphinx extensions\nsphinx.ext.autodoc, sphinx.ext.autosummary\n### Extra tools\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

The failure to find classes and methods could indicate a need for broader or different search strategies, considering possible issues such as mismatches in class or method names, or challenges in locating them within the codebase structure.\n\nSince direct searching for classes, class methods, and the code pattern did not yield results, let's consider alternative approaches:\n\n1. **Broaden the code snippet search criteria:** Given that direct code pattern `@classmethod\\n@property` did not return results, it's possible that the codebase uses variances of this pattern, or that the formatting affected the search. A broader search might involve looking for instances of `@classmethod` and `@property` separately or in a broader context. However, this might return too general results, considering these decorators are common in Python codebases.\n\n2. **Search for relevant files:** Since the classes and methods can't be directly found, it might be beneficial to search for files that likely contain these classes based on naming conventions or related modules. The repository mentioned is a \"sphinx_demo\", hinting at demonstration purposes for Sphinx documentation. If the issue describes missing documentation for certain class methods, it might be helpful to search for files related to Sphinx configuration or documentation sources in the project.\n\nGiven the limitations in direct searching, the following API calls could provide additional context or indirect paths to find relevant code:\n\n- `search_code(\"class\")`: This broad search might return too many results but can help in identifying how classes are declared if there's a specific pattern or naming convention used that differs from the standard expectations.\n- `search_code(\"def\")`: Similar to searching for \"class\", this aims to catch how methods are defined, possibly catching unique implementations of class methods or properties.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"sphinx\", \"conf.py\")`: This attempts to find configurations related to Sphinx documentation, assuming \"conf.py\" is the configuration file for Sphinx. It may provide clues on how the documentation is set up or if specific extensions or settings are influencing the documentation output.\n\nThese approaches attempt to circumvent the direct issue of not finding specific classes or methods by gathering more general context on the project structure, class definitions, method definitions, and Sphinx configuration. This broader context might lead to insights about why the issue is occurring or suggest other specific areas of the code or documentation setup that could be the cause of the problem."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Thus, in adherence to the guidelines for this task:\n\n1. **do we need more context**: Yes, we need more context. However, given the limitations of our capabilities, we're unable to formulate effective search API calls beyond the previously mentioned strategies without repeating the same unsuccessful approaches.\n\n2. **where are bug locations**: Without specific results from the search API, I cannot accurately identify the buggy files, classes, and methods. Therefore, I cannot provide the necessary locations that need to be fixed or describe the intended behavior of the code at those locations.\n\nTo progress towards resolving the issue described, a manual inspection of the codebase, specifically looking into the implementation of the Sphinx documentation setup (e.g., `conf.py`), class definitions, and method declarations within the project repository provided in the issue, would be required. This hands-on approach would allow for direct observation of how `@classmethod` and `@property` decorators are used and how Sphinx is configured, which could reveal why the documentation output does not include the expected methods."
