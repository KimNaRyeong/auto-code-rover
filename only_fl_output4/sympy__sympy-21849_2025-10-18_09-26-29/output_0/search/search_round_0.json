        "content": "In order to resolve this issue, we need to understand how the `LambertW` function and its LaTeX representation are implemented in Sympy, and why it's causing a `TypeError` when passed with an unexpected keyword argument `exp`. The traceback suggests that the error arises from the LaTeX printer when trying to print a power of the `LambertW` function. Let's gather the necessary information using the described API calls:\n\n1. Search for the class `LambertW` to understand its structure and methods, as well as its relationship with other classes that might be relevant to this error:\n```python\nsearch_class(\"LambertW\")\n```\n\n2. Since the error mentions `_print_LambertW` receiving an unexpected keyword argument `exp`, let's find out where this method is defined. It is likely part of a printer class responsible for generating LaTeX representations of expressions:\n```python\nsearch_method(\"_print_LambertW\")\n```\n\n3. The traceback also involves `_print_Pow`, suggesting that the printer is trying to handle a power (`Pow`) expression. We should look at how this method is implemented to figure out why it would pass `exp` as a keyword argument to `_print_LambertW`:\n```python\nsearch_method(\"_print_Pow\")\n```\n\n4. Understanding how `Pow` expressions are handled in general, and specifically how they interact with the `LambertW` function in the LaTeX printer, might be key in solving this issue. To get a complete view, let's search for the `Pow` class definition:\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Pow\")\n```\n\nThese API calls should give us a comprehensive understanding of how the `LambertW` function, power expressions, and their LaTeX representations are implemented in Sympy, pointing us towards the root cause of the issue and indicating how it might be resolved."
