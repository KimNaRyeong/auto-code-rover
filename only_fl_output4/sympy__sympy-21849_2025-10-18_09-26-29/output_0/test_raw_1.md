Given the previous misunderstanding, let's adjust the approach for the standalone Python script. The critical aspect of reproducing the issue is not merely checking if the execution leads to an error but rather if specific operations with the SymPy library, and potentially its interaction with IPython (which underlies Jupyter's execution model), lead to an error. Since the problem described involves the display of `LambertW` function results in Jupyter Lab and might be related to IPython's display mechanism, simulating the error in a standalone script requires us to mimic this environment or context.

However, it's important to note that a standalone script running in a standard Python interpreter won't completely replicate the IPython environment in Jupyter Lab. The error could be tied to the IPython display system, which uses special `__repr__` methods (like `_repr_latex_`) to render objects. Executing this in a non-IPython environment might not trigger the error due to the absence of this rendering process.

To aim closer at replicating the conditions, I will write a script that tries to imitate the display process in a basic manner. Yet, it's crucial to remember for a complete reproduction, testing within an actual Jupyter or IPython environment may be necessary. Here's a revised attempt that also checks for potential issues when trying to display `LambertW` objects using their LaTeX representation, hoping to better mimic the conditions where the error might occur:

```python
# reproducer.py
import sympy as sp

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def sympy_latex_rendering_check():
    """Mimics the LaTeX rendering part of _repr_latex_ for SymPy objects"""
    sp.init_printing(use_latex='mathjax')
    expr = sp.Pow(sp.LambertW(2), 2)
    latex_string = sp.latex(expr)
    print(latex_string)
    
def main():
    try:
        sympy_latex_rendering_check()
        print("The issue is fixed, exiting with code 0.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue with displaying LambertW raised to a power is present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script switches focus towards generating LaTeX representations directly with SymPy, which is a closer action to what Jupyter would perform when trying to display mathematical expressions. Note that it does not precisely simulate the Jupyter display mechanisms but targets the rendering issue highlighted in the stack trace provided. If this approach also does not reproduce the issue outside of the Jupyter environment, the error likely resides in the specific integration of SymPy with Jupyter/IPython's display functions, which this script can't fully emulate.
