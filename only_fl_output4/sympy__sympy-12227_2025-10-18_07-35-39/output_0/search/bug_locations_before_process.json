        "intended_behavior": "The `__new__` method should be modified to explicitly handle both binary precision (`prec`) and decimal precision (`dps`), making the distinction clear. Introduce separate keyword arguments for `dps` and `prec` in the method signature, ensuring that they are mutually exclusive to prevent ambiguity. If both `prec` and `dps` are provided by the user, the method should raise an error to avoid confusion over which precision is intended. The method should maintain backward compatibility by interpreting the `prec` argument as it currently does, but add checks and conversion logic to handle the new `dps` keyword correctly. Update documentation within the method to explain the new functionality and usage of `dps` and `prec`. Incorporate a deprecation warning for usage of `prec` in the decimal precision context to guide users towards the new `dps` argument."
