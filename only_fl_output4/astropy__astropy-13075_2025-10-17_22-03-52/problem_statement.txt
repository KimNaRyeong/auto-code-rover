Register format ``html`` to ``Cosmology.write`` with nice mathjax
Cosmology can now read and write to files.
It would be nice to register with ``Cosmology.write`` a  method for exporting a Cosmology to a HTML table.
There are good examples of IO with Cosmology at https://github.com/astropy/astropy/tree/main/astropy/cosmology/io
and documentation at https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/cosmology/io.html#cosmology-io

I'm thinking the ``write_html(...)`` method would call ``cosmology.io.table.to_table()``, format the table to nice MathJax or something and then call the `QTable.write(..., format='html')`.

Edit: also, the mathjax representation of each parameter can be stored on the corresponding Parameter object, like how units have the ``format`` argument in [def_unit](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.units.def_unit.html#astropy.units.def_unit).
