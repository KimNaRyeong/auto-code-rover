        "intended_behavior": "In the fit method, adapt the call to check_X_y and check_array to support 3D inputs if the base estimator can process such data formats. This could involve implementing a condition to skip or modify the input validation step for X when a compatibility flag or attribute in the base estimator indicates support for 3D inputs. The method should continue to ensure all other validation checks (e.g., for finite values) without enforcing a 2D shape limitation unconditionally."

        "intended_behavior": "Modify the predict_proba method similarly to accept 3D arrays when the underlying model or calibrated classifiers can handle such input shapes. This adjustment might require a conditional application of check_array, analyzing if the model's design or a specific attribute/flag permits 3D input. The aim is to offer flexibility for advanced use cases without disrupting the current functionality for more typical 2D input scenarios."

If fit and predict_proba are adapted to accept 3D inputs, then predict should be adjusted in a parallel manner, ensuring it can also handle 3D inputs appropriately based on the base estimator's capabilities."
