Certainly! Below is a standalone Python file named `reproducer.py`. This script is designed to set up a minimal Django environment, define a `OrderItem` model, and reproduce the issue as described. It will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, including printing a detailed stack trace of the issue. Remember to have Django installed in your environment where you plan to run this script.

```python
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Sum, Value
from django.db.models.functions import Coalesce

# Minimal Django configuration necessary for the script to run.
settings.configure(
    INSTALLED_APPS=[
        '__main__',  # This script is the main module.
    ],
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        }
    },
    USE_TZ=True,
)

django.setup()


class OrderItem(models.Model):
    quantity = models.IntegerField()

    class Meta:
        app_label = '__main__'


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def reproduce_issue():
    # Ensuring the database starts in a known state
    OrderItem.objects.all().delete()
    OrderItem.objects.create(quantity=50)

    # Test 1: Matched queryset should return 50 as per aggregate
    matched_result = OrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[1]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))
    assert matched_result['test'] == 50, f"Expected 50, got {matched_result['test']}"

    # Test 2: Unmatched queryset should return 0 as per Coalesce default
    unmatched_result = OrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[-1]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))
    assert unmatched_result['test'] == 0, f"Expected 0, got {unmatched_result['test']}"

    # Test 3: Empty queryset should return 0 as per Coalesce, but is expected to raise for illustration
    try:
        empty_result = OrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))
        # The following assertion will fail if the issue persists
        assert empty_result['test'] == 0, f"Expected 0, got {empty_result['test']}"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise


if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError:
        # Exiting with code 0 as instructed, assuming assertions are expected to catch the demonstration of the issue.
        os._exit(0)
    else:
        print("Issue not present.")
```

This script sets up a minimal Django model and environment, then proceeds to conduct three tests that lead up to the issue described. If the issue is present (i.e., the script is unable to produce the expected result where the `Coalesce` function should return `0` instead of `None` for an empty input list), it captures and prints the `AssertionError` stack trace. 

Make sure you have Django installed in your environment (`pip install django`) and run the script using `python3 reproducer.py` in the root directory of a suitable project or in a minimal setup as described.

Keep in mind that over time, the Django project might fix this issue, implicit behaviors might change, or links to source code may become outdated due to changes in the repository. This script is based on the issue's description as of its conception and Django's status quo up to the end of 2023.
