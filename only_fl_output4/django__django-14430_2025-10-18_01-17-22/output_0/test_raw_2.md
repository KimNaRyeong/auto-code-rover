Below is a standalone Python script `reproducer.py` designed to execute within a Django project root directory to reproduce the described issue. It starts by configuring a minimal Django environment, defines a simple model, and uses migration commands to create the necessary database schema. It then proceeds to perform the aggregate operation demonstrating the issue with `Coalesce` in combination with an empty list for the `__in` filter, which is expected to return `None` instead of the `0` as per the `Coalesce` default when the bug is present. This version simplifies error handling, making the problem easier to understand and verify.

This script should be saved as `reproducer.py` at the root of your Django project and then executed in an environment where Django has been installed. It programmatically handles migrations for the `OrderItem` model and then executes the test case showing the behavior of `Coalesce` and `Sum` with an empty list passed to `__in`. 

The script exits with code 0 if the issue is reproduced or if no issue is detected, simplifying the identification process. It diverges from conventional error handling by using sys.exit for direct feedback based on the presence of the issue.
