See below:\n# Test with matched Queryset. Sum will return 50\nOrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[1]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))\n>>>{'test': 50}\n# Test with unmatched Queryset. Sum will return 0\nOrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[-1]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))\n>>> {'test':0}\n# Test with unmatched Queryset (using empty list). EmptyResultSet returned because of empty list. Sum will return NONE\nOrderItem.objects.filter(pk__in=[]).aggregate(test=Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0)))\n>>> {'test': None}\nSimon Charette on django-users suggested the following:\nFrom what I understand the ORM simply doesn't perform any query in this case\nas the pk__in lookup cannot match any OrderItem and result in an\nEmptyResultSet exception[1].\nThis exception is caught in the Query.get_aggregation() method where all\naggregates are converted to None[2].\nI suppose we should alter the except EmptyResultSet clause to account for\nouter_query.annotation_select items that are Coalesce() instances used with\nValue() but I'm unsure about how it should be done.\n[1] \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/2e0cd26ffb29189add1e0435913fd1490f52b20d/django/db/models/lookups.py#L221-L223\n[2] \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/2e0cd26ffb29189add1e0435913fd1490f52b20d/django/db/models/sql/query.py#L439-L445\nSee full discussion here:\n\u200bhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/django-users/HGD3Vv3IerA\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue described, we need to understand how Django handles the `__in` lookup resulting in an `EmptyResultSet` and how the `aggregate` method deals with it, specifically when `Coalesce` and `Sum` are used. To get the necessary context, I will perform the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the `EmptyResultSet` exception class to understand its implementation and usage within Django:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"EmptyResultSet\")\n```\n\n2. Since the `EmptyResultSet` exception is mentioned to be caught in the `Query.get_aggregation()` method, I'll search for this method within the `Query` class to see how aggregates are handled in cases where no records are matched:\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"get_aggregation\", \"Query\")\n```\n\n3. Furthermore, to understand when the `EmptyResultSet` exception is raised, especially in the context of using `pk__in=[]`, it's important to inspect the part of the code that deals with this condition. The issue mentions it being part of lookup processing, so let's find the relevant code snippet in the `lookups.py` file where this exception might be raised:\n\n```python\nsearch_code_in_file(\"raise EmptyResultSet()\", \"django/db/models/lookups.py\")\n```\n\nThese calls should provide adequate background to start addressing the issue described, specifically how to handle `Coalesce(Sum('quantity'), Value(0))` returning `None` instead of `0` when an empty list is passed to `pk__in`."
