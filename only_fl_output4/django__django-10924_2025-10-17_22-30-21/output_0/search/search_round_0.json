Seeing as the place where these files are stored is different on different machines I have the following:\nimport os\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\nclass LocalFiles(models.Model):\nname = models.CharField(max_length=255)\nfile = models.FilePathField(path=os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir'))\nNow when running manage.py makemigrations it will resolve the path based on the machine it is being run on. Eg: /home/<username>/server_files/example_dir\nI had to manually change the migration to include the os.path.join() part to not break this when running the migration on production/other machine.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to investigate how `FilePathField` is implemented and how it currently handles the `path` argument. Specifically, we want to understand the constructor of `FilePathField` and any relevant logic that deals with the `path` attribute. Gathering details about how migrations are generated for models using `FilePathField` might also be beneficial. Based on the information provided in the issue, I will make the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"FilePathField\")`: To find the implementation details of `FilePathField` in the codebase.\n2. `search_method_in_class(\"deconstruct\", \"FilePathField\")`: To examine how `FilePathField` is deconstructed for migrations, and how the `path` argument is handled during this process. This is relevant because the issue mentions a need to manually adjust the migration to include dynamic paths.\n\nThese calls should provide the necessary context to understand how to modify `FilePathField` to accept a callable as the `path` argument."
