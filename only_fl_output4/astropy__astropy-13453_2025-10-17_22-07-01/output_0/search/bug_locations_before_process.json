This means that the functionality, which currently might be bypassing or incorrectly handling the `formats` argument, needs to be corrected such that:\n- Each column of the table is checked against the `formats` dictionary.\n- If a column's format is specified, apply the provided formatting function or string to each value in the column before outputting to HTML.\n- This change should be done in a way that does not affect the method's ability to handle other arguments or disrupt its existing functionality for cases where `formats` is not provided.\n- The implementation should ensure backward compatibility and maintain the integrity of the HTML structure being generated.\nThe correction should lead to the HTML output mirror the behavior observed when writing to formats like CSV or RST, where the `formats` argument successfully alters the representation of the data in the output file."
