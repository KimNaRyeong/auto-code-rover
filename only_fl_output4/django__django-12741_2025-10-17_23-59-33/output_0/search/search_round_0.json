My plan includes finding the class definition, examining the current method signature, and understanding how and where the method is currently being invoked. \n\nGiven these requirements, the following search API calls would provide the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"DatabaseOperations\")`: This call will help me locate the file or files where the `DatabaseOperations` class is defined. Understanding where this class is defined will allow me to navigate the codebase more effectively.\n\n2. `search_method(\"execute_sql_flush\")`: By performing this search, I can find all occurrences of the `execute_sql_flush` method throughout the project. This includes not just the definition but also where it\u2019s being called, which will help in understanding its current use.\n\n3. `search_code(\"connection.ops.execute_sql_flush\")`: This call is aimed at finding instances in the code where the method is called in the manner described in the issue. It will highlight the need to adjust how the method is invoked once the signature is changed."
