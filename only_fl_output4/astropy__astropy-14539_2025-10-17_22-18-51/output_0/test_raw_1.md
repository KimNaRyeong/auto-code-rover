Given the requirements, let's try again with a slightly modified approach, ensuring any external dependencies such as `astropy` are properly accounted for. This time, we emphasize a direct approach to checking the bug while also incorporating the provided stack trace function to handle the AssertionError more robustly.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    try:
        from astropy.io import fits

        col = fits.Column('a', format='QD', array=[[0], [0, 0]])
        hdu = fits.BinTableHDU.from_columns([col])
        filename = 'diffbug.fits'
        hdu.writeto(filename, overwrite=True)

        # Perform the difference check
        diff_result = fits.FITSDiff(filename, filename)
        assert diff_result.identical, "FITSDiff reports differences between identical files."
        print("No issue detected: the file comparisons are identical as expected.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred:", str(e))
        raise e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

This script includes a direct call to `reproduce_issue()`, which executes the comparison logic via `FITSFiff`. By executing this script in an environment where `astropy` and its dependencies are properly installed, we can observe whether the `AssertionError` is correctly triggered by the specified bug condition (i.e., reporting differences between identical files).

Make sure to set up your environment as needed (e.g., installing `astropy`, `numpy` etc.) before running this script. A successful run means the environment has been correctly configured and `astropy.io.fits.FITSDiff` is behaving as expected under the test conditions. If the script triggers an `AssertionError` and prints the stack trace, it indicates the reproducer has found the reported issue.

The script exits with code 0 if no exceptions occur; any caught `AssertionError` is re-raised after printing the stack trace to ensure visibility of the issue if it persists.
