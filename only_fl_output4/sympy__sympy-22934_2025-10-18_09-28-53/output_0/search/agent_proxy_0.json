Based on the description, it seems the issue is with how elements are checked or included in a fractional field within a mathematical or algebraic library, potentially SymPy or a similar library, given the notation `QQ.frac_field`.\n\nThus, to gather sufficient context, the following API calls would be pertinent:\n\n1. Search for the class that handles fraction fields, which is likely named similarly to `FracField` or directly involved with fraction field operations in the codebase.\n2. Search for the method within this class or relevant to this operation that might be responsible for including elements like `1/x` into the fraction field.\n\nGiven these considerations, the API calls can be:\n\n- `search_class(\"FracField\")`\n- `search_method(\"frac_field\")`\n\nThese calls aim to find the class definition that might be responsible for fraction field operations and any method that directly references creating or handling fraction field objects, specifically how elements are included or checked within such fields."
