        "content": "To gather the necessary context to address the issue, we can perform the following API calls:\n\n1. Since the issue mentions a function `idiff` and includes traceback paths related to `sympy/geometry/util.py`, it's crucial to find this function and examine its implementation. Therefore, a search for this method in the specific file is needed to understand its current handling of `Eq` and function notation:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"idiff\", \"./sympy/geometry/util.py\")`\n\n2. Given the mention of errors when passing an equation in the form of `Eq` and using function notation `f(x)`, it would be helpful to understand how these are handled within the `idiff` method. Since these aren't direct method or class names, looking for their usage or handling logic within `idiff` through code snippets search in the specific file can provide insight:\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"solve(eq.diff(x), dydx)\", \"./sympy/geometry/util.py\")`\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"ValueError(\\\"expecting x-dependent symbol(s) but got:\", \"./sympy/geometry/util.py\")`\n\n3. The `idiff` function might be part of a larger class or module that deals with symbolic differentiation or equation manipulation in general. Understanding its context can be useful, so searching for the class or module where `idiff` resides would be informative:\n   - `search_code(\"def idiff(\", \"./sympy/geometry/util.py\")`\n\nThese API calls are aimed at understanding the specific implementation issues with `idiff` related to handling `Eq` and recognizing `f(x)` as a valid argument. The results will provide the necessary information to consider adjustments or enhancements."

Perform a search for the `idiff` method within the specified file, which is mentioned in the traceback to ascertain its location and implementation:\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"idiff\", \"sympy/geometry/util.py\")`\n\n2. Since the issue describes problems with handling `Eq` and also mentions a specific use case with `f(x)`, it would be useful to explicitly look at how equations and functions are being parsed or handled in the context of `idiff`. Unfortunately, my previous approach assumed a direct method to search code snippets with specific errors or handling within `idiff`, which may not be correct without knowing the exact implementation details. \n\nWithout the capability to directly search for error messages or specific handling of `Eq` and `f(x)` as I implied incorrectly, the corrected approach focuses solely on the `idiff` function's implementation details available in the file mentioned in the traceback to derive a solution based on its current logic and potentially involved error handling.\n\nGiven this clarification and the correct usage of the available APIs, the initial and primary focus should be on examining the `idiff` implementation:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"idiff\", \"sympy/geometry/util.py\")`\n\nThis focused approach will correctly identify the implementation details of `idiff`, which is essential for addressing the issue reported."
