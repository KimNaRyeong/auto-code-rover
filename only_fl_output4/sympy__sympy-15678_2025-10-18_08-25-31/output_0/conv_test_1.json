It first attempts to execute `idiff` with an equation wrapped inside an `Eq` object, which is expected to fail with the described issue.\n2. Then, it tries to pass `f(x)` as part of the equation, which is also supposed to trigger the described failure.\n3. Finally, it checks if `idiff` can correctly solve an expression without using `Eq` objects and `f(x)`, which should work as per your last example.\n\nThe script utilizes assertions to check for the presence of the issues. When executed under the conditions that reproduce the problem, the `AssertionError`s will be skipped due to the exceptions being caught first, and it will print the relevant stack traces. When the issues are fixed, no exception relating to the problem should occur, and the script exits normally with code 0 if everything is correct.\n"
