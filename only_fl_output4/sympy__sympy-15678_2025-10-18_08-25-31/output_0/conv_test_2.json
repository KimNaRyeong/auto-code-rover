Then, it corrects my mistake in attempting to call `Function` from `symbols`, which is not the correct usage and instead defines `y` and `f` as `Function` objects properly.\n\nWith these corrections, the script should accurately reflect the issue described, failing properly where the issues are present and indicating success where the fixes have been applied.\n\nPlease execute this script within your environment to verify the replication and handling of the problem as described."
