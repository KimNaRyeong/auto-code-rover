This script will attempt to configure Django settings with non-uppercase settings, reflecting the issue described. According to Django's documentation and design philosophy, such a configuration should be disallowed, as Django expects all settings to be in uppercase, ensuring a clear distinction between settings and regular variables.

- If the script encounters an AttributeError, it means Django has been fixed to disallow non-uppercase settings, and the script exits with code 0, indicating success (i.e., issue is fixed).
- If the script manages to execute without encountering AttributeError, it implies the bug where non-uppercase settings can be set and accessed is still present, and it signals this by raising an AssertionError and printing a stack trace for debugging purposes, then exits with code 1, indicating failure (i.e., issue is present).
