        "intended_behavior": "This method should include a mechanism to correctly handle negative column indexes by converting them into their positive counterparts based on the current shape of X before they are used to select columns. The adjustment for negative indexes should occur before the _get_column(X, column) method is called within the loop. This ensures that negative indexes are treated consistently with standard Python negative indexing, enabling users to specify columns from the end of the array/DataFrame. The core functionality of the method remains unchanged, but it should validate the range of negative column indices to ensure they are within the valid range for the given data shape, potentially raising an informative error if an index is out of bounds."
