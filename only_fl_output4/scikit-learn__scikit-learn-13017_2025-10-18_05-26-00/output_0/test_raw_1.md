Below is a corrected version of the `reproducer.py` that attempts to capture the original issue outlined. This version focuses on ensuring that the difference in behavior when ColumnTransformer is given negative column indices versus positive column indices is correctly checked and reported in the form of an `AssertionError` when the behavior does not match the expectation. It also uses the provided `print_stacktrace` function correctly to provide more information in case of an error.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_column_transformer_negative_index_issue():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
    from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

    X = np.random.randn(2, 2)
    X_categories = np.array([[1], [2]])
    X = np.concatenate([X, X_categories], axis=1)

    try:
        ohe = OneHotEncoder(categories='auto')
        # Transformer with negative index
        tf_1 = ColumnTransformer([('ohe', ohe, [-1])], remainder='passthrough')
        result_1 = tf_1.fit_transform(X)

        # Transformer with positive index equivalent
        tf_2 = ColumnTransformer([('ohe', ohe, [2])], remainder='passthrough')
        result_2 = tf_2.fit_transform(X)

        # Assert that the shapes are same (implicitly checks correct transformation and dropping of columns)
        assert result_1.shape == result_2.shape, "Shapes from negative and positive column indexing do not match."

        # Additionally, we can check that the contents of the transformed arrays have the correct expected arrangement.
        # Note that this step is somewhat trivial here, as the main concern is whether negative indices are handled properly,
        # which primarily affects the shape. However, more thorough equality checks can be added based on requirements.

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_column_transformer_negative_index_issue()
        print("No issues detected.")
    except AssertionError:
        # If an AssertionError is raised, it indicates that the issue is present.
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
```

This script will execute the test case and compare the behavior of `ColumnTransformer` when given negative versus positive column indices. If the behavior does not match the expectation (i.e., it does not handle negative indices correctly or consistently with positive indices), it will raise an `AssertionError` and provide a traceback for debugging. The script exits with code 0 only when no issue is detected, otherwise, it exits with code 1.
