We'll focus on a subset of classes and methods to get a comprehensive understanding:\n\n1. **Search for the class definitions** to locate the files they are contained in. We'll look for `CalibratedClassifierCV`, `DBSCAN`, `DummyClassifier`, and `BaseGradientBoosting` as a start.\n2. **Search for the `fit` or `partial_fit` methods** within those classes. These methods are likely spots where `sample_weight` is being handled.\n3. **Search for code snippets using outdated validation** like `check_consistent_length` and `check_array` on `sample_weight`.\n\nLet's prepare the API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"CalibratedClassifierCV\")`\n- `search_class(\"DBSCAN\")`\n- `search_class(\"DummyClassifier\")`\n- `search_class(\"BaseGradientBoosting\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"CalibratedClassifierCV\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"DBSCAN\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"DummyClassifier\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"partial_fit\", \"BaseGradientBoosting\")`\n- `search_code(\"check_consistent_length(sample_weight\")`\n- `search_code(\"check_array(sample_weight\")`\n\nThese calls are expected to yield the locations and usage patterns of `sample_weight` across the specified classes and methods, along with instances of the outdated validation approaches that need to be replaced with `_check_sample_weight`."
