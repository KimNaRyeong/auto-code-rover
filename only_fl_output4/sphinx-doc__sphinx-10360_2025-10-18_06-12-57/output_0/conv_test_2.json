This enum has a deprecated value `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN`. The macro `JXL_DEPRECATED` is defined elsewhere, but it is included in `c_id_attributes` and `cpp_id_attributes`, so that shouldn't be the problem.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/** Data type for the sample values per channel per pixel.\r\n */\r\ntypedef enum {\r\n  /** Use 32-bit single-precision floating point values, with range 0.0-1.0\r\n   * (within gamut, may go outside this range for wide color gamut). Floating\r\n   * point output, either JXL_TYPE_FLOAT or JXL_TYPE_FLOAT16, is recommended\r\n   * for HDR and wide gamut images when color profile conversion is required. */\r\n  JXL_TYPE_FLOAT = 0,\r\n\r\n  /** DEPRECATED: Bitpacked 1-bit. As an alternative, use JXL_TYPE_UINT8.\r\n   */\r\n  JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN JXL_DEPRECATED,\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen building documentation from this, it is parsing it as if the enum value is `JXL_DEPRECATED`, not `JXL_TYPE_BOOLEAN` as it should be. When there are two or more enum values deprecated like this, it results in `Duplicate C++ declaration`.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nJust like attributes for function definitions, attributes for enum values should be ignored when parsing.\n\n### Your project\n\nhttps://libjxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### OS\n\nLinux\n\n### Python version\n\n3.9.10\n\n### Sphinx version\n\n4.5.0\n\n### Sphinx extensions\n\n_No response_\n\n### Extra tools\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n"

However, note that certain dependencies, especially those related to Sphinx, may still need to be installed in the environment.\n\nThe following script assumes `sphinx` and any necessary extensions, such as `breathe` if you're working with C/C++ documentation, are installed. If `docutils` or any other dependency is missing, the script cannot automatically install them due to the complexity and variability of Python environments (virtual environments, system Python, etc.).

Actual implementation of `check_enum_value_with_attribute` depends on the specifics of how the issue manifests in the documentation or build logs, which requires custom logic tailored to the specifics of the Sphinx project and its output.\n\nRemember, before running the script, ensure all dependencies, including Sphinx, are correctly installed and accessible in your programming environment. Adjust the Sphinx build command and the validation logic as necessary to fit your project's setup."
