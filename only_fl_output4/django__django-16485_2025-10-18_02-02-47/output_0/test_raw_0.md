This script attempts to reproduce the issue described, catching and handling `ValueError` specifically to assert the presence of the reported issue. If `ValueError` is raised with the message related to the valid range for precision, the traceback will be printed, and an `AssertionError` will be raised to signify the issue's presence explicitly. If the operations complete without raising an exception, it is assumed the issue has been resolved, and a confirmation message is printed.
