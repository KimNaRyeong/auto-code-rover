        "intended_behavior": "The `floatformat` function should be capable of handling a precision argument (`arg`) of 0 without causing a crash. This requires adjusting the precision calculation and validation logic to manage a zero value appropriately, ensuring that it does not conflict with the underlying `Decimal` operations used for formatting the number. The intended behavior, when supplied with an argument of 0, would be to format the input number to a whole number without any fractional part, effectively rounding it to the nearest whole number."
