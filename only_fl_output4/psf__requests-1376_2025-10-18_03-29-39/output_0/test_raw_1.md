Given the instructions and the specific need to ensure the script will exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed, while raising an `AssertionError` if the mentioned issue is present, let's create a more fine-tuned reproducer script. This script attempts to replicate the exact scenario as described, focusing specifically on the assertion related to how multipart POST field names are handled and encoded.

```python
# reproducer.py

import requests

def httpbin(endpoint):
    """Construct httpbin URL."""
    return f'https://httpbin.org/{endpoint}'

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_unicode_multipart_post_fieldnames():
    try:
        # Prepare the request with Unicode field names
        r = requests.Request(method='POST',
                             url=httpbin('post'),
                             data={'stuff'.encode('utf-8'): 'elixr'},  # Correctly use 'stuff' as bytes
                             files={'file': ('test_requests.py', open(__file__, 'rb'))})
        prep = r.prepare()
        
        # Perform the assertions
        assert b'name="stuff"' in prep.body, "Field name not correctly encoded in the body"
        assert not b'name="b\'stuff\'"' in prep.body, "Field name incorrectly double-encoded"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Ensure the script exits with a status code indicating an error
        exit(1)
    else:
        print("Issue is fixed, no assertion error.")
        # Exit with code 0 indicating success/no error
        exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_unicode_multipart_post_fieldnames()
```

This script will:
- Attempt to send a POST request to httpbin with a multipart form data where one of the field names is a Unicode string encoded in UTF-8.
- Check for the specific issue where the field name might be incorrectly encoded or represented in the request body.
- Print a stack trace and exit with code 1 if the issue is replicated (i.e., if the assertion fails), suggesting the issue is present.
- Exit with code 0, indicating no error/issue has been found if the assertions pass.
