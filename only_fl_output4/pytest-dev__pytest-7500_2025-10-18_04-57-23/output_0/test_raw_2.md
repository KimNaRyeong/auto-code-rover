Given the specific requirements and the nature of the error you want to reproduce, here's a restructured approach. Directly simulating the behavior of `pytest`'s cleanup of temporary directories might not be straightforward because it involves internal mechanisms that are not trivially replicated outside of its context. However, we can attempt to closely emulate the logic as described, focusing on creating and attempting to clean up temporary directories under stress conditions.

This version of `reproducer.py` aims to reflect more accurately on emulating conditions under which the cleanup might fail due to permission errors by creating temporary directories, marking some of them for deletion (akin to the 'garbage-' prefix), and then attempting cleanup under controlled conditions that mimic a high-load scenario.

```python
import os
import shutil
import tempfile
import time
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_dir_and_mark_for_cleanup(base_dir):
    for _ in range(10):  # Adjust based on experimentation
        temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp(dir=base_dir)
        os.rename(temp_dir, temp_dir + "_garbage")

def attempt_cleanup(base_dir):
    for path in os.listdir(base_dir):
        full_path = os.path.join(base_dir, path)
        if "_garbage" in path:
            try:
                shutil.rmtree(full_path)
            except PermissionError as e:
                print_stacktrace(e)
                raise AssertionError("Caught PermissionError during manual cleanup.") from None

def run_test():
    base_temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    try:
        create_dir_and_mark_for_cleanup(base_temp_dir)
        time.sleep(2)  # Simulate some delay or work happening
        attempt_cleanup(base_temp_dir)
    finally:
        # Cleanup any remaining temp directories
        shutil.rmtree(base_temp_dir, ignore_errors=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        run_test()
    except AssertionError:
        sys.exit(1)
    print("No PermissionError detected; manual cleanup mimicked without issues.")
    sys.exit(0)
```

### Notes:

- This script first creates temporary directories within a base temporary directory. It then marks these for deletion (similar to how `pytest` might rename directories it plans to clean up), attempts their cleanup, and catches any `PermissionError`.
- Adjust the number of directories or add simulated load to create conditions more conducive to triggering the issue on your system.
- It's crucial to understand that this script may still not guarantee reproduction of the specific issue due to the nuanced interplay of operating system, filesystem permissions, and potential timing-specific conditions not fully represented here.
- If this script consistently exits with code 0 and no errors are detected, it might indicate that the conditions necessary to reproduce the issue aren't fully met or the underlying problem might have been resolved in the system/environment setup.
