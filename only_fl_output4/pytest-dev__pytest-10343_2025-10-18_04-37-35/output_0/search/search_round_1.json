We should focus on where pytest generates deprecation warnings for plugin hooks, specifically for `pytest_configure` hook implementations using old-style options. Here are some targeted search API calls:\n\n1. Look into how pytest handles plugin hook registrations and deprecation warnings:\n   - `search_method(\"pytest_configure\")` to find occurrences of the `pytest_configure` hook implementation.\n   - `search_code(\"PytestDeprecationWarning\")` to find where these deprecation warnings are generated in the codebase.\n\n2. Given the nature of the issue, it's also important to understand the decorator mechanism for hooks, to suggest a proper approach to include file or plugin name in the warning message:\n   - `search_method(\"hookimpl\")` to find the definition or usage of hook implementation decorator.\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point for identifying where changes need to be made to include more descriptive error information in deprecation warnings."

However, without location information in the warning, it's challenging to pinpoint which one.\n\n- **Intended behavior of this part of the code:**\n  Ideally, for deprecation warnings related to `pytest_configure` or any hook implementations, the system should provide clear information about the location (file and possibly the plugin name) where the deprecated usage occurs.\n\n### Analysis of `PytestDeprecationWarning`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  These snippets are likely where pytest generates deprecation warnings, including the one mentioned in the issue.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug:**\n  The parts of the code responsible for triggering `PytestDeprecationWarning` are directly related to the issue, as modifying these parts could potentially allow for including additional context (e.g., file or plugin name) in the warning message.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n  The deprecation warning mechanism should be enhanced to log where (in which file or plugin) a deprecated `hookimpl` usage occurs.\n\n### Given these analyses, further steps include:\n\n1. Investigating how `PytestDeprecationWarning` is generated, especially in `src/_pytest/deprecated.py` and `src/_pytest/warning_types.py`, to understand how to include more descriptive information.\n   \n2. Since the search for `hookimpl` method returned no results, it indicates a misunderstanding or misspecification of my query. Given that `hookimpl` might not be a method but a feature or decorator provided by pytest for marking plugin hooks, I should refine my search. Let's consider it's a decorator or part of the plugin mechanism and adjust our search towards finding its implementation or usage guidance in the documentation or code comments. Thus, a more suitable search might involve:\n   - **Exploring how pytest's plugin system works** to find references to the decorator mechanism (possible API calls not initially considered might include searching through code comments or the documentation).\n   - **Looking into how pytest handles hook registration and invocation**, which might delve into `src/_pytest/plugins.py` or similar files if they exist, or revisiting `src/_pytest/hookspec.py` to understand specifications for hooks.\n   \n3. The approach to fixing the bug would likely involve enhancing the logic that triggers the deprecation warning to capture and include the source (file name, possibly the plugin name) of the deprecated usage. This might involve:\n   - Modifying the deprecation warning logic in the identified files where `PytestDeprecationWarning` is used.\n   - Enhancing the hook registration system to retain and provide location information when a deprecation warning needs to be issued."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

The code responsible for emitting the `PytestDeprecationWarning` related to hook implementations should be enhanced to include the location (e.g., file name and line number) where the deprecated usage occurs. This requires modifying how the warning is constructed to dynamically fetch and append location information about the hookimpl causing the warning. This preservation ensures that developers receive immediate context about where to look for the deprecated usage without altering the nature or purpose of existing warnings.\n\n**Bug Location 2:**\n   - **File:** `src/_pytest/warning_types.py`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** If this file contributes to categorizing or formatting of warnings including `PytestDeprecationWarning`, an update may be necessary to support the inclusion of file or plugin name in the warning messages produced for deprecated hook implementations. The modification should allow warnings to be enriched with context-specific details such as the source file or plugin name and line number while preserving the structure and standard behavior of warnings throughout pytest.\n\n**Rationale:**\nGiven the nature of the issue, it is vital to provide immediate and actionable feedback to developers about deprecated practices within their test suites or plugins. By including precise location information in deprecation warnings, pytest can significantly improve the developer experience and facilitate a smoother transition to newer, supported practices. These enhancements will not alter the basic functionalities of pytest or its handling of warnings but will provide a more informative and guiding user experience."
