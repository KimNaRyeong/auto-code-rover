        "intended_behavior": "The `get_db_prep_value` method should incorporate a call to `get_prep_value` to allow for custom handling of the value before it's adapted for the database. This should be done while preserving the existing functionality of handling instances of `expressions.Value` and other scenarios as currently implemented. Specifically, the method should adapt the value processed by `get_prep_value` instead of the unmodified `value` directly. This reintroduction ensures that custom JSON fields that override `get_prep_value` for pre-processing values before database insertion will work as expected."
