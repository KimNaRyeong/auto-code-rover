This script will attempt to reproduce the issue as described. It performs an HTTP GET request to a URL that should generate a 301 redirect, using libraries that are known to have compatibility issues when handling byte strings in this context. If the problem is detected (an SSLError due to type issues is raised), it prints a detailed stack trace to help with diagnosing the issue. Exiting with code 0 signifies that the test ran without encountering the specific error, suggesting the issue may have been resolved.
