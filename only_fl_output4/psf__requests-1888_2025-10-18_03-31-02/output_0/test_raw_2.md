Based on your requirements to reproduce the issue involving a 301 redirect with the listed pyOpenSSL/SNI stack, I've prepared a Python script that directly addresses the sequence leading to the error. This script uses `requests` to initiate an HTTPS request that is expected to redirect (status 301) and thus triggers the stack trace if the issue is present. If the underlying problem is resolved, it won't raise an exception, and will print an indicative message and exit with code 0. Please ensure you have the specified versions of the libraries, or adjust the versions in the script as needed.

```python
# reproducer.py
import requests

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_pyopenssl_redirect():
    try:
        response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/status/301')
        # Following the redirect successfully without an exception means the issue is fixed
        print("Redirect followed successfully. Issue seems to be fixed.")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if test_pyopenssl_redirect():
        exit(0)
    else:
        raise AssertionError("The issue with handling 301 redirect is still present.")
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

- This script initiates an HTTP GET request to a URL that is known to return a 301 redirect response. The URL `https://httpbin.org/status/301` is used here because it consistently reproduces the redirect behavior needed to test the scenario.
- The `print_stacktrace` function is used as you requested, to catch and display the exception details if the error occurs.
- In the `test_pyopenssl_redirect` function, if the request is successful and follows the redirect without raising an exception, it prints a success message. Otherwise, it prints the stack trace using the `print_stacktrace` function and returns `False`.
- At the script's end, if a `False` is returned, it raises an `AssertionError` indicating the test failed to execute correctly under the current library setup, reflecting the issue is still present.

Before running this script, ensure that the necessary Python libraries (`requests` and its dependencies as per the versions you've listed) are installed in your environment. The version compatibility and potential fixes in newer library releases should be considered as this issue may be specific to the combination of library versions you've detailed.
