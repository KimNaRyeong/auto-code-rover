I see that after the redirect is received the returned URL is [decoded to a Unicode string](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/requests/adapters.py#L181). Then requests passes the response to `resolve_redirects` which uses the url to make a new request. This leads to a Unicode string being passed to urllib3 and eventually pyopenssl. And because in pyopenssl they now check that the data is of type bytes, an exception is thrown.\nI Wrote this test:\n```\ndef test_pyopenssl_redirect(self):\nrequests.get('https://httpbin.org/status/301')\n```\nand this is the result of py.test:\n```\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nself = <OpenSSL.SSL.Connection object at 0x000000000345CC50>\nbuf = u'GET /redirect/1 HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: httpbin.org\\r\\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, defl...cept: */*\\r\\nUser-Agent: python-r\nequests/2.2.1 CPython/2.7.6 Windows/8\\r\\n\\r\\n'\nflags = 0\ndef sendall(self, buf, flags=0):\n\"\"\"\nSend \"all\" data on the connection.

Here are the steps based on the details provided in the issue description:\n\n1. Since the issue mentions that the problem arises when a `301` response is received and passed to `resolve_redirects` which eventually leads to a Unicode string being passed to urllib3 and then to pyopenssl, it's crucial to investigate how `resolve_redirects` handles the URL.\n\n2. The issue specifically points out an exception raised in `OpenSSL.SSL.Connection`'s `sendall` method, due to receiving a Unicode string instead of a byte string. Reviewing the implementation of `sendall` could provide insights into the expected data types and any recent changes.\n\n3. Given that the problem involves handling of HTTPS requests and redirections, examining the request-making mechanism particularly in terms of how URLs are processed and passed along might be helpful. This involves looking into `requests.get` and how it prepares the URL.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls:\n- search_method(\"resolve_redirects\")\n- search_class(\"Connection\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"sendall\", \"Connection\")\n- search_code(\"requests.get\")"

        "content": "Based on the information gathered from the search API calls, let's analyze the collected context and consider the relevant questions regarding the parts of code identified and their potential relation to the bug.\n\n### Analyzing `requests/sessions.py` and method `resolve_redirects`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe `resolve_redirects` function in `requests/sessions.py` is responsible for handling HTTP redirections. When a response with a status code that indicates a redirect (like 301) is received, this function iterates over the redirections, updating the request URL and method as necessary according to the HTTP standards and specific quirks of common web browsers. It prepares and sends new requests for each redirection until the final resource is reached or the maximum number of allowed redirects is exceeded.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug\nThe issue is specifically with handling a `301` redirect where the URL, after being fetched from the response headers and potentially modified, is set to the `prepared_request.url`. The mention in the issue that a Unicode string gets passed all the way to pyOpenSSL implies that the modification and handling of the URL within `resolve_redirects` (or potentially how the URL is set on the `prepared_request`) might not be ensuring the string is appropriately encoded to bytes before being sent over the network layer, leading to a `TypeError` in `OpenSSL.SSL.Connection.sendall`.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nIdeally, `resolve_redirects` should ensure that any URL it prepares and ultimately requests should be in a format (bytes) expected by the lower networking layers, including urllib3 and pyOpenSSL. This ensures compatibility and prevents TypeErrors when the request is being sent.\n\n### Analyzing `requests/__init__.py` and `requests.get`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThis code snippet demonstrates a simple use case of the `requests.get` method to make an HTTP GET request. It's the entry point for utilizing the `requests` library to send a request to a specified URL.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug\nWhile the snippet itself doesn't directly relate to the bug, it signifies the starting point of where the error scenario begins, according to the test described in the issue. `requests.get` would eventually lead to using `resolve_redirects` for handling 301 responses if such a response is received from the initial request.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nThe `requests.get` method should seamlessly handle redirect responses by following them according to HTTP standards and the library's redirection policy, encoding URLs correctly along the way to ensure compatibility with all parts of the request-handling pipeline, including when passed to third-party libraries like pyOpenSSL.\n\n### Missing Context: The `OpenSSL.SSL.Connection` class and `sendall` method\n\nSince the search for the `Connection` class and `sendall` method within it yielded no results, it's clear that we might need to either directly explore the pyOpenSSL library's source code for this method or make assumptions based on common Python practices and the pyOpenSSL documentation. The error message indicated that the `sendall` method expects a byte string (`bytes`), suggesting any argument passed to this method should be encoded appropriately before making the call.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the inability to directly analyze the pyOpenSSL `Connection.sendall` implementation, the plausible next step is to ensure that anywhere within `requests` (specifically within the flow leading from `requests.get` through to `resolve_redirects`) that involves preparing URLs and sending requests, should correctly handle the conversion of URLs to byte strings before they are passed down to urllib3 or pyOpenSSL, adhering to the expected types and avoiding the mentioned TypeError.\n\nFurther investigation or a patch might need to focus on ensuring that:\n1. URLs are encoded to bytes after being processed and before being sent in a request.\n2. Confirm whether `requests` or a related dependency like `urllib3` is responsible for the conversion, and if not, apply a fix at the appropriate location in the codebase."

This should happen after URL manipulation processes (like joining the domain with the path if the location header provides a relative path or handling schema-less URLs) but before the URL is set to `prepared_request.url` and sent again. This encoding step must preserve the existing functionality where URLs are handled according to HTTP standards and peculiarities addressed (e.g., turning POST requests into GET requests after a 301 redirect). The encoding should specifically target compatibility with libraries like `urllib3` and `pyOpenSSL` that expect byte strings in network operations.\n\n   Considering the error arises from passing a Unicode string where a byte string is expected, an additional step might involve inspecting or wrapping the interaction point (passing the URL for the request) with `urllib3` or directly with `pyOpenSSL` (through `requests` or `urllib3`), ensuring the conversion to byte string happens if it's not being adequately handled. However, without direct evidence of the `Connection.sendall` method implementation from `pyOpenSSL`, we proceed with the assumption based on the error type and Python's explicit nature about string types. \n\nThis fix aims to maintain the flexibility and standards compliance of the `requests` library while ensuring compatibility with the stricter type expectations of underlying libraries it interfaces with, particularly for SSL connections through `pyOpenSSL`."
