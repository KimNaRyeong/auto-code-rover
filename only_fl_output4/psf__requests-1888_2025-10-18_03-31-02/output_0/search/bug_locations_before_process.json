        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior here is to ensure that before a new request is made (after a redirect), the URL processed from the redirect response 'headers['location']' is properly encoded into bytes before it's used in a request. This should happen after URL manipulation processes (like joining the domain with the path if the location header provides a relative path or handling schema-less URLs) but before the URL is set to 'prepared_request.url' and sent again. This encoding step must preserve the existing functionality where URLs are handled according to HTTP standards and peculiarities addressed (e.g., turning POST requests into GET requests after a 301 redirect). The encoding should specifically target compatibility with libraries like 'urllib3' and 'pyOpenSSL' that expect byte strings in network operations."
