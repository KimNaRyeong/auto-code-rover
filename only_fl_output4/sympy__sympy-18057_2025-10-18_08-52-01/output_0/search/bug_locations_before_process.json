This might involve additional checks or validations to ensure the string representation of an object can be safely converted into a SymPy expression. If a string does not meet these criteria, it should not be evaluated. Instead, `sympify` could either handle the input conservatively as an error or attempt non-evaluative parsing strategies that do not involve `eval`. For cases where `eval` remains necessary, implementing a sandboxed environment or using a safer evaluation strategy (e.g., AST parsing without execution) could mitigate risks. These changes aim to preserve the functionality of allowing flexible inputs to `sympify` while ensuring security and reliability."

This includes validating input strings and potentially sanitizing inputs to remove or handle known dangerous patterns before parsing and evaluation. Moreover, `parse_expr` should handle cases where the `eval_expr` function is called, ensuring that any code passed to `eval_expr` has been verified as safe. In scenarios where evaluation could lead to unsafe behavior, `parse_expr` could fall back to error handling mechanisms that avoid execution while still providing useful feedback to the user."

This may include verifying the contents of the `code` parameter against a set of allowed operations and structures before allowing `eval` to execute. Additionally, implementing a more restricted execution context for `eval` can limit potential damage from malicious or unintended code execution. This context could limit the available namespaces and restrict execution capabilities to purely mathematical evaluations, thus reducing risk."
