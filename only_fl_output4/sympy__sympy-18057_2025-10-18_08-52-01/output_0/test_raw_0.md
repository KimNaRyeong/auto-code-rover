This script reproduces the issue described by attempting to compare a `sympy.Symbol` instance to instances of user-defined classes `C` and `D` whose `__repr__` output simulates unexpected and potentially harmful evaluations or incorrect equality checks.

- It first tries the case where the `__repr__` could cause an `eval` of attributes that don't exist (`x.y`), expecting it to raise an exception that is caught and reported.
- Then, it tests for an incorrect equality assumption where the `repr` matches the name of a `Symbol`, but they should logically not be considered equal (`x`).

When the issue is present, it expects an `AssertionError`, providing a detailed stack trace of where and why the issue occurred. If fixed, the script would not raise any assertion errors.
