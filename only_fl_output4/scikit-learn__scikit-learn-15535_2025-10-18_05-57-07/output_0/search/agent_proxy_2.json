While maintaining its current validation checks (1D shape and length consistency), an additional step should be included to either convert these labels to a numeric format compatible with subsequent computations or to ensure that ensuing functions can handle these label types directly.

If modification of `check_clusterings` is not sufficient to ensure compatibility, `contingency_matrix` should incorporate logic to handle or convert object array inputs into a form suitable for constructing the contingency matrix. This could involve assigning unique numerical identifiers to string labels internally while preserving their correspondence for all calculations. The main goal is to compute the contingency matrix correctly without losing the semantic meaning of non-numeric cluster labels, thus allowing the mutual information score to be calculated as expected.\n\nThese enhancements should not affect the existing functionality for numeric labels, ensuring backward compatibility with existing codebases while extending support for non-numeric clustering labels as was possible in version 0.21.1."
