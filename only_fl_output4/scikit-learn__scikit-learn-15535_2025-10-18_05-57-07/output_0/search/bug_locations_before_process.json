        "intended_behavior": "The `check_clusterings` method should include a preprocessing step or enhancement to ensure that non-numeric labels (e.g., strings in an object array) can be managed properly without causing errors downstream. While maintaining its current validation checks (1D shape and length consistency), an additional step should be included to either convert these labels to a numeric format compatible with subsequent computations or to ensure that ensuing functions can handle these label types directly. This change aims to restore prior functionality where object arrays did not cause errors, enabling users to pass string-based cluster labels without conversion errors."

        "method": "contingency_matrix",
        "intended_behavior": "The `contingency_matrix` function should be capable of accurately processing cluster labels as object arrays containing strings, as it does with numeric labels. If modification of `check_clusterings` is not sufficient to ensure compatibility, `contingency_matrix` should incorporate logic to handle or convert object array inputs into a form suitable for constructing the contingency matrix. This could involve assigning unique numerical identifiers to string labels internally while preserving their correspondence for all calculations. The main goal is to compute the contingency matrix correctly without losing the semantic meaning of non-numeric cluster labels, thus allowing the mutual information score to be calculated as expected."
