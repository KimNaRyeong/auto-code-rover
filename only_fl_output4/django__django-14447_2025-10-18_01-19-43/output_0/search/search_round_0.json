First, in the cache setting code, it runs:\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM %s\" % table)\nnum = cursor.fetchone()[0]\nnow = timezone.now()\nnow = now.replace(microsecond=0)\nif num > self._max_entries:\nself._cull(db, cursor, now)\n(\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/d06c5b358149c02a62da8a5469264d05f29ac659/django/core/cache/backends/db.py#L120-L131)\nThen in self._cull (the last line above) it runs:\ncursor.execute(\"DELETE FROM %s WHERE expires < %%s\" % table,\n[connection.ops.adapt_datetimefield_value(now)])\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM %s\" % table)\nnum = cursor.fetchone()[0]\nif num > self._max_entries:\n# Do culling routine here...\n(\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/d06c5b358149c02a62da8a5469264d05f29ac659/django/core/cache/backends/db.py#L254-L260)\nThe idea is that if the MAX_ENTRIES setting is exceeded, it'll cull the DB cache down by some percentage so it doesn't grow forever.\nI think that's fine, but given that the SELECT COUNT(*) query is slow, I wonder two things:\nWould a refactor to remove the second query be a good idea? If you pass the count from the first query into the _cull method, you can then do:\ndef _cull(self, db, cursor, now, count):\n...\ncursor.execute(\"DELETE FROM %s WHERE expires < %%s\" % table,\n[connection.ops.adapt_datetimefield_value(now)])\ndeleted_count = cursor.rowcount\nnum = count - deleted_count\nif num > self._max_entries:\n# Do culling routine here...\nThat seems like a simple win.\nIs it reasonable to not run the culling code *every* time that we set a value? Like, could we run it every tenth time or every 100th time or something?\nIf this is a good idea, does anybody have a proposal for how to count this? I'd be happy just doing it on a mod of the current millisecond, but there's probably a better way (randint?).\nWould a setting be a good idea here? We already have MAX_ENTRIES and CULL_FREQUENCY. CULL_FREQUENCY is \"the fraction of entries that are culled when MAX_ENTRIES is reached.\" That sounds more like it should have been named CULL_RATIO (regrets!), but maybe a new setting for this could be called \"CULL_EVERY_X\"?\nI think the first change is a no-brainer, but both changes seem like wins to me. Happy to implement either or both of these, but wanted buy-in first.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving this issue, I would need to perform the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the class that contains the issue. Since the issue mentions a DB cache, the class likely handles database caching. The initial code snippet provided mentions `self._cull(db, cursor, now)`, suggesting the class could be something related to cache backends. Although the exact class name isn't provided in the issue, it's reasonable from the Django URL to guess it might be related to cache backends. Therefore, I would initially search for a class name that could be related to database caching in Django:\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"DatabaseCache\")\n   ```\n\n2. Once the class name is identified, I need to examine the methods `_cull` and the cache-setting code where `SELECT COUNT(*)` is called. The issue description points out specific parts of the code, suggesting these are key areas of concern. Therefore, if \"DatabaseCache\" is confirmed as the class name or a different one is identified from the first call:\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"_cull\", \"DatabaseCache\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"set\", \"DatabaseCache\") # Assuming 'set' might involve cache setting based on typical naming conventions.\n   ```\n\n3. Given the provided GitHub URLs and descriptions, I know these lines are critical, but more context is necessary to propose a concrete solution. Therefore, examining the current handling of counts in `_cull` and during cache updates is crucial. To refine the investigation without guessing the method names associated with cache setting, examining code snippets from the GitHub links can be insightful. Given we don't have direct access to files or line numbers in this case but know the operations involve `SELECT COUNT(*)` and a deletion based on expiration, we should look for these operations:\n   ```python\n   search_code(\"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM %s\" % table)\n   search_code(\"DELETE FROM %s WHERE expires < %%s\" % table)\n   ```\n\nThese API calls will provide a clearer understanding of the implementation details of the caching mechanism, the `_cull` method, and how counts are managed before and after culling. This information will be crucial for optimizing the cache updates and reducing the performance penalty discussed in the issue."
