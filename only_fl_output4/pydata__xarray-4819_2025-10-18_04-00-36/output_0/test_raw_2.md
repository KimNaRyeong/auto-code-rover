Given the previous misunderstanding, let's create a correct and succinct script aiming to verify the behavior of `drop_sel` on a xarray Dataset without coordinates specified for selection, in line with the reported issue.

```python
import numpy as np
import xarray as xr
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    data = np.random.randn(2, 3)
    ds = xr.Dataset({"A": (["x", "y"], data)})

    try:
        # Attempt to use drop_sel in a way that is expected to fail according to the issue description.
        modified_ds = ds.drop_sel(y=[1])  # Intentionally attempting to drop based on non-existent coordinate labels
        assert "y" in modified_ds.dims, "Dimension 'y' unexpectedly modified."
    except NotImplementedError as e:
        # Expected failure as per issue description
        print("NotImplementedError caught as expected. Issue still present.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with non-zero status code indicating failure due to unexpected error

    # If no exception is raised (indicating potential resolution of the issue), or assertion fails:
    print("No error raised or assertion failed. Issue may be fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script checks the functionality related to the issue with `drop_sel` in `xarray`, especially in the context of dropping indices from a dimension that doesn't have coordinate labels. The expected behavior (or error) is explicitly tested, and any deviation is captured by either handling the specific anticipated error or asserting the unmodified state when the operation is hypothetically successful. The script exits with code 0 to reflect either the persistence of the problem under the originally understood conditions or its resolution.
