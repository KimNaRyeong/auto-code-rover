        "intended_behavior": "The `linsolve` method should correctly handle systems of linear equations, ensuring consistent behavior for slightly varying coefficients especially in the context of floating-point arithmetic. To resolve the issue, the method might need enhanced logic to more robustly handle numerical precision or to improve the differentiation between systems with unique solutions and those that are underdetermined. This could involve refining the threshold or criteria used during the determination phase of the solution's nature (unique vs. infinite solutions). The existing functionality to solve linear equations accurately must be preserved while ensuring that similar systems of equations, even when involving minor numerical coefficient differences, consistently yield equivalent types of solutions."
