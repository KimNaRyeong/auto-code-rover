To ensure the standalone script can execute successfully without external dependencies being manually managed, it should catch and handle any import errors related to missing modules such as `docutils` or the Sphinx application itself. However, since the original question assumes these dependencies are available and installed, a revised script to reproduce the issue as requested would not typically check for or install missing packagesâ€”that would be something managed outside of the script, assumed to be part of the environment setup.

Nonetheless, if the execution environment does not have the necessary packages like Sphinx or docutils, the script will fail due to import errors. If it's crucial to have the script also ensure its execution environment, it would be stepping beyond the commonly expected responsibilities of such a script. The expected setup including Sphinx and related packages would have to be done ahead of time or managed as part of an encompassing automation process that prepares the environment before executing scripts like this.

Based on the initial requirements and the provided context, the original script already encapsulates the actions needed to reproduce the specified issue, assuming an environment where Sphinx and necessary dependencies are installed. Therefore, if encountering issues related to missing packages or modules, the environment setup process should be revisited to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed. 

In a practical scenario, you should ensure that the execution environment has Sphinx, docutils, and any other necessary packages installed using pip or a similar package manager before running such scripts. If handling environment preparation automatically is essential, you might consider using a virtual environment setup script that precedes the execution of `reproducer.py`:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install Sphinx docutils
python3 reproducer.py
```

This sequence ensures that the required packages are available in the environment where `reproducer.py` is executed. Keep in mind, however, that this approach is generally managed outside the scope of a simple reproduction script.
