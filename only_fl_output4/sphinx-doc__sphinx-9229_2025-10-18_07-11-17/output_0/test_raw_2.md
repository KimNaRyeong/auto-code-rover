Understanding your request, let's create a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that attempts to programmatically replicate the issue of inconsistent documentation generation for type aliases with Sphinx, and validate whether the issue is present or not by checking the content of the generated HTML files.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_command(command):
    result = subprocess.run(command, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)
    if result.returncode != 0:
        raise Exception(f"Command failed: {command}\nOutput: {result.stdout}\nErrors: {result.stderr}")
    return result.stdout

def setup_sphinx():
    os.makedirs("docs", exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs("api", exist_ok=True)
    with open("docs/conf.py", "w") as f:
        f.write("extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']\n")
    with open("docs/index.rst", "w") as f:
        f.write(".. toctree::\n\n   api/file\n")
    run_command("sphinx-apidoc -f -o api .")

def generate_html():
    run_command("make -C docs html")

def check_html_content():
    expected_phrases = [
        "Dictionary with PyScaffold's options",
        "When the file content is ``None``",
        "Signature of functions considered file operations"
    ]
    with open("docs/_build/html/api/file.html", "r") as f:
        content = f.read()
    for phrase in expected_phrases:
        if phrase not in content:
            raise AssertionError(f"Phrase not found in HTML output: {phrase}")

def main():
    try:
        setup_sphinx()
        generate_html()
        check_html_content()
        print("Issue not found. Documentation generated correctly.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script does the following:
- Sets up a minimal Sphinx configuration and content structure in a `docs` directory.
- Runs Sphinx to generate the API documentation (including type aliases) from source code comments into HTML.
- Checks the generated HTML for expected phrases that should be present if the documentation strings for type aliases are correctly included in the output.
- Raising an `AssertionError` if the expected content is not found in the documentation, indicating the issue is present.
- Printing the stack trace if an error occurs during the process.

This script should be run from a directory containing the source code `file.py`, as described in your issue reproduction steps, to ensure it works correctly. Before running this script, ensure that Sphinx and any other dependencies are installed in your Python environment.
