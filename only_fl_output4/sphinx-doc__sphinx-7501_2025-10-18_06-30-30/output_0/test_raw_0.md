The following is a standalone Python script (`reproducer.py`) designed to reproduce the issue described. This script automates the cloning of the `phpmyadmin` project, installation of Sphinx, and building of the documentation to check for the described glossary term case sensitivity issue. It raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is found and exits with code 0 if the issue is fixed, printing a stack trace of the issue when it occurs.

```python
import subprocess
import sys
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_command(command, path=None):
    process = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, shell=True, cwd=path)
    stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
    return process.returncode, stdout.decode('utf-8'), stderr.decode('utf-8')

def main():
    project_url = "https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin.git"
    clone_command = f"git clone --depth 1 {project_url}"
    project_path = "phpmyadmin"

    # Step 1: Clone the phpmyadmin project
    print("Cloning phpMyAdmin repository...")
    returncode, stdout, stderr = run_command(clone_command)
    if returncode != 0:
        print("Error cloning repository.")
        print(stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

    # Step 2: Install Sphinx
    print("Installing Sphinx...")
    returncode, stdout, stderr = run_command("pip install 'Sphinx'", project_path)
    if returncode != 0:
        print("Error installing Sphinx.")
        print(stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

    # Step 3: Build the html documentation
    doc_path = os.path.join(project_path, "doc")
    print("Building the documentation...")
    returncode, stdout, stderr = run_command("make html", doc_path)
    
    # Check if the specific error message is in the output
    error_msg = "duplicate term description of mysql, other instance in glossary"
    if error_msg in stderr:
        try:
            assert False, f"Found issue: {error_msg}"
        except AssertionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            sys.exit(1)  # Exit with non-zero to indicate error
    else:
        print("No issue found, issue seems to be fixed or not present.")
        sys.exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script encapsulates the issue's reproduction steps as closely as possible given the original issue's description. To execute, place `reproducer.py` in the root directory outside of the `phpmyadmin` project (to prevent it from being removed by the cloning operation), then run it with `python3 reproducer.py`. It checks for the exact error message related to the glossary term case sensitivity issue and handles output accordingly.
