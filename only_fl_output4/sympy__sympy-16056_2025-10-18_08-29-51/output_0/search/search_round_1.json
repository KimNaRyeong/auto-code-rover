Personally, I will set it to `\\text` the second it is implemented, but the package dependency may be confusing for newer users. (It seems like both options works in e.g. iPython but I have not explicitly tested, just not noted any issue.)\nProbably the easiest way to implement it is to add a helper function `print_text` or something so people do not have to test at every single instance.\n</issue>"

To get started, we will need to locate instances of these usages as well as any configurable settings or helper functions that might currently exist for LaTeX printing. First, let's gather context around these LaTeX commands and any related printing or configuration functionalities within the code by conducting the following searches:\n\n1. For understanding the broader context in which `\\mathrm` and `\\text` are used, we need to find where these LaTeX commands are being invoked in the code:\n   - `search_code(\"\\\\mathrm\")`\n   - `search_code(\"\\\\text\")`\n\n2. Since the issue suggests adding a helper function (e.g., `print_text`) to handle LaTeX text printing, we should search if any such function already exists or if there are similar helpers that we could extend or mimic:\n   - `search_method(\"print_text\")`\n\n3. The concept of making this feature \"configurable\" suggests there may already be configuration handling in place that we can tie into. Let's search for methods or classes that are likely to be involved in printing configuration settings, though without specific names we will be somewhat speculative:\n   - `search_code(\"config\")`\n   - `search_method(\"get_config\")`\n   - `search_method(\"set_config\")`\n\nThese searches will help us map out how `\\mathrm` and `\\text` are currently used within the project, locate existing infrastructure for LaTeX printing and configuration, and identify where we might integrate the ability to switch between these two LaTeX commands through a configuration setting or through the introduction of a new helper function."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context in relation to the issue of standardizing the use of `\\mathrm` and `\\text` in LaTeX printing routines, let's consider the implications and potential steps needed to address the issue based on the gathered code snippets and method availability.\n\n### Analysis of `\\mathrm` and `\\text` Usage\n\n#### Usage of `\\mathrm`\nThe findings from the `search_code(\"\\\\mathrm\")` call indicate that `\\mathrm` is used in special error function descriptions within the `sympy/functions/special/error_functions.py` file. These instances are specific to making certain mathematical functions (like `erf`, `Ei`, and `li`) more tractable for the Gruntz algorithm, which is involved in symbolic limits.\n\n**Relevance to Issue:** The usage of `\\mathrm` here serves a very mathematical and typesetting purpose, focusing on ensuring the printed text is stylized correctly within mathematical contexts. The need for a uniform approach to text rendering in LaTeX output is evidenced by these specific uses.\n\n#### Usage of `\\text`\nThe `search_code(\"\\\\text\")` call shows `\\text` used in a similar context within `sympy/integrals/meijerint_doc.py`, for dynamically generating LaTeX documentation and conditions as part of the documentation strings. This usage aligns `\\text` more closely with dynamic text renditions that may adapt to the surrounding LaTeX font settings.\n\n**Relevance to Issue:** This aligns with the reported issue, as `\\text` proves to adapt better to the surrounding math-font rather than sticking to a Roman font, making it a preferable option for text that needs to match the document's math font.\n\n### Helper Function `print_text`\nThe absence of a `print_text` method (or similar) suggests that currently, there isn't a centralized way to handle text printing within LaTeX contexts in the codebase. Implementing such a function could streamline the handling of text styles (`\\mathrm` vs. `\\text`) based on user configuration or package requirements.\n\n### Configurability\nThe absence of direct `get_config` and `set_config` method results, coupled with a broad appearance of `config` in various parts of the codebase, suggests a dispersed handling of configurations. The numerous references across different modules underscore the complexity of implementing a new, centralized configuration setting. Specifically, `sympy/polys/polyconfig.py` might be an interesting file to look further into, as it directly pertains to configurations within a significant SymPy module.\n\n### Intended Behavior and Steps Forward\n\nGiven the issue description and analysis:\n1. **Unifying Text Rendering in LaTeX Output:** A key goal is to decide whether `\\text` or `\\mathrm` should be the standard for the project and to make this choice configurable. Given their pros and cons, and the fact that `\\text` adapts better to the document's font settings, `\\text` seems favorable but requires dependency on the `amsmath` package.\n\n2. **Implementation via Helper Function:** Creating a `print_text` (or similarly named) function would encapsulate the logic for choosing between `\\mathrm` and `\\text`. This approach would centralize text styling decisions and make maintenance easier.\n\n3. **Configurability:** To address the configurability aspect, it's necessary to integrate with the existing configuration system within SymPy. Given the lack of a centralized configuration handler pinpointed in our search, further investigation into how configurations are managed (potentially starting with `sympy/polys/polyconfig.py`) is warranted.\n\n### Next Steps for API Calls\n\nGiven the analysis, further API calls should involve:\n- Investigating currently available configuration management systems within the project, possibly by looking into specific files hinted at containing configurations (`search_code_in_file(\"config\", \"sympy/polys/polyconfig.py\")`).\n- Understanding the impact on existing documentation and function definitions (as both `\\mathrm` and `\\text` are used within comments or docstrings), which might necessitate revisiting how documentation interprets LaTeX commands depending on the chosen approach."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Depending on the configuration setting decided upon (either sticking with `\\mathrm` or moving to `\\text`), the documentation comments should be updated to reflect this choice. This ensures consistency across the documentation and helps in aligning with the new approach once the helper function for printing text in LaTeX is implemented.\n\n- **Bug Location 2:**\n  - **File:** sympy/integrals/meijerint_doc.py\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Where `\\text` is used within the code for dynamic generation of documentation strings, ensure that if a switch is made to using `\\mathrm` (or conversely, if sticking with `\\text` by default), the code here aligns with that standard. If `\\text` is chosen as the default but requires the `amsmath` package, ensure that this dependency is clearly documented. Alternatively, if a helper method is implemented to abstract the rendering of text in LaTeX expressions, refactor these instances to use the new method, ensuring that the function dynamically adapts based on the configuration while preserving the functionality of dynamically generated documentation.\n\nGiven the decision to make this behavior configurable, the intended behavior across these locations is to adapt the LaTeX printing to use a potentially new, centralized method (`print_text` or similar) that decides whether to use `\\mathrm` or `\\text` based on a global or local configuration setting. This method would not only abstract away the direct calls to LaTeX commands in the codebase but also allow for a single point of update in the future, should the project's needs or LaTeX best practices change."
