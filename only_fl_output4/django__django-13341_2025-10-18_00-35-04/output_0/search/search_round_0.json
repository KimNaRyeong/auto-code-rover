ListView does not, I yet have to check others.\nThis is inconsistency and, I think, it should be fixed.\nTemplateView.get_context_data()'s kwargs returns SimpleLazyObjects that causes a crash when filtering.\nDescription\nExample Code that works in 3.0, but not in 3.1:\nclass OfferView(TemplateView):\ntemplate_name = \"offers/offer.html\"\ndef get_context_data(self, **kwargs):\noffer_slug = kwargs.get(\"offer_slug\", \"\")\noffer = get_object_or_404(Account, slug=offer_slug)\nreturn {\"offer\": offer, \"offer_slug\": offer_slug}\nIn order to make this work in 3.1, you have to explicitly convert the result of kwargs.get() to a string to get the SimpleLazyObject to resolve:\nclass OfferView(TemplateView):\ntemplate_name = \"offers/offer.html\"\ndef get_context_data(self, **kwargs):\noffer_slug = kwargs.get(\"offer_slug\", \"\")\noffer = get_object_or_404(Account, slug=str(offer_slug))\nreturn {\"offer\": offer, \"offer_slug\": offer_slug}\nThe error generated if you don't is:\nError binding parameter 0 - probably unsupported type\nfrom django/db/backends/sqlite3/operations.py, line 144, in _quote_params_for_last_executed_query\nIn both cases, the urls.py looks like:\npath(\n\"/offers/<slug:offer_slug>/\",\nOfferView.as_view(),\nname=\"offer_view\",\n),\nWhen debugging, I found that offer_slug (coming in from kwargs.get) was of type 'SimpleLazyObject' in Django 3.1, and when I explicitly converted it to a string, get_object_or_404 behaved as expected.\nThis is using Python 3.7.8 with SQLite.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, I'll need to gather more context about the implementation of the `TemplateView` and how it handles `kwargs` in the `get_context_data` method, as well as to understand how `ListView` and possibly other views handle `kwargs` for comparison. Therefore, the following API calls would be necessary:\n\n1. Search for the `TemplateView` class to understand its structure and how it's currently working with `kwargs`.\n    - `search_class(\"TemplateView\")`\n\n2. Search for the `get_context_data` method within the `TemplateView` class to see how the method works and whether it automatically includes `kwargs` into the context.\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"get_context_data\", \"TemplateView\")`\n\n3. Search for the `ListView` class for comparison, to understand if and how it differs from `TemplateView` in handling `kwargs`.\n    - `search_class(\"ListView\")`\n\n4. Since the issue also mentions a problem with `ListView` potentially missing similar functionality, it would be pertinent to investigate how `ListView` handles context data.\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"get_context_data\", \"ListView\")`\n\n5. To get a broader view of how `get_context_data` is used across the project, it might be helpful to search for its usages elsewhere.\n    - `search_method(\"get_context_data\")`\n\n6. Finally, to understand the reported error in using `get_object_or_404` with a `SimpleLazyObject` when not converted to a string, it could be useful to see its implementation or usage, particularly in relation to `TemplateView` or `kwargs`.\n    - `search_code(\"get_object_or_404\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a comprehensive context to address the reported inconsistency and the issue with `SimpleLazyObject` in `TemplateView.get_context_data`."
