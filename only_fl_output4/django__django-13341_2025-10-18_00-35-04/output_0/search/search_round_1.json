        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### TemplateView and ListView Classes\n\nThe search results reveal the files where `TemplateView` and `ListView` are defined (`django/views/generic/base.py` and `django/views/generic/list.py` respectively), but searches specifically for the `get_context_data` method within these classes did not yield direct results. This suggests that the method might be inherited or defined in a mixin that both these classes use. Given that the `TemplateView` class is shown to inherit from `TemplateResponseMixin` and `ContextMixin`, it's likely that the `get_context_data` method comes from one of these mixins, possibly the `ContextMixin`.\n\n#### Relationship to the Bug\n\nThe reported issue is that `TemplateView.get_context_data()` automatically passes `self.kwargs` into the context, which is not consistent with the behavior of `ListView` and potentially other generic views in Django. This inconsistency can lead to unexpected errors, as demonstrated by the trouble with `SimpleLazyObject` when a template view tries to use `kwargs` to filter database objects.\n\n#### Intended Behavior\n\nThe intended behavior, inferred from the issue description, is either to avoid automatically including `kwargs` in the context for all views consistently or to provide a clear and documented way for developers to control this behavior. This would likely involve modifying how `get_context_data` is defined or operates within `TemplateView` and possibly other views to ensure consistency and prevent errors associated with automatic `kwargs` handling.\n\n### Further Steps for Context Gathering\n\nGiven that the `get_context_data` method was not directly found within `TemplateView` or `ListView`, but knowing that these classes involve mixins, the next steps could include:\n\n1. **Searching for `ContextMixin`**: Since the `TemplateView` inherits from `ContextMixin` and this mixin likely provides the `get_context_data` method, a more detailed look into this class can provide insights into how `kwargs` are handled.\n    - `search_class(\"ContextMixin\")`\n\n2. **Exploring the `TemplateResponseMixin` and `BaseListView`**: As these mixins are part of the inheritance chain for `TemplateView` and `ListView`, understanding their implementation may also shed light on the issue.\n    - `search_class(\"TemplateResponseMixin\")`\n    - `search_class(\"BaseListView\")`\n\n3. **Detailed Examination of `get_context_data` Implementations**: Since the method was found in various files across the codebase, examining a few of these implementations can give clues about how different views or Django components handle context data.\n    - `search_method_in_file(\"get_context_data\", \"django/views/generic/base.py\")` (to directly address the absence earlier)\n    - `get_code_around_line(\"django/views/generic/list.py\", line_number, window_size)` with an appropriate line number if known or inferred from previous analyses.\n\n4. **Review `get_object_or_404` Implementation**: Understanding its usage patterns may help in devising a general solution or workaround for the issue with `SimpleLazyObject`.\n    - `search_method_in_file(\"get_object_or_404\", \"django/shortcuts.py\")`\n\nThese steps aim to fill the gaps in understanding the root causes of the issue and to inform an effective solution."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

The adjustment should ensure that `kwargs` passed to the context do not automatically convert into `SimpleLazyObject` without explicit developer intention. This might involve providing a mechanism or documentation guideline on how to explicitly declare which `kwargs` should be passed to the context or adding an explicit processing step within `get_context_data` to safely handle `SimpleLazyObject` types, ensuring they are converted to a more compatible type (e.g., string) when necessary. The solution should preserve the flexibility for developers to pass additional context to their templates while avoiding unforeseen errors due to type mismatches.\n\n- **Location 2:** File: `django/views/generic/base.py`, Class: `ContextMixin`.\n    \n    - **Intended Behavior:** Assuming `ContextMixin` is where `get_context_data` is defined or primarily modified for use by `TemplateView` and possibly other views, it is critical to ensure that this method either avoids automatically passing `kwargs` into the context without explicit conversion or provides developers with the tools to manage this behavior themselves. If `ContextMixin` indeed controls the population of context data from `kwargs`, an update here would potentially resolve the inconsistency across different views like `TemplateView` and `ListView`. The behavior to introduce could include clearer handling or documentation about how `kwargs` are to be handled when constructing the context, possibly including a check or filter mechanism to convert or ignore `SimpleLazyObject` instances unless they are explicitly needed and requested by the developer."
