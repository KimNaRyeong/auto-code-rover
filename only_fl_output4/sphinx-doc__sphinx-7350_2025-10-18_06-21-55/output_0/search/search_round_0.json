        "content": "Given the issue description, we'll need to investigate how the `Attributes:` directive is handled within the Sphinxcontrib-Napoleon extension and why the `:noindex:` option is not being respected. Therefore, we should look into the code handling directives, especially those related to attributes within the Napoleon extension. Let's start with the following searches to get relevant code context:\n\n1. To understand how Napoleon handles directives, we can start by looking for any class that might be responsible for processing `Attributes:` directives. Since the specific class handling it is not mentioned, we'll search broadly within the Napoleon extension.\n\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"Napoleon\")\n    ```\n\n2. Given `Attributes:` is a reStructuredText (reST) directive used by Sphinx and Napoleon for documenting class attributes, it's likely processed by a method that parses or handles these directives. Let's try to find methods that could be involved in this processing.\n\n    ```python\n    search_method(\"process_attributes_directive\")\n    ```\n\n3. Since the user mentioned editing `conf.py` to include `sphinxcontrib-napoleon`, this file might contain configurations or import statements relevant to how directives are handled. We should look for any references to `Attributes:` or `:noindex:` within it to see if there's specific handling for these directives configured there.\n\n    ```python\n    search_code_in_file(\":noindex:\", \"conf.py\")\n    ```\n\n4. The problem might also be related to how `.automodule` directives are parsed, especially when options like `:noindex:` are provided. It would be helpful to check any code that may parse or modify the behavior of `.. automodule::` directives.\n\n    ```python\n    search_code(\".. automodule::\")\n    ```\n\n5. Finally, since the issue specifies a problem with indexing, we should find out how the Napoleon extension interacts with Sphinx's indexing features. This could involve searching for methods that handle indexing specifically for attributes or more general indexing functions within the Napoleon extension.\n\n    ```python\n    search_method(\"index_nodes\")\n    ```\n\nThese searches aim to gather sufficient context on how the Napoleon extension processes directives, especially `Attributes:`, and how it interacts with Sphinx's indexing features, particularly in relation to the `:noindex:` option."
