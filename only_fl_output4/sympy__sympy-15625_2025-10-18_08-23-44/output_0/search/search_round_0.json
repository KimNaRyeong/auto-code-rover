LaTeX Error: Bad math environment delimiter.\nSee the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.\nType  H <return>  for immediate help.\n...\nl.300     $$\\begin{equation*}\n1\\end{equation*}$$\n?\n!

        "content": "To address this issue, we need to gather more context about where and how the LaTeX output is generated and formatted within the Jupyter Notebook or nbconvert codebase. Given the information in the issue, the primary area of focus seems to be on how mathematical expressions are handled and converted to LaTeX. \n\nHere are the API calls we can make based on the given details:\n\n1. Since the issue mentions changing the LaTeX wrapping method, we should look into the code responsible for this process. This likely involves a method or function that handles the conversion or formatting of output to LaTeX, although the exact name of this method or function isn't explicitly mentioned in the issue. A good starting point would be to search for occurrences of `$$` and `$\\displaystyle` within the code, as these are directly related to the problem and proposed solution.\n\n2. The issue references changes or problems related to \"printing\" in the release notes. This might hint at specific classes or methods in charge of handling the output or print functionalities, particularly those that deal with the LaTeX representation of mathematical expressions.\n\n3. The linked issues and pull requests (PRs) from IPython and nbconvert repositories (\"https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/11357\", \"https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/892\") suggest that similar changes or issues have been addressed before in related projects. This could imply that the functions or methods modified in those PRs are similar or relevant to the ones we need to investigate here. However, accessing information from URLs directly is outside the scope of provided API functionality, so we will focus on internal code structure and identifiers that might relate to those fixes.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following API calls can be made to gather the necessary code context:\n\n```plaintext\nsearch_code(\"$$\")\nsearch_code(\"$\\displaystyle\")\n```\n\nThese API calls aim to locate parts of the codebase where LaTeX math mode is switched on (`$$`) and where the suggested change involves using `$\\displaystyle`, thus honing in on potential locations in the code that would need modification according to the issue description."
