        "intended_behavior": "The code that handles the generation of LaTeX strings for mathematical expressions should be modified to not wrap expressions with `$$` when an `equation*` or similar environment is used, because `equation*` already denotes a math environment and adding `$$` around it is redundant and leads to errors. Adopt the proposed solution to change from `$$`...`$$` to `$\\displaystyle`...`$` for expressions that need to be displayed, ensuring expressions are wrapped appropriately without causing the 'Bad math environment delimiter' error, while preserving existing functionality for other types of mathematical expressions and LaTeX environments."
