        "intended_behavior": "The `Chr` class should have its `output_field` explicitly set to `CharField()`, ensuring that the function's output is always treated as a character string in Django, not as an integer. This modification would allow `Chr` to safely transform ASCII numeric codes into their character equivalents without causing type conversion errors when used in conjunction with `annotate` or other QuerySet methods. Add a suitable update to the `__init__` method or directly to the class body to include `self.output_field = CharField()` (considering how Django handles output fields for expressions and transforms). This change would explicitly inform Django's ORM and type system that the output of `Chr` is a string, thereby eliminating the erroneous `int(value)` conversion attempt. The main goal is to prevent `ValueError` when non-integer values are processed by the `Chr` function, aligning it with the expected usage scenario where users would input ASCII numeric codes and expect character outputs without the system mistakenly attempting to handle those outputs as integers. This will preserve the existing functionality of `Chr` within the Django model field context, ensuring it seamlessly integrates with Django's data type expectations and the ORM layer's handling of annotated QuerySets."
