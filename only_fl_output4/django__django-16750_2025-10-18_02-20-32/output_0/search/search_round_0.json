        "content": "To address the issue mentioned, let's gather enough context about the classes and methods that the bug description references. Given the information provided in the issue, we need to focus on the `Chr` and possibly the `CharField` class, as well as the `annotate` method (likely of a QuerySet) and the part of the code that causes the `ValueError`. The file paths and class names have not been explicitly mentioned, so we'll start by locating `Chr` and `CharField`, and then proceed to pieces of code relevant to `annotate` and the conversion causing the error.\n\n1. Search for the `Chr` class to understand its current implementation and where `output_field` might be set:\n   - `search_class(\"Chr\")`\n\n2. Search for the `CharField` class to confirm its properties and usage context, ensuring it aligns with the suggested modification:\n   - `search_class(\"CharField\")`\n\n3. The `annotate` method is likely part of a model's QuerySet or a manager, and given that `Author.objects.annotate(...)` is the context, it might be worth checking where `annotate` is utilized within the relevant classes, although `annotate` is a common method from Django's ORM:\n   - `search_method(\"annotate\")`\n\n4. Finally, since the ValueError refers to an operation in a lambda within expressions.py where an `int(value)` conversion is attempted, understanding this specific piece of code is crucial:\n   - `search_code(\"int(value)\")`"
