Given the requirement and the previous misunderstanding, let's adjust the approach. The objective remains to attempt reproducing the `ValueError` when using the `Chr` function with an argument that causes an error due to being improperly handled within Django's ORM. We'll ensure that the script checks for the specific error correctly and use `print_stacktrace` to display the error information clearly if the issue is encountered. 

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models.expressions import Value
from django.db.models.functions import Chr

# Configure Django settings
settings.configure(
    DEBUG=True,
    DATABASES={
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': ':memory:',
        }
    },
    INSTALLED_APPS=('__main__',),
)

django.setup()

# Define a test model
class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

# Utility function to print the stack trace
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Function to attempt reproducing the issue and validate the outcome
def reproduce_issue():
    from django.core.management import call_command
    # Apply migrations to set up the in-memory database
    call_command('makemigrations', '__main__', interactive=False)
    call_command('migrate', interactive=False)

    # Attempt to reproduce the issue
    try:
        # The line supposed to trigger the issue
        Author.objects.annotate(first_letter=Chr(Value('M')))
        # If the operation does not raise an error, we'll consider the issue fixed
        return True
    except ValueError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if reproduce_issue():
        print("The issue seems to be fixed. Exiting with code 0.")
    else:
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.")
```

This script deliberately includes the call to `reproduce_issue` within a conditional block to differentiate between when the issue is present and when it is considered fixed. The exception handling is specifically looking for `ValueError`, which is the type of exception we expect when the issue is present. Note that this script may need adjustments if the Django ORM's behavior changes or if the `Chr` function's handling of its arguments is modified in a way that does not result in a `ValueError` under similar circumstances.
