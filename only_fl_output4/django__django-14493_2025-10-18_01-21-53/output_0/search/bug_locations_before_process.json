        "intended_behavior": "Within the `post_process` method, there should be handling for the scenario when `max_post_process_passes` is set to `0`. This adjustment would entail ensuring that the variable `substitutions` is appropriately initialized before its first reference, even if no post-processing passes are to be made. This could be done by initializing `substitutions` to an empty dictionary or appropriate data structure at the start of the method to ensure it exists, or by adding conditions to skip over code paths that assume `substitutions` has been modified only if `max_post_process_passes` is greater than `0`. The method should be modified to directly accommodate the case where `max_post_process_passes = 0` by either bypassing the processing logic altogether or ensuring that the processing logic can gracefully handle a lack of iterations without resulting in an `UnboundLocalError`. A potential modification could be to initialize `substitutions` to an empty state that signifies no substitutions are needed when `max_post_process_passes` is set to `0`, preventing the iteration process from starting and thus preserving the intention behind setting `max_post_process_passes` to `0`. This adjustment must preserve the existing functionality for all other cases, ensuring that when `max_post_process_passes` is not `0`, the code behaves as initially designed, iterating over static files and making adjustments based on substitutions."
