        "content": "To effectively gather the necessary context for resolving the issue mentioned, we need to understand how the `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` class and its `post_process` method are implemented, especially around the part where the variable `substitutions` is involved. Moreover, understanding the inheritance and overloading within the context of `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` and its parent classes could be crucial to ensuring compatibility and correctness in the solution. Here are the search API calls that would help in collecting this context:\n\n1. **Search for the class `ManifestStaticFilesStorage`**: This will give us a broad overview of the class, potentially including its parent classes, methods, and any relevant documentation within the codebase.\n    ```python\n    search_class(\"ManifestStaticFilesStorage\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Search for the method `post_process` in class `ManifestStaticFilesStorage`**: Given that the traceback points to the `post_process` method, it's crucial to understand how it's defined in the `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` class, especially since the error seems to stem from here.\n    ```python\n    search_method_in_class(\"post_process\", \"ManifestStaticFilesStorage\")\n    ```\n\n3. **Search for the code snippet where `substitutions` is referenced**: Since the issue specifically mentions that `UnboundLocalError` arises due to `substitutions` being referenced before assignment, fetching the exact implementation details of this snippet will allow us to understand the immediate problem.\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"if substitutions:\")\n    ```\n\n4. **Get the code around the mentioned GitHub URL**: The issue description provides a GitHub link pointing to specific lines in `storage.py`. Retrieving code around this area could offer direct insights into the issue and its context. Although the exact implementation details and line numbers might differ in the project's current state, fetching code from similar locations could be helpful.\n    ```python\n    get_code_around_line(\"django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py\", 251, 5)\n    ```\n\nThese API calls are structured to provide a thorough understanding of both the scope of the `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` class, its `post_process` method, how `substitutions` is handled, and the area around the problematic code snippet. The insight gathered from these calls will be crucial in crafting a patch to resolve the issue."
