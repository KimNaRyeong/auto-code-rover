One way to\n537     deal with this problem is to assert that two floating-point numbers are\n538     equal to within some appropriate tolerance::\n539 \n540         >>> abs((0.1 + 0.2) - 0.3) < 1e-6\n541         True\n542 \n543     However, comparisons like this are tedious to write and difficult to\n544     understand.  Furthermore, absolute comparisons like the one above are\n545     usually discouraged because there's no tolerance that works well for all\n546     situations.  ``1e-6`` is good for numbers around ``1``, but too small for\n547     very big numbers and too big for very small ones.  It's better to express\n548     the tolerance as a fraction of the expected value, but relative comparisons\n549     like that are even more difficult to write correctly and concisely.\n550 \n551     The ``approx`` class performs floating-point comparisons using a syntax\n552     that's as intuitive as possible::\n553 \n554         >>> from pytest import approx\n555         >>> 0.1 + 0.2 == approx(0.3)\n556         True\n557 \n558     The same syntax also works for ordered sequences of numbers::\n559 \n560         >>> (0.1 + 0.2, 0.2 + 0.4) == approx((0.3, 0.6))\n561         True\n562 \n563     ``numpy`` arrays::\n564 \n565         >>> import numpy as np                                                          # doctest: +SKIP\n566         >>> np.array([0.1, 0.2]) + np.array([0.2, 0.4]) == approx(np.array([0.3, 0.6])) # doctest: +SKIP\n567         True\n568 \n569     And for a ``numpy`` array against a scalar::\n570 \n571         >>> import numpy as np                                         # doctest: +SKIP\n572         >>> np.array([0.1, 0.2]) + np.array([0.2, 0.1]) == approx(0.3) # doctest: +SKIP\n573         True\n574 \n575     Only ordered sequences are supported, because ``approx`` needs\n576     to infer the relative position of the sequences without ambiguity. This means\n577     ``sets`` and other unordered sequences are not supported.\n578 \n579     Finally, dictionary *values* can also be compared::\n580 \n581         >>> {'a': 0.1 + 0.2, 'b': 0.2 + 0.4} == approx({'a': 0.3, 'b': 0.6})\n582         True\n583 \n584     The comparison will be true if both mappings have the same keys and their\n585     respective values match the expected tolerances.\n586 \n587     **Tolerances**\n588 \n589     By default, ``approx`` considers numbers within a relative tolerance of\n590     ``1e-6`` (i.e. one part in a million) of its expected value to be equal.\n591     This treatment would lead to surprising results if the expected value was\n592     ``0.0``, because nothing but ``0.0`` itself is relatively close to ``0.0``.\n593     To handle this case less surprisingly, ``approx`` also considers numbers\n594     within an absolute tolerance of ``1e-12`` of its expected value to be\n595     equal.  Infinity and NaN are special cases.  Infinity is only considered\n596     equal to itself, regardless of the relative tolerance.  NaN is not\n597     considered equal to anything by default, but you can make it be equal to\n598     itself by setting the ``nan_ok`` argument to True.  (This is meant to\n599     facilitate comparing arrays that use NaN to mean \"no data\".)\n600 \n601     Both the relative and absolute tolerances can be changed by passing\n602     arguments to the ``approx`` constructor::\n603 \n604         >>> 1.0001 == approx(1)\n605         False\n606         >>> 1.0001 == approx(1, rel=1e-3)\n607         True\n608         >>> 1.0001 == approx(1, abs=1e-3)\n609         True\n610 \n611     If you specify ``abs`` but not ``rel``, the comparison will not consider\n612     the relative tolerance at all.  In other words, two numbers that are within\n613     the default relative tolerance of ``1e-6`` will still be considered unequal\n614     if they exceed the specified absolute tolerance.  If you specify both\n615     ``abs`` and ``rel``, the numbers will be considered equal if either\n616     tolerance is met::\n617 \n618         >>> 1 + 1e-8 == approx(1)\n619         True\n620         >>> 1 + 1e-8 == approx(1, abs=1e-12)\n621         False\n622         >>> 1 + 1e-8 == approx(1, rel=1e-6, abs=1e-12)\n623         True\n624 \n625     You can also use ``approx`` to compare nonnumeric types, or dicts and\n626     sequences containing nonnumeric types, in which case it falls back to\n627     strict equality. This can be useful for comparing dicts and sequences that\n628     can contain optional values::\n629 \n630         >>> {\"required\": 1.0000005, \"optional\": None} == approx({\"required\": 1, \"optional\": None})\n631         True\n632         >>> [None, 1.0000005] == approx([None,1])\n633         True\n634         >>> [\"foo\", 1.0000005] == approx([None,1])\n635         False\n636 \n637     If you're thinking about using ``approx``, then you might want to know how\n638     it compares to other good ways of comparing floating-point numbers.  All of\n639     these algorithms are based on relative and absolute tolerances and should\n640     agree for the most part, but they do have meaningful differences:\n641 \n642     - ``math.isclose(a, b, rel_tol=1e-9, abs_tol=0.0)``:  True if the relative\n643       tolerance is met w.r.t. either ``a`` or ``b`` or if the absolute\n644       tolerance is met.  Because the relative tolerance is calculated w.r.t.\n645       both ``a`` and ``b``, this test is symmetric (i.e.  neither ``a`` nor\n646       ``b`` is a \"reference value\").  You have to specify an absolute tolerance\n647       if you want to compare to ``0.0`` because there is no tolerance by\n648       default.  More information: :py:func:`math.isclose`.\n649 \n650     - ``numpy.isclose(a, b, rtol=1e-5, atol=1e-8)``: True if the difference\n651       between ``a`` and ``b`` is less that the sum of the relative tolerance\n652       w.r.t. ``b`` and the absolute tolerance.  Because the relative tolerance\n653       is only calculated w.r.t. ``b``, this test is asymmetric and you can\n654       think of ``b`` as the reference value.  Support for comparing sequences\n655       is provided by :py:func:`numpy.allclose`.  More information:\n656       :std:doc:`numpy:reference/generated/numpy.isclose`.\n657 \n658     - ``unittest.TestCase.assertAlmostEqual(a, b)``: True if ``a`` and ``b``\n659       are within an absolute tolerance of ``1e-7``.  No relative tolerance is\n660       considered , so this function is not appropriate for very large or very\n661       small numbers.  Also, it's only available in subclasses of ``unittest.TestCase``\n662       and it's ugly because it doesn't follow PEP8.  More information:\n663       :py:meth:`unittest.TestCase.assertAlmostEqual`.\n664 \n665     - ``a == pytest.approx(b, rel=1e-6, abs=1e-12)``: True if the relative\n666       tolerance is met w.r.t. ``b`` or if the absolute tolerance is met.\n667       Because the relative tolerance is only calculated w.r.t. ``b``, this test\n668       is asymmetric and you can think of ``b`` as the reference value.  In the\n669       special case that you explicitly specify an absolute tolerance but not a\n670       relative tolerance, only the absolute tolerance is considered.\n671 \n672     .. note::\n673 \n674         ``approx`` can handle numpy arrays, but we recommend the\n675         specialised test helpers in :std:doc:`numpy:reference/routines.testing`\n676         if you need support for comparisons, NaNs, or ULP-based tolerances.\n677 \n678         To match strings using regex, you can use\n679         `Matches <https://github.com/asottile/re-assert#re_assertmatchespattern-str-args-kwargs>`_\n680         from the\n681         `re_assert package <https://github.com/asottile/re-assert>`_.\n682 \n683     .. warning::\n684 \n685        .. versionchanged:: 3.2\n686 \n687        In order to avoid inconsistent behavior, :py:exc:`TypeError` is\n688        raised for ``>``, ``>=``, ``<`` and ``<=`` comparisons.\n689        The example below illustrates the problem::\n690 \n691            assert approx(0.1) > 0.1 + 1e-10  # calls approx(0.1).__gt__(0.1 + 1e-10)\n692            assert 0.1 + 1e-10 > approx(0.1)  # calls approx(0.1).__lt__(0.1 + 1e-10)\n693 \n694        In the second example one expects ``approx(0.1).__le__(0.1 + 1e-10)``\n695        to be called. But instead, ``approx(0.1).__lt__(0.1 + 1e-10)`` is used to\n696        comparison. This is because the call hierarchy of rich comparisons\n697        follows a fixed behavior.

        "content": "The provided code snippet from the `approx` function in `src/_pytest/python_api.py` outlines its purpose and functionality. Let's analyze it in relation to the issue at hand:\n\n### What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe `approx` function is designed to make floating-point comparisons easier and more intuitive. It allows the assertion of equality between two numbers, or two sequences of numbers, within a specified tolerance. This is particularly useful in testing scenarios where exact equality comparisons for floating-point numbers can be unreliable due to the inherent imprecision of floating-point representation in computers.\n\nThe function works by comparing an \"expected\" value (or set of values) against an \"actual\" one, considering either an absolute or relative tolerance (or both) to determine if they should be considered approximately equal. It can handle various types of inputs including scalars, sequences, dictionaries, and even `numpy` arrays.\n\n### What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue describes a `TypeError` raised when `None` is compared using `approx`. This error is likely originating from operations (`-` operator specifically) that expect numeric types but are instead encountering a `NoneType` in one operand. The `approx` function, or the classes it delegates to (`ApproxScalar`, `ApproxMapping`, etc.), probably does not have explicit handling or checks for `None` values during these operations, leading to the observed `TypeError`.\n\n### Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior, derived from the context of the issue and the functionality of `approx`, would be to gracefully handle `None` values. Given the utility of `approx` for dealing with optional values or missing data (as lightly mentioned in lines 628-633), it should ideally provide meaningful feedback when encountering `None`, instead of raising a `TypeError`. \n\nThis could manifest as treating `None` as a special case that cannot be approximately equal to a numeric type, thereby failing the assertion more gracefully, or by explicitly checking for `None` and raising a more informative error message specific to this scenario.\n\nSince the provided code does not show such handling, and the provided `TypeError` does not originate directly from the approx functionality (as \"Could not find code TypeError\" indicates no direct link was found), the issue likely stems from how `approx` or its delegated classes handle `None` during arithmetic or comparison operations.\n\nGiven this analysis, further context is needed to pinpoint where `NoneType` values are explicitly handled or mishandled within the comparison logic, specifically in the classes `approx` delegates to. Considering the delegation logic for different types (`ApproxScalar`, `ApproxMapping`, etc.) mentioned in the code, it would be beneficial to investigate how these handle `None` values.\n\nFuture API Calls to Consider:\n- `search_class(\"ApproxScalar\")`: To understand how individual numbers are compared and if there's handling for `None`.\n- `search_class(\"ApproxMapping\")`: As dictionaries are involved, it would be useful to see if and how dictionary values, which could be `None`, are handled.\n- `search_code(\"TypeError\")`: Although the first attempt returned no direct hits, narrowing the search to the context of comparison operations with `None` may require more specific queries or looking in related class implementations."

If `None` is encountered on either side of the comparison, the class should raise an `AssertionError` with a clear message that `None` values are not supported for approximate comparisons or provide a logical way to handle `None` based on the context (e.g., automatically considering them not equal to any numeric value but not raising a `TypeError`). This approach aligns with `pytest`'s aim for clarity and informative error messages when assertions fail.\n\n### Bug Location 2:\n- **File:** `src/_pytest/python_api.py`\n- **Class:** `ApproxMapping`\n- **Intended Behavior:** \n  - Since the issue arises when comparing dictionary values, `ApproxMapping` must be capable of identifying `None` values in expected dictionary values and handling them appropriately. Similar to `ApproxScalar`, it should either fail gracefully with an informative error message about the inability to use `None` in approximate comparisons or define a specific behavior for `None` values. This could involve skipping `None` values with a warning or treating them as a special case, depending on what behavior is deemed more useful for users of `pytest`.\n\nThese suggested changes aim to preserve the existing functionality of approximate comparisons while improving the handling of `None` values, thereby preventing the `TypeError` and making test failures easier to understand and debug."

        "content": "From the search results, we have information on the `ApproxScalar` and `ApproxMapping` classes within `src/_pytest/python_api.py`. Let\u2019s analyze their relationship to the issue and speculate on intended behavior modifications needed to resolve the issue.\n\n### ApproxScalar\n- **Purpose:** This class likely handles the comparison of scalar numeric values within the `approx` functionality, computing whether two scalars are approximately equal based on specified tolerances.\n- **Relationship to Bug:** The bug involves a `TypeError` when one of the values being compared is `None`, which indicates `ApproxScalar` (or perhaps the broader `approx` implementation) does not explicitly handle `None` values or check for their presence before attempting arithmetic or comparison operations.\n- **Intended behavior:** To address the issue, `ApproxScalar` should include a check for `None` values in the `__eq__` method (or whichever method performs the comparison). If `None` is detected, it should either raise a more informative `AssertionError` indicating `None` cannot be used for approximate comparisons, or explicitly return `False` (if the design decision is that a comparison involving `None` should always fail).\n\n### ApproxMapping\n- **Purpose:** This class appears designed to handle comparisons of mappings (like dictionaries), checking if two mappings are approximately equal by comparing their key-value pairs under the tolerances defined for `approx`.\n- **Relationship to Bug:** Since the issue occurs with an assertion involving dictionary values, where the expected value is `None`, it's reasonable to infer that `ApproxMapping` doesn\u2019t properly account for `None` values in its comparison logic.\n- **Intended Behavior:** `ApproxMapping` should implement a mechanism within `__eq__` or a related method to either: a) gracefully handle `None` values by providing a clear, descriptive error when they cannot be compared approximately, or b) decide on a practical rule for `None` values (e.g., always considering them not equal to numeric values) and document this behavior for users. Additionally, enhancing error messages to guide the user about the presence of `None` values in approximate comparisons could greatly improve usability.\n\nBoth of these changes address the direct issue and potentially preempt similar errors by providing clarity on handling `None` values in future test cases. Adding these checks not only resolves the bug but also aligns with the broader intent of `pytest` to make testing more intuitive and informative."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

If `actual` or the object being compared (`self.expected`) is `None`, the method should return `False` directly or raise a more descriptive error indicating that `None` values cannot be compared using `approx`. This change ensures that users are not met with a `TypeError` due to unsupported arithmetic operations involving `None`, but instead receive clear feedback on the nature of the error.\n\n### Bug Location 2:\n- **File:** `src/_pytest/python_api.py`\n- **Class:** `ApproxMapping`\n- **Method:** `__eq__`\n- **Intended Behavior:** In the `__eq__` method, before performing any comparison, check if any value in the `actual` mapping or in the expected mapping (`self.expected`) is `None`. If so, handle gracefully by either explicitly returning `False` to indicate non-equality due to `None` values or raise an informative exception that `None` values are not supported for approximate comparisons in dictionaries. This will guide the user to either correct the test or adjust their expectations regarding the use of `approx` with mappings containing `None`.\n\nThese modifications maintain the core functionality of the `approx` utility, ensuring it remains a powerful tool for floating-point comparisons, while enhancing its usability and error messaging for cases involving non-numeric types like `None`."
