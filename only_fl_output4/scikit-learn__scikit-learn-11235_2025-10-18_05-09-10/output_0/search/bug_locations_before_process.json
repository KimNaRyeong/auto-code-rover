        "intended_behavior": "The `partial_fit` method should include a conditional check at the beginning to handle cases where both `with_mean=False` and `with_std=False` consistently across both sparse and dense inputs. This means, if both are `False`, the method should effectively bypass any computations or updates to `self.mean_`, `self.var_`, and `self.n_samples_seen_` that would otherwise occur since it acts as an identity transformation in this configuration. This prevents unnecessary computation and ensures that subsequent calls to `fit` or `partial_fit` do not result in errors related to inconsistent internal state like attempting to delete `self.n_samples_seen_` which may not have been properly initialized for sparse data."

        "method": "fit",
        "intended_behavior": "The `fit` method should also contain similar logic to `partial_fit` as mentioned above, ensuring that when `with_mean` and `with_std` are both set to `False`, the scaler does not perform any unnecessary computations or updates. This includes not attempting to center or scale the data and not performing updates on `self.mean_`, `self.var_`, or `self.n_samples_seen_`. It could even include a direct return of `self` after resetting if these conditions are met, similar to how it delegates to `partial_fit` but ensuring it bypasses further operations."
