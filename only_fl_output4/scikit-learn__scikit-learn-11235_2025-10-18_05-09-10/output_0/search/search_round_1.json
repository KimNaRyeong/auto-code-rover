If we wish a transformer to do so, one should use the `FunctionTransformer` I assume.\n2. If we consider this behaviour normal, we need to:\n* In the dense case, force `self.mean_` to be `None` after each iteration of `partial_fit`.\n* In the sparse case, compute the non-NaNs values and update `self.n_samples_seen_` which is not computed. It leads currently to an error if calling twice `fit` (i.e. `del self.n_samples_seen_` will fail).\nIMO, we should make a checking at `fit` raise an error.\n@jnothman @ogrisel WDYT?\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context gives us insight into how the `StandardScaler` class is implemented and managed in scikit-learn, and how this relates to the reported issue regarding the consistency of behavior between sparse and dense data with the parameters `with_mean=False` and `with_std=False`.\n\n### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n1. **`StandardScaler` Implementation Overview**:\n   - The `StandardScaler` class is a part of `sklearn/preprocessing/data.py`. It supports centering and scaling of data.\n   - Key methods within this class include `fit`, `partial_fit`, `transform`, and `inverse_transform`.\n   - During fitting (`fit` and `partial_fit` methods), the mean, variance, and scale of features are computed to scale the data.\n\n2. **Handling `with_mean=False` and `with_std=False`**:\n   - The `partial_fit` method has logic for handling when `with_mean` and/or `with_std` are set to `False`. If `with_std` is `False`, it avoids computing the scale related to standard deviation but proceeds to update mean and variance (even if `with_mean` is `False`), which is essential for the incremental computation.\n   - Sparse matrices cannot be centered if `with_mean=True` due to the nature of sparse data. This is explicitly checked and raised as an error if attempted.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior vs. Issue Description**:\n   - The issue points out a lack of consistency because when both `with_mean` and `with_std` are set to `False`, the behavior differs between sparse and dense data inputs. It is expected that in this scenario, the `StandardScaler` might act like an identity transformation, which the submitter argues isn't its intended use.\n   - From the description and the analysis of `partial_fit`, we see that `self.mean_` is set to `None` when `with_std=False` for sparse inputs. This mechanism appears to be part of handling edge cases internally but doesn't directly address whether it's consistent across sparse and dense inputs nor whether `n_samples_seen_` is correctly managed in all scenarios.\n\n### Conclusions for Intended Behavior\n\nGiven the issue description and analyzed code:\n\n- The reported inconsistency arises from how `StandardScaler` handles the `fit` and `partial_fit` methods under different configurations (`with_mean=False` and `with_std=False`), and the expectation or lack thereof of changes in `self.mean_` and `self.n_samples_seen_`.\n\n- For dense data, `self.mean_` and `self.var_` are maintained during `partial_fit` (unless `with_std` is `False`, where `self.mean_` gets set to `None` explicitly in certain conditions). For sparse data, an attempt to center data (update `self.mean_`) when `with_mean=True` will raise an error. However, the handling when both are set to `False` seems not explicitly designed for both data types, potentially leading to the observed inconsistency.\n\n- The current implementation implies that even when not used for scaling (both `with_mean` and `with_std` set to `False`), `StandardScaler` still computes and updates internal state (like `n_samples_seen_`) which might not be necessary for the identity transformation.\n\n### Next Steps for Resolving the Issue\n\n- Deciding whether `StandardScaler` should explicitly manage cases where both `with_mean` and `with_std` are `False` to consistently do nothing or simply act as an identity transformation across both sparse and dense data types.\n- If proceeding with the transformation is decided to be the intended behavior, then ensuring that internal state (`self.mean_`, `self.var_`, and particularly `self.n_samples_seen_`) does not improperly update or cause errors in subsequent calls for both sparse and dense inputs is necessary. Additionally, explicit checks at the beginning of `fit` or `partial_fit` could preempt and manage such configurations, possibly redirecting users to more suitable transformers for identity transformations or raising informative errors."

This means, if both are `False`, the method should effectively bypass any computations or updates to `self.mean_`, `self.var_`, and `self.n_samples_seen_` that would otherwise occur since it acts as an identity transformation in this configuration. This prevents unnecessary computation and ensures that subsequent calls to `fit` or `partial_fit` do not result in errors related to inconsistent internal state like attempting to delete `self.n_samples_seen_` which may not have been properly initialized for sparse data.\n\n- **Location 2**: \n  - **File**: `sklearn/preprocessing/data.py`\n  - **Class**: `StandardScaler`\n  - **Method**: `fit`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: The `fit` method should also contain similar logic to `partial_fit` as mentioned above, ensuring that when `with_mean` and `with_std` are both set to `False`, the scaler does not perform any unnecessary computations or updates. This includes not attempting to center or scale the data and not performing updates on `self.mean_`, `self.var_`, or `self.n_samples_seen_`. It could even include a direct return of `self` after resetting if these conditions are met, similar to how it delegates to `partial_fit` but ensuring it bypasses further operations.\n\nThese changes will align the behavior of `StandardScaler` for sparse and dense inputs when it's essentially expected to perform no scaling, ensuring consistency and preventing errors related to the improper handling of internal state in these scenarios. This resolves the issue by making explicit the non-operation of `StandardScaler` under configurations where it should act as an identity transformation, thus preserving existing functionality while correcting the inconsistency highlighted in the issue."
