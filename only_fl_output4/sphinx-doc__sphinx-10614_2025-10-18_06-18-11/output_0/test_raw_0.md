To create a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` that reproduces the described issue with the inheritance diagram SVG links, you can follow this approach. This script will simulate the steps required to reproduce the issue, including generating documentation with inheritance diagrams in SVG format. Then, it will verify if the links in the generated SVG files point correctly relative to their embedding HTML files. If the links are incorrect, leading to a 404 error if they were to be clicked on a live server, the script will raise an `AssertionError`.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_svg_links():
    docs_build_dir = 'docs_build'
    svg_file_path = os.path.join(docs_build_dir, 'my_package', 'index.html')
    expected_substring = '../my_package/my_class_1.html#my_package.MyClass1'

    try:
        # Assuming Sphinx generates an SVG inside an HTML object tag in `docs_build/my_package/index.html`
        with open(svg_file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            content = file.read()
            if expected_substring not in content:
                raise AssertionError("SVG link does not point correctly. Expected substring not found.")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"File not found: {svg_file_path}")

try:
    # Step 1: Install Sphinx (assumes Sphinx and necessary extensions are not already installed)
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", "sphinx"])

    # Step 2: Generate documentation with Sphinx. This command might need to be adjusted based on the actual Sphinx setup.
    subprocess.check_call(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', 'docs_source', 'docs_build'])

    # Step 3: Check if SVG links are correct
    check_svg_links()

    print("Success: No issue found with SVG links.")

except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
```

**Note**: This script assumes that the Sphinx project is correctly set up in a way analogous to the one described in the issue report. You might need to adjust the `docs_source` and `docs_build` directory paths if they differ in your environment. Since this script includes installing Sphinx, it presumes Sphinx is not already installed in your Python environment, and it runs Sphinx to regenerate documentation. Make sure that your actual directories and paths match the ones expected in the script, especially for `svg_file_path` and `expected_substring`, to accurately check for the presence of the bug.
