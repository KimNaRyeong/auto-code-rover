Given your requirements and the context of the initial problem description, here's how you could structure a standalone `reproducer.py` script. This script will aim to replicate the reported issue inside a Python environment programmatically, by creating a minimal Sphinx project that includes generating SVG inheritance diagrams with problematic links. Additionally, it will inspect the generated output for incorrect SVG links. If the problem exists, it will raise an `AssertionError`.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_sphinx_project():
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'sphinx.cmd.quickstart', '--quiet', '--sep', '-p', 'TestProject', '-a', 'Author', 'docs'])
    with open('docs/conf.py', 'a') as conf:
        conf.write("\nextensions = ['sphinx.ext.inheritance_diagram']\n")
    os.makedirs('docs/my_package', exist_ok=True)
    with open('docs/my_package/my_class_1.rst', 'w') as f:
        f.write(".. inheritance-diagram:: MyPackage.MyClass1\n")
    with open('docs/index.rst', 'w') as f:
        f.write("Welcome to TestProject's documentation!\n==================================\n\n.. toctree::\n\n   my_package/my_class_1\n")

def check_svg_links():
    svg_file_path = 'docs/_build/html/my_package/my_class_1.html'
    expected_substring = 'my_package/my_class_1.html#mypackage.myclass1'

    try:
        with open(svg_file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            content = file.read()
            assert expected_substring in content, "SVG link does not point correctly."
    except FileNotFoundError:
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Expected file was not generated: {svg_file_path}")

try:
    create_sphinx_project()
    # Generate documentation
    subprocess.check_call(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', 'docs', 'docs/_build/html'])

    # Check if SVG links are correct
    check_svg_links()

    print("Success: No issue found with SVG links; they point correctly.")

except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
```

**Note:**
This script assumes the presence of a Python environment where Sphinx and its dependencies are installed. It sets up a basic Sphinx project programmatically, modifying configurations to include the necessary extensions and setting up a structure that mirrors the reported scenario. After generating the documentation, it checks for the specific link structure within the generated SVG content.

Please ensure you adjust the paths and the assertion conditions according to your specific environment and the detailed structure of the SVG content you expect to test. This script does not cover the full complexity that might be observed in real projects, especially those with more complex class hierarchies or Sphinx configurations.
