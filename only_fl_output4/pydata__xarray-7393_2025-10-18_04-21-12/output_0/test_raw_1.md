Based on the new specifications and correcting previous guidance, here is an updated script `reproducer.py` to accurately reproduce the reported issue, including the usage of `print_stacktrace` for error reporting:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    import xarray as xr
    import numpy as np

    ds = xr.Dataset(coords={'a': np.array([0], dtype='i4')})
    result = ds['a'].values.dtype == ds.stack(b=('a',))['a'].values.dtype
    
    try:
        # The issue is present if this assertion fails
        assert result, "Data type changed after stacking."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Reraise the exception to allow catching or exit with a non-zero code
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError:
        # If an AssertionError occurs, it indicates the issue is present.
        # Exiting with a non-zero code to indicate failure/error.
        exit(1)
    else:
        # If no AssertionError, the issue is considered fixed/not reproduced.
        # Exiting with a zero code to indicate success/no error.
        exit(0)
```

This script should be executed as `python3 reproducer.py`. It attempts to reproduce the described issue by asserting that the data type should not change after stacking with `xarray`. If the data type does change (i.e., the assertion fails), it prints a detailed stack trace using the provided function and exits with status code 1, indicating the issue is present. Otherwise, it exits with status code 0, indicating the issue is fixed or not present.
