However, a little known quirk of Python regexes is that $ will also match a trailing newline. Therefore, the user name validators will accept usernames which end with a newline. You can avoid this behavior by instead using \\A and \\Z to terminate regexes. For example, the validator regex could be changed to\nr'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\nin order to reject usernames that end with a newline.\nI am not sure how to officially post a patch, but the required change is trivial - using the regex above in the two validators in contrib.auth.validators.\n</issue>"

        "content": "The collected context from `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` is quite informative regarding the issue at hand.\n\n### 1. What does this part of the code do?\n\nThe provided code snippets belong to two classes, `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`, both inheriting from `validators.RegexValidator`. These classes are used to validate usernames based on a regex pattern provided in the `regex` attribute of each class. The specific regex pattern `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` is employed to define a set of allowed characters in usernames. These characters include alphanumeric characters (both letters and numbers), along with a specific set of symbols: period (.), at sign (@), plus sign (+), and dash (-). The use of flags `re.ASCII` in `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `flags = 0` in `UnicodeUsernameValidator` differentiates the handling of character sets by enforcing ASCII only in the former, while the latter allows Unicode characters.\n\n### 2. What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?\n\nThe issue stems from the regex pattern employed (`r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'`) which, due to the use of `$`, unintentionally permits trailing newlines in usernames. This behavior diverges from the validators' apparent intent, which is to limit the username format to specific characters sans trailing whitespace or newline characters. Both `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` are affected since they both use this regex pattern.\n\n### 3. Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?\n\nThe intended behavior is to strictly validate usernames according to the specified pattern without allowing trailing newlines. To rectify the issue, the suggestion is to substitute the current regex pattern with one that uses `\\A` and `\\Z` for start and end of string assertions, respectively, instead of `^` and `$`. This change ensures that the validation process does not accept usernames ending with a newline character. Updating the regex to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'` in both validator classes will enforce this stricter and more intentional matching rule.\n\nThe absence of findings for the search of the regex string in the codebase possibly indicates a limitation either in the search query (escaping special characters in regex could be necessary) or in the scope of the search. Given the explicit results obtained for both validator classes, we now understand the specific location (`django/contrib/auth/validators.py`) and exact lines to be modified according to the described issue and its remediation plan."

This modification ensures that the validation strictly confines to the beginning and end of the string, disallowing trailing newlines in usernames while preserving the allowed set of alphanumeric and special characters (., @, +, -). This change adheres to the project's requirements for ASCIIUsernameValidator by allowing only English letters, numbers, and specific characters (@, ., +, -, _) without trailing newlines.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**:  \n  **File**: `django/contrib/auth/validators.py`  \n  **Class**: `UnicodeUsernameValidator`  \n  **Intended Behavior**: Similar to `ASCIIUsernameValidator`, the `UnicodeUsernameValidator` class's regex pattern must be updated from `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`. This adjustment ensures the validator excludes usernames ending with a newline, strictly enforcing the pattern from the very start to the very end of the string. The change maintains the validator's purpose of allowing letters (including non-English characters due to Unicode support), numbers, and the specified characters while ensuring no trailing newline characters are accepted. This adjustment affirms the project's validation rules for `UnicodeUsernameValidator` concerning global character support."
