        "intended_behavior": "The `LazyObject` should only expose magic methods (`__getitem__`, `__iter__`, and others) if the wrapped object actually supports those methods. Implement a dynamic mechanism to check the capabilities (i.e., which methods are supported) of the wrapped object. Modify the proxy mechanism (`new_method_proxy`) to conditionally apply these magic method proxies based on the wrapped object's available methods, ensuring that the interface exposed by `LazyObject` dynamically matches the interface of the wrapped object, preserving backward compatibility and preventing runtime errors."
