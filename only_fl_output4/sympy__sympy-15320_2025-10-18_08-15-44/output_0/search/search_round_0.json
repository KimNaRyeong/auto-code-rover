Search for the `RootOf` class to understand its structure and related methods. This will provide an overview of how `RootOf` operates and handles its input arguments, including the generator.\n   - `search_class(\"RootOf\")`\n\n2. Given the issue description mentions the `poly` attribute and how it handles the generator (e.g., `x` or `tan(x)`), it's also crucial to find where and how the `RootOf` instance's `poly` attribute is defined or manipulated.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"poly\", \"RootOf\")`\n\n3. The examples from the issue highlight operations like `.subs()`, which might not be directly related to the `RootOf` class but are crucial for understanding how expressions are manipulated before being passed to `RootOf`. Therefore, looking into where `.subs` is defined or used within the class context is necessary.\n   - `search_method(\"subs\")`\n\n4. The issue indicates a potential problem with how `RootOf` is interpreting or ignoring the generator changes in expressions. It will be informative to search for any method or function that might be responsible for evaluating or interpreting the generator within `RootOf` or related utilities.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"generator\", \"RootOf\")`\n   - `search_method(\"generator\")` // To catch any utility functions/classes that might influence the behavior.\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive view of how the `RootOf` class is designed, how it deals with generators and expressions, and potentially why it might be missing changes in the generator as described in the issue."
