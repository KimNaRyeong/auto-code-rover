Given the test execution's issue with the environment and the noted `AttributeError` concerning `np.unicode_`, it's clear that the environment where the code is running might not be compatible with the code provided initially, likely due to advancements in the numpy version. However, if we are to reproduce the issue exactly as requested ignoring the compatibility issues seen in the test environment, the python file `reproducer.py` would remain as previously stated with the understanding it needs an environment where this compatibility issue does not occur. 

Numpy's `np.unicode_` being removed in version 2.0 suggests an environment mismatch. The original script is written for a specific version of the libraries, notably xarray, which may not work correctly with the numpy version in the test environment. 

Ensure your environment matches the requirements for xarray at the version level indicated in the traceback (`xarray: 0.10.8`, `numpy: 1.15.0` as per the user's `xr.show_versions()` output). Compatibility between `xarray` and `numpy` versions is crucial for avoiding such errors. Since the environment setup can't be adjusted through this interface, I recommend verifying the compatibility of library versions in your execution environment or creating a new environment that matches these requirements.

For reproducibility and future reference, setting up an environment that closely matches the original issue's conditions is crucial. You might use conda or venv to create an environment with specific versions, e.g., Python 3.6, numpy 1.15.0, and xarray 0.10.8, to more accurately reproduce and test the issue described.
