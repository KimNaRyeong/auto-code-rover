I understand your request, but please note that the error in the previous execution seems to be related to a version compatibility issue of NumPy in your environment rather than a failure to reproduce the intended `IndexError`. The error message "`np.unicode_` was removed in the NumPy 2.0 release" indicates that there was a problem importing `xarray` due to a breaking change in NumPy. This might be due to a mismatch between the versions of NumPy and xarray in your test environment, which could be resolved by adjusting the environment to use compatible versions.

However, if the intent is still to craft a Python script that would correctly test for the originally stated issue (ignoring the environmental issue), the script provided previously should serve well when executed in an environment with compatible package versions. If required, please ensure that your environment matches the versions stated in your original question (notably, xarray: 0.10.8, pandas: 0.23.3, numpy: 1.15.0) to avoid compatibility issues. 

To strictly adhere with your original request and specifications, assuming that the environment is now set with compatible versions, the previous script is already aligned with your requirements. This script aims to reproduce the `IndexError` and handle it accordingly by printing a detailed stack trace if it encounters this specific error during execution.
