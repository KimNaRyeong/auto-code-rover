The function should detect and manage groups resulting from NaN values so that when indices are recalculated or data is reordered, no IndexError occurs. This could involve filtering out NaN groups before recombination or implementing a check to ensure indices are within bounds after processing NaN-inclusive groups."

It should be updated to correctly handle NaN values or the effects of NaN values present in group identifiers. Specifically, it needs to guarantee that all generated indices are valid for the given array size, perhaps by omitting or separately handling NaN-affected positions to prevent generating out-of-bounds indices."
