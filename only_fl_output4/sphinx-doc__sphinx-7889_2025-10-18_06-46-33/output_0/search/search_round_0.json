See the attached log: [sphinx-err-325ndteh.log](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/files/4842672/sphinx-err-325ndteh.log)\n**To Reproduce**\n```\n$ git https://github.com/perrygoy/screenpy.git\n$ cd screenpy/docs\n$ python -m venv env\n$ source env/bin/activate\n$ pip install sphinx pyhamcrest selenium typing_extensions\n$ make html\n```\nObserve the docs command fails with a TypeError.\n**Expected behavior**\nDocs can still be built when generics are involved.\n**Your project**\nhttps://github.com/perrygoy/screenpy.git\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Mac 10.15.5 (19F101)\n- Python version: 3.7.7\n- Sphinx version: 3.1.1\n- Sphinx extensions:  sphinx.ext.autodoc, sphinx.ext.intersphinx, sphinx.ext.coverage, sphinx.ext.ifconfig, sphinx.ext.napoleon\n**Additional context**\nThis might just be me not knowing how to make Sphinx-friendly generic typing, if that's the case please let me know!\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient code context to resolve the issue related to the Autodoc extension's mock file throwing a `TypeError` for generic-typed classes, I will start with:\n\n1. The error seems to stem from Autodoc\u2019s handling of generics, specifically within its `mock._make_subclass` method, attempting to concatenate a `str` to a `TypeVar`. To address this, we first need to see how generic-typed classes are being defined and used within the project. As no specific class or file was mentioned in the issue regarding where the error occurs, I will start by looking for examples of generics usage within the codebase that might be triggering this error.\n\n2. We should also understand how `mock._make_subclass` is implemented or used within the Sphinx or the project to cause such an error. Given that this method likely lives within Sphinx's codebase (considering the context of the error), searching directly within the project for the usage of generics and any custom subclassing or mocking logic that interacts with Sphinx's autodoc functionality might be more productive initially.\n\nBased on this, the appropriate search queries would be:\n\n- `search_code(\"TypeVar\")` to find how generics are defined and used.\n- `search_code(\"mock._make_subclass\")` to possibly catch any direct references or custom implementations in the project, even if it's a Sphinx method."
