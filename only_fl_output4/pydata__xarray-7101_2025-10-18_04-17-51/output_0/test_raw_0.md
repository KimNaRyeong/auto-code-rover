This script attempts to reproduce the issue described. It creates a dataset, stacks it by multiple dimensions, and then assigns new coordinates. It explicitly checks whether the coordinates have been updated correctly, and whether operations that implicitly depend on the correct tracking of coordinates and variables (such as `len`) function as expected.

If the issue is present, relevant `AssertionError` or `ValueError` will trigger the custom stack trace printer, detailing exactly where the issue occurred. If the modifications to the dataset have resolved the mentioned issues (either through library updates or fixes to the dataset handling mechanism), the script will note that no errors were detected, suggesting the issue may have been resolved.
