Based on the given information and restrictions, below is a revised version of `reproducer.py` that adheres to your error handling and reporting requirements. This script attempts to explicitly reproduce the issue with assigning coordinates after stacking and triggers an `AssertionError` if the issue exists, or exits with code 0 if the issue is fixed. Also, it incorporates the requested function for printing the stack trace of the encountered issue.

```python
# reproducer.py

import xarray as xr


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


def run_test():
    try:
        ds = xr.DataArray(
            [[[1, 1], [0, 0]], [[2, 2], [1, 1]]],
            dims=("lat", "year", "month"),
            coords={"lat": [-60, 60], "year": [2010, 2020], "month": [3, 6]},
            name="test",
        ).to_dataset()

        stacked = ds.stack(time=("year", "month"))
        stacked = stacked.assign_coords(
            {"time": [y + m / 12 for y, m in stacked["time"].values]}
        )

        # Triggering the length check that surfaced the issue initially
        assert len(stacked) >= 0, "Dataset length should not be less than zero."

        print("No issues detected.")
        
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("\nAssertion failed. Exiting with non-zero code.")
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_test()
```

This script does the following:

1. Utilizes `xarray` to create a dataset, apply stacking, and then assign new coordinates.
2. Attempts to verify the result through checks that would fail if the issue is present.
3. Uses `print_stacktrace` to output detailed error information if an exception is caught, which helps diagnose whether the observed behavior matches the described issue.
4. Exits with code 1 on catching an `AssertionError` or any other exception, indicating an unsuccessful test run due to reproducing the issue or encountering an unexpected problem.

It's worth noting that correct execution (not encountering the described issue or any unexpected exception) will result in a "No issues detected." message and the script exiting with code 0, signaling a successful run potentially indicating that the issue might be fixed in the current environment or version being tested.
