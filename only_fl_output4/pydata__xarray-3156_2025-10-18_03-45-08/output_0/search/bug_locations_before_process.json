        "intended_behavior": "Introduce error handling for operations on empty groups within the GroupBy class operations, including mean. When the GroupBy object encounters an empty DataArray during aggregations like mean, it should gracefully handle the situation. Instead of propagating a StopIteration error, which is a low-level exception that might be confusing in this context, the method should raise a more descriptive exception (e.g., ValueError or a custom exception) indicating that the operation cannot be performed on an empty dataset. This change will ensure that the error message clearly communicates the issue to the user, improving the debugging experience. Additionally, consider implementing a check at the beginning of aggregation methods (e.g., mean, sum, etc.) to immediately return an empty DataArray or raise an informative exception if the grouped dataset is empty."
