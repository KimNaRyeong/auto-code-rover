        "content": "<issue>Nested blueprints are not respected when mounted on subdomains\nHello, and thanks for all your work \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\nNested blueprints [as described in the docs](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/blueprints/#nesting-blueprints) work perfectly fine when using `url_prefix`. However, when mounting the parent blueprint using a subdomain, the child routes are not accessible.\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom flask import Blueprint\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config[\"SERVER_NAME\"] = \"localhost:5000\"\nparent = Blueprint(\"parent\", __name__)\nchild = Blueprint(\"child\", __name__)\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\nreturn \"index\"\n@parent.route('/')\ndef parent_index():\nreturn \"parent\"\n@child.route('/child/')\ndef child_index():\nreturn \"child\"\nparent.register_blueprint(child)\napp.register_blueprint(parent, subdomain=\"api\")\nif __name__ == '__main__':\napp.run(debug=True)\n```\nThe index route works as expected:\n```\n\u276f http http://localhost:5000/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 5\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:44:10 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\nindex\n```\nSo does the parent route in the subdomain:\n```\n\u276f http http://api.localhost:5000/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 6\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:44:06 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\nparent\n```\nBut the child responds with a 404:\n```\n\u276f http http://api.localhost:5000/child/\nHTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 207\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:45:42 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=en>\n<title>404 Not Found</title>\n<h1>Not Found</h1>\n<p>The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.</p>\n```\nIf we change the `subdomain=\"api\"` for `url_prefix=\"/api\"` when registering the blueprint however everything works as expected:\n```\n\u276f http http://localhost:5000/api/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 6\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:46:53 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\nparent\n\u276f http http://localhost:5000/api/child/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 5\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nDate: Tue, 04 Oct 2022 10:46:59 GMT\nServer: Werkzeug/2.2.2 Python/3.10.4\nchild\n```\nThis was surprising to me as I expected the same nesting to apply regardless of whether the parent is mounted using a subdomain or a URL prefix. Am I missing something?\nEnvironment:\n- Python version: 3.10\n- Flask version: 2.2.2\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue regarding nested blueprints not being respected when mounted on subdomains, we need to acquire more context about the implementation of both blueprints and their registration process in the Flask framework. This will involve finding out how Flask handles blueprint registration, especially with subdomains and nested blueprints, as well as how the `app` object interacts with these components. Here are the necessary API calls to gather this context:\n\n- `search_class(\"Flask\")`: Since the `app` object is an instance of the `Flask` class, this search will help us understand if there's anything specific to subdomains or blueprint registration within the class definition.\n  \n- `search_class(\"Blueprint\")`: This search will provide more details on how the `Blueprint` class is structured, which is crucial since the issue revolves around nested blueprints not behaving as expected with subdomains.\n\n- `search_method(\"register_blueprint\")`: Given that the issue occurs during the blueprint registration process, investigating this method will provide insights into how Flask registers blueprints and whether it treats subdomains differently.\n\nThese API calls should provide a thorough context of the parts of Flask that are most relevant to the reported issue, helping us understand if the problem originates from how Flask is designed to handle blueprint nesting with subdomains or if it's an oversight in the current implementation."
