To create a standalone Python script `reproducer.py` that aims to reproduce the issue where `JSONField.bound_data` raises a `TypeError` when data is `None`, and to adhere to the requirements outlined, follow the script below. This script checks for a specific issue in Django's handling of `JSONField` in forms. 

Please note, this script assumes you are using a Django environment. Django needs to be installed and minimally configured to run this script. The provided traceback function is included for detailed error reporting.

```python
# reproducer.py
import django
from django import forms
from django.conf import settings
import sys

# Minimal Django settings required for setup
settings.configure(
    SECRET_KEY='a-very-secret-key',
    INSTALLED_APPS=[
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
    ],
)
django.setup()

# The form with a JSONField
class JSONForm(forms.Form):
    json_field = forms.JSONField(required=False)

# Function to print stacktrace
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        form = JSONForm({})
        assert form.as_p(), "Form rendering failed, expected output but got None"
        print("Issue not reproduced, form rendered successfully.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exiting with code 1, means issue is not reproduced, assertion failed.
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # If we catch an Exception other than AssertionError, it means the error is reproduced.
        print("Issue reproduced successfully.")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exiting with code 0, issue reproduced successfully.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script:

1. Sets up a minimal Django environment needed to define a form and to use `forms.JSONField`.
2. Defines a simple form `JSONForm` containing a `JSONField`.
3. Implements `main` function that attempts to render the form. If the form fails to render because of a `TypeError`, the error is caught, and the traceback is printed using the provided `print_stacktrace` function. This indicates the issue is present.
4. If an `AssertionError` is raised, indicating something other than the targeted issue occurred (e.g., the form rendered as `None`, although this is unexpected in this specific script without further modifications to the form logic), the script will exit with code 1.
5. If no exceptions are raised, we assume the issue has not been reproduced, printing a message to that effect and exiting with code 1.

Remember to have Django installed in your environment to run this script (`pip install django`). This script should be placed in the root directory of the project and executed with Python 3.
