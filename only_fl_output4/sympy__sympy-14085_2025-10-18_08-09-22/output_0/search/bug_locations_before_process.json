        "intended_behavior": "This method should be able to recognize and convert string expressions containing Unicode representations of Greek letters directly into their corresponding SymPy symbols (e.g., convert \"\u03b1\" to Symbol(\"alpha\")). To preserve existing functionality, this enhancement should be made in a way that does not interfere with the current capabilities of handling various input types and should specifically target the handling of string inputs that represent Greek letters. This might involve expanding the method's internal logic to include a lookup or mapping for Greek letters to their symbolic names within SymPy before attempting to parse them as general expressions."

        "intended_behavior": "parse_expr should be enhanced to explicitly account for and correctly interpret Greek letters when converting string expressions into SymPy objects. This functionality could be realized by integrating a preprocessing step or a specialized transformation within the existing list of transformations applied to the input expression. The enhanced behavior should identify Unicode Greek letters and convert them to their equivalent SymPy symbols or ensure that such conversions are effectively handled by subsequently applied transformations. This adjustment should maintain the method's general approach to parsing while adding specific support for Greek letter recognition, thereby supporting the broader range of mathematical expressions users might input."
