To address the request more appropriately and provide a `reproducer.py` file that meets the specified requirements, let's rewrite the script. The goal remains to test if the `sympify` function can correctly parse a Unicode Greek character (α), and properly handle the error scenario if it does not.

The improved version of the script will include a more precise handling of exceptions that match the issue's description and make sure that it exits with the correct code based on whether the issue could be reproduced or not.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import sympify, SympifyError

    try:
        # Attempt to parse a Unicode Greek letter using sympify
        sympify(u"α")
    except SympifyError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Report an AssertionError because the issue is present
        raise AssertionError("SympifyError occurred, indicating the issue is present.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Raise AssertionError for any unexpected errors
        raise AssertionError("An unexpected exception occurred.") from None
    else:
        # If no exceptions are raised, issue is either fixed or not present
        print("Issue cannot be reproduced; sympify(u'α') executed successfully.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e, file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 to indicate the presence of the issue or an error in testing
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0, indicating the absence of the issue
```

This script focuses on the same key aspects as before but is structured to directly address the task's requirements. It tests specifically for the sympify parsing of a Greek character, handles exceptions correctly, and exits with the appropriate status codes based on whether the issue could be reproduced.
