        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. BaseCommand Class\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `BaseCommand` class in Django serves as the foundation for creating custom management commands. It provides a structured way to define commands, including how to add arguments, handle the command logic, and interact with different parts of a Django project.\n  \n- **Relationship with the bug:** \n  The issue is related to the implementation of a management command that inherits from `BaseCommand`. Specifically, the problem arises in how `add_arguments` method is used to add mutually exclusive arguments that target the same destination. This is directly related to `BaseCommand`'s functionality.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n  The intended behavior would be for the `add_arguments` method to correctly handle mutually exclusive arguments such that they can be used interchangeably when invoking the command via `call_command`. Each argument should adequately handle its designated input format.\n\n#### 2. call_command Function\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `call_command` function is a utility provided by Django to programmatically execute management commands. It allows commands to be invoked from within Django applications, not just from the command line, while handling argument parsing and forwarding.\n  \n- **Relationship with the bug:** \n  The issue lies in using `call_command` with commands that have mutually exclusive arguments that target the same `dest`. From the provided code, `call_command` attempts to parse arguments and assign them based on the command's defined parser, but it isn't handling the case described in the issue effectively.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n  When `call_command` is invoked, it should correctly parse and pass arguments to the command, even in cases of mutually exclusive options that use the same `dest`. This entails identifying which of the mutually exclusive options is being used and ensuring its value is correctly parsed and passed without conflict from the other option.\n\n#### 3. parse_time Method\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  The `parse_time` method interprets a string representation of a time (without timezone information) and returns a `datetime.time` object. It either uses `fromisoformat` method for ISO formatted strings or a custom parsing logic for other formats.\n  \n- **Relationship with the bug:** \n  This method is mentioned in the issue as being used to parse one of the mutually exclusive argument options (`--until`). The other function (`parse_duration_to_time`) was not found, which suggests it is likely a custom implementation not part of the Django framework.\n  \n- **Intended behavior:**\n  The `parse_time` method should accurately parse string inputs into `datetime.time` objects when the `--until` option is used. If `call_command` is used to pass a time string, this method should successfully parse it for the command's logic to use.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven that `parse_duration_to_time` was not found in the search, it's likely a custom implementation specific to the application. To resolve the issue, it would be useful to understand how `call_command` can differentiate and correctly use the input for mutually exclusive arguments targeting the same `dest`. Moreover, ensuring that both `parse_time` and the custom `parse_duration_to_time` can be invoked appropriately, based on which argument is passed to `call_command`, is crucial.\n\n**Further Actions:**\n\n- Investigate how `call_command` manages argument parsing for mutually exclusive groups, specifically focusing on error handling and argument replacement in such scenarios.\n- Since `parse_duration_to_time` was not found, making a search for its usage or definition in the project might provide insights into how durations are expected to be converted to times and how this process can be streamlined with `call_command`.\n\nThis comprehensive understanding and approach will aim at modifying `call_command` or the way commands are defined to accommodate the described scenario appropriately."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

The intended modification must ensure that when such arguments are passed to `call_command`, it systematically determines which argument was actually provided by the caller and correctly processes it using the relevant parsing function (e.g., `parse_time` or the custom `parse_duration_to_time`). This involves refining the logic that maps command line arguments to their respective handling functions, especially in scenarios where mutually exclusive arguments may overlap in functionality but diverge in expected input formats. The modification should preserve all existing functionalities of `call_command`, including its ability to process other types of arguments and options, maintaining its general utility for invoking management commands within Django applications.\n\n#### Additional Context Needed:\nAlthough the specific locations for bug fixes have been identified based on the given issue description and the analyzed context, the absence of `parse_duration_to_time` function in the search results suggests that it may be useful to have context about how durations are converted to timestamps within the application. Without modifying the actual method (since it's not found), understanding its implementation or ensuring its presence and correct functionality is crucial for resolving the issue fully. However, without specific details on this function, we focus on adjusting `call_command` to handle the mutually exclusive arguments correctly as outlined."
