        "content": "To address the issue regarding the incorrect view name for CBVs (Class-Based Views) on the technical 404 debug page, we need to gather more context around how views are being identified and reported in the error pages, especially for CBVs. Given the regression commit mentioned, it is likely that the issue pertains to how the system handles the representation of class views in errors. The report indicates that instead of showing a clean class name `view_tests.views.Http404View`, the debug page shows `view_tests.views.<class 'view_tests.views.Http404View'>`.\n\nBased on this information, we need to search for:\n- The representation of views, particularly focusing on how class-based views are handled.\n- The mechanism that generates the \"Raised by:\" information in the technical 404 debug page.\n\nTherefore, appropriate API calls to gather this context would include:\n\n1. Searching for the class `Http404View` to understand its structure and how it might be represented:\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Http404View\")\n```\n\n2. Searching for the code that handles or manipulates the \"Raised by:\" output in error or debug pages, which likely involves string formatting or representation of classes. Given the lack of specific method names related to error handling or debug pages from the issue description, we will target broad code snippets related to \"Raised by:\" and error handling mechanisms:\n```python\nsearch_code(\"Raised by:\")\n```\n\n3. Since the issue specifically mentioned a regression caused by a commit, looking at how CBVs are logged or how their strings are formatted for debug purposes could be useful. This requires understanding how Django or the project converts class references to strings, which might not be directly mentioned, but let's try to find if there is a generic handler for this:\n```python\nsearch_method(\"get_view_name\")\nsearch_code(\"str(class)\")\n```\n\nThese API calls are aimed to cover the handling and representation of class-based views within the project\u2019s error reporting mechanism, focusing on areas that could contribute to the reported issue."

If the view function is associated with a view class (indicating it's a class-based view), it formats the name to include the module and the class name (`__qualname__`, which gives the fully qualified name of the class including any enclosing classes, which is different from and more detailed than just `__name__`). If it's not a class-based view, it simply constructs the name using the module and the function's own name or class name.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n   The reported issue involves the incorrect representation of CBVs (Class-Based Views) names on the technical 404 debug page. Specifically, it's showing the representation including the class keyword (e.g., `<class 'view_tests.views.Http404View'>`) instead of the expected `view_tests.views.Http404View`. The `get_view_name` function is directly involved in formatting class names, making it a key area of interest for addressing the bug. The function appears to have the correct approach for formatting class-based and function-based views, suggesting the issue might not reside here but perhaps in how the debug page utilizes this function or a similar mechanism.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n   The intended behavior of the `get_view_name` function aligns with the expected correct output reported in the issue: presenting a clean, fully qualified name of class-based and function-based views without Python type descriptors like `<class '...'>`. If the debug page or the component that generates the \"Raised by:\" section uses a different method or incorrectly uses this one, it might not format the CBVs' names as intended. \n\nGiven this context and analysis, further actions should involve:\n- Investigating how the debug pages or error reporting mechanism retrieves and uses the view names, focusing on whether `get_view_name` is used or if an alternative mechanism is causing the bug.\n- Since `get_view_name` seems to function as expected for getting a view's name, checking for changes in error handling or debug reporting mechanisms in the regression commit mentioned in the issue might unearth the cause.\n\nFurther API calls could include searching for other code parts that deal with rendering or reporting errors in debug pages or specifically for 404 errors, to see if there's a distinct method or process handling that scenario:\n- Search for code that relates to the handling of 404 debug pages.\n- Search for history or changes related to error handling in the vicinity of the commit mentioned in the issue description, although API calls do not directly support retrieving change history; conceptual thinking on this step involves looking at version control logs or diffs if accessible outside of these API calls."

Given no direct fault found in `get_view_name`, the intended behavior at this location is correct and should not be altered. However, the actual handling of this function's output or a similar process for debug pages might not be utilizing it correctly or undergoing a regression due to changes in code.\n\n  To resolve the issue, a thorough review of how the debug or error reporting system interfaces with getting view names is necessary, especially changes made around the mentioned commit. The intended behavior is for any part of the system that reports class-based views on technical 404 debug pages to use `get_view_name` (or a similarly effective method) correctly, ensuring the view name is displayed as `view_tests.views.Http404View` without the `<class '...'>` descriptor. \n\n  Since the specific file or method responsible for the incorrect display on the debug page wasn't identified through the API calls, a further investigation into how and where debug pages format the \"Raised by:\" section's output is essential for applying a fix. This might involve tracing back from where debug pages are rendered or looking into error handling mechanisms that format error messages, focusing on their integration with `get_view_name` or similar functionalities."
