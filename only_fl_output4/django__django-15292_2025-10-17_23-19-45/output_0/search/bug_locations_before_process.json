        "intended_behavior": "Although `get_view_name` correctly formats class-based and function-based views' names, the issue suggests an integration problem between generating view names and how they are presented in the technical 404 debug pages. Given no direct fault found in `get_view_name`, the intended behavior at this location is correct and should not be altered. However, the actual handling of this function's output or a similar process for debug pages might not be utilizing it correctly or undergoing a regression due to changes in code.\n\nTo resolve the issue, a thorough review of how the debug or error reporting system interfaces with getting view names is necessary, especially changes made around the mentioned commit. The intended behavior is for any part of the system that reports class-based views on technical 404 debug pages to use `get_view_name` (or a similarly effective method) correctly, ensuring the view name is displayed as `view_tests.views.Http404View` without the `<class '...'>` descriptor.\n\nSince the specific file or method responsible for the incorrect display on the debug page wasn't identified through the API calls, a further investigation into how and where debug pages format the \"Raised by:\" section's output is essential for applying a fix. This might involve tracing back from where debug pages are rendered or looking into error handling mechanisms that format error messages, focusing on their integration with `get_view_name` or similar functionalities."
