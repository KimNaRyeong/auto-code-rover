The previous issue outlined seems to relate more to a setup or environmental problem rather than the described issue with `clone` itself. In such a case, ensuring the environment is properly set up and all dependencies, including scikit-learn, are correctly installed is crucial.

To address the original problem—`clone` failing for parameters that are estimator types—a modified version of the `reproducer.py` script is provided below. This version attempts to directly reproduce the reported issue within the constraints described, assuming that the environment and scikit-learn are correctly setup and functioning:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_clone_with_estimator_type():
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    from sklearn.base import clone

    try:
        # Attempt to clone an estimator with a class type parameter instead of instance
        cloned = clone(StandardScaler(with_mean=StandardScaler))
        print("Cloning was successful, indicating that the issue might be fixed.")
        exit(0)  # Exits with code 0 if no exception was raised, indicating potential fix.
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("clone() failed for parameters that are estimator types.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_clone_with_estimator_type()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(1)  # Exits with code 1 if AssertionError was raised, indicating the issue is present.
```

This script tests specifically for the behavior of `clone` when dealing with a parameter that is a type rather than an instance of that type, which is the core issue reported. Running this script in a properly set up environment (where scikit-learn is correctly installed and operational) should trigger the AssertionError if the issue originally described is present. Conversely, it should exit with code 0, indicating no issues detected, if the behavioral anomaly has been addressed in the version of scikit-learn being used.
