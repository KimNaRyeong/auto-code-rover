Based on your requirements, here's a revised standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the reported issue. The script checks if `clone` can handle parameters that are estimator types, i.e., classes rather than instances. It incorporates the exception handling and stack trace printing functionality you've specified:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sklearn.base import clone
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

    try:
        # Attempt cloning with a class as parameter
        clone(StandardScaler(with_mean=StandardScaler))
        # If no error is thrown, we assume it's fixed, which should not happen based on the initial issue description
        print("Issue not present, the `clone` function works as expected.")
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        # If an error is caught, it's expected based on the issue description
        print_stacktrace(e)
        # Asserting here allows the script to exit with 1, signaling the presence of the issue.
        assert False, "clone() failed for parameters that are estimator types."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
```

This script will:
- Try to clone a `StandardScaler` instance but with a parameter set to a class (`StandardScaler` itself) rather than an instance of `StandardScaler`, which according to the initial issue description, causes a failure.
- Catch any exception thrown during the cloning attempt, print a detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function, and then raise an `AssertionError` indicating the specific failure mode (i.e., inability to clone an object with class-type parameters).
- Exit with code 0 if the operation unexpectedly succeeds, suggesting that the issue has been fixed in the installed version of sklearn.
- Execute the `main` function, which encapsulates this logic, allowing for easy extension or modification without altering the script's core flow. 

To use this script:
1. Place it at the root directory of your project.
2. Run it using Python 3 as indicated: `python3 reproducer.py`.
This will provide a clear indication of whether the issue is reproducible with your current setup and scikit-learn version.
