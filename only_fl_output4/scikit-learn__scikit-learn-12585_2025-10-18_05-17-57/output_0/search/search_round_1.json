        "content": "Given the results from the API calls, here\u2019s an analysis and a plan for further steps:\n\n1. **About the `clone` Function:**\n   - The initial search for the `clone` method in `lib/site-packages/sklearn/base.py` did not find the file in the codebase. This could be because of an incorrect file path or library structure change in different versions. The `sklearn.base` module is known to contain core functionality shared across the library, including utility functions like `clone`.\n   - **Intended behavior**: The `clone` function in scikit-learn is designed to construct a new estimator with the same parameters as an existing estimator. This function should ideally handle both estimator instances and classes, where the latter is highlighted as causing issues in the bug report.\n   - **Relationship to the bug**: The problem appears when `clone` tries to work on classes rather than instances, failing to call `get_params` because that method expects an instance (`self`).\n\n2. **About the `get_params` Method:**\n   - The method `get_params` appears in various parts of scikit-learn, indicating it's a widely used and essential part of the estimator interface. It allows for retrieving the parameters of an estimator, crucial for cloning processes among other things.\n   - **Intended behavior**: For any estimator (a classifier, regressor, transformer, or pipeline), `get_params` should return the parameters that were used to create it. This is key to ensure that cloning an estimator precisely copies its configuration.\n   - **Relationship to the bug**: The issue arises because the `clone` function expects an object with the `get_params` method, which is not available in a class type without instantiation.\n\n**Further Steps:**\n\nSince the direct search for `clone` in `base.py` was unsuccessful due to a file path issue, a better approach might be to search for the `clone` method in general or specifically within `base.py` by omitting the path, acknowledging that `sklearn` might have had its directory structure or packaging format changed.\n\nAlso, `get_params` being common across different kinds of estimators suggests that the handling or special casing around classes versus instances should probably be consistent across the library, which highlights the need for carefully considering the proposed code change.\n\n**Next API Calls:**\n\nTo get the necessary context around the `clone` function implementation, it's appropriate to adjust the search:\n\n1. Since the direct file path search failed, let\u2019s try a more general search for the `clone` method in the entire codebase and concentrate on its implementation in `base.py`.\n2. Given the potential impact of changes on how parameters are cloned, especially considering instances versus classes, reviewing implementations of `get_params` in `base.py` might give additional insights into existing assumptions about parameters and instances.\n\n```python\nsearch_method(\"clone\")\nsearch_method_in_file(\"get_params\", \"sklearn/base.py\")\n```"

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

Currently, it fails when trying to clone a class type because it treats every argument as if it were an instance (attempting to call `get_params` directly on it). To resolve the issue, `clone` needs to distinguish between class types and instances. When the argument is a class type (specifically, subclassing an estimator), it should not attempt to call `get_params()` on it directly. Instead, it could pass through class types unchanged or initiate an exception handling process tailored for dealing with class types, thus allowing the flexibility needed to support the use case presented in the issue. This behavior should preserve existing functionality for instance parameters while adding support for class type parameters, ensuring that cloning operations do not fail when encountering an estimator type as a parameter."
