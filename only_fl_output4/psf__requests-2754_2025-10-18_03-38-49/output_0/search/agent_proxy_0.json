Any custom script or configuration files related to redirect handling which might be included in the project. (Although `.htaccess` itself cannot be directly accessed/modified through the Python codebase, any references to Apache configuration or encoding might be relevant).\n2. Search for any code snippets handling or mentioning redirects or character encoding.\n\nGiven the hypothetical limitations and the typical project structure, here are a few demonstrations of API calls which might be useful if the context were different and if such references existed within the codebase:\n\n- `search_code(\"Redirect\")`\n- `search_code(\".htaccess\")`\n- `search_code(\"IDN\")`\n- `search_code(\"character encoding\")`\n\nHowever, it's crucial to acknowledge these calls are speculative and based on the premise of accessing related information within a codebase, which might not apply directly to the given issue that primarily involves server configuration and .htaccess file manipulation."
