Let's analyze the results we obtained:\n\n1. **Search on `entry_points` and `scripts` in the `setup.py`**\n   - **Result Analysis**: The search did not find instances of `entry_points={'console_scripts':` or `scripts=['django/bin/django-admin.py']` within the codebase. This result is unexpected given the issue description, suggesting that the mechanism for installing these scripts or registering entry points might have changed or is implemented differently than directly in a `setup.py` file or not readily searchable with the provided snippets. This lack of findings necessitates a different approach perhaps focusing more directly on how Django's setup and installation scripts/commands are defined or exploring any modern practices Django might use for command line script installation that don't directly rely on the `setup.py` `scripts` or `entry_points` syntax as traditionally expected.\n\n2. **Result of `execute_from_command_line` search**\n   - **Code Functionality**: The `execute_from_command_line` method appears to initialize and execute a `ManagementUtility` object with given arguments (usually command line arguments). This is central to Django's command-line interface, allowing it to process and execute commands.\n   - **Relationship to the Bug**: Both scripts in question (`django-admin` and `django-admin.py`) aim to invoke this method as their primary function, indicating this is the core action Django expects to perform when either script is used. This underlines the redundancy mentioned in the issue - both scripts effectively bootstrap the Django command line environment to perform the same action.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Based on the issue, the intended behavior seems to be minimizing redundancy by consolidating these scripts into a single entry point. Understanding how `execute_from_command_line` operates is crucial because any changes to the script(s) setup should maintain its invocation flow unaltered.\n\nGiven the gaps in our initial query results and the insights from what we did find, it seems that a deeper dive into how `execute_from_command_line` integrates within Django's command-line infrastructure is needed.\n\nAdditional API calls to consider for more context might focus on:\n- The initialization and usage of `ManagementUtility`, since it's instantiated within the `execute_from_command_line` method, indicating its importance in command execution.\n- Searching for any references to `django-admin` and `django-admin.py` within the codebase not limited by their inclusion in `setup.py` scripts or entry points, aiming to understand their creation, maintenance, or invocation in a broader context.\n- Investigating any modern Django documentation or comments within the codebase regarding their setup and installation process for command-line utilities, especially focusing on changes after Django 1.7 where this issue arises.\n\n**Additional API Calls**:\n- `search_class(\"ManagementUtility\")`: To understand the utility class that `execute_from_command_line` method is utilizing.\n- `search_code(\"django-admin\")`: To find broader references or usage of `django-admin` in the codebase.\n- `search_code(\"django-admin.py\")`: Similarly, to find references or usage of `django-admin.py`. \n\nThese calls aim to fill in the knowledge gaps we encountered and provide a comprehensive understanding of the problem and potential solutions surrounding the Django administrative scripts."

This means choosing between `django-admin` and `django-admin.py` for installation through Django's project packaging and installation mechanism. Since modern Python and Django practices favor `entry_points` over direct script installation for better cross-platform support and integration with Python packaging ecosystems, the intended behavior would involve removing the direct script (`django-admin.py`) installation mechanism and relying solely on the `entry_points` configuration to expose `django-admin`. This approach would not only simplify Django's command-line tooling setup but would also align with Python's best practices for package development and distribution.\n\n    - **Rationale**: This consolidation aims to eliminate redundancy and confusion related to having two script entry points (`django-admin` and `django-admin.py`) that serve the identical purpose of initiating Django's command-line interface via the `execute_from_command_line` method. Maintaining one script would streamline the user experience, reduce maintenance overhead for the Django team, and align with modern packaging practices.\n\nGiven the generic details without direct codefile paths or specific lines of code due to the search constraints, this analysis builds on the issue description and known Django practices to dictate where and how the resolution should be approached conceptually.

Both scripts serve the same purpose, which is to allow command execution via Django's `execute_from_command_line` method. Based on the information provided and understanding of Django's command-line setup, here is a conclusive approach to address the reported issue:\n\n### Bug Locations and Resolution Strategy\n\n1. **Direct File or Configuration Changes**: Since our search did not yield specific locations such as `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` which are typical files involved in packaging and defining entry points for Python projects, we rely on the issue description for context. The reallocation for modifications would be in the project's setup configuration, which dictates how executables are defined and installed.\n\n    - **Intended Behavior in Setup Configuration**: To resolve the redundancy, Django's setup configuration should be modified to install only one command-line script, preferably `django-admin`, given its direct use of the `pkg_resources` module which is a more contemporary approach aligning with Python's ecosystem standards. This change involves:\n        - Removing `scripts=['django/bin/django-admin.py']` from the setup configuration if it exists, to stop the manual installation of the `django-admin.py` script.\n        - Ensuring `entry_points` in the setup configuration accurately defines `django-admin` as the sole entry point for Django's command-line interface like:\n            ```python\n            entry_points={\n                'console_scripts': [\n                    'django-admin = django.core.management:execute_from_command_line',\n                ],\n            }\n            ```\n        - This consolidation hinges on the premise that `django-admin.py` and `django-admin` achieve the same end; thus, maintaining just `django-admin` simplifies the interface without losing functionality.\n\n2. **Validation and Compatibility Consideration**: Given Django's broad use, removing `django-admin.py` must be communicated clearly in release notes, and migration guides should be provided for developers to adjust any direct invocations of `django-admin.py` in their development, staging, or production environments.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWithout the ability to directly point to file paths or lines of code, the resolution is framed around the conceptual steps Django's project maintainers can take to streamline Django's command-line tools. This involves adjusting the project's setup configuration to favor a single, standard entry point for command-line operations, enhancing simplicity and maintainability.\n\nThis approach ensures Django aligns with best practices for Python projects, minimizing confusion for developers and maintaining the framework's ease of use. Given Django's extensive documentation and community, ensuring these changes are well-documented and communicated would facilitate a smooth transition."

My responses have been conceptual, aiming to align with the guidance and outcomes you've sought based on the issue provided and the limitations around the search API results.\n\nTo address the issue with **Django installs `/usr/bin/django-admin` and `/usr/bin/django-admin.py`** based on the initial description and my capabilities, here is a synthesized recommendation without invoking new API calls or expecting additional codebase insights:\n\n### Recommended Approach for Django Command-Line Script Consolidation\n\nTo resolve the problem of redundant Django command-line scripts (`django-admin` and `django-admin.py`), the goal would be to streamline Django's setup mechanism to ensure only one preferred script is installed. Given the lack of specific code locations from the search API results, these steps are conceptual yet aim closely at addressing the core issue:\n\n1. **Review and refactor Django's package setup mechanism**:\n   - Identify where Django defines its package installation scripts and entry points, typically within `setup.py` for older versions or migrating towards `pyproject.toml` for newer releases adhering to PEP 517/518 standards.\n   - Since the API searches for `entry_points` and `scripts` in the setup configuration did not return relevant code snippets directly, it's suggested to manually navigate Django's repository or installation scripts for these configurations.\n\n2. **Simplify the command-line interface installation**:\n   - Decide on a single script approach. Given modern Python practices and the details provided, `django-admin` seems the preferable script to retain, mainly because it represents the more modern entry point mechanism via `pkg_resources`.\n   - Adjust Django's project setup configuration to remove the `django-admin.py` script setup, ensuring that `entry_points` properly defines `django-admin` as the sole command-line interface entry.\n   - Such changes would directly involve modifying configuration files responsible for package installation tasks, such as `setup.py` (or specific sections within Django's modern packaging configurations), to streamline the command-line tooling.\n\n3. **Ensure backward compatibility and provide clear migration paths**:\n   - Implement deprecation warnings in upcoming releases before entirely removing `django-admin.py` to guide developers towards the new standard.\n   - Update documentation to reflect the change, highlighting the use of `django-admin` over `django-admin.py`, and offer guidance on migrating scripts or toolchain configurations that directly invoke `django-admin.py`.\n\n4. **Community and Documentation Updates**:\n   - Communicate this change through Django's release notes and developer communications to ensure the community is aware of this shift and understands the rationale behind it.\n   - Offer detailed examples and best practices for using `django-admin`, covering common use cases previously achieved with `django-admin.py`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile unable to specify direct code snippets or file paths due to API search constraints, this approach is designed to conceptually address the redundancy issue with Django's command-line scripts. The focus is on maintaining Django's functionality and developer experience by transitioning to a unified command-line interface setup that aligns with best practices in Python project packaging and distribution."
