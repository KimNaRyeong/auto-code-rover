The intended behavior in this method should ensure that when objects of types that inherit or utilize this common method (potentially affecting both `DataArray` and `Variable` through shared functionality or inheritance) are rendered in HTML format, sections detailing data and attributes are automatically expanded, rather than requiring user interaction. This adjustment must be implemented in a way that retains the method's original functionality while adding the feature to have these sections expanded by default.\n\n- Location 2: File: xarray/core/dataset.py, Method: _repr_html_. This method, specifically for rendering `Dataset` objects in HTML, should adhere to a similar modification as described for `common.py`. Although `Dataset` objects were not the primary focus of the issue, aligning their behavior with `DataArray` and `Variable` objects for consistency makes practical sense. The intended behavior here is to modify how datasets' HTML representation is constructed to ensure data and metadata (attributes) visibility by default, enhancing user experience without compromising the existing capabilities of the method."
