If the execution of the previous script resulted in a `ModuleNotFoundError` due to `matplotlib` not being installed, it implies that there's a need for ensuring the environment in which the script is executed has `matplotlib` available. The issue cannot be reproduced without the necessary dependencies. Assuming you have control over the environment or can ensure `matplotlib` is installed, the script should work as intended.

However, to align with the requirement and incorporate a check or instruction for installing `matplotlib`, I'll modify the script slightly. Please note, automatically installing packages from a script might not be the best practice for all environments, especially in production or sensitive environments. It is generally better to manage dependencies separately through requirements files or environment management tools like `pipenv`, `conda`, etc.

Here's an updated version of `reproducer.py` that includes a mention of ensuring `matplotlib` is installed:

```python
# reproducer.py
def ensure_matplotlib_installed():
    try:
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        return plt
    except ModuleNotFoundError:
        raise ImportError("This script requires matplotlib. Please ensure it's installed in your environment.")

def test_zero_width_figure_saving(plt):
    try:
        plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(3, 0))
        plt.savefig("test.png")
    except RuntimeError as e:
        if "libpng signaled error" in str(e):
            print("Issue detected: Zero-width figure crashes libpng.")
            raise AssertionError("libpng error encountered.") from e
        else:
            raise

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        plt = ensure_matplotlib_installed()
        test_zero_width_figure_saving(plt)
    except ImportError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        exit(1)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    print("No issue detected: The test passed successfully.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note: This version adds a separate function to check whether `matplotlib` is available. If `matplotlib` is not found, it raises an `ImportError` with instructions rather than attempting to automatically install it. This is to avoid complexities with different environments and the administrative permissions that might be required to install packages.

Remember, before running the script, ensure your Python environment has `matplotlib` installed. You can install `matplotlib` using pip:

```sh
pip install matplotlib
```

Or if using conda, use:

```sh
conda install matplotlib
```
