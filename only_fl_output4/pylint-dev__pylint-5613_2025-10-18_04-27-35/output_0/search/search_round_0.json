Therefore, I would invoke the following search APIs with specific arguments:\n\n- `search_method(\"run_pyreverse\")`: This will help us understand how the method `run_pyreverse` is currently designed and called, including any parameters it accepts or global states it relies on (like `sys.argv` in the current problem description).\n- `search_code(\"pyreverse -o png -p\")`: Searching this code snippet will give us context on how command-line arguments for `pyreverse` are currently passed and parsed, which could be crucial for designing a more Pythonic API.\n- `search_method(\"pyreverse\")`: Given the desired solution suggests calling `pylint.pyreverse` directly, this search will help us determine if a method by that name already exists, or if there is a similarly purposed function that can be enhanced or wrapped to achieve the desired API."
