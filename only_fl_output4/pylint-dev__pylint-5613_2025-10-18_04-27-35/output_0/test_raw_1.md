Given the requirement and the specifics of reproducing the issue with `pylint` and `pyreverse`, here's a corrected version for a `reproducer.py` script. This script will attempt to utilize `pylint` in the current cumbersome way to call `pyreverse`. Since the desired solution is not implemented yet in `pylint`, any call to such a function would naturally fail and should thus raise an `AssertionError` indicating the issue's presence. On fixing the issue (i.e., implementing a direct way to call `pyreverse` in the desired manner), the assertion would not be raised, and the script would exit with code 0.

```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    from pylint import epylint as lint
except ImportError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit("Failed to import pylint modules necessary for running pyreverse.")

# Prepare arguments for the current cumbersome approach
name = "MyProject"
files = "example1.py example2.py"  # Assuming files are in the current working directory
pyreverse_cmd = f'pyreverse -o png -p {name} {files}'

# Try the current cumbersome approach
try:
    (pylint_stdout, pylint_stderr) = lint.py_run(pyreverse_cmd, return_std=True)
    output = pylint_stdout.getvalue()
    error = pylint_stderr.getvalue()
    if error:
        raise RuntimeError("Pyreverse encountered an error:\n" + error)
    if "no module named" in output.lower() or "error" in output.lower():
        raise AssertionError("Pyreverse did not execute as expected.")
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)

# Mock a desired solution API call - this will always fail because it doesn't exist
try:
    lint.pyreverse(output=lint.PNG, project=name, files=files.split())
except AttributeError as e:  # AttributeError used as a stand-in for any failure due to the call not existing
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise AssertionError("The desired pyreverse API is not implemented.") from e
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit("Unexpected error while attempting the desired pyreverse API call.")
```

To use this script:
- Ensure `pylint` is installed in your environment. If not, install it using pip: `pip install pylint`.
- Save the script as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of the project.
- Run it using `python3 reproducer.py`.
- The script will attempt to use `pyreverse` with the currently available but cumbersome method, simulate an attempt to call `pyreverse` in a more direct and cleaner way as described in your desired solution (which will fail because such a method does not exist), and handle the errors appropriately.
