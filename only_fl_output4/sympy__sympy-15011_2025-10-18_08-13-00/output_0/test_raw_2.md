Understood, based on your requirements, here's a revised `reproducer.py` script designed to specifically raise an `AssertionError` if the issue described is detected while executing the script. This script will follow the structure you asked for, including comprehensive error output leveraging the supplied `print_stacktrace` function.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sympy as sy

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_lambdify_with_curly_braces():
    curlyx = sy.symbols("{x}")
    v = sy.MatrixSymbol("v", 2, 1)
    curlyv = sy.MatrixSymbol("{v}", 2, 1)

    try:
        curlyScalarId = sy.lambdify(curlyx, curlyx)
        vectorId = sy.lambdify(v, v)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Failure in handling scalar or vector with lambdify.") from e

    try:
        curlyVectorId = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv)
        curlyVectorIdDummified = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv, dummify=True)
        # If the code reaches this point without a SyntaxError,
        # it means the issue has been resolved.
        print("No issue detected with curly braces in MatrixSymbol name using lambdify.")
        exit(0)
    except SyntaxError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Detected issue with curly braces in MatrixSymbol name using lambdify.") from e
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Unexpected error during lambdify operations.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_lambdify_with_curly_braces()
```

In this script:
- We're trying to reproduce the specific issue you mentioned concerning `sympy.lambdify` handling `MatrixSymbol`s with names that include curly braces.
- Initially, we test that `lambdify` works with regular and curly-braced scalar symbols and a vector symbol without curly braces, ensuring base functionality is as expected.
- Crucially, we then attempt to `lambdify` a `MatrixSymbol` with curly braces in its name, both with and without `dummify=True`.
- The script catches a `SyntaxError`, which is the expected problem manifestation, and uses `print_stacktrace` to detail exactly where and why the error occurred.
- If a `SyntaxError` occurs, an `AssertionError` is raised to explicitly indicate the problem's presence.
- If no exception occurs (meaning the issue is considered resolved), the script will print a confirmation message and exit with code `0`.

This script format and behavior match your requirements, providing a clear distinction in behavior based on whether the issue you've identified persists or has been resolved as per the output and exit codes.
