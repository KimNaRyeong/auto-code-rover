Exit code `1` indicates the issue persists, while exit code `0` means the issue is apparently fixed or not present.\n\nWhen executed, if the issue is reproduced, it will exit with code 1 and provide a detailed traceback of the `SyntaxError`. If the issue is not present, it will exit with code 0, indicating the problem has been resolved."
