From the description, we're looking at how the runserver handles HTTP responses, specifically for HEAD requests, and how it previously stripped response bodies to comply with the HTTP specification. Since the issue mentions the change started affecting Django version 1.10 due to modifications made in #26052, we should focus on the server component responsible for generating responses.\n\nGiven this, we should look into:\n1. `WSGIServer` class, because the issue mentions \"Server: WSGIServer/0.2 CPython/3.4.5\" indicating the WSGI server Django uses in development (`runserver`).\n2. How the response is constructed and sent in the context of `runserver`, specifically for HEAD requests, which might be handled in a method related to responding to HTTP requests. Methods that are likely involved are those that generate or handle the response object, including determining the body of the response.\n\nTherefore, the following API calls would be useful to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"WSGIServer\")`: This will help us find where `WSGIServer` is defined, providing an entry point into understanding how Django's development server is implemented.\n2. `search_method(\"handle_request\")`: Since the handling of the request, and ultimately the response, must go through some process of determining the request method, this can provide insight into where the differentiation between GET and HEAD requests occurs, if it does at all within Django's implementation.\n\nThese searches will provide a good starting point for understanding the issue's context and identifying where modifications might be necessary to ensure HEAD requests do not include a response body when handled by Django's `runserver`."

It mentions a few customizations like `request_queue_size`, a constructor `__init__` method that supports IPv6 configuration, and an error handling method.\n   - **Relationship to the bug**: Since the bug is about Django's `runserver` command improperly handling HEAD requests by not stripping the response body, it's possible that the issue might be related to how `WSGIServer` (part of handling incoming requests and responses in Django's development server) does not specifically address or differentiate handling for HEAD requests.\n   - **Intended behavior**: Given the RFC compliance issue, the intended behavior of any server component handling HTTP requests, including the `WSGIServer`, would be to correctly interpret HEAD requests. This means acknowledging that while HEAD requests seek the same headers as GET requests, the response must not contain a body. Adjustments to the server's handling might be needed here to ensure compliance.\n\nGiven the received results and the analysis, it appears that directly searching for `handle_request` didn't yield results, possibly because that's not the specific method name used by Django for this part of the request-response life cycle, or it is handled differently within the codebase. \n\nConsidering the context and next steps:\n- The search for `WSGIServer` confirmed where the server setup for Django's runserver is located, but didn't directly lead to the part of the code responsible for handling HEAD requests.\n  \nTo get more context or locate the specific handling of HEAD requests which might be managed at a higher-level response generation or within a middleware-like framework in Django, additional searches are necessary. Given the structure of WSGI applications, responses are often handled in a view or middleware. However, since `runserver` is a development server with potentially different handling logic, we might need to consider looking for:\n- Any specific method or class that handles the creation or assembly of HTTP responses in `django/core/servers/basehttp.py`.\n- Additionally, exploring if Django employs any middleware or overridden methods responsible for managing the response lifecycle specifically for HEAD requests.\n\nTherefore, more targeted searches might include looking for methods related to response handling in the identified file (`django/core/servers/basehttp.py`) or general handling of HEAD requests across the Django application. This includes:\n- Searching for methods that involve response handling in `django/core/servers/basehttp.py`.\n- Exploring if there's a more appropriate method name related to request handling, such as methods that override or extend lower-level WSGI handling functionalities, specific to `WSGIServer` or the base HTTP server functionality in Django."

This method ensures that the connection stays open to handle one request after the other until it's explicitly closed. After processing requests (via the `handle_one_request` method multiple times if necessary), it attempts to cleanly shutdown the connection.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   Although the `handle` method itself directly deals with connection management rather than HTTP method specifics, the invocation of `handle_one_request()` suggests that this is where requests are individually processed. The bug related to not stripping the body from HEAD requests could stem from how `handle_one_request` (and the processes it invokes) interprets and responds to different HTTP methods. Since the issue concerns the HTTP HEAD method specifically not behaving as expected by not stripping the response body, the logical focus should be on how requests are handled and how the response is constructed within or after the `handle_one_request` method.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   To resolve the issue, the intended behavior in the request handling flow should explicitly recognize HEAD requests and ensure that the response, while including all headers as if it were a GET request, does not include a body. This might necessitate either adjusting the `handle_one_request` method's processing logic to identify HEAD requests and modify the response accordingly or introducing a conditional check post-request processing but before the response is sent back to the client. The fix needs to ensure that it is compliant with RFC 2616, section 4.3, by not including a response body for HEAD requests, thus possibly avoiding the \"Broken pipe\" errors and ensuring correct behavior of the `runserver`.\n\nGiven this analysis, although the `handle` method provides context on connection management, it underscores where further investigation is needed, specifically around how `handle_one_request` interprets different HTTP methods and constructs responses. The direct involvement of this method with the bug may be limited, but understanding its role in the request-response lifecycle is crucial for pinpointing where the specific handling (or mishandling) of HEAD requests occurs. Thus, while `handle` gives an overview of request processing, the detailed mechanics of method-specific response construction remain to be clarified, likely within the `handle_one_request` method or within the components/methods it delegates to for constructing and finalizing responses."
