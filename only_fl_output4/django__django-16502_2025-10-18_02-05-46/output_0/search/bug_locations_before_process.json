        "intended_behavior": "Within the handle_one_request method of the WSGIRequestHandler class, after the request has been successfully parsed and before the response is sent back to the client, introduce logic to check if the request is a HEAD request. If it is, ensure the response body is excluded from the final response sent to the client. This could potentially involve adjusting the behavior of ServerHandler.run(self.server.get_app()) or another downstream component of the response generation process, ensuring that while headers and status codes appropriate for the equivalent GET request are generated and sent, the body is omitted in compliance with HTTP specifications for HEAD requests.\n\nThis adjustment must allow WSGIRequestHandler to continue handling all other aspects of requests and responses as currently implemented, ensuring that the added logic for HEAD requests does not interfere with or alter the handling of any other HTTP method types, maintaining the existing functionality and performance characteristics of Django's development server."
