To accurately reproduce the issue and follow your request, we'll revise the `reproducer.py` script to more reliably start the Django server and send a HEAD request. This version will ensure a Django app is dynamically created and run, circumventing potential issues with project paths or server startup that were encountered previously.

The revised script will:
1. Dynamically create a Django project and app to ensure the script's independence from any existing project.
2. Use `threading` to run the Django server in the background to avoid blocking the main thread.
3. Perform a HEAD request to the server and check for the presence of a response body.
4. Utilize the provided `print_stacktrace` function for clear error reporting.

Please note, for a complete standalone script that includes creating a new Django project, we have to ensure that Django is installed in your environment. If Django is not yet installed, please run `pip install Django`.

```python
import os
import subprocess
import threading
import time
import requests
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Function to run Django server in background thread
def run_django_server():
    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'test_project.settings')
    from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
    execute_from_command_line(['manage.py', 'runserver', '127.0.0.1:8000'])

# Creating a new Django project
project_name = 'test_project'
if not os.path.exists(project_name):
    subprocess.call(['django-admin', 'startproject', project_name])

# Change working directory to the project directory
os.chdir(project_name)

# Running Django server in a separate thread
threading.Thread(target=run_django_server).start()

time.sleep(5)  # wait a bit for server to start

# Function to send HEAD request and check for response body
def test_head_request():
    try:
        response = requests.head('http://127.0.0.1:8000/')
        if response.content:
            raise AssertionError("Response body should be empty for HEAD requests.")
        else:
            print("No response body for HEAD request. The issue is fixed.")
            sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)

test_head_request()
```

Save this script as `reproducer.py` in an empty directory and execute it with `python3 reproducer.py`. This script will attempt to dynamically reproduce the issue under investigation. If the issue exists (i.e., the server returns a response body for HEAD requests when it shouldn't), the script will print an error trace as per your request. If the issue is fixed (no response body for HEAD requests), it will exit with code 0.
