This might shed light on practices or utility functions that are relevant to the issue.\n\n2. **Custom wrappers or utilities around assertions or pytest functionalities:** Since direct references to `pytest.raises` weren't found, it's possible that the project uses wrappers or utility functions that internally use pytest functionalities, including exception handling and assertions.\n\nThus, the next steps in our investigation could involve:\n\n- **Looking for any encoding or decoding functions:** Since encoding issues are at the heart of the matter, finding utility functions that handle encoding might provide insights.\n  \n- **Searching for custom assertion functions or exception handling utilities:** These might abstract away the direct usage of `pytest.raises` and might be where the issue needs fixing.\n\nTherefore, the following API calls could be helpful:\n\n- `search_code('encode')`: To find any explicit encoding operations that might give insights into how Unicode strings are customarily handled.\n- `search_code('decode')`: Similarly, to see if there's any manual decoding that could interact poorly with Python 2's default ASCII encoding.\n- `search_code('assert ')`: Since the issue is related to asserting with a Unicode match, looking for custom assertion patterns might be useful.\n- `search_code('with pytest.raises')`: While we didn't find `pytest.raises` directly, searching for its usage context might still offer clues, especially in wrapped or utility functions.\n\nThese calls are aimed at circling around the problem area from different angles, hopefully shedding light on the code patterns and practices that led to the reported issue."

        "content": "The collected context provides several insights into the issue and potential areas that might contribute to the resolution of the Unicode matching assertion problem described. Given the snippets and their location, we can infer a few things:\n\n### Encoding and Decoding Operations\n\n1. **What they do:** Encoding and decoding operations (`encode` and `decode`) are crucial for converting between different formats. In Python 2, it's particularly important for handling Unicode strings since it differentiates between Unicode strings and byte strings, unlike Python 3 which treats all strings as Unicode by default. These operations are used across the codebase to ensure that strings are in the correct format for various operations, such as file IO, network communication, and more.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:** The bug occurs because a Unicode character (`u\"\\u2603\"`) is not correctly handled, leading to a `UnicodeEncodeError`. This suggests there might be an issue with how the project's testing utilities or assertion mechanisms deal with encoding, especially in the context of exception messages or assertion failure messages.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:** Ideally, the code should handle Unicode characters gracefully, especially when used in assertions or error messages. This might involve ensuring that strings are encoded or decoded appropriately at the boundaries where Python 2 expects a specific string type. This could be missing or mishandled currently, leading to the described bug.\n\n### Usage of `assert` Statements\n\n1. **What they do:** The assert statements are used extensively across the test suite to verify that the code behaves as expected. In the context of test cases, these assertions check if the conditions are true; if not, an AssertionError is thrown.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:** Given the widespread use of assertions and the error occurring in an `assert` statement with a Unicode match parameter, it suggests that the handling of assertion messages (especially those containing Unicode characters) might be where the issue lies.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:** The assertion mechanism should be capable of handling Unicode characters in assertion messages without raising encoding errors. This might involve fixing how these messages are constructed, encoded, or logged.\n\n### Usage of Pytest `raises` Context\n\n1. **What they do:** The `with pytest.raises` snippets are used to ensure that a block of code raises a specific exception. It's a common pattern in testing exceptions handling mechanisms in the code being tested.\n\n2. **Relationship with the bug:** The use of `with pytest.raises` in conjunction with Unicode assertion messages suggests that the interaction between pytest's exception capturing and Unicode messages might be improperly handled, specifically under Python 2's encoding rules.\n\n3. **Intended behavior:** When using `pytest.raises` in tests, it should be able to handle Unicode characters in the exception message without causing encoding issues. This involves ensuring that the pytest framework or the custom wrapper handling pytest functionality in the project properly encodes or decodes messages as needed.\n\nGiven this analysis, to resolve the issue, we need to ensure that any custom utility functions, assertion mechanisms, or exception handling code deals correctly with Unicode strings, especially under Python 2's stricter requirements. This might involve adjusting encoding/decoding strategies, using the `from __future__ import unicode_literals` to make string literals Unicode by default, or ensuring that the pytest framework's `match` argument in the `raises` context manager handles Unicode patterns appropriately.\n\nThe specific bug locations are likely to be found within custom assertion utilities, the pytest configuration or customization layers (`testing/python/raises.py`, `src/_pytest/pytester.py`, or similar files), or any encoding/decoding utilities (`src/_pytest/compat.py`). The intended behavior involves modifying these areas to ensure Unicode characters are correctly handled, preserving existing functionality while preventing `UnicodeEncodeError` when Unicode strings are used in assertion or exception messages."

Here's a concise identification based on the gathered insights:\n\n### Bug Locations and Intended Behaviors:\n\n1. **File:** `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`\n   - **Class/Method:** This file likely contains logic related to rewriting assert statements for better error reporting in pytest. The exact class and method can't be pinpointed without specific code excerpts but look for methods involved in handling the format or output of assertion errors.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Ensure that methods dealing with assertion errors properly handle Unicode characters, possibly by making sure encoding conversions are handled correctly under Python 2. This may involve explicitly encoding Unicode strings to UTF-8 (or another appropriate encoding) before they are processed or outputted.\n\n2. **File:** `src/_pytest/compat.py`\n   - **Class/Method:** Given its role in compatibility across Python versions, this module may contain utility functions that deal with encoding issues or provide a bridge for Unicode handling between Python 2 and 3.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Verify and, if necessary, adjust the encoding and decoding utilities to ensure they gracefully handle Unicode strings, especially in the context of assertions and exceptions. For example, utility functions could be designed to encode Unicode strings to a specific encoding only when running under Python 2, using `sys.version_info` checks.\n\n3. **File:** `testing/python/raises.py`\n   - **Class/Method:** This file likely contains pytest tests that specifically focus on testing exception raising (`with pytest.raises`). Although the issue isn't with `pytest.raises` itself but with how assertions and Unicode strings interact within such blocks under Python 2, this file could be a source of practical examples or tests that need adjustment.\n   - **Intended Behavior:** Ensure any test cases that use `pytest.raises` with Unicode strings are correctly designed to handle or expect Unicode characters without causing encoding errors. If this file contains custom utility functions or helpers around `pytest.raises`, verify these helpers manage Unicode strings properly under Python 2.\n\nTo resolve the issue, a comprehensive approach involving reviewing and possibly refactoring how Unicode strings are handled in these contexts is required. The goal is to preserve the existing functionality while eliminating the `UnicodeEncodeError` when assertions with Unicode messages are evaluated. The resolution might involve small, targeted patches across several locations, particularly focusing on consistent and correct Unicode handling, rather than a single, large change in one location.\n"
