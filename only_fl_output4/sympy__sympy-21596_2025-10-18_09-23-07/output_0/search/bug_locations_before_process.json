        "intended_behavior": "This method should ensure that intersections between an ImageSet producing complex numbers and Reals are accurately calculated, excluding any non-real numbers from the results. This may require implementing a check within the intersection logic to explicitly determine if a given element from an ImageSet is real before including it in the result set when intersecting with Reals. Enhancing the logic to understand and simplify complex expressions better, to accurately determine their real-number status in an intersection scenario."
