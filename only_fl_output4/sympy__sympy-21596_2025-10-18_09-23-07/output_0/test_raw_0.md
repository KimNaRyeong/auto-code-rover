Below is the standalone python file `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the described issue. This script will check the bug related to the `is_subset(Reals)` method and the intersection with the `Reals` set. It raises an `AssertionError` if the bug is present, using the provided `print_stacktrace` function to print a detailed stack trace of where the error occurs. Conversely, it will exit with code 0 when the issue is corrected, indicating no error.

```python
from sympy import symbols, I, Lambda, imageset, S
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback    
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    # Define the set S1 where each element is defined by n + i*(n-1)*(n+1) for each n in integers
    n = symbols('n')
    S1 = imageset(Lambda(n, n + (n - 1)*(n + 1)*I), S.Integers)

    # Check whether 2 is an element of S1
    assert 2 not in S1, "2 should not be in S1"

    # Check whether 2 is in the intersection of S1 with reals; it should not
    assert not (2 in S1.intersect(S.Reals)), "2 should not be in the intersection of S1 with Reals"

    # Check if the intersection of S1 and Reals is as expected {-1, 1}
    expected = {-1, 1}
    result = S1.intersect(S.Reals)
    assert set(result) == expected, f"Expected {expected} but got {result}"

def main():
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code 1 to indicate the bug is present
    print("No issues detected.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script leverages the `sympy` library to define the set `S1` and then performs checks to see if `2` is incorrectly considered an element of `S1` or its intersection with `Reals`. The `AssertionError` will be raised with a corresponding message if the logic does not work as expected. Make sure `sympy` is installed in your environment before running this script.
