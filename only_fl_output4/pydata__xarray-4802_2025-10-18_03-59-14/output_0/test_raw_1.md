Based on your request to adapt the task to a correct format after identifying previous confusion, I'll rewrite the script to adhere strictly to your specifications. This time, it will include the requested `print_stacktrace` function correctly. Please note, this script assumes the version of `xarray` where this issue exists is installed in the environment where the script is run.

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    ds = xr.DataArray([0, 1, 2], name='foo',
                      attrs={'scale_factor': [0.01],
                             'add_offset': [1.0]}).to_dataset()
    xr.decode_cf(ds)
    print("Issue not present, exited with code 0")
    sys.exit(0)  # Indicate success/no issue.
except Exception as e:  # Catching the broader exception to ensure any unexpected error is caught.
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Indicate failure/issue present.
```

This script aims to directly reproduce the specific issue previously described, where `xr.decode_cf()` fails due to `scale_factor` and `add_offset` being length-1 lists rather than numpy arrays or scalars. It tries to execute the operation that results in the `AttributeError` relating to the `.item()` method not found on a list, printing a meaningful stack trace if the error occurs.

If this script is executed in an environment where the issue is present, it will reproduce the error and exit with code 1, identifying the issue. Conversely, if the issue is fixed, the script should execute successfully and exit with code 0.
