To get an idea about how LaTeX equations are currently embedded in the documentation, I'll try to find instances where LaTeX is used within code comments or docstrings. This requires a broad search since the specific files or classes where LaTeX is most frequently mentioned aren't specified.\n   - `search_code(\"LaTeX\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a substantial amount of context required to proceed with the implementation of the rewrite method for Catalan and to evaluate the feasibility and necessary steps for dynamically generating LaTeX equations in the documentation."
