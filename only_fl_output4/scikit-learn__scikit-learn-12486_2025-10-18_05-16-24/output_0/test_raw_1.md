Given the requirements and to address the initially reported error accurately, below is an updated version of the `reproducer.py` script. This version is more cautious about potential errors and includes the suggested function to print stack traces for any exceptions encountered. It attempts to directly address the `IndexError` as noted in the provided example, ensuring an `AssertionError` is raised if the issue manifests, indicative of a problem, and exits gracefully with code 0 if resolved.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
    from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture  # Assuming GaussianMixture as the closest alternative to deprecated GMM.
    import sys

    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_features=10, n_classes=2)

    gm_model = GaussianMixture()  # Updated from GMM to GaussianMixture

    param_grid = {
        'n_components': [1, 2, 3, 4],
        'covariance_type': ['tied', 'full', 'spherical']
    }

    grid_search = GridSearchCV(gm_model, param_grid, scoring='roc_auc')

    try:
        grid_search.fit(X, y)
    except IndexError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.") from e
    except Exception as e:  # Additional catch for any unexpected exception types.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with an error code for unexpected exceptions.

    print("The issue is fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script checks for the specific `IndexError` involved in the issue and uses an explicit exception handling strategy to provide clear outcomes depending on whether the error is encountered. The approach also includes a generic exception handler to ensure that any unexpected errors still result in a clear, concise output, along with a stack trace for debugging purposes.
