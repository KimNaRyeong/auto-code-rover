        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the API calls:\n\n1. **TemplateView Class in `django/views/generic/base.py`**: \n   - **What it does**: This part of the code signifies that `TemplateView` is indeed a part of Django's generic views, intended to display a template. It inherits from `TemplateResponseMixin`, `ContextMixin`, and `View`, providing the functionality to render a template and pass context data to it. The method `get` is defined, which handles GET requests to the view.\n   - **Relationship to the bug**: Since `OfferView` is described as a subclass of `TemplateView`, understanding how `TemplateView` operates is crucial. The issue arises when overriding the `get_context_data` method, which is not explicitly mentioned in the snippet but is a key method involved in preparing context data for the template. `get_context_data` typically comes from `ContextMixin`, suggesting that any issue involving passing context likely intersects with this or derived methods.\n   - **Intended behavior**: The intended behavior would be for `TemplateView` (and thus, `OfferView`) to seamlessly accept keyword arguments (kwargs) passed via the URL and apply them appropriately in the context data. In particular, the `offer_slug` should be correctly retrieved and used to filter database queries or other operations without causing type errors.\n\nGiven these insights and the fact that no explicit mentions or implementations of `OfferView`, `get_context_data`, or the specific error message were found in the codebase through the searches, the bug seems related to how subclassing `TemplateView` and overriding `get_context_data` work together in a version upgrade scenario.\n\nSince `OfferView` and its method implementations were not found, this might suggest that the code examples provided in the issue submission are possibly not indexed correctly, or there's an inconsistency in naming or paths within the project structure not captured by the search terms used.\n\nGiven these considerations, next steps to gather more context could involve:\n\n- Broadening the search for `OfferView` perhaps by looking into the file system structure if the class is defined outside the conventional locations. Since direct searches failed, consider looking into specific directories where view classes are expected to be defined.\n- Investigating how `ContextMixin` and its `get_context_data` method work, since this is a likely place where the bug manifests. It's possible the issue is with how `kwargs` are handled in this method when overridden.\n- Re-attempting to search for the error message using a broader or more generic query, in case the specific text given was not indexed or is part of a longer traceback not captured fully by the initial search.\n- Since the URL configuration could not be located directly with the provided search, consider searching for any files named `urls.py` or similar, as these files typically contain URL-to-view mappings.\n\nFuture API calls could include:\n- Searching for files named `urls.py` to find URL configurations.\n- Searching for `ContextMixin` to analyze the `get_context_data` method's implementation or any overrides in the codebase.\n- Broadening the search for error messages related to parameter binding in SQLite to capture related issues, even if not exactly matching the initially provided error text."

However, based on the issue description and the understanding of Django's class-based views, we can infer a probable location and describe the intended behavior to resolve the issue.\n\n   **Probable Bug Location and Intended Behavior:**\n\n   - **File:** Since the actual file where `OfferView` resides wasn't identified through search results, we assume it's in a file that defines custom views, possibly named something like `views.py` or within a module specific to the \"offers\" feature within the project.\n     - **Class:** `OfferView`\n     - **Method:** `get_context_data`\n   - **Intended Behavior:** The method `get_context_data` should ensure that all keyword arguments (`kwargs`) used for database queries or other operations that expect string types are explicitly cast to strings before use. This adaptation is necessary to accommodate changes in Django 3.1 where `kwargs` may contain `SimpleLazyObject` instances, which are not directly compatible with database operations expecting string inputs. The code modification in the issue description demonstrates this fix by explicitly converting `offer_slug` to a string before passing it to `get_object_or_404()`. This behavior preserves existing functionality by ensuring compatibility with Django's lazy objects and preventing type errors during database operations.\n   \n   Though the exact file and location within the codebase were not identified due to the constraints of the search results provided, the described intended behavior offers a guideline for resolving the issue based on the understanding of Django's handling of lazy objects in version upgrades and the described error scenario."
