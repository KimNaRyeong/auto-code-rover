        "intended_behavior": "The method `get_context_data` should ensure that all keyword arguments (`kwargs`) used for database queries or other operations that expect string types are explicitly cast to strings before use. This adaptation is necessary to accommodate changes in Django 3.1 where `kwargs` may contain `SimpleLazyObject` instances, which are not directly compatible with database operations expecting string inputs. The code modification in the issue description demonstrates this fix by explicitly converting `offer_slug` to a string before passing it to `get_object_or_404()`. This behavior preserves existing functionality by ensuring compatibility with Django's lazy objects and preventing type errors during database operations."
