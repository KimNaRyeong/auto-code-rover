Below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py`. This script aims to reproduce the reported issue regarding the usage of `SimpleLazyObject` instances leading to crashes when used in Django views, specifically after a version change that affects the handling of `kwargs` in `get_context_data()`.

Please note, this example assumes a minimal Django setup around it, including a Django project and an application containing a model named `Account` with at least one field named `slug`. This setup is not defined in the script due to the focus on replicating the specific issue with `SimpleLazyObject`.

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "project.settings")

import django
django.setup()

from django.test import Client, TestCase
from django.urls import path, include
from django.views.generic.base import TemplateView
from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404
from django.apps import apps

# Assuming an app named 'app' and model 'Account'
Account = apps.get_model('app', 'Account')


def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)


class OfferView(TemplateView):
    template_name = "offers/offer.html"

    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        offer_slug = kwargs.get("offer_slug", "")
        try:
            offer = get_object_or_404(Account, slug=offer_slug)
            return {"offer": offer, "offer_slug": offer_slug}
        except Exception as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise


urlpatterns = [
    path("/offers/<slug:offer_slug>/", OfferView.as_view(), name="offer_view"),
]


class ReproduceTestCase(TestCase):
    def test_issue_reproduction(self):
        client = Client()
        response = client.get("/offers/some-slug/")
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 404)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    from django.core.management import call_command
    from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application

    application = get_wsgi_application()
    call_command("test", "reproducer.ReproduceTestCase")
```

### Instructions for Preparation
1. Ensure you have a Django project setup with settings correctly pointing to a database and an app where the `Account` model exists.
2. Add `"app"` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting inside your project's `settings.py`.
3. Include the `urlpatterns` from the above script into your project's URL configuration.
4. Ensure the Django environment is correctly setup and the database is migrated with the `Account` model defined.

This script utilizes Django's testing framework to simulate a request to a view that should cause the described error when an issue exists, leveraging `get_object_or_404` without converting `SimpleLazyObject` to a string explicitly in the view.

**Note**: Actual implementation details like Django project configuration (`project.settings`), the presence of the `Account` model, and template files are not defined in this script and need to be configured in your Django project setup for this script to run successfully.
