To write an effective standalone `reproducer.py` that closely simulates the described Django context, captures the specific issue, and fits your requirements, we'll create a script that doesn't depend on an external Django project setup. It will mock the necessary parts to reproduce the issue regarding `SimpleLazyObject` from Django's lazy objects utility when passed as `kwargs` in `get_context_data()`. 

This script will mock a Django view and Django model handling to focus on reproducing and catching the `TypeError` caused by passing a `SimpleLazyObject` to a database query.

```python
# reproducerer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class SimpleLazyObject:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.__dict__['_setupfunc'] = func

    def _setup(self):
        self.__dict__['_wrapped'] = self._setupfunc()

    def __getattr__(self, name):
        if '_wrapped' not in self.__dict__:
            self._setup()
        return getattr(self._wrapped, name)

def get_object_or_404(klass, **kwargs):
    # Mocking a queryset filter method to replicate the error
    if not kwargs:
        raise Exception("This is a mock - Object does not exist.")
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        # Simulate the TypeError from the database backend when a wrong type is supplied
        if isinstance(value, SimpleLazyObject):
            raise TypeError("Error binding parameter 0 - probably unsupported type")
    return "Mocked object"

def resolve_simple_lazy_object(obj):
    if isinstance(obj, SimpleLazyObject):
        return obj._setupfunc()
    return obj

class OfferView:
    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        offer_slug = kwargs.get("offer_slug", SimpleLazyObject(lambda: "default-slug"))
        try:
            # Before fix: offer = get_object_or_404(Account, slug=offer_slug)
            # After fix
            offer_slug_resolved = resolve_simple_lazy_object(offer_slug)
            offer = get_object_or_404(Account, slug=offer_slug_resolved)
            return {"offer": offer, "offer_slug": offer_slug_resolved}
        except Exception as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise

# Mock setup
Account = type('Account', (), {})
offer_view = OfferView()

try:
    context_data = offer_view.get_context_data(offer_slug=SimpleLazyObject(lambda: "test-slug"))
    assert context_data['offer_slug'] == "test-slug", "Issue is present!"
    print("Issue fixed or the error did not occur.")
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 to indicate the test should fail if the issue is present.
except Exception as e:
    sys.exit(1)  # Non-AssertionError indicates an unexpected failure.
```

This script:
- Mocks minimal Django functionality relevant to the issue, notably `SimpleLazyObject` and the `get_object_or_404` utility function.
- It uses a mocked `OfferView.get_context_data` method to simulate passing a `SimpleLazyObject` as an argument, following the pattern that leads to the crash described.
- Implements a mock resolution function `resolve_simple_lazy_object()` to replicate the proposed solution.
- Raises an `AssertionError` if the issue is present, and prints a detailed stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function.
- Exits with code `0` when the issue can be reproduced (indicating the reproduction is successful or the issue is fixed). 

Please adapt the script to align with the specifics of your Django environment or mock structure as necessary.
