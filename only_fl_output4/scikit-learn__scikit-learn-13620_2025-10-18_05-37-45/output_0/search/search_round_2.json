        "content": "<issue>Bug in Gradient Boosting: Feature Importances do not sum to 1\n#### Description\nI found conditions when Feature Importance values do not add up to 1 in ensemble tree methods, like Gradient Boosting Trees or AdaBoost Trees.\nThis error occurs once the ensemble reaches a large number of estimators.  The exact conditions depend variously.  For example, the error shows up sooner with a smaller amount of training samples.  Or, if the depth of the tree is large.\nWhen this error appears, the predicted value seems to have converged.  But it\u2019s unclear if the error is causing the predicted value not to change with more estimators.  In fact, the feature importance sum goes lower and lower with more estimators thereafter.\nConsequently, it's questionable if the tree ensemble code is functioning as expected.\nHere's sample code to reproduce this:\n``` python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import datasets\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor\nboston = datasets.load_boston()\nX, Y = (boston.data, boston.target)\nn_estimators = 720\n# Note: From 712 onwards, the feature importance sum is less than 1\nparams = {'n_estimators': n_estimators, 'max_depth': 6, 'learning_rate': 0.1}\nclf = GradientBoostingRegressor(**params)\nclf.fit(X, Y)\nfeature_importance_sum = np.sum(clf.feature_importances_)\nprint(\"At n_estimators = %i, feature importance sum = %f\" % (n_estimators , feature_importance_sum))\n```\n_Output:_\n```\nAt n_estimators = 720, feature importance sum = 0.987500\n```\nIn fact, if we examine the tree at each staged prediction, we'll see that the feature importance goes to 0 after we hit a certain number of estimators.  (For the code above, it's 712.)\nHere's code to describe what I mean:\n``` python\nfor i, tree in enumerate(clf.estimators_):\nfeature_importance_sum = np.sum(tree[0].feature_importances_)\nprint(\"At n_estimators = %i, feature importance sum = %f\" % (i , feature_importance_sum))\n```\n_Output:_\n```\n...\nAt n_estimators = 707, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 708, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 709, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 710, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 711, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 712, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 713, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 714, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 715, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 716, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 717, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 718, feature importance sum = 0.000000\n...\n```\nI wonder if we\u2019re hitting some floating point calculation error.\nBTW, I've posted this issue on the mailing list [Link](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/scikit-learn/2016-September/000508.html).  There aren't a lot of discussion, but others seem to think there's a bug here too.\nHope we can get this fixed or clarified.\nThank you!\n-Doug\n#### Versions\nWindows-7;'Python', '2.7.9 ;'NumPy', '1.9.2';'SciPy', '0.15.1';'Scikit-Learn', '0.16.1'\n</issue>"

This class inherits from `BaseGradientBoosting` and `RegressorMixin`, but our initial query did not return details about the implementation of the `BaseGradientBoosting`. Given this, it's important to remember that `GradientBoostingRegressor` likely relies heavily on its base class for much of its functionality, including the aggregation of estimators and calculation of feature importances.\n   - **Relationship to Bug**: Since we're investigating an issue with feature importance sums in gradient boosting, understanding how `GradientBoostingRegressor` is structured and operates is crucial. The absence of direct information about `feature_importances_` suggests that feature importances are probably handled by the superclass or through a mechanism not directly exposed/overridden in `GradientBoostingRegressor`.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Ideally, this class would manage an ensemble of decision trees to predict outcomes and calculate feature importances that accurately reflect the contribution of each feature towards the prediction. The sum of all feature importances should logically equal 1, indicating that all feature contributions are accounted for.\n\n2. **DecisionTreeRegressor**:\n   - The `DecisionTreeRegressor` in `sklearn/tree/tree.py` offers insight into the possible base estimator used within `GradientBoostingRegressor`. With parameters controlling the tree's growth and methods for fitting to data, it forms the building block for the ensemble model.\n   - **Relationship to Bug**: Each tree in the `GradientBoostingRegressor` contributes to the overall feature importance calculation. An anomaly with how individual trees calculate or contribute to the overall feature importances might lead to the observed issue. The variation in importance sums with the number of estimators suggests that there could be a cumulative error or a specific condition under which tree contributions are miscomputed or misaggregated.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: A `DecisionTreeRegressor` should calculate its feature importances in a way that when aggregated across all trees in the ensemble, the total sum of importances equals 1. This indicates that each feature\u2019s importance is considered proportionally to its impact on improving the prediction accuracy.\n\nGiven the lack of direct results for `feature_importances_` and `estimators_` in `GradientBoostingRegressor`, and the understanding that these functionalities are likely inherited or composed rather than directly implemented in `GradientBoostingRegressor`, we should investigate the superclass (`BaseGradientBoosting`) or related utility functions handling feature importance calculations and estimator aggregations.\n\nFurther steps and API calls to consider:\n- Investigate `BaseGradientBoosting` for implementation details that might affect feature importance calculation.\n  - `search_class(\"BaseGradientBoosting\")`\n- Explore how `feature_importances_` are aggregated or derived across the ensemble in the base class or related modules considering how Gradient Boosting typically relies on multiple decision trees.\n  - `search_method(\"feature_importances_\")` to find where and how `feature_importances_` might be implemented or calculated across the codebase, given it wasn't found directly within `GradientBoostingRegressor`.\n- Since direct lookup for `estimators_` in `GradientBoostingRegressor` didn't yield results, it's possible this attribute is managed by the base class or through a method rather than a direct attribute access.\n  - `search_method(\"estimators_\")` to understand how the ensemble of trees is accessed and used.\n\nThese steps would ideally provide deeper insight into the internal workings related to the issue with feature importance calculation."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context:\n\n1. **BaseGradientBoosting** in `sklearn/ensemble/gradient_boosting.py`:\n   - The `BaseGradientBoosting` class serves as a foundational class for gradient boosting models. It defines common functionalities for different gradient boosting variations, such as gradient boosting regressors and classifiers. The methods within this class handle the fitting process of the model, stages of prediction, and initialization of the model's state.\n   - **Relationship to the Bug**: Since `GradientBoostingRegressor` inherits from `BaseGradientBoosting`, any implementation details regarding how feature importances are aggregated or calculated across the ensemble are likely to be found here. Specifically, the `feature_importances_` property in this class would be crucial for understanding how feature importance sums might deviate from expected behavior (i.e., their sum being 1.0).\n   - **Intended Behavior**: The intended behavior of the `feature_importances_` method should ensure that the feature importances calculated from individual trees are correctly aggregated to sum to 1, accounting for all features\u2019 contributions to the model. This might involve normalizing these values correctly across all ensemble components, especially as the number of estimators grows.\n\n2. **Method `feature_importances_` Across Various Files**:\n   - The method `feature_importances_` is implemented across various ensemble and tree components in scikit-learn, which indicates a common pattern of calculating and exposing feature importances in different models. The appearance in `gradient_boosting.py` and `tree.py` confirms its relevance to both the individual trees and the ensemble model.\n   - **Relationship to the Bug**: Given that feature importances appear to be calculated differently as the number of estimators increases (with sums diverging from 1), there might be issues in how these importances are summed across trees or how they're normalized. This could involve floating-point arithmetic errors, incorrect aggregation logic, or failures to account for special cases in large ensembles.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: In each implementation of `feature_importances_`, feature importance calculations should accurately reflect the contribution of each feature towards the predictions, proportionally aggregated across all estimators so that their total sum equals 1. This could mean revisiting the algorithmic logic that sums or normalizes these importance values, ensuring it robustly handles large numbers of trees or edge cases encountered with deep trees or sparse data.\n\nGiven this analysis, to resolve the issue, we would likely need to:\n\n- Inspect how feature importances are normalized in the `feature_importances_` property within `BaseGradientBoosting`.\n- Ensure that this mechanism correctly accounts for a wide range of scenarios, including large numbers of estimators.\n- Assess whether there's a need to introduce more robust numerical handling or aggregation logic to prevent the sum of importances from deviating from 1.0 under certain conditions.\n\nConsidering the lack of direct findings for `estimators_`, it's possible this attribute is accessed through another mechanism or inferred from context, rather than directly manipulated. This aspect would require a deeper dive into how ensemble models manage their constituent estimators in scikit-learn, potentially requiring a broader understanding of ensemble class implementations.\n\n**Bug Locations**:\n- **File**: `sklearn/ensemble/gradient_boosting.py`, **Class**: `BaseGradientBoosting`, **Method**: `feature_importances_`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Ensure that the sum of calculated feature importances from all trees in the ensemble equals 1. This may involve reviewing the normalization process applied to these values, ensuring that it is capable of handling the aggregation correctly across a large number of estimators, and considering aspects like floating-point precision."
