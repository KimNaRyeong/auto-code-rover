        "content": "<issue>Bug in Gradient Boosting: Feature Importances do not sum to 1\n#### Description\nI found conditions when Feature Importance values do not add up to 1 in ensemble tree methods, like Gradient Boosting Trees or AdaBoost Trees.\nThis error occurs once the ensemble reaches a large number of estimators.  The exact conditions depend variously.  For example, the error shows up sooner with a smaller amount of training samples.  Or, if the depth of the tree is large.\nWhen this error appears, the predicted value seems to have converged.  But it\u2019s unclear if the error is causing the predicted value not to change with more estimators.  In fact, the feature importance sum goes lower and lower with more estimators thereafter.\nConsequently, it's questionable if the tree ensemble code is functioning as expected.\nHere's sample code to reproduce this:\n``` python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import datasets\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor\nboston = datasets.load_boston()\nX, Y = (boston.data, boston.target)\nn_estimators = 720\n# Note: From 712 onwards, the feature importance sum is less than 1\nparams = {'n_estimators': n_estimators, 'max_depth': 6, 'learning_rate': 0.1}\nclf = GradientBoostingRegressor(**params)\nclf.fit(X, Y)\nfeature_importance_sum = np.sum(clf.feature_importances_)\nprint(\"At n_estimators = %i, feature importance sum = %f\" % (n_estimators , feature_importance_sum))\n```\n_Output:_\n```\nAt n_estimators = 720, feature importance sum = 0.987500\n```\nIn fact, if we examine the tree at each staged prediction, we'll see that the feature importance goes to 0 after we hit a certain number of estimators.  (For the code above, it's 712.)\nHere's code to describe what I mean:\n``` python\nfor i, tree in enumerate(clf.estimators_):\nfeature_importance_sum = np.sum(tree[0].feature_importances_)\nprint(\"At n_estimators = %i, feature importance sum = %f\" % (i , feature_importance_sum))\n```\n_Output:_\n```\n...\nAt n_estimators = 707, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 708, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 709, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 710, feature importance sum = 1.000000\nAt n_estimators = 711, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 712, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 713, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 714, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 715, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 716, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 717, feature importance sum = 0.000000\nAt n_estimators = 718, feature importance sum = 0.000000\n...\n```\nI wonder if we\u2019re hitting some floating point calculation error.\nBTW, I've posted this issue on the mailing list [Link](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/scikit-learn/2016-September/000508.html).  There aren't a lot of discussion, but others seem to think there's a bug here too.\nHope we can get this fixed or clarified.\nThank you!\n-Doug\n#### Versions\nWindows-7;'Python', '2.7.9 ;'NumPy', '1.9.2';'SciPy', '0.15.1';'Scikit-Learn', '0.16.1'\n</issue>"

This involves examining the relevant classes and methods that contribute to this functionality. Based on the issue description, the key areas of interest are the `GradientBoostingRegressor` class, the underlying tree estimators used in the ensemble, and how feature importances are computed and aggregated across these estimators. Here are the API calls to perform:\n\n1. Search for the class where the Gradient Boosting Regressor is defined:\n   - `search_class(\"GradientBoostingRegressor\")`\n\n2. Given the issue seems related to the calculation of feature importances in an ensemble method, we should look into how feature importances are computed within this class:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"feature_importances_\", \"GradientBoostingRegressor\")`\n\n3. It is also mentioned that examining the tree at each stage could reveal more about the issue. Trees in gradient boosting are typically instances of a decision tree class. Let's find the class definition for the decision trees used within the gradient boosting algorithm. This information can help us understand how each tree's feature importances are calculated:\n   - `search_class(\"DecisionTreeRegressor\")`\n\n4. Since the problem appears once a large number of estimators are reached, and understanding that the ensemble method involves aggregating individual tree estimators, we should examine how these estimators are stored and accessed in the Gradient Boosting Regressor class:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"estimators_\", \"GradientBoostingRegressor\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide us with a good starting point to understand the underlying structure of `GradientBoostingRegressor`, how feature importances are computed, and how each estimator is involved in this process, enabling us to pinpoint the root cause of the issue."

        "content": "Analyzing the returned results:\n\n1. **GradientBoostingRegressor**:\n   - The `GradientBoostingRegressor` class in `sklearn/ensemble/gradient_boosting.py` is defined with a set of parameters that control the fitting behavior of the model. This class inherits from `BaseGradientBoosting` and `RegressorMixin`, but our initial query did not return details about the implementation of the `BaseGradientBoosting`. Given this, it's important to remember that `GradientBoostingRegressor` likely relies heavily on its base class for much of its functionality, including the aggregation of estimators and calculation of feature importances.\n   - **Relationship to Bug**: Since we're investigating an issue with feature importance sums in gradient boosting, understanding how `GradientBoostingRegressor` is structured and operates is crucial. The absence of direct information about `feature_importances_` suggests that feature importances are probably handled by the superclass or through a mechanism not directly exposed/overridden in `GradientBoostingRegressor`.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: Ideally, this class would manage an ensemble of decision trees to predict outcomes and calculate feature importances that accurately reflect the contribution of each feature towards the prediction. The sum of all feature importances should logically equal 1, indicating that all feature contributions are accounted for.\n\n2. **DecisionTreeRegressor**:\n   - The `DecisionTreeRegressor` in `sklearn/tree/tree.py` offers insight into the possible base estimator used within `GradientBoostingRegressor`. With parameters controlling the tree's growth and methods for fitting to data, it forms the building block for the ensemble model.\n   - **Relationship to Bug**: Each tree in the `GradientBoostingRegressor` contributes to the overall feature importance calculation. An anomaly with how individual trees calculate or contribute to the overall feature importances might lead to the observed issue. The variation in importance sums with the number of estimators suggests that there could be a cumulative error or a specific condition under which tree contributions are miscomputed or misaggregated.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: A `DecisionTreeRegressor` should calculate its feature importances in a way that when aggregated across all trees in the ensemble, the total sum of importances equals 1. This indicates that each feature\u2019s importance is considered proportionally to its impact on improving the prediction accuracy.\n\nGiven the lack of direct results for `feature_importances_` and `estimators_` in `GradientBoostingRegressor`, and the understanding that these functionalities are likely inherited or composed rather than directly implemented in `GradientBoostingRegressor`, we should investigate the superclass (`BaseGradientBoosting`) or related utility functions handling feature importance calculations and estimator aggregations.\n\nFurther steps and API calls to consider:\n- Investigate `BaseGradientBoosting` for implementation details that might affect feature importance calculation.\n  - `search_class(\"BaseGradientBoosting\")`\n- Explore how `feature_importances_` are aggregated or derived across the ensemble in the base class or related modules considering how Gradient Boosting typically relies on multiple decision trees.\n  - `search_method(\"feature_importances_\")` to find where and how `feature_importances_` might be implemented or calculated across the codebase, given it wasn't found directly within `GradientBoostingRegressor`.\n- Since direct lookup for `estimators_` in `GradientBoostingRegressor` didn't yield results, it's possible this attribute is managed by the base class or through a method rather than a direct attribute access.\n  - `search_method(\"estimators_\")` to understand how the ensemble of trees is accessed and used.\n\nThese steps would ideally provide deeper insight into the internal workings related to the issue with feature importance calculation."
