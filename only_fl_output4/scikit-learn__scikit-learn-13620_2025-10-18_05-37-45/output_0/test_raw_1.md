Given the feedback and the error encountered during execution, it seems there was a misunderstanding in crafting the reproducer script for the issue initially reported. Let's refine the approach based on the original bug description, ensuring the script is compatible with a Python 3 environment and correctly identifies the issue by raising an `AssertionError` if the feature importances sum to a value other than `1.0`. This script assumes that the sklearn and numpy installations are correctly configured in the environment where it will be executed.

```python
# reproducer.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}", line {line_number}', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {frame.line.strip()}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    try:
        boston = datasets.load_boston()
        X, Y = (boston.data, boston.target)

        n_estimators = 720
        params = {'n_estimators': n_estimators, 'max_depth': 6, 'learning_rate': 0.1}
        clf = GradientBoostingRegressor(**params)
        clf.fit(X, Y)

        feature_importance_sum = np.sum(clf.feature_importances_)
        assert np.isclose(feature_importance_sum, 1.0), f"Sum of feature importances is not equal to 1, was {feature_importance_sum}"
        
        for i, estimators in enumerate(clf.estimators_):
            for tree in estimators:
                tree_importance_sum = np.sum(tree.feature_importances_)
                assert np.isclose(tree_importance_sum, 1.0), f"At n_estimators = {i}, feature importance sum = {tree_importance_sum}"

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    print("No issues detected.")
    exit(0)
```

This script aims to reproduce the specific issue regarding feature importances not summing to `1.0` within the Gradient Boosting model as well as in individual trees of the ensemble. It includes checking the sum of feature importances of individual trees, addressing the deeper level of the original bug report. Execution exits with code `1` upon detecting the anomaly, as requested.
