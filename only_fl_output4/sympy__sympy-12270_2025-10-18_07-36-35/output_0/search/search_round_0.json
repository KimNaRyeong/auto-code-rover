        "content": "To address the issue outlined, we should investigate the `Mul` class and `extract_multiplicatively` method, since the problem seems to revolve around an unexpected behavior in these areas. Furthermore, a dive into the `primitive` method's implementation might also reveal more insights, given its involvement in the issue. Here are the API calls we need to make:\n\n1. **Search for the `Mul` class**: This will provide context on how multiplication operations are handled, especially since there's a mention of \"non-evaluated\" `Mul` that might be affecting the `extract_multiplicatively` method.\n   - `search_class(\"Mul\")`\n\n2. **Search for the `extract_multiplicatively` method**: It's essential to understand how this method works within the context of the `Mul` class, or wherever else it is defined, to trace the bug mentioned.\n   - `search_method(\"extract_multiplicatively\")`\n\n3. **Search for the `primitive` method**: Since the issue outlines an unexpected result from the `primitive` method before attempting a multiplication extraction, understanding its functionality is crucial.\n   - `search_method(\"primitive\")`\n\n4. **Search for the specific code snippet in `core/expr.py`**: This might help understand the problematic behavior or any related comments around the issue.\n   - `search_code_in_file(\"Mul(2, -x, evaluate=False).extract_multiplicatively(-2)\", \"core/expr.py\")`\n\nThese API calls will help gather sufficient context around the functionalities and implementations of `Mul`, `extract_multiplicatively`, and `primitive` methods, which are directly related to the reported bug."
