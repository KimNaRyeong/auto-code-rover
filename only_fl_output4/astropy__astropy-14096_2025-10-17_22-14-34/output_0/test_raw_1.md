Given the nature of the error encountered during the initial execution attempt, it seems there was a misunderstanding or a system-specific issue rather than an error in the reproduction script related to the original problem. The error indicated a missing Python module (`packaging`) which is unrelated to the `astropy` library issue we're trying to reproduce. This issue might occur due to an incomplete environment setup or a missing dependency that is not directly related to `astropy` or the reproduction script itself.

To ensure the environment is correctly set up for our purpose of reproducing the `astropy` issue, ensure that all necessary dependencies, including `astropy` and any others that might be missing (such as `packaging`), are installed. This can be achieved by using `pip` or `conda` to manage your Python packages.

Considering the instructions and ensuring a correct setup, let's reformat the reproducer script with the correct handling to catch and assert the attribute access issue. Please ensure your environment is correctly set up with all necessary dependencies before running this script.

```python
import astropy.coordinates as coord
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class CustomCoord(coord.SkyCoord):
    @property
    def prop(self):
        return self.random_attr

def main():
    try:
        c = CustomCoord('00h42m30s', '+41d12m00s', frame='icrs')
        c.prop  # This line is expected to raise an AttributeError for `random_attr` not `prop`
    except AttributeError as e:
        correct_message = "'CustomCoord' object has no attribute 'random_attr'"
        if str(e) != correct_message:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            # Raise an AssertionError if the issue is present, indicating the test failed
            raise AssertionError("The error message did not match the expected output.")
        else:
            print("The issue has been fixed or was not reproduced.")
            sys.exit(0)  # Exit normally because the error message is correct or the issue was not reproduced

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Before you execute this script, you should:
1. Ensure that the `astropy` package along with any other dependencies (like `packaging`) is installed in your Python environment.
2. Verify that the environment where the script is executed has network access if needed, to prevent any unrelated errors regarding the environment configuration.
3. Make sure you're using a compatible Python version for the `astropy` version you're testing with.

This script strictly follows the criteria for reproducing the specific attribute access issue with subclassing `SkyCoord` in the `astropy` library.
