I apologize for the confusion in the previous instructions. Let's try this again with the correct approach to reproduce the described issue involving subclassing `SkyCoord` from the `astropy` library and accessing a custom property that refers to a non-existent attribute. Below is an updated version of `reproducer.py` designed to specifically address the error handling and assertion criteria you've outlined. This script will correctly provoke the issue at hand and exit with code 0 if the issue has been resolved, adhering to the function provided for printing the stack trace clearly.

```python
import astropy.coordinates as coord
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

class CustomCoord(coord.SkyCoord):
    @property
    def prop(self):
        return self.random_attr

def check_attribute_error_message():
    try:
        c = CustomCoord('00h42m30s', '+41d12m00s', frame='icrs')
        _ = c.prop  # Attempting to access a custom property that leads to a non-existent attribute
    except AttributeError as e:
        expected_message = "CustomCoord object has no attribute 'random_attr'"
        # Change to check if 'random_attr' is in the message, as the exact formatting may differ
        if 'random_attr' not in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("Incorrect error message for missing attribute.")
    else:
        # If no exception is raised, that is incorrect behavior given the current context
        raise AssertionError("AttributeError was expected but was not raised.")

def main():
    try:
        check_attribute_error_message()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(f"Test failed: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error code if the issue is present
    print("The issue has been addressed or was not reproduced.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit normally because the issue was fixed or not reproduced

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script:
- Defines a subclass of `SkyCoord` with a custom property that attempts to access a non-existent attribute.
- Catches the `AttributeError` to check if the error message correctly refers to the non-existent attribute (`random_attr`) instead of the custom property (`prop`).
- Utilizes the provided `print_stacktrace` function to clearly print the exception traceback if the observed behavior doesn't match the expected.
- Raises an `AssertionError` if the attribute error message is incorrect, and exits with code `1` to indicate failure.
- Exits with code `0`, indicating that the issue has been addressed or was not reproduced if no incorrect behavior is detected.
