This change aims to preserve the functionality of defining the number of mixture components while offering an interface consistent with clusterers. The implementation should check for the usage of either `n_clusters` or `n_components` in a backward-compatible manner, prioritizing `n_clusters` if both are provided."

        "intended_behavior": "Implement or document the storage of `labels_` attribute after fitting the model. The model should compute and store the most likely cluster (component) for each observation in the training set upon fitting and make this available through the `labels_` attribute. This change would make mixture models' output more consistent with clusterers, aiding in interpretability and analysis of fitted models. This might involve adjusting or ensuring that the `predict` method (or an equivalent method for assigning data points to their most likely component) populates this attribute after the model is fitted."

        "method": "",
        "intended_behavior": "Add a `fit_predict` method that combines fitting the model and predicting the most likely cluster for each observation in the dataset. The method would internally call `fit` followed by `predict` (or the method used to assign observations to components), returning the predicted cluster labels. This enhancement will streamline the workflow for users who are interested in both fitting the model to their data and immediately obtaining cluster assignments, thus aligning mixture models' usage more closely with that of clusterers."
