sympy 1.6.1 ?
Hi, is there any plan on releasing 1.6.1, just like we had 1.5.1 shortly after 1.5? [We're unfortunately stuck with 1.5.1](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/blob/master/requirements.txt#L3), but the patches we've submitted have already been merged into SymPy master, and we're looking forward to jump to 1.6. Thanks!
