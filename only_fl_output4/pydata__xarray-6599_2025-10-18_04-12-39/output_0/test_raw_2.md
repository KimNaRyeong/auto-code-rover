Based on the updated request and correcting the syntax in the provided function for printing the stack trace, below is the standalone Python file named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the described issue. It follows the conditions laid out:

1. The script will try to reproduce the issue outlined -- discrepancies in `xr.polyval` results when using `timedelta64` coordinates across different versions of xarray.
2. It will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present.
3. It will print a stack trace of the issue if an exception is raised.
4. It will exit with code 0 if the issue is fixed or if the results are as expected.

```python
import numpy as np
import xarray as xr
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    values = np.array([
        "2021-04-01T05:25:19.000000000",
        "2021-04-01T05:25:29.000000000",
        "2021-04-01T05:25:39.000000000",

        "2021-04-01T05:26:09.000000000",
    ], dtype="datetime64[ns]")
    azimuth_time = xr.DataArray(values, name="azimuth_time", coords={"azimuth_time": values - values[0]})

    polyfit_coefficients = xr.DataArray([
        [2.33333335e-43, 1.62499999e-43, 2.79166678e-43],
        [-1.15316667e-30, 1.49518518e-31, 9.08833333e-31],
        [-2.50272583e-18, -1.23851062e-18, -2.99098229e-18],
        [5.83965193e-06, -1.53321770e-07, -4.84640242e-06],
        [4.44739216e06, 1.45053974e06, 5.29960857e06],
    ], dims=("degree", "axis"), coords={"axis": [0, 1, 2], "degree": [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]})

    result = xr.polyval(azimuth_time, polyfit_coefficients)

    # Check if the first row of the result matches expected values as per v2022.3.0
    expected_first_row = np.array([4.44739216e06, 1.45053974e06, 5.29960857e06])
    np.testing.assert_allclose(result[0], expected_first_row, atol=1e-5)
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    print("\nIssue reproduced. AssertionError indicates a mismatch in calculated values.")
    sys.exit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)

print("Test passed: No discrepancies found in polyval results.")
sys.exit(0)
```

This script checks the first row of the results from `polyval` against expected values. The `atol=1e-5` argument in `assert_allclose` specifies an absolute tolerance parameter, which can be adjusted as needed for the results being compared.

- If an `AssertionError` is raised, it means the calculated values do not match the expected ones, indicating the issue persists.
- If any other exception is caught, its stack trace is printed for further analysis.
- If no exceptions are caught, the script prints a success message indicating no discrepancies were found, implying the issue has been resolved or does not exist with the current environment setup.
