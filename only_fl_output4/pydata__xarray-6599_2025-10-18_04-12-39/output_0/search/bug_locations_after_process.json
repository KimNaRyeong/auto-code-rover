        "intended_behavior": "The `_ensure_numeric` function must ensure that `timedelta64` data are correctly and consistently converted to a numeric format suitable for polynomial evaluation. The conversion should accurately represent the duration information inherent in `timedelta64` types, possibly converting to a uniform unit like seconds or milliseconds. This process must preserve the granularity and scale of temporal data to maintain the integrity of polynomial operations. Moreover, this function should explicitly check for `timedelta64` types and apply a conversion logic that mitigates any potential precision loss or misinterpretation that could influence the final computation outcome. This adjustment will ensure that evaluations involving `timedelta64` coordinates produce accurate and expected results, aligning with the functionality observed in version `2022.3.0`."
