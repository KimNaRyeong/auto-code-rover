        "intended_behavior": "The `_ensure_numeric` function must ensure that `timedelta64` data are correctly and consistently converted to a numeric format suitable for polynomial evaluation. The conversion should accurately represent the duration information inherent in `timedelta64` types, possibly converting to a uniform unit like seconds or milliseconds. This process must preserve the granularity and scale of temporal data to maintain the integrity of polynomial operations. Moreover, this function should explicitly check for `timedelta64` types and apply a conversion logic that mitigates any potential precision loss or misinterpretation that could influence the final computation outcome. This adjustment will ensure that evaluations involving `timedelta64` coordinates produce accurate and expected results, aligning with the functionality observed in version `2022.3.0`."

        "intended_behavior": "Although the core issue seems rooted in `_ensure_numeric`, the `polyval` method may require adjustments to ensure proper handling of `timedelta64` data post-conversion by `_ensure_numeric`. This might involve validating that the numeric conversion of `timedelta64` coordinates is handled in a way that aligns with the polynomial computation logic, especially considering the unique semantics of time durations. The `polyval` method should ensure compatibility with the numeric types resulting from the conversion and possibly adjust computations to reflect the accurate representation of time durations. This ensures that the polynomial evaluations remain reliable and consistent across versions for all data types, including `timedelta64`."
