</code><intended_behavior>Although the core issue seems rooted in `_ensure_numeric`, the `polyval` method may require adjustments to ensure proper handling of `timedelta64` data post-conversion by `_ensure_numeric`. This might involve validating that the numeric conversion of `timedelta64` coordinates is handled in a way that aligns with the polynomial computation logic, especially considering the unique semantics of time durations. The `polyval` method should ensure compatibility with the numeric types resulting from the conversion and possibly adjust computations to reflect the accurate representation of time durations. This ensures that the polynomial evaluations remain reliable and consistent across versions for all data types, including `timedelta64`.</intended_behavior>]
