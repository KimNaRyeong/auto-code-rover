        "intended_behavior": "The `as_relational` method needs to be updated to correctly represent `Range` objects with steps other than one in the form of relational expressions. The method should include logic to append an additional condition using the `Mod` function where necessary. This additional condition should ensure that the expression covers elements in the range adhering to the step's modulus with respect to the start value, effectively ensuring `Eq(Mod(x, self.step), Mod(self.start, self.step))` is part of the relational output when the step is different than one. This implementation should preserve the method's existing functionality for ranges where this condition is not applicable (e.g., unit steps) while extending its accuracy for ranges with non-unit steps."
