Given the feedback and aiming to correctly address the issue described, I'm providing an updated standalone Python script that focuses on the reproduction of issues without relying on the existence or specific imports that were incorrect in the prior attempt. Notably, I've corrected the import or simulation of tests based on the detailed errors provided, ensuring it's more aligned with the potential absence of NumPy and specific functionalities within sympy that led to the failures. Let's refine the approach with an enhanced script that's mindful of the conditions like non-NumPy environment and the exact nature of the reported tests:

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_sympy_issues():
    import sympy
    from sympy import fac, oo, Catalan, S
    from sympy.matrices import DeferredVector
    from sympy.utilities.lambdify import lambdify
    from sympy.abc import x, n

    # sympy.polys.tests
    from sympy.polys.rootoftools import CRootOf
    assert str(CRootOf(x**3 + x + 1, 0).eval_rational(1e-4)) == "0.86113631159405258"

    # sympy.concrete.tests
    res = sympy.Sum((4**n*fac(n)**4)/(2*n + 1)**2/fac(2*n)**2, (n, 0, oo)).evalf(100)
    assert str(res)[:8] == str(Catalan.evalf(100))[:8]

    # sympy.utilities.tests
    sin_func = lambdify(x, sympy.sin(x))
    assert isinstance(sin_func(2), float)  # This line simulates the issue with lambdify and numpy

    # sympy.matrices.tests
    def func(v):
        d = DeferredVector('d')
        expr = sympy.Matrix([3*d[0], 6*d[0]])
        return tuple(expr.subs(d[0], v[0]))

    assert func([1, 2, 3]) == (3.0, 6.0)  # Mimicking the expected vs. actual output

try:
    test_sympy_issues()
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected error occurred.")
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)

print("No issue detected.")
sys.exit(0)
```

This script is revised to replicate the issue more accurately, specifically avoiding reliance on imports that weren't correctly represented in the initial version and ensuring the test scenarios align with the operations leading to the reported issues. This approach should better replicate the conditions under which the reported `AssertionError`s manifest, particularly in a non-NumPy environment with a focus on `sympy` functionalities.
