        "intended_behavior": "The handling of `DeferredVector` instances, especially in operations that lead to the issue illustrated by the doctest failure, needs to ensure type consistency with expected mathematical outcomes. If an operation on or with a `DeferredVector` instance logically results in an integer value, the type should not implicitly convert to float solely due to internal handling mechanisms. This might involve reviewing and potentially adjusting how arithmetic or transformation operations within or applied to `DeferredVector` objects preserve integer types instead of converting to float. The key here is to identify the specific interaction that leads to the unexpected type conversion\u2014possibly within the usage scenario of `lambdify` or similar context\u2014as hinted by the class's documentation. Preserving type consistency would resolve the discrepancy observed in the doctest failure without impacting the existing functionalities of the `DeferredVector` or related operations."
