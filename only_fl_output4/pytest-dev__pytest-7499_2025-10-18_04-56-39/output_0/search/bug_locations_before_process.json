        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior within this raises method is to accurately process the match argument such that it can correctly identify and compare exception messages even when they contain special characters like parentheses or when they are complex regex patterns. This behavior should include:\n- Explicitly checking if the provided match argument is a raw string or needs special handling to accurately interpret parentheses and other regex special characters.\n- Enhancing the error message to provide more clarity on why a match failed, possibly suggesting checks for special characters or regex patterns.\n- Maintaining existing functionality for straightforward string matches and regex pattern matches without introducing breaking changes.\n- Optionally, integrating a check to warn or inform users when it looks like a regex pattern is intended but potentially misinterpreted due to issues like unescaped characters or lack of raw string notation."
