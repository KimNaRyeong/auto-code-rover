One approach to resolve the issue could be to directly format the log message with %(asctime)s (or a comparable, consistent timestamp format) that's broadly adopted across the server's logging system. Additionally, ensure that the timestamp format is configurable to accommodate different use cases or preferences."

It should ensure that all log messages passing through here adhere to a unified timestamp format. The class might also need a method or a mechanism to configure the datetime format, providing a way to easily customize how timestamps are presented in logs, aligning with the customization mentioned in the original issue description."
