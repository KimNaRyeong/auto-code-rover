On the other hand, WSGIServer uses logging without providing a server_time. This gets \"fixed\" in ServerFormatter.format using self.formatTime(record, self.datefmt), which uses a completely different format.\nCurrently we make this at least consistent by providing the datefmt parameter when constructing the logger, but it would be better if they were coded to be in sync (and configurable?).\n(Looking into it further, it looks like we should be using %(asctime)s instead of %(server_time)s, but would be good if that were the suggested default. In \u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/releases/1.10/#runserver-output-goes-through-logging we see %(server_time)s.)\n</issue>"

        "content": "Based on the description of the issue, it's clear that the inconsistency involves logging from `WSGIRequestHandler` and `WSGIServer`, and the suggestion to make logging consistent by possibly using `%(asctime)s` in the logging format. To gather the context necessary for addressing the issue, we'll need to find:\n\n1. The implementation details of `WSGIRequestHandler` and how it handles logging, specifically how `server_time` is used or calculated.\n2. The implementation of `WSGIServer` to understand how it currently handles logging and why it might not be providing a `server_time`.\n3. The location and usage of `ServerFormatter` to see how `formatTime` is applied and to check if there's a discrepancy in date formatting.\n4. Occurrences of `%(server_time)s` and `%(asctime)s` in the logging configurations to identify how logging format is currently configured and where changes need to be applied.\n\nLet's start the investigation with the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"WSGIRequestHandler\")` - To find the implementation of `WSGIRequestHandler`.\n2. `search_class(\"WSGIServer\")` - To locate the `WSGIServer` class and its logging functionality.\n3. `search_class(\"ServerFormatter\")` - To find the `ServerFormatter` class for logging format details.\n4. `search_code(\"%(server_time)s\")` - To find where `%(server_time)s` is used in logging configurations.\n5. `search_code(\"%(asctime)s\")` - To find occurrences of `%(asctime)s` to see where the time is currently formatted in the logs."
