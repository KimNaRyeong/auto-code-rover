        "content": "To address the issue effectively, let's break down the information we need from the codebase. The feature request is to implement a method to rewrite `Min` and `Max` functions in terms of `Piecewise`. From this description, the classes and methods we need more context on are:\n\n1. The `Max` class \u2013 to understand its current implementation and to possibly add a new method.\n2. The `Min` class \u2013 similar to `Max`, we need to understand its structure to implement the `rewrite()` method.\n3. The `Piecewise` class \u2013 to ensure we understand how to use it for the implementation of the new feature.\n4. The `rewrite()` method implementations across these classes \u2013 to gain insight into how rewriting is currently handled.\n\nGiven this requirement, let's construct our API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Max\")` \u2013 to find where the `Max` class is defined.\n2. `search_class(\"Min\")` \u2013 to locate the `Min` class definition.\n3. `search_class(\"Piecewise\")` \u2013 to get information on the `Piecewise` class.\n4. `search_method(\"rewrite\")` \u2013 to identify how `rewrite` methods are implemented and used throughout the project.\n\nThese searches should provide enough context to start planning the implementation of the `rewrite` functionality for `Min` and `Max` in terms of `Piecewise`."
