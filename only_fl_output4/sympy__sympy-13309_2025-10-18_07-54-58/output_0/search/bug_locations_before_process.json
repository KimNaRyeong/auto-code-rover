        "intended_behavior": "Implement a new `rewrite` method that can transform the `Max` function into a `Piecewise` expression appropriately, preserving the existing functionality for other rewrite cases. The method should essentially handle input arguments to rewrite `Max(a, b)` to `Piecewise((a, a>b), (b, True))`. This functionality should be integrated in such a way that it complements the existing methods without altering their behavior for non-`Piecewise` rewrites."

        "intended_behavior": "Similarly to `Max`, a `rewrite` method should be added to the `Min` class to enable it to be expressed as a `Piecewise` function. The implementation should rewrite `Min(a, b)` as `Piecewise((a, a<b), (b, True))`. This new method must coexist with the current functionalities, adding the capability to rewrite to `Piecewise` without disturbing existing rewrite logic or any other method behaviors."
