The feature request is to implement a method to rewrite `Min` and `Max` functions in terms of `Piecewise`. From this description, the classes and methods we need more context on are:\n\n1. The `Max` class \u2013 to understand its current implementation and to possibly add a new method.\n2. The `Min` class \u2013 similar to `Max`, we need to understand its structure to implement the `rewrite()` method.\n3. The `Piecewise` class \u2013 to ensure we understand how to use it for the implementation of the new feature.\n4. The `rewrite()` method implementations across these classes \u2013 to gain insight into how rewriting is currently handled.\n\nGiven this requirement, let's construct our API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"Max\")` \u2013 to find where the `Max` class is defined.\n2. `search_class(\"Min\")` \u2013 to locate the `Min` class definition.\n3. `search_class(\"Piecewise\")` \u2013 to get information on the `Piecewise` class.\n4. `search_method(\"rewrite\")` \u2013 to identify how `rewrite` methods are implemented and used throughout the project.\n\nThese searches should provide enough context to start planning the implementation of the `rewrite` functionality for `Min` and `Max` in terms of `Piecewise`."

However, these instances suggest a pattern or ways `rewrite()` is generally implemented across different classes in the codebase:\n     - **Relation to the Issue**:\n       - Not directly related to the `Max`, `Min`, or `Piecewise` implementation but provides insight into the structure and semantics of a `rewrite()` method which can be considered when implementing a new `rewrite()` method for `Max` and `Min`.\n       - **Intended Behavior**: A method that should allow an object or expression to be expressed in an alternative form, which in this issue's context means expressing `Max` and `Min` as `Piecewise`.\n\nGiven this code context, the steps towards solving the issue would involve:\n- Defining the `rewrite()` method in both `Max` and `Min` classes to handle the specific case of rewriting these expressions as `Piecewise` objects.\n- Ensuring that the newly implemented `rewrite()` method interacts correctly with existing methods and behaviors in the `Piecewise` class to generate the expected outcomes.\n\nNext steps would involve drafting the implementation logic based on this analysis, focusing on how to construct the `Piecewise` expression within the `rewrite()` method for both `Max` and `Min`."

The method should essentially handle input arguments to rewrite `Max(a, b)` to `Piecewise((a, a>b), (b, True))`.

The implementation should rewrite `Min(a, b)` as `Piecewise((a, a<b), (b, True))`. This new method must coexist with the current functionalities, adding the capability to rewrite to `Piecewise` without disturbing existing rewrite logic or any other method behaviors."
