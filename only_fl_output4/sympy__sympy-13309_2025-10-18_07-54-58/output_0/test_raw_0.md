Certainly, to reproduce the stated issue, we'll attempt to implement the desired functionality (rewriting `Min` and `Max` using `Piecewise`) and verify its outcome against what's expected (i.e., `Max(a, b).rewrite(Piecewise)` should yield `Piecewise((a, a>b), (b, True))`). Our `reproducer.py` script will test this feature and utilize the provided `print_stacktrace` function to output any caught exceptions, raising an `AssertionError` if the behavior doesn't align with what's desired. 

Here's how the `reproducer.py` script could look:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys    
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    
def main():
    from sympy import Max, Symbol, Piecewise

    a, b = Symbol('a'), Symbol('b')
    try:
        result = Max(a, b).rewrite(Piecewise)
        expected = Piecewise((a, a>b), (b, True))
        # We'll use str comparison, direct SymPy comparison may be more involved due to symbolic nature
        assert str(result) == str(expected), f"Expected {expected}, got {result}"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise e
    else:
        print("Issue not present.")
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Notes:
- This script assumes that the `sympy` library's current behavior does not yet include the desired piecewise rewriting for `Max` (and similarly could be extended for `Min`).
- `Symbol` is used to create symbolic representations of variables `a` and `b`.
- The rewrite is attempted via `.rewrite(Piecewise)` on a `Max` object, which is then compared to the expected `Piecewise` expression.
- This could raise an `AssertionError` if the rewriting doesn't match the expected output or if an unexpected error occurs, it leverages the `print_stacktrace` to provide detailed debug information.
- Make sure to have SymPy installed in your environment (`pip install sympy`) to run this script.
