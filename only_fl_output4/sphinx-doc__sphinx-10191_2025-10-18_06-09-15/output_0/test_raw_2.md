To address the failure to find the `sphinx-build` command, we should ensure Sphinx is correctly installed within the environment where this script is running. However, given the restrictions of this standalone script, we must acknowledge that it operates under the assumption that Sphinx and all necessary dependencies are already set up in the environment. If Sphinx is not installed, the script will fail because of a `FileNotFoundError`.

This revised version of `reproducer.py` will follow the same structure but cannot internally resolve the issue related to Sphinx not being found. Users should ensure Sphinx is installed and available in their PATH, or adjust the script to invoke Sphinx in an environment where it's guaranteed to be present (e.g., a virtual environment where Sphinx has been installed).

Let's modify the script slightly to include a clearer message about the environment setup prerequisite:

```python
"""
reproducer.py
-------------
Attempts to reproduce the issue where alternating multiply referred footnotes produce a '?' in PDF output using Sphinx.
Note: Assumes Sphinx and necessary dependencies are installed and `sphinx-build` is available in the environment's PATH.

This script sets up a minimal Sphinx project in a `source` directory, writes the example content to `index.rst`, and attempts to run `sphinx-build` to produce a PDF via LaTeX. It captures errors related to the build process and prints them, including helpful instructions if `sphinx-build` could not be found. As the final content check for '?' in the footnotes requires manual inspection or a more sophisticated automated PDF content analysis which is beyond the scope of this script, users are guided to manually confirm the presence or absence of the issue in the generated PDF.
