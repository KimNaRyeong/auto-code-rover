        "content": "To resolve the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about the `kernS` function mentioned in the issue, as well as where and how it's referenced or implemented in the codebase. Here's how I would proceed with the API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the `kernS` Function**: Since the error points to `kernS` being used before assignment, the first step is to understand what `kernS` is supposed to do, and where it is defined. This requires searching for its definition.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"kernS\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search within the Sympify Module**: Given that the issue mentions `from sympy.core.sympify import kernS`, it is also valuable to explore the `sympify` module for the occurrence of `kernS` to see how it's implemented or referenced.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code_in_file(\"kernS\", \"sympy/core/sympify.py\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for the 'kern' Reference**: Since the error mentions `local variable 'kern' referenced before assignment`, it would be useful to find where `kern` is assigned or used within the related files. This could point to where the logical error or scoping issue arises.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code_in_file(\"kern\", \"sympy/core/sympify.py\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls should provide sufficient context to understand the nature of the issue, and how `kernS` is meant to work within the project's codebase, as well as pinpoint where the unresolved reference to `kern` might be happening."
