        "content": "Given the nature of the issue, we need to focus on the part of the Django framework that deals with the `DatabaseCache` backend functionality. The issue highlights a problem with field quoting in queries, specifically for Snowflake databases. This points us towards looking into how queries are constructed within the `DatabaseCache` code. To start, we need to find where the `DatabaseCache` class is defined and review the methods related to query construction or execution. Then, we might need to look into the specifics of how fields are quoted in those queries.\n\nLet's perform the following API calls to get the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the `DatabaseCache` class to find out which file it is located in:\n```python\nsearch_class(\"DatabaseCache\")\n```\n\n2. Once we have the file name for the `DatabaseCache` class, we should look for methods that might be constructing or executing SQL queries. Although we don't have specific method names from the issue description, we can infer common operation names like `get`, `set`, or more generic terms like `query`.\n\nThus, assuming we find the relevant file name from the first search, we would perform searches like:\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"get\", \"DatabaseCache\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"set\", \"DatabaseCache\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"query\", \"DatabaseCache\")\n```\n\nThese actions will help us narrow down the functions or methods within `DatabaseCache` that could be responsible for the issue described, specifically the unquoted fields in queries for Snowflake."
