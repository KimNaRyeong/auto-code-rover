        "intended_behavior": "The method __or__ should ensure that it can handle Q objects with conditions that involve non-pickleable types, such as dict_keys, without raising a TypeError. When combining two Q objects, the method needs to ensure that any such types are converted into a format that preserves the intention of the query while being pickleable. This could be as simple as eagerly converting dict_keys to a list or another pickleable structure before the combination process proceeds. This change must be done in a way that does not alter the semantic meaning of the query conditions."
