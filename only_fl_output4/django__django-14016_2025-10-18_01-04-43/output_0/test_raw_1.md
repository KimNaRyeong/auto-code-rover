Given your latest instructions and the context provided earlier, it looks like there was a misunderstanding in interpreting the test execution results in my previous implementation.

Since the execution of the script led to the exact error it was designed to catch indicating the issue was reproduced successfully, but your instructions imply looking for a modified or perhaps more clear implementation considering the provided outcome. 

However, based on the provided output and your instructions, the script below is essentially what's required and is aligned with the previous content. The script correctly reproduces the issue when executed in the right environment. If you're looking to refine or adjust its behavior further based on additional criteria or to make it handle or interpret results differently, Iâ€™d need specific details on what those adjustments are.

**Reproducer Script (reproducer.py):**

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    from django.db.models import Q
    try:
        # Executing the statement that leads to the issue
        result = Q() | Q(x__in={}.keys())
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Issue reproduced: cannot pickle 'dict_keys' object.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # The script raises an AssertionError if the issue is present
    try:
        reproduce_issue()
        # If no exception is raised, assume the issue has been fixed.
        print("Issue has been fixed.")
        exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(e)
        exit(1)
```

This script should be executed in a Django environment, where the Django version replicates the behavior that leads to the TypeError mentioned. It attempts to combine two `Q` objects using the `|` operator when one of them uses `dict_keys` as a parameter, which is expected to trigger the error per the described issue.
