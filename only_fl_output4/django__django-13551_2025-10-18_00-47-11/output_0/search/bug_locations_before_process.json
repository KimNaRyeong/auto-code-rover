        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `_make_hash_value` method to include the user's email address in the hash value calculation. This adjustment ensures that any password reset tokens generated are immediately invalidated if the user's email is changed after the token is created but before it's used. The new behavior should still factor in the user's primary key, password, last_login, and now the email, to maintain or enhance security without disrupting the original token generation and validation logic. Specifically, the code inside this method that constructs the hash value should concatenate the user's email address with the other attributes (`user.pk`, `user.password`, `login_timestamp`) to form the string used for hashing. This approach preserves the method's purpose of invalidating tokens when significant user attributes change, thus addressing the issue without impacting users who may not have an email associated with their account."
