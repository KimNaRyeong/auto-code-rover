exp doesn't simplify based on its periodicity
In current master, `exp` doesn't use its periodicity to automatically reduce its argument, not even for purely imaginary arguments:
```
>>> exp(9*I*pi/4)
 9⋅ⅈ⋅π
 ─────
   4
ℯ
>>> simplify(exp(9*I*pi/4))
 9⋅ⅈ⋅π
 ─────
   4
ℯ
>>> a = exp(9*I*pi/4) - exp(I*pi/4); a
   ⅈ⋅π    9⋅ⅈ⋅π
   ───    ─────
    4       4
- ℯ    + ℯ
>>> simplify(a)
            9⋅ⅈ⋅π
            ─────
  4 ____      4
- ╲╱ -1  + ℯ
>>> expand_complex(a)
0
```
