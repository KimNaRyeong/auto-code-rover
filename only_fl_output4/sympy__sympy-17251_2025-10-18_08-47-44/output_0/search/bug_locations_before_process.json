This means either directly implementing this simplification within the `exp` method or ensuring it correctly interacts with other parts of the system (like `simplify`) that perform this task. The implementation should preserve the generality of `exp` for other types of arguments while adding specific checks or simplifications for cases involving `I*pi*n`."

        "intended_behavior": "The `simplify` method should reliably recognize and simplify expressions involving the exponential function that can be reduced through the use of exponential periodicity, especially expressions of the form `exp(I*pi*n)`. This would likely involve enhancing the pattern matching or heuristic evaluation to detect these opportunities for simplification and apply the known identity `exp(I*pi*n) = (-1)^n` when appropriate. The improvement should not affect the method's ability to handle other simplifications but should extend its capability to include better handling of exponential functions."
