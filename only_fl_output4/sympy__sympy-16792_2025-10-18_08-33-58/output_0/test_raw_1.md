This script attempts to reproduce the issue described. It will execute without errors and exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed, indicating successful execution. However, if the issue is still present, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a stack trace highlighting where the exception occurred in the script, specifically indicating the problem with how `autowrap` with the `cython` backend handles functions with array arguments that do not appear in the expression.
