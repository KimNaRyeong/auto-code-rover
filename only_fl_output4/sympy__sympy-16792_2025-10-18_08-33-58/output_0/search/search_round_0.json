        "content": "<issue>autowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr\nWhen using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:\n```python\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\nimport numpy as np\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\nexpr = 1.0\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\n```\nThis should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:\n```python\nTypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars\n```\nA little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:\n```C\ndouble autofunc(double x) {\ndouble autofunc_result;\nautofunc_result = 1.0;\nreturn autofunc_result;\n}\n```\n(`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)\nI've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:\n```python\nfrom sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap\nfrom sympy import MatrixSymbol\nimport numpy as np\nx = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)\n# now output depends on x\nexpr = x[0,0]\nf = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')\n# returns 1.0 as expected, without failure\nf(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))\n```\nThis may seem like a silly issue (\"why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?\"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.\nI think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the context needed to address the issue, we'll need to search for specific classes, methods, and code snippets mentioned in the issue. Based on the issue description, it seems we're dealing with classes and methods related to `autowrap` and the Cython backend within SymPy's codebase. The relevant entities mentioned include:\n\n- The `autowrap` function.\n- The handling of `MatrixSymbol` as function arguments.\n- The generation mechanism of the corresponding C function, especially its argument types handling mechanism.\n\nTo dive deeper into these areas, we can perform the following searches:\n\n1. Search for the `autowrap` function to understand how it's implemented and how it decides on the function signatures for the generated C code.\n2. Search for classes or methods that deal with `MatrixSymbol` arguments within the context of `autowrap` to see how these are processed.\n3. Search for code that involves the generation of C function signatures, specifically looking for where the argument type (e.g., `double` vs. `double *`) is determined based on the `expr` and `args`.\n\nGiven this, the API calls we can make are:\n\n1. `search_method(\"autowrap\")`: To find the implementation details of the `autowrap` function.\n2. `search_class(\"MatrixSymbol\")`: To get more context on how `MatrixSymbol` instances are handled throughout the codebase, which could affect their handling in `autowrap`.\n3. `search_code(\"double autofunc(double x)\")`: This snippet seems central to the issue, indicating a potential mishandling of argument types for the generated C function. Understanding where and how this line is generated will be crucial to resolving the bug."
