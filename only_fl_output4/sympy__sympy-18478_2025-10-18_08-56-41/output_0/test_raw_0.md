Here's a `reproducer.py` script that you can run to reproduce the issue described. The script checks the evaluation of expressions `(x+cos(x)).subs(x,oo)` and `(exp(x)+cos(x)).subs(x,oo)`, ensuring they behave as expected. If they do not, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints a detailed stack trace to help identify the issue.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_issue():
    from sympy import symbols, cos, exp, oo

    x = symbols('x')

    # Test cases
    expr1 = (x + cos(x)).subs(x, oo)
    expr2 = (exp(x) + cos(x)).subs(x, oo)

    # Expected behavior
    try:
        assert expr1 == oo, "Expected (x + cos(x)).subs(x, oo) to evaluate to oo"
        assert expr2 != expr1, "Expected (exp(x) + cos(x)).subs(x, oo) to evaluate differently than (x + cos(x)).subs(x, oo)"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_issue()
    except AssertionError:
        exit(1)
    print("Issue not found or has been fixed.")
    exit(0)
```

This script assumes the issue is present, and it will raise an `AssertionError` if the output of the substitution doesn't match the expected outcomes outlined. When you run this in the project's root directory using Python 3, it will demonstrate whether the issue is still there. If the assumptions made about the fixes are incorrect, or there has been a misunderstanding about the expected results, you might need to adjust the assertions accordingly.
