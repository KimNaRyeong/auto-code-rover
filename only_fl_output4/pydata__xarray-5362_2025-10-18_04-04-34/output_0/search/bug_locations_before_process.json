        "intended_behavior": "Before executing the mean calculation, implement a dimension existence check within the `mean` method. This validation should iterate over the `dim` parameter (which may be a single dimension name or an iterable of dimension names) and verify that each specified dimension exists within the dataset associated with the weighted object. If any of the dimensions do not exist, the method should raise a descriptive `ValueError` indicating which dimension(s) are invalid. This change ensures that users are immediately informed about the misuse of the method with non-existent dimensions, thus making the library's behavior consistent with other operations that already perform such checks. This validation step should be executed before any calculations are initiated, thereby preserving the existing functionality for cases where the dimensions are valid."
