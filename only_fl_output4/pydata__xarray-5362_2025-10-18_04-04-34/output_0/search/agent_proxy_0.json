            "content": "To address the issue regarding weighted operations not raising an error when the dimensions passed don't exist in the xarray library, we should first gather some context about where and how weighted operations are implemented. Specifically, we need to look into the classes and methods that process these operations. From the issue description, it's clear the `weighted` function and its subsequent mean operation (`mean`) are central to the problem. Let's start by finding where these are defined and used within the xarray codebase.\n\n1. To understand how weighted operations are set up, we need to find where the `weighted` method is defined. Hence, we'll search for the `weighted` method. Since the issue doesn't specify which class contains this method, we'll search the entire codebase.\n2. Once we know where `weighted` is defined, understanding the implementation of aggregation functions like `mean` within the context of weighted objects is crucial. Thus, we'll also search for the `mean` method in the context of weighted operations.\n3. Lastly, since the issue mentions a discrepancy between weighted and unweighted operations in terms of dimension existence verification, it might be useful to search for code snippets where dimension checks occur in similar contexts to get an idea of how this is typically handled in the project.\n\nTherefore, the necessary API calls are:\n\n- `search_method(\"weighted\")`\n- `search_method(\"mean\")`\n- `search_code(\"dimension check\")`"
