        "intended_behavior": "Within `run.py`, the modification should firstly introduce the capability to parse and understand the new `--fail-on` command-line argument. This requires extending the `argparse` logic to accept `--fail-on` and processing it to filter specific issue types or codes as specified by the user.\nSecondly, after the linting process concludes, before deciding on the exit code based on the `--fail-under` score threshold, the code should evaluate whether any of the issues detected match the criteria defined by `--fail-on`. If any issues match, regardless of the linting score, an error exit code should be returned.\nThis behavior must preserve existing functionality, such as `--fail-under`, while adding the new conditional fail logic. It should act as an additional layer of condition that, if met, precedes other considerations for determining the exit code.\nAdding support for the `--fail-on` option will involve not only parsing the option but also adjusting the linting result evaluation process. The evaluation should maintain its original function, where it exits with an error code if the score is under the specified threshold while also incorporating the new logic to check for specific issue types or codes and fail if they are present, regardless of the score."
