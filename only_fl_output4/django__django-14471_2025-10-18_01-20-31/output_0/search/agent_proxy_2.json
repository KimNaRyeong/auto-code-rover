This change would enable `process_view` (or other calling contexts) to handle the exception appropriately by rejecting the request early without the additional, unnecessary steps of token regeneration.

Upon catching this exception, it directly rejects the request using the reason included in the exception (e.g., incorrect length or invalid characters of the CSRF token). This behavior ensures a clearer and more immediate response to requests with invalid CSRF tokens, streamlining the middleware's protection mechanism against CSRF attacks and enhancing the debugging experience for developers.
