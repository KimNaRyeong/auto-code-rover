Creating a Python script that accurately reproduces the described Sphinx documentation issue while fully automating Sphinx setup and execution within a single script is quite complex, given the nature of Sphinx as an external tool with project-based configuration and the need to inspect generated HTML content for validation. However, I'll attempt to design a more thoughtfully structured Python script that approaches the task by simulating the steps needed to set up a Sphinx project, generate documentation, and then inspect the output for the specific issue. This revised script will encapsulate the process into functions and attempt to verify the presence of the issue programmatically.

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys

def setup_sphinx_project():
    """
    Sets up a minimal Sphinx project to emulate the issue.
    """
    # Ensure the directories exist
    os.makedirs("docs", exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs("docs/source", exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs("docs/source/_static", exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs("docs/source/_templates", exist_ok=True)

    # Create minimal Sphinx configuration
    with open("docs/source/conf.py", "w") as conf_file:
        conf_file.write("""
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))
extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'sphinx.ext.napoleon']
project = 'Issue Reproduction'
        """)

    # Create an index file
    with open("docs/source/index.rst", "w") as index_file:
        index_file.write("""
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

.. autoclass:: reproducible.A
        """)

    # Create a Python module with a class to document
    with open("reproducible.py", "w") as module_file:
        module_file.write("""
class A:
    """
    Attributes
    ----------
    hello_: int
        Description for hello_ attribute.
    """
    pass
        """)

def build_documentation():
    """
    Build the Sphinx documentation.
    """
    command = ["sphinx-build", "-b", "html", "docs/source", "docs/build"]
    subprocess.check_call(command, stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)

def check_output_for_issue():
    """
    Check the generated HTML for the issue.
    """
    with open("docs/build/index.html", "r") as f:
        content = f.read()
        assert 'hello\\_' not in content, "Backslash found in attribute name."

def main():
    try:
        setup_sphinx_project()
        build_documentation()
        check_output_for_issue()
        print("Issue fixed or not present.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
        sys.exit(1)

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This revised `reproducer.py` will:

1. Create a minimal Sphinx documentation setup in a temporary `docs` directory.
2. Add a Python module with a class and a properly formatted docstring expected to reproduce the issue.
3. Call Sphinx to build the HTML documentation.
4. Look for the presence of the specific issue within the generated HTML file.

It's worth noting, though, the script assumes certain prerequisites and environment conditions (like the presence of Sphinx and its extensions installed in the active Python environment). The script also avoids handling all potential errors for clarity and brevity.
