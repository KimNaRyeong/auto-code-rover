For a more accurate reproduction that may better address the issue presented, let's try a different approach. I'll write a Python script that directly manipulates the Django models and attempts to simulate the migration from a UUIDField to a ForeignKey, and then it will check if this creates the necessary migration dependencies. This script does not depend on dynamically patching Django internals but focuses more on simulating the steps that lead to the error and checking for the correct behavior.

```python
import os
import sys
import django
from django.db import migrations, models
from django.db.migrations.exceptions import NodeNotFoundError
from django.db.migrations.autodetector import MigrationAutodetector
from django.db.migrations.graph import MigrationGraph
from django.db.migrations.state import ProjectState

os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'testproject.settings'
django.setup()

from django.apps import apps

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_test_migration(from_state, to_state):
    """
    Attempts to create a test migration from the given app states.
    """
    autodetector = MigrationAutodetector(
        from_state,
        to_state,
        questioner=None,
    )
    changes = autodetector.changes(graph=MigrationGraph())
    return changes

try:

    from_state = ProjectState.from_apps(apps)
    # You would normally define the changes to your models here.
    # E.g., changing a UUIDField to a ForeignKey.
    
    to_state = from_state.clone()

    # Pretend we change App1.another_app from UUIDField to ForeignKey pointing to App2 model.
    # This is a simplified representation that might not directly translate to your models.
    App1_model = to_state.apps.get_model('testapp1', 'App1')
    App1_model._meta.get_field('another_app').__class__ = models.ForeignKey
    # Set up the new field properties. This doesn't cover all required attributes for a ForeignKey.
    App1_model._meta.get_field('another_app').remote_field = models.ManyToOneRel(App1_model, 'testapp2', 'app2')
    App1_model._meta.get_field('another_app').remote_field.model = 'testapp2.App2'
    
    changes = create_test_migration(from_state, to_state)
    
    if not changes:
        raise AssertionError("Migration was not created as expected.")
    else:
        # Here we'd check if dependencies on App2 are properly set in the migration file,
        # which we simulated by the `changes` variable.
        # This is a mock-up logic:
        app1_changes = changes.get('testapp1')
        if app1_changes and any(isinstance(op, migrations.AddField) for migration in app1_changes for op in migration.operations):
            print("Migration created. Now checking for correctly set dependencies...")
            # Note: Further logic required to fully check dependency correctness.
        else:
            raise AssertionError("No AddField operation found for App1; likely missing FK dependency.")
    
    print("If this message is printed, the initial issue was likely not accurately simulated.")
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)
```

Please note, the above script contains a high-level approach which attempts to simulate the process of detecting model changes and generating migrations but doesn't directly execute or validate SQL statements or Django's internal migration application logic. It assumes a certain structure and intention based on your description, which might not perfectly align with all Django versions or usages. You will need to adjust the paths and model names according to your project, and more intricate logic might be required to fully emulate the Django migration behavior, especially for validating the migrations' dependency resolution.
