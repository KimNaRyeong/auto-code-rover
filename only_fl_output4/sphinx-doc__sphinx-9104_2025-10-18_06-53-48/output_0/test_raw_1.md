Given the specific requirements for reproducing the issue you're facing and the constraints around the environment setup, including the availability of `sphinx-build`, I'm going to adjust the approach slightly. We'll check if Sphinx is installed, run the Sphinx build process, and then parse the output for the specific warning message. If the necessary tools aren't available, the script will indicate this instead of incorrectly reporting that the issue is not present.

Here is an updated version of `reproducer.py`:

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_sphinx_installed():
    try:
        subprocess.check_output(['sphinx-build', '--version'])
        return True
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return False

def run_sphinx():
    if not check_sphinx_installed():
        print("Sphinx is not installed, please install Sphinx to run this reproducer.")
        sys.exit(1)
    try:
        output = subprocess.check_output(['sphinx-build', '-b', 'html', '.', '_build'], stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, text=True)
        if "WARNING: py:class reference target not found: .." in output:
            print("Issue detected: Sphinx 'py:class reference target not found: ..' warning is present.")
            sys.exit(1)
        else:
            print("No issues detected. The Sphinx warning did not appear.")
            sys.exit(0)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print(f"Error running Sphinx. Output:\n{e.output}")
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_sphinx()
```

Please ensure that:

1. Your Sphinx project is correctly set up in the current directory where you'll run this script. The script assumes the Sphinx `conf.py` file is in the current directory and the build directory is `_build`. Adjust the paths in the `subprocess.check_output` call if your setup differs.

2. Sphinx is installed in your environment. The script checks if `sphinx-build` is accessible in the system's PATH and will exit with a message if it's not found.

Remember, this script doesn't automatically generate or modify Sphinx configuration or source files such as `conf.py` or `index.rst`. You should have a Sphinx project set up before running this script, and it should include the problematic code or configuration that leads to the issue you've described. If necessary, adjust the script's `subprocess.check_output` arguments to fit your project's structure.
