To address the task as specified, we'll write a Python script named `reproducer.py` aimed at reproducing the outlined matplotlib issue regarding `cla()` and `clf()` not unsetting the `.axes` and `.figure` attributes of deparented artists correctly. This script will specifically test the clearing of axes with `cla()` and check if the `.axes` attribute of a line artist becomes `None`, which it should according to the described issue. If the issue is present, the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace. Conversely, if the issue is resolved (i.e., the `.axes` attribute is correctly unset), the script will exit with code 0, indicating success.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    # Use matplotlib to create a figure, an axis, and a line plot on that axis
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    line, = ax.plot([1, 2])

    # Call cla() to clear the axis
    ax.cla()

    # After clearing the axis, verify if the line's `.axes` attribute is unset (i.e., should be None)
    try:
        assert line.axes is None, "line.axes should be None after ax.cla()"
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exit with non-zero code indicating the issue is present

    print("Issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproduce_issue()
```

This script thoroughly tests the scenario presented in the original issue report. Based on the outcome of the assertion, it either prints a stack trace detailing the failure (if the issue exists) or indicates a resolution to the problem by cleanly exiting. While this script is written with the information provided, the actual behavior when run will depend on the version of matplotlib used and whether any fixes have been applied to address this issue in subsequent updates post-`mpl2.0b3`.
