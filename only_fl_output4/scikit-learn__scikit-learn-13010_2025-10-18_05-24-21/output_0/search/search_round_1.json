I can convert the array to a larger precision but when working with a larger dataset the memory saved by using float16 on smaller numbers kind of matter. The error is mostly on numpy. Adding the dtype on the mean/std calculation does it but I'm not sure if that how people here would like to do it.\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nsample = np.full([10_000_000, 1], 10.0, dtype=np.float16)\nStandardScaler().fit_transform(sample)\n```\n#### Expected Results\nThe normalized array\n#### Actual Results\n```\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/_methods.py:36: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in reduce\nreturn umr_sum(a, axis, dtype, out, keepdims, initial)\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/fromnumeric.py:86: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in reduce\nreturn ufunc.reduce(obj, axis, dtype, out, **passkwargs)\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/core/_methods.py:36: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in reduce\nreturn umr_sum(a, axis, dtype, out, keepdims, initial)\n/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/preprocessing/data.py:765: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in true_divide\nX /= self.scale_\narray([[nan],\n[nan],\n[nan],\n...,\n[nan],\n[nan],\n[nan]], dtype=float16)\n```\n#### Versions\n```\nSystem:\npython: 3.6.6 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Oct  9 2018, 12:34:16)  [GCC 7.3.0]\nexecutable: /opt/conda/bin/python\nmachine: Linux-4.9.0-5-amd64-x86_64-with-debian-9.4\nBLAS:\nmacros: SCIPY_MKL_H=None, HAVE_CBLAS=None\nlib_dirs: /opt/conda/lib\ncblas_libs: mkl_rt, pthread\nPython deps:\npip: 18.1\nsetuptools: 39.1.0\nsklearn: 0.20.2\nnumpy: 1.16.0\nscipy: 1.1.0\nCython: 0.29.2\npandas: 0.23.4\n```\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\nFrom the search results, we have some initial insights into how `StandardScaler` is implemented in the scikit-learn library (`sklearn`). Let's analyze them in relation to the submitted issue.\n\n#### StandardScaler Class\n- The `StandardScaler` class is found in `sklearn/preprocessing/data.py`. It includes the following methods relevant to our discussion: `__init__`, `_reset`, `fit`, `partial_fit`, `transform`, and `inverse_transform`.\n- There is no method explicitly named `fit_transform` or `_compute_mean_std` within the `StandardScaler` class. However, the absence of `fit_transform` in the search results might be due to it being inherited from a parent class or mixed in via a mixin that implements `fit_transform` by utilizing the existing `fit` and `transform` methods.\n- The `StandardScaler.fit` method is crucial because it computes the mean and std for later scaling. This method resets internal state and defers to `partial_fit` for the actual computation. This implies that `partial_fit` does the heavy lifting of computing statistics that are potentially affected by the overflow issue described.\n\n#### Relationship to the Bug\n- The overflow issue is likely occurring during the computation processes in `partial_fit`, which is, as indicated by the `fit` method's code, responsible for calculating the mean and standard deviation used in scaling.\n- Since `fit_transform` wasn't directly found, but `fit` ultimately calls `partial_fit`, it's reasonable to deduce that the overflow occurs during these calculations or operations that are a part of `partial_fit`.\n\n#### Intended Behavior and Issue\n- The intended behavior is for `StandardScaler` to compute accurate mean and standard deviation values for datasets, regardless of the numpy data type, and utilize them to scale the data without causing overflow errors.\n- Given the issue description, the problem seems to stem from the handling of `float16` data types during these statistical computations. There is a need for the method to either adjust its computational strategy based on the data type or ensure that operations prone to overflow are safely managed.\n\n### Next Steps for Insight\nTo bridge the gaps in our understanding, we need context on how `partial_fit` is implemented since it is directly called by `fit` and likely manages the computations causing overflow. Additionally, understanding how NumPy's `mean` and `std` calculations are performed within scikit-learn's context could hint at potential solutions. Here are some API calls that could provide this context:\n\n- search_method_in_class(\"partial_fit\", \"StandardScaler\") - to understand how mean and std are computed and possibly causing overflow.\n- search_code(\"numpy.mean\") and search_code(\"numpy.std\") - to find how NumPy's mean and std methods are utilized in scikit-learn, since the direct search for these methods didn't yield results.\n- Given the inheritance and mixin patterns in scikit-learn, it might be useful to understand how `fit_transform` is expected to function in the context of `StandardScaler`, even if it inherits this method from a mixin or a parent class. Since no direct information was returned, examining parent classes or mixins could be an approach but may require knowledge outside the scope of provided API capabilities."
