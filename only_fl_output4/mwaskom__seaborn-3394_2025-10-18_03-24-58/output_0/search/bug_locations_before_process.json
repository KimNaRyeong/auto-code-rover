        "intended_behavior": "The `lineplot` function should maintain the axis ordering consistent with the input data, regardless of the presence of `pd.NA`. It means ensuring that during data preparation before plotting, `pd.NA` values are handled in a way that does not affect sorting or ordering of the axis. This might involve better integration or checks during the data transformation steps that happen prior to plotting, such as ensuring that `pd.NA` values are treated correctly in comparisons or sorting operations, without reversing the axis order. The fix should ensure that the presence of `pd.NA` does not lead to automatic or unintended reordering of plot axes, thus maintaining a predictable and consistent plotting behavior that aligns with user expectations."

        "intended_behavior": "While the direct issue doesn\u2019t stem from this specific location, the handling of `pd.NA` shown here represents seaborn\u2019s approach to dealing with pandas' newer missing value type. The intended change is not in the method itself but suggests a broader review and possibly updating other areas of the seaborn codebase to consistently manage `pd.NA` in a way that does not impact the logical flow or output of the visualization functions. Specifically, it would involve ensuring that wherever `pd.NA` values could impact plot outputs (beyond Boolean scaling), those areas should correctly interpret `pd.NA` to either exclude such values from affecting plot scales, legends, or axis ordering, or handle them in a manner that matches user expectations and pandas behavior closely."
