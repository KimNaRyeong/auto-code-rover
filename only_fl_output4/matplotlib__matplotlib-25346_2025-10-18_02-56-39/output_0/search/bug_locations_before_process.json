        "intended_behavior": "This method should accurately recalculate and adjust layout spaces considering the extra space needed for text when titles wrap. Specifically, it needs to account for the height that wrapped titles occupy and adjust the layout to prevent titles from overlapping with axes or getting clipped. This might involve enhancements in how space requirements are calculated for text elements, ensuring that the engine dynamically updates layout constraints when text wrapping changes the required space. The functionality to detect and adjust for wrapped text should preserve the current ability of the layout engine to adapt to various elements and sizes, enhancing it to better accommodate wrapped titles."

        "method": "set_title",
        "intended_behavior": "While the method currently sets the title's position and styling, it could be enhanced to notify the layout engine when a title is set with wrapping that would cause it to occupy more space than a single line. This behavior requires integration with the constrained layout system to ensure that any time a title is set (or updated) with wrapping enabled, the layout engine recalculates the necessary space. A possible approach could include adding a mechanism to flag a need for layout recalculation when text wrapping occurs, preserving its existing functionality while ensuring it contributes to a layout that accommodates wrapped text adequately."
