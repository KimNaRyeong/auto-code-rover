Certainly! Below is a standalone Python script (`reproducer.py`) designed to reproduce the issue you are encountering. This script creates a table from a list of dictionaries where some keys map to empty arrays. It tries to print these tables, expecting it should work seamlessly. However, if the issue is present, it will catch the `IndexError` and use `print_stacktrace` to display the details. It exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed, meaning the script will not raise any `AssertionError` in that case.

```python
import numpy as np
from astropy.table import QTable

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    events = [
        {"A": 0, "B": 0, "C": np.array([], dtype=np.uint64)},
        {"A": 1, "B": 0, "C": np.array([], dtype=np.uint64)},
        {"A": 2, "B": 2, "C": np.array([0, 1], dtype=np.uint64)}
    ]
    
    try:
        # Trying with the first two events which have empty arrays for "C"
        print("Attempting to print table with rows having 0-length array cells...")
        table = QTable(rows=events[:2])
        print(table)
    except IndexError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.")

    # If we got here, then no exception was raised, and the issue is fixed
    print("No issue detected; the expected behavior is achieved.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Here's a quick rundown of how the script works:

1. Defines a function `print_stacktrace` that, given an exception, prints its stack trace with filenames, line numbers, and the error message.
2. In the `main` function, creates a table from a list of dictionaries where some dictionaries have empty arrays.
3. Tries to print the table with rows that should cause the issue according to the initial report.
4. If an `IndexError` is caught, it prints the stack trace and raises an `AssertionError` to indicate that the issue is present.
5. If no error is raised, it prints a message indicating that no issue was detected, which means the error should be considered fixed.

You can run this script in the root directory of your project by executing `python3 reproducerer.py` in your terminal. This should help with diagnosing the issue according to your requirements.
