We need to identify the method or part of the code handling this conversion. Let's start with some targeted search calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"latex\")`: Since the issue mentions a method that seems to convert expressions to LaTeX, looking for a method named `latex` or similar could be a good starting point.\n2. `search_code(\"latex(ln\")`: This could help us find where in the code the `ln` function is being specifically handled or converted.\n3. `search_code(\"log{\\left\")`: This search can help trace where the incorrect LaTeX conversion `log{\\left(10\\right)}` is generated.\n"
