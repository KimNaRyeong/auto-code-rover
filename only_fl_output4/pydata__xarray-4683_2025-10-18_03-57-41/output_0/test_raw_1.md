Based on the given requirements and considering that the previous attempt to execute the test did not yield the desired result due to compatibility issues and not directly due to the logic within the script intended to reproduce the original issue cited, here is an updated standalone script. This script should be executed in an environment where the xarray version is correctly installed and doesn't have compatibility issues with the available NumPy version. I've simplified the script slightly to ensure readability and straightforward execution. Ensure that the Python environment has xarray installed with the correct version for this reproduction script to operate as intended.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import xarray as xr

    try:
        print("xarray version:", xr.__version__)
        data_array = xr.DataArray([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
        # Attempt to use the 'order' keyword argument with astype
        result = data_array.astype(dtype='d', order='F').values.strides
        # Define expected result based on previous compatible behavior
        expected = (8, 16)
        assert result == expected, "Result does not match expected output."
        print("Test PASSED: 'order' parameter works as expected.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("\nFailed: The output does not match expected strides indicating a potential issue or change in behavior.")
        raise
    except TypeError as e:
        if "unexpected keyword argument 'order'" in str(e):
            print_stacktrace(e)
            print("\nFailed: 'order' parameter is not accepted, reproducing the reported issue.")
        else:
            print("An unexpected TypeError occurred.")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script is aimed to be directly run in a Python environment setup with the appropriate xarray version where the failure condition was originally observed. Upon executing, it will either:

- Assert the presence of the issue by failing to accept the 'order' argument, which aligns with the reported bug.
- Pass if the 'order' keyword argument is handled correctly, suggesting that the issue has been resolved in the utilized xarray version or that the testing environment does not replicate the originally reported conditions.

Do ensure the testing environment is correctly configured with dependencies that are compatible with the xarray versions being tested.
