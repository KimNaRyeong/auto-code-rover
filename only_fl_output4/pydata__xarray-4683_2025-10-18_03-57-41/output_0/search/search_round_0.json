The documentation at http://xarray.pydata.org/en/v0.16.0/generated/xarray.DataArray.astype.html\nstill has this snippet\n> order ({'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional) \u2013 Controls the memory layout order of the result. \u2018C\u2019 means C order, \u2018F\u2019 means Fortran order, \u2018A\u2019 means \u2018F\u2019 order if all the arrays are Fortran contiguous, \u2018C\u2019 order otherwise, and \u2018K\u2019 means as close to the order the array elements appear in memory as possible. Default is \u2018K\u2019.\n(which was identical to the documentation from numpy.ndarray.astype at https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.astype.html)\nwhile http://xarray.pydata.org/en/v0.16.1/generated/xarray.DataArray.astype.html seems to lack that part.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving the issue where the `astype` method lost its `order` parameter in the transition from xarray version 0.15.1 to 0.16.2, we should start by investigating the `astype` method within the `DataArray` class. Given the details of the issue, the following API calls would be appropriate to get more context:\n\n1. Search for the `DataArray` class to find the file or files it is defined in:\n   ```\n   search_class(\"DataArray\")\n   ```\n   \n2. Once the file for the `DataArray` class is identified, search for the `astype` method within that file. This would tell us where the method is defined:\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"astype\", \"DataArray\")\n   ```\n   \n3. Gather information on the changes made to the `astype` method, which might include looking at the method's implementation details to understand if the `order` parameter is being used or handled differently, or if it has been deprecated:\n   ```\n   search_code(\"def astype\")\n   ```\n\n4. Lastly, investigate the release notes or documentation changes related to the `astype` method around versions 0.16.0 to 0.16.2. This step is more about understanding the rationale behind the change, which may not directly translate to an API call but is crucial for addressing the issue comprehensively.\n\nThese API calls should provide sufficient information to understand the modifications made to the `astype` method in the `DataArray` class, specifically regarding the handling of the `order` parameter."
