        "intended_behavior": "The method should ensure that all incoming input data `X` is in a supported numerical format before proceeding with fitting the model. If `X` is of boolean dtype, it should be converted to float dtype. This step will preserve the existing functionality for numerical input while extending support for boolean input by converting it to float, thus preventing the TypeError. This behavior aligns with how other linear models in scikit-learn, like `LinearRegression`, implicitly handle boolean predictors."

        "intended_behavior": "While the direct bug fix might primarily involve changes before this function is called (e.g., within `.fit`), ensuring that this function either checks the input type or is documented to require numerical input could improve clarity and maintainability. However, the primary change would be in how data is prepared before it reaches this function, as described in Location 1. No changes are required directly in this function to resolve the issue, assuming all conversions are handled upstream (in the `.fit` method)."
