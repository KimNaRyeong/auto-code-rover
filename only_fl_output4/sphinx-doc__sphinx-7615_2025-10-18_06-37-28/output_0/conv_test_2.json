In pure Docutils, they are renderer properly according with RST spec.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nThe following snippet demonstrantes buggy rendering. \r\n```\r\nTwo \\\\\r\n\r\nThree \\\\\\\r\n\r\nFour \\\\\\\\\r\n\r\nFive \\\\\\\\\\\r\n\r\nSix \\\\\\\\\\\\\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nTwo backslashes should be rendered as `\\`. Three still as `\\`. Four and five as `\\\\`. Six as `\\\\\\` and so on. This is how it works in Docutils.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/383059/80948942-5cb29c00-8df3-11ea-8fe9-ca4bc390eef9.png)\r\n\r\n**Environment info**\r\n- OS: Linux\r\n- Python version: 3.6\r\n- Sphinx version: 3.0.2\r\n- Sphinx extensions:  none\n"
