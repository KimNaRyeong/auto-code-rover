The issue mentions changing from `get_template` to `select_template`. The relevant files and methods are likely within Django's template handling subsystem. \n\nWe will start by locating where the `Include` template tag is defined and then find the usage of `get_template` that needs to be replaced with `select_template`. The following API calls are selected to gather sufficient context:\n\n- search_class(\"IncludeNode\"): To find the definition of the class handling the `{% include %}` template tag.\n- search_method(\"get_template\"): To find usages of `get_template` method in the codebase, which might reveal its usage in the context of include tags.\n- search_method(\"select_template\"): To understand how `select_template` is used elsewhere in the codebase, providing insight on how to implement it for the issue at hand."
