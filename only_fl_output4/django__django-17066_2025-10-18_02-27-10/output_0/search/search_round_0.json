However, migrations serializer doesn't have any special facilities for ensuring stable output for sets and this is what causes annoying diffs for us all the time.\nI suggest to add a trivial serializer specifically for unordered sequences which ensures stable output no matter the iteration order. Stability can be achieved by sorting elements in the set by their string representation. This only affects the writer output, and doesn't interfere with the rest of Django in any way, so this change only improves developer experience, but has no effect on the performance and/or reliability.\nI hope that even though it's apparently not a major problem for most users you would still accept the fix to ensure stable migration writer output for the rest of us.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand how Django's migration system serializes sets, particularly in the context of `unique_together` and `index_together` constraints. Given the nature of the issue, the problem likely resides within the serialization process of migration files, possibly within a class or method responsible for handling the serialization of model state changes, such as constraints.\n\nSince the issue revolves around serialization unstability due to Python's set behavior, our focus should be on finding the code responsible for serializing the `unique_together` and `index_together` configurations in the migration files. Likely targets include methods or classes related to migration serialization, specifically how sets are handled.\n\nTo get the necessary context for devising a patch, the following API calls will be useful:\n\n1. **Search for migration serializer classes.** Since the issue mentions serialization, we should first locate the class responsible for migration serialization. The class name might not be straightforward; however, names like `MigrationSerializer`, `Serializer`, or anything related to migration and serialization should be our focus.\n\n2. **Search for methods responsible for handling `unique_together` and `index_together`.** These may not be directly called `unique_together` or `index_together` but rather could involve generic serialization routines that handle various types of fields, including sets.\n\nGiven these considerations, the initial set of API calls could include:\n- `search_class(\"MigrationSerializer\")`\n- `search_method(\"serialize\")`\n- `search_code(\"unique_together\")`\n- `search_code(\"index_together\")`\n\nThese searches aim to locate the relevant parts of the codebase where changes could be introduced to ensure the stable serialization of sets, thereby eliminating the non-deterministic order issue mentioned."
