        "content": "<issue>handle Decimal in json encoder\nThe `simplejson` removal (#3555) decreased the flask encoding capabilities as the built-in `json` doesn't cover cases like `Decimal` types. The solution seems to be: overwrite the flask app encoder with `JSONEnconder` from `simplejson`, but this incorporates a problem for users that relies on both `Decimal` and `datetimes` as `simplejon` doesn't handle `datetimes`, while flask encoder does. The solution I found is to build a custom encoder that tests if the value is `Decimal` and gives it to `simplejson`, otherwise, handles it with the default flask app encoder. My suggestion is to incorporate a simple test in the flask encoder to add `Decimal` coverage, that would remove any residual dependency on `simplejson`. The str(decimal) was taken from: [simplejson/encoder.py#L511](https://github.com/simplejson/simplejson/blob/8bef979ad8272cbc2903970f4b9992f603d50973/simplejson/encoder.py#L511)\n```python\nfrom flask import json as fjson\nfrom flask.json import JSONEncoder\nimport simplejson as sjson\nimport decimal\nfrom datetime import datetime\nrdatetime = datetime.strptime('1/1/2008 1:30 PM', '%m/%d/%Y %I:%M %p')\nrdecimal = decimal.Decimal(10)\nobj = {'datetime':rdatetime,'decimal':rdecimal}\nfjson.dumps(obj) #Doesn't work because of decimal\nsjson.dumps(obj) #Doesn't work because of datetimes\n```\nThe custom encoder:\n```python\nclass CustomJSONEncoder(JSONEncoder):\n'''\nAdd Decimal coverage\n'''\ndef default(self, o):\nif isinstance(o, decimal.Decimal):\nreturn str(o)\nreturn super().default(o)\napp.json_encoder = CustomJSONEncoder\n```\nThe expected behavior is to work with both `Decimal` and `datetimes`  as it used to work on Flask version 1.1.2\nEnvironment:\n- Python version: 3.8.10\n- Flask version: 2.0.1 and 1.1.2\n- Simplejson(Optional) version: 3.17.2\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context around the classes, methods, and pieces of code mentioned in the bug report. Specifically, we should focus on how Flask's JSON encoding currently handles types that are not natively supported by Python's built-in `json` module, such as `Decimal` and `datetime` objects. We should also investigate the customization of the JSON encoder in Flask, which seems to be crucial for supporting these types.\n\nTo achieve this, we will perform the following API calls:\n\n1. Search for the Flask `JSONEncoder` class to understand its current implementation and how it can be extended or modified to support `Decimal` types in addition to its existing capabilities.\n   \n2. Since the custom encoder extends Flask's `JSONEncoder`, we should look into the `default` method, as this is likely where the type checking and special handling occur. This will provide insight into how we can add support for `Decimal`.\n\n3. The code snippet provided suggests modifying the Flask app's JSON encoder directly (`app.json_encoder = CustomJSONEncoder`). This implies interaction between the Flask application configuration and the custom JSON encoder. Searching for similar uses in the codebase might reveal how Flask facilitates the customization of JSON encoding for the whole application.\n\nHere are the specific API calls we will make:\n\n- `search_class(\"JSONEncoder\")`: To find the implementation of Flask's `JSONEncoder`, which we need to extend.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"default\", \"JSONEncoder\")`: To inspect the `default` method of the `JSONEncoder` class where we can add our custom handling for `Decimal` types.\n- `search_code(\"app.json_encoder =\")`: To see how the Flask app's JSON encoder is typically customized or overridden in the project, offering insights into established practices or patterns that could influence our solution.\n\nThese calls should give us a solid foundation for understanding how to implement a patch that integrates `Decimal` handling into Flask's JSON encoding process."
