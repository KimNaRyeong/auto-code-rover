Corresponding to this change, minor changes need to be brought in the schema.tests.SchemaTests.test_func_unique_constraint_lookups test.\nThe PR generated is \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/15569\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides insights into the `RegisterLookupMixin` class, and specifically the methods `register_lookup` and `_unregister_lookup`, which are directly related to the issue.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\n- The `RegisterLookupMixin` class is likely a utility within Django's ORM layer that allows for the registration and unregistration of lookup types. These lookup types are used to extend the query capabilities of Django models.\n\n- The `register_lookup` method allows adding a new lookup to the class. It assigns the lookup to the `class_lookups` dictionary using `lookup_name` as the key. After adding the lookup, it clears cached lookups by calling `_clear_cached_lookups`, ensuring the new lookup is available for use immediately without being hindered by stale cache entries.\n\n- The `_unregister_lookup` method removes a lookup from the `class_lookups` dictionary using `lookup_name`. It is marked for use in tests and is noted as not being thread-safe. Currently, it lacks the mechanism to clear the cache after a lookup is unregistered, implying that removed lookups might still be accessible until the cache is manually cleared or invalidated in another way.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\n- The issue arises because, while `register_lookup` correctly clears the cache post-registration to ensure the lookups' immediate availability, `_unregister_lookup` does not clear the cache after a lookup is removed. This inconsistency can lead to potential bugs where unregistered lookups still influence query results due to their presence in the cache, leading to unexpected behavior or results in applications that dynamically register and unregister lookups.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\n- The intended behavior for `_unregister_lookup`, following the pattern established by `register_lookup`, would be to also clear the lookup cache after a lookup is successfully unregistered. This modification would enforce consistency in the management of lookups and their cache, ensuring that once a lookup is unregistered, it cannot affect query results.\n\nGiven this analysis, to address the issue:\n\n- The `_unregister_lookup` method should be modified to call the `_clear_cached_lookups` method after removing the lookup from `class_lookups`, mirroring the approach taken in `register_lookup`.\n\nFor the missing test information, it seems the initial search for `schema.tests.SchemaTests.test_func_unique_constraint_lookups` failed. This implies I should attempt a broader search for the test, possibly by searching for the file or class it resides in, as it may provide insights into how lookups are tested with unique constraints, allowing for better assessment of how the change impacts testing.\n\nThus, the next logical step is to search for the test file or class containing `test_func_unique_constraint_lookups`. Given the structure of Django's test suite, an alternative API call to search for \"SchemaTests\" might uncover the needed context:\n\n- `search_class(\"SchemaTests\")`: To locate the file and exact location of the `SchemaTests` within the Django project, aiming to find the specific test mentioned in the issue."

The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

Specifically, the method should be updated to call the `_clear_cached_lookups` after removing the lookup, as follows:\n\n  ```python\n  @classmethod\n  def _unregister_lookup(cls, lookup, lookup_name=None):\n      \"\"\"\n      Remove given lookup from cls lookups.
