        "intended_behavior": "The initialization method should include additional logic to validate the compatibility of the 'loss' parameter with the classification type. Specifically, when 'loss='categorical_crossentropy'' is set, the method should check if the classification is binary and either raise an informative error stating that 'categorical_crossentropy' is not compatible with binary classification or implement a mechanism to correctly handle binary classification with 'categorical_crossentropy'. This change ensures that the API's behavior aligns with user expectations and documented capabilities."

        "intended_behavior": "This method should be updated to correctly map 'categorical_crossentropy' for binary classification scenarios or, alternatively, enforce the correct usage of loss functions based on the classification task. If 'categorical_crossentropy' cannot naturally extend to binary classification within the current framework, an appropriate error should be raised to prevent silent failures. This modification ensures that loss function validation is robust, preventing logical mismatches between the task and the loss function used."
