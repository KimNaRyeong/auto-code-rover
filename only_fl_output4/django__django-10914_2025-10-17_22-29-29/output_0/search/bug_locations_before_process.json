        "intended_behavior": "The `_save` method should ensure that, after a file is saved to its final location on the filesystem, it explicitly checks and applies the file permissions defined by `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`. This includes handling files uploaded through both `MemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile` mechanisms. The functionality should remain unchanged, except for an additional step to verify and enforce the specified file permissions on the newly saved file. This approach ensures consistent file permissions aligned with the administrator's configuration, potentially mitigating security concerns arising from overly restrictive or permissive default permissions."

        "method": "",
        "intended_behavior": "Consider introducing a mechanism (either within `__init__`, `temporary_file_path`, or `close` method; but more context is needed to specify further) that enforces the application of `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` settings to the temporary file before it gets moved to its permanent location. This step would help in maintaining consistency in file permissions from the moment a file is uploaded and stored temporarily, to when it is permanently stored on the filesystem."
