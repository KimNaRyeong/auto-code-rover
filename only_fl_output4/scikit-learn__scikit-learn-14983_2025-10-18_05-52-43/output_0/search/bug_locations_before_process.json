        "intended_behavior": "Implement a `__repr__` method that provides an accurate and informative string representation of instances of `_RepeatedSplits` and its subclasses. This method should dynamically construct a string that includes the subclass name and initialization parameters such as `n_repeats` and `random_state` in a format that allows users to understand the configuration of the instance easily. The output should resemble `ClassName(n_repeats=10, random_state=None, ...)`, adapting as needed to include all relevant parameters. The primary goal is to address the current absence of a meaningful `__repr__` return value, ensuring it aligns with the expected Pythonic standards for an object's string representation, which could include, but not be limited to, details enabling one to recreate the class instance if desired."
