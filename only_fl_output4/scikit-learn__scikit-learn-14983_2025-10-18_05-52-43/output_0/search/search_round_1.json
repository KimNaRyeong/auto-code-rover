The provided code snippets for each class only include their `__init__` method, setting up parameters such as `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **What do these parts of the code do?**\n   \n   The code snippets define the initialization methods (`__init__`) for the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes, which are responsible for setting up instances of these classes with specified values for the number of splits, repeats, and an optional random state for reproducibility. The classes inherit from `_RepeatedSplits`, suggesting that any shared functionality, possibly including the `__repr__` method, is defined in the `_RepeatedSplits` class or further up the inheritance chain.\n\n2. **Relationship between this part of the code and the bug.**\n   \n   The issue with the incorrect `__repr__` strings for instances of these classes suggests that the `__repr__` method is either not implemented or not functioning correctly in these classes or in their superclass where it could have been inherited from. Since the initialization methods don't include a `__repr__` definition, it's likely that the implementation is intended to be inherited or is absent, resulting in the default representation provided by Python's object model.\n\n3. **Intended behavior of this part of the code.**\n   \n   The intended behavior, as suggested by the bug report, is for the `__repr__` method of both classes to return a string representation that includes the class name and the initialization parameters (`n_splits`, `n_repeats`, `random_state`) in a readable format. This format should match the constructor's signature to allow easy understanding and potentially recreating an instance from the representation.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next step should involve examining the `_RepeatedSplits` class from which both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` inherit. This will help to understand if the `__repr__` method is defined there and how it might be malfunctioning. If `_RepeatedSplits` does not provide a proper `__repr__` implementation, providing one in either this superclass or in each subclass directly may resolve the issue.\n\nTo proceed, the required action is to:\n- Inspect `_RepeatedSplits` to see if a `__repr__` method is defined and how it operates. This involves searching for the `_RepeatedSplits` class and its `__repr__` method definition if it exists."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

The method should dynamically reflect the actual class name for subclasses such as `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` to enhance readability and debuggability.
