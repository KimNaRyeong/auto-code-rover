Certainly! It seems there might have been an issue with the environment setup previously. Let's ensure we have a proper `reproducer.py`, taking into account any necessary checks and balances for a clean Python environment.

```python
def check_repr_issues():
    from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedKFold, RepeatedStratifiedKFold

    # Instantiate both classes without any constructor arguments
    rkf = RepeatedKFold()
    rskf = RepeatedStratifiedKFold()

    # Generate the repr strings for both instances
    rkf_repr = repr(rkf)
    rskf_repr = repr(rskf)

    # Define the expected repr strings based on default constructor values
    expected_rkf_repr = "RepeatedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)"
    expected_rskf_repr = "RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)"

    # Assert that the actual repr matches the expected repr
    assert rkf_repr == expected_rkf_repr, f"RKf repr mismatch. Expected: {expected_rkf_repr}. Found: {rkf_repr}"
    assert rskf_repr == expected_rskf_repr, f"RSKf repr mismatch. Expected: {expected_rskf_repr}. Found: {rskf_repr}"

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        check_repr_issues()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    else:
        print("No issues detected.")
        exit(0)
```

This script properly encapsulates the logic to check for the issue with the `__repr__` method of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` in scikit-learn, making use of the `print_stacktrace` function to provide an informative stack trace should an `AssertionError` occur. This makes it more straightforward for developers to diagnose and resolve the issue.
