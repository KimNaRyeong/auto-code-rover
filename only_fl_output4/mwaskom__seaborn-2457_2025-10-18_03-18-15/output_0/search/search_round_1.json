Therefore, our first goal is to find where `lineplot` is defined in the codebase.\n\n2. **Understand how `ci` is processed**: Once we find the `lineplot` method, we need to understand how the `ci` parameter is currently handled to identify where the warning and reformatting logic should be inserted.\n\n3. **Locate relevant helper functions or argument parsing mechanisms**: It's also possible that the handling of parameters like `ci` is abstracted away in helper functions or within argument parsing mechanisms used by `lineplot`. Identifying these parts of the code will be crucial for implementing the warning and reformatting logic effectively.\n\nTherefore, the API calls we should make to gather the necessary context are:\n\n- `search_method(\"lineplot\")`: To find the definition or implementations of the `lineplot` function within the codebase.\n- `search_code(\"ci=None\")`: To find instances where `ci` might be explicitly checked or set to `None` in the codebase. This could help identify if there are existing mechanisms or patterns for handling `ci` that would inform how we implement the required feature.\n\nLet's start with these API calls."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context, we'll focus on understanding the role of the found pieces in relation to the reported issue and how the intended behavior should be modified based on the issue description.\n\n### 1. Analysis of `lineplot` in `seaborn/relational.py`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThis part of the code defines the `lineplot` function which is part of seaborn's relational plot capabilities. It accepts a wide range of arguments to customize the plot, including `x`, `y`, `hue`, `size`, `style`, `ci`, and many others. Notably, it handles the `ci` parameter directly and also makes an internal call to `_deprecate_ci`, indicating there is some mechanism expected to deal with deprecation or reassignment for the `ci` parameter.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug**\n\nThe reported issue specifically targets this functionality, stating that when `ci=None`, the function should issue a warning and then internally reformat this argument to `errorbar=None`. The existing code already checks the `ci` parameter and performs some form of operation (`errorbar = _deprecate_ci(errorbar, ci)`) which might be closely related to the intended fix for this issue.\n\n- **Intended behavior**\n\nBased on the issue, when `ci=None` is supplied, the code should not only passively deprecate or handle the `ci` value but explicitly issue a warning to the user. Then, it should treat this scenario as if `errorbar=None` was passed directly, which isn't handled directly in the provided snippet but is hinted at with the deprecation mechanism.\n\nGiven this context, the next steps in addressing the issue would involve examining how `_deprecate_ci` functions and ensuring it can issue a warning appropriately. If `_deprecate_ci` is designed only to remap parameters without warning, its logic would need to be extended, or an additional check prior to this call may be needed to issue the warning when `ci=None`.\n\n### 2. Analysis of `ci=None` Usage in Codebase\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThe search for `ci=None` across the codebase highlights various places where the `ci` parameter is set or used with a value of `None`. This indicates that the handling or expectation of `ci=None` is spread across different parts of seaborn, not just within the `lineplot` function.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug**\n\nBeing a common parameter across multiple functions, any change to the handling of `ci=None` should be consistent and consider not just the `lineplot`, but also other functions that might deal with `ci` in a similar manner. The presence of `ci=None` in multiple files suggests a pervasive pattern that the proposed change might need to fit within.\n\n- **Intended behavior**\n\nThe uniform handling of `ci=None` across seaborn where, instead of simply accepting `None` as a \"no confidence interval\" indicator with no feedback to the user, the library should proactively inform the user that `ci=None` will be deprecated or transformed to `errorbar=None` for clarity and future proofing.\n\nGiven these insights, the resolution seems to involve a two-pronged approach: modify the specific handling of `ci` in `lineplot` to include a warning and possibly alter how `ci` is deprecated across seaborn. A careful review of `_deprecate_ci` and related logic across the mentioned files will be essential in crafting a solution that is both specific enough to solve the reported issue and general enough to maintain consistency across the library."

Following this warning, the function should internally handle the scenario as if `errorbar=None` were passed to ensure consistency with the intended new behavior. This modification should preserve the existing functionality of handling `ci` and `errorbar` parameters but enhance the user feedback mechanism and future-proof the argument handling mechanism.\n  \nThe necessary enhancement involves integrating a mechanism to issue warnings when deprecated usage patterns are detected (`ci=None`) and ensure that this pattern leads to consistent internal handling (`errorbar=None`). This change is primarily intended to improve the interface and user guidance without altering the fundamental plotting capabilities provided by the `lineplot` function."
