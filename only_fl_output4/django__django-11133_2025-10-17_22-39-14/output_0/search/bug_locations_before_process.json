        "intended_behavior": "The `content` setter should be explicitly designed to check if the input `value` is a `memoryview` object. If so, it should convert the `memoryview` to bytes before proceeding with the rest of the logic that already exists for handling iterable values or directly setting the `_container` list. This ensures that `memoryview` objects are treated equivalently to how bytes or str inputs are treated, preserving the original byte content of the `memoryview` when it is intended to be part of the HTTP response. The existing functionality for other types of content (e.g., strings, bytes, iterables) should remain unaffected by this change."
