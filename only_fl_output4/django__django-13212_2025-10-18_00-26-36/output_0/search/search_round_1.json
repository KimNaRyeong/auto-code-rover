Since the request specifically mentions built-in validators and the ability to override error messages with a %(value)s placeholder, we should focus on the core validation mechanics.\n\nFirst, let's identify where built-in validators are implemented. Django's validators are likely to be defined either in a common validators module or within specific field types. Let's initiate searches to find these validators and a common method or class that raises `ValidationError`.\n\n1. `search_class(\"ValidationError\")`: To find the definition of the `ValidationError` class, understanding its implementation will help us in modifying it to include the provided value.\n\n2. `search_method(\"validate_email\")`: As an example of a built-in validator, this method should give us an idea of how validators are currently implemented and how they raise errors.\n\n3. `search_code(\"validators=[\")`: This will help us find examples of how validators are attached to model fields or forms and could provide context on where we can integrate the value inclusion feature.\n\nThese searches are aimed to cover the groundwork needed for understanding both the implementation and usage of validators in the project, making it easier to devise a solution that fits within the existing architecture."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context related to the issue of including the provided value in the `ValidationError` message, let's consider the results:\n\n### 1. ValidationError Class\n\nThe `ValidationError` class, found in `django/core/exceptions.py`, serves as the base class for all validation errors thrown within Django. \n\n- **What does this part of the code do?** This class encapsulates validation error information, including the message, an optional error code, and optional parameters for further detailing the error. It provides methods to access error messages and update error dictionaries.\n- **Relationship with the bug:** This class is directly related to the issue since it's responsible for handling error messages during validation. However, it seems it doesn't currently support including the failing value directly in the error message, based on its constructor signature.\n- **Intended behavior:** The intended modification would require the `ValidationError` class to somehow support including the provided (failing) value in its message, presumably by accepting it as part of its `__init__` method or offering a way to interpolate it into the final message string.\n\n### 2. validate_email Method\n\nThe attempt to find a `validate_email` method did not return any results. This might indicate that specific validators are either not named as anticipated or are implemented within a more generic validation framework or method that wasn't directly matched by the query.\n\n- **What other API calls can be made:** Since `validate_email` wasn't found directly, it might be useful to look for a more generic validator or a file that contains validators, such as searching for files with `validators` in their name or path. For example, `search_method_in_file(\"validate\", \"django/core/validators.py\")` (assuming validators are located in such a file based on Django's usual structure), or searching broadly for any validators with `search_code(\"def validate\")`.\n\n### 3. Validators in Code Snippets\n\nThe code snippets found containing `validators=[` give insight into how validators are used within model and migration files throughout Django. These snippets point to definitions where validators are applied to model fields.\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?** These snippets show various instances where validators are defined and attached to model fields, indicating a pattern of usage for field validation in Django.\n- **Relationship with the bug:** The relationship here is indirect, showing where and how validators are applied but not the implementation of the validators themselves. However, understanding this can help in determining how validators should behave or be modified to support including validation values in their error messages.\n- **Intended behavior:** While these snippets don't directly implement validation logic, changing validators to support including the failed value in error messages would mean that wherever a validator is assigned, it would be capable of utilizing this new feature. It implies modifying or extending the validators to accept and relay the provided value to the `ValidationError`.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems necessary to further investigate where and how validators are implemented within Django's codebase, specifically looking for their definitions and how they raise `ValidationError`s, to modify them according to the issue's requirement."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

        "content": "1. **Do we need more context:**\n\nTo effectively address and resolve the issue described, additional context about where and how validators are defined and how they throw `ValidationError`s is needed. Here are the constructed API calls:\n\n- `search_code(\"class BaseValidator\")`: This search is aimed at finding base validator definitions, assuming that built-in validators might inherit from a common base, which would be an ideal place to modify the behavior globally.\n- `search_code(\"raise ValidationError\")`: To understand how `ValidationError` is currently being raised across the project, which may pinpoint specific validators or a pattern of validation that could be enhanced to include the provided value in error messages.\n\n2. **Where are bug locations:**\n\nGiven the initial analysis, the specific locations of the bugs cannot be precisely determined without additional context. However, based on the descriptions and the typical structure of Django projects, we can hypothesize the necessary modifications would likely occur in the following areas:\n\n- **File:** `django/core/exceptions.py`, **Class:** `ValidationError`: The `ValidationError` class might need to be enhanced to accept the failing value as an argument and format the error message accordingly. This would preserve its original functionality while adding the ability to include the provided value in error messages.\n\n- **Validators Implementation Files**: While specific files and classes have not been identified due to the lack of direct search results for validators like `validate_email`, the intended behavior across all validators would be to adapt their error-raising logic to include the provided value when constructing `ValidationError` objects. This could mean modifying individual validator functions or methods to accept and pass the value being validated to `ValidationError` when an invalid case is encountered.\n\n    - **Intended Behavior for Validators:** Modify validators to capture the value being validated and ensure it is passed to the `ValidationError` in a way that the error message can optionally include it. This means either modifying the validator's signature to include and pass this value or using a context that is already passed to validators that could include this information.\n\nWithout knowing the exact structure and implementation details of the current validators, these are high-level suggestions intended to guide toward the resolution of the issue. After gathering more context with the proposed search API calls, more precise modifications could be outlined."
