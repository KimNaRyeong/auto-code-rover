This system check function would iterate through the model fields, identifying any `ManyToManyField` with a custom `through` model and check if `filter_horizontal` or `filter_vertical` is being used for such fields. If found, it should raise a warning or error, indicating that this configuration is not supported."

        "intended_behavior": "Although no direct changes might be needed in the `ModelAdmin` class based on the current context, enhancing the documentation or inline comments to clearly state that `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` cannot be used with `ManyToManyField` instances that specify a `through` model could improve developer experience and clarity. If the system check is implemented as suggested above, a reference to this check could also be included here as part of the documentation."
