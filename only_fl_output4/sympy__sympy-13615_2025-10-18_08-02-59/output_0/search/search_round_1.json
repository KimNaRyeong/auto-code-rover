This module seems to provide a variety of functionalities around sets, such as unions, intersections, complements, etc.\n   - Both classes inherit from a base `Set` class and include several methods for set operations, such as `_complement`, `_intersect`, `_union`, and methods for querying properties of the set like boundaries and measure.\n\n2. **Relationship With the Bug:**\n   - The bug involves the `Complement` functionality, which according to the issue description, does not work as expected when the input is a mixture of symbols and numbers. From the methods listed, `_complement` stands out as potentially related to the issue. Both `FiniteSet` and `Interval` classes have their own `_complement` method implementations, suggesting that the handling of complements is specialized for the different kinds of sets.\n   - Given that the `Complement` method wasn't found, it's possible that the operation is implemented within these `_complement` methods or the system dynamically routes `Complement` operations to these methods based on the types of the operands.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior:**\n   - Based on the issue description, the expected behavior for a complement operation involving a `FiniteSet` with mixed symbols and numbers against an `Interval` should respect the interval's bounds for the numerical elements, leaving symbolic elements unaffected. This implies that the current handling within the `_complement` methods, or the mechanism that routes the complement operations, doesn't correctly account for cases where both symbolic and numerical elements are involved.\n\nGiven this analysis, further actions should include:\n- Inspecting the implementations of `_complement` within both the `FiniteSet` and `Interval` classes, to understand how complement operations are currently processed and identify why the mixed symbol-number case fails.\n- Investigating how `Complement` operations are resolved to these method calls, as the `Complement` method itself wasn't found. There might be a routing mechanism within the SymPy sets module that directs operations to specific methods depending on the types of the operands involved.\n\nTo progress, the following API calls are necessary:\n- search_method_in_file(\"_complement\", \"sympy/sets/sets.py\") to find implementations of the complement method which could give us insight into how these operations are expected to work and why they might fail for mixed types.\n- Given the lack of direct results for `Complement`, investigate how method calls are dispatched in this context might involve looking at how superclass methods or dynamic invocation works within SymPy. However, without explicit support for searching such mechanisms, focusing on available `_complement` method implementations is our immediate next step."
