This module seems to provide a variety of functionalities around sets, such as unions, intersections, complements, etc.\n   - Both classes inherit from a base `Set` class and include several methods for set operations, such as `_complement`, `_intersect`, `_union`, and methods for querying properties of the set like boundaries and measure.\n\n2. **Relationship With the Bug:**\n   - The bug involves the `Complement` functionality, which according to the issue description, does not work as expected when the input is a mixture of symbols and numbers. From the methods listed, `_complement` stands out as potentially related to the issue. Both `FiniteSet` and `Interval` classes have their own `_complement` method implementations, suggesting that the handling of complements is specialized for the different kinds of sets.\n   - Given that the `Complement` method wasn't found, it's possible that the operation is implemented within these `_complement` methods or the system dynamically routes `Complement` operations to these methods based on the types of the operands.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior:**\n   - Based on the issue description, the expected behavior for a complement operation involving a `FiniteSet` with mixed symbols and numbers against an `Interval` should respect the interval's bounds for the numerical elements, leaving symbolic elements unaffected. This implies that the current handling within the `_complement` methods, or the mechanism that routes the complement operations, doesn't correctly account for cases where both symbolic and numerical elements are involved.\n\nGiven this analysis, further actions should include:\n- Inspecting the implementations of `_complement` within both the `FiniteSet` and `Interval` classes, to understand how complement operations are currently processed and identify why the mixed symbol-number case fails.\n- Investigating how `Complement` operations are resolved to these method calls, as the `Complement` method itself wasn't found. There might be a routing mechanism within the SymPy sets module that directs operations to specific methods depending on the types of the operands involved.\n\nTo progress, the following API calls are necessary:\n- search_method_in_file(\"_complement\", \"sympy/sets/sets.py\") to find implementations of the complement method which could give us insight into how these operations are expected to work and why they might fail for mixed types.\n- Given the lack of direct results for `Complement`, investigate how method calls are dispatched in this context might involve looking at how superclass methods or dynamic invocation works within SymPy. However, without explicit support for searching such mechanisms, focusing on available `_complement` method implementations is our immediate next step."

        "content": "Based on the collected context from the `_complement` method implementations in `sympy/sets/sets.py`, we can analyze their functionality and how they relate to the reported issue:\n\n### Analyzing `_complement` Implementations\n\n1. **Functional Overview of `_complement` Methods:**\n   - These methods define how the complement of a set is calculated relative to another set, typically denoted as `other - self` or \"the elements in `other` that are not in `self`.\" Each implementation handles the complement operation depending on the types of the sets involved (e.g., `FiniteSet`, `Interval`, `Union`, etc.).\n\n2. **Relationship to the Bug:**\n   - The bug pertains to how the complement is computed when one set (`FiniteSet`) contains a mix of symbols and numbers, and the other set is an `Interval`. From the search results, Search result 12 (`FiniteSet` `_complement` with `Interval`) is most relevant because it specifically handles a scenario where a `FiniteSet` interacts with an `Interval`. \n   - This item details constructing intervals and managing numbers and symbols when computing complements, which is directly related to the bug since it outlines handling for mixed types within a `FiniteSet`.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior:**\n   - The intended behavior for the complement operation in this context should recognize and correctly handle the mixture of symbols and numbers, ensuring that numbers falling within the `Interval` range are excluded from the result, while symbols and numbers outside the interval are rightfully included.\n   - Specifically, numbers within the `FiniteSet` that fall inside the specified `Interval` boundaries should be excluded from the resulting set, while symbols and any numbers outside the `Interval` should remain.\n\n### Deduction from Analyzed Implementations\n\n- **Search Result 12 (`_complement` in `FiniteSet`):**\n  - This implementation attempts to sort numeric elements within the `FiniteSet` and construct intervals to represent the real line excluding those numbers. This is close to handling the issue's requirement, but the given behavior summary shows it might not specifically address excluding numbers within an interval while maintaining symbolic elements. The logic concentrates more on differentiating symbols from numbers when the `other` is `Reals`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo address the issue, modifications may be necessary in the `FiniteSet` `_complement` method (Search Result 12), ensuring it more accurately handles cases where `other` is an interval, differentiating between symbols and numerical elements that fall inside versus outside the interval's boundaries. Additions to this method should ensure that:\n- Numerical values within the `FiniteSet` that fall inside the interval specified by `other` are excluded.\n- Symbolic values and numerical values outside the interval are retained in the complement result.\n- Preserve the functionality for other cases not involving an interval or when no numbers are present in the `FiniteSet`.\n\n### Actionable Insight\n\n- **Bug Location**: `sympy/sets/sets.py`, `class`: `FiniteSet`, `method`: `_complement`.\n- **Intended Behavior**: Modify the method to accurately segregate numbers falling within the interval from those outside and symbols, ensuring the correct set is formed representing `{x, y} \\ [-10,10]` in the issue's context."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

Symbolic elements, as well as numerical elements outside the `Interval`'s range, should remain unaffected. This change aims to fix the incorrect behavior when inputs contain a mix of symbols and numbers, ensuring that the output correctly reflects the mathematical set operation `{x, y} \\ [-10,10]`, as described in the issue. The modification should retain existing functionality for all other cases, ensuring that no regressions are introduced for complements involving other types of sets or under different conditions."
