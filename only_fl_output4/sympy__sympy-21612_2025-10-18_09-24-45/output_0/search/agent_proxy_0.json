Given that the issue arises when parsing a specific LaTeX expression involving fractions, it's essential to understand how these expressions are handled, parsed, and translated into a different representation (in this case, a Python expression).\n\nThe problem description mentions the use of `parse_latex` function from the `sympy.parsing.latex` module. So, our immediate focus should be on the `parse_latex` function and any class or utility responsible for handling fractions within the LaTeX parsing context.\n\nLet's define the necessary API calls based on this analysis:\n\n1. **Search for `parse_latex` Function**: To understand how LaTeX strings are processed and understand its entry point.\n   ```python\n   search_method(\"parse_latex\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for Classes Responsible for Parsing LaTeX**: Since the issue is with parsing fractions, there might be specific classes handling the parsing of `\\frac{}` or fractions.\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"LaTeXParser\")\n   search_class(\"Fraction\")\n   ```\n\nThese steps should provide us with a better understanding of the LaTeX parsing mechanism, specifically how fractions are dealt with, and may direct us to the specific areas of the codebase where the issue originates."
