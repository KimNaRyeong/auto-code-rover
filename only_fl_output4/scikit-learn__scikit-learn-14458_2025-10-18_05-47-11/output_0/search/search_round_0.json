        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context around the `ArrayData` class mentioned in the traceback, specifically its constructor (the `__cinit__` method in Cython is analogous to the constructor in Python classes) to understand how it handles the input array. Additionally, understanding how `make_dataset` function interacts with `ArrayData` might reveal where a `check_array` could be beneficially inserted to ensure input arrays are C-contiguous. Here are the API calls that would be most beneficial for this task:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ArrayData\")`: This will help in locating the file and class definition of `ArrayData`, giving us a starting point to understand its requirements on numpy arrays.\n\n2. `search_method(\"make_dataset\")`: Since `make_dataset` is mentioned in the traceback, finding its definition is crucial to understand where it tries to create an instance of `ArrayData` and possibly identifying the spot to introduce a check or conversion to C-contiguous array.\n\n3. `search_code(\"Ridge(solver='sag').fit\")`: This can provide context on how `Ridge` model with `sag` solver calls the underlying implementation that eventually leads to the necessity of `ArrayData` being C-contiguous. It may help us understand the sequence of calls that lead to this requirement.\n\nThe outcome of these searches should provide a comprehensive view of the issue at hand and the areas within the codebase that might need modification to resolve the reported bug."
