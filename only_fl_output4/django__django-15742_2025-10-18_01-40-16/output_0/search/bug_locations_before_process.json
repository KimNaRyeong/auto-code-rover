        "intended_behavior": "The `blocktranslate` tag's handling of the `asvar` argument should correctly manage and store variables as `SafeString` instances when the context marks them safe. This ensures that when the variable is reused (e.g., in HTML attributes), it does not undergo double escaping, preserving output fidelity. This could entail adjusting the blocktranslate tag processing code to evaluate the safety of its content when `asvar` is used and ensuring the output is either a `SafeString` (when safe) or is marked appropriately to avoid re-escaping already escaped content."

        "intended_behavior": "While not directly buggy in relation to the issue, ensuring the usage of `escape` within the template processing (and particularly within the `blocktranslate` tag processing) respects the `SafeString` marking is crucial. The method itself provides the mechanism to escape content appropriately and returns `SafeString`, but its application in the context of `blocktranslate` and `asvar` must guarantee that this safety attribute is preserved, avoiding double escapes. This suggests the surrounding logic in template rendering that invokes `escape` needs to respect or leverage the `SafeString` mechanism more explicitly, especially post-variable substitution in `blocktranslate` usage."
