Based on your instructions and requirements, I have crafted a revised standalone Python file `reproducer.py` that includes a precise mechanism to both reproduce the issue at hand and adhere to the prescribed error handling and reporting format. This improved version incorporates the specified `print_stacktrace` function, aimed at delivering clear and detailed stack trace information upon encountering the anticipated TypeError due to incompatible signatures when using a pipeline as the initial estimator of `GradientBoostingRegressor`.

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    # Construct the pipeline as the initial estimator
    init = make_pipeline(PCA(), ElasticNet())
    # Instantiate the model with the pipeline as 'init' parameter
    model = GradientBoostingRegressor(init=init)
    # Generate some sample data
    x = np.random.rand(12, 3)
    y = np.random.rand(12)

    # Attempt fitting the model and catch any TypeError
    try:
        model.fit(x, y)
    except TypeError as e:
        print("An issue was detected:", file=sys.stderr)
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The GradientBoostingRegressor initial estimator compatibility issue with Pipeline is present.") from e

    print("No issues detected. The issue appears to be fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        sys.exit(1)
    sys.exit(0)
```

This script, when executed in an environment where the issue is present, is designed to trap and visually report the specific `TypeError` that arises from the misuse of the pipeline as an initial estimator within the `GradientBoostingRegressor`. This error trace back will provide enough detail to confirm the nature of the problem precisely.

Conversely, if the issue has been resolved, the script will naturally progress to completion, echoing a message of no issues detected, and exit with a code of 0, denoting success as per your detailed instructions.

To use this script:
1. Place `reproducer.py` in the root directory of the project.
2. Run the script using the command `python3 reproducer.py` from your terminal or command prompt.

This setup ensures that the script behaves as an assertive diagnostic tool, aptly notifying the developer of the specific issue's presence or absence, strictly following the outlined operational blueprint.
