Given the context and requirements you've shared for reproducing the issue about the `GradientBoostingRegressor`'s `init` parameter not playing nicely with `Pipeline`, I've crafted the Python script below. This script is specifically designed to pinpoint the problem you've encountered by attempting to replicate the issue as concisely as possible. Upon encountering the issue, it will produce an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace for diagnostic purposes. Conversely, if the issue has been resolved, the script will indicate so by terminating with a status code of 0, following your guidelines.

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    init = make_pipeline(PCA(), ElasticNet())
    model = GradientBoostingRegressor(init=init)
    x = np.random.rand(12, 3)
    y = np.random.rand(12)
    try:
        model.fit(x, y)
        print("The issue is fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except TypeError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please follow these steps to use this script:
1. Save the script as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project.
2. Execute the script via your command line or terminal using `python3 reproducer.py`.

The script functions by:
- Attempting to fit a `GradientBoostingRegressor` object, configured to use a pipeline as its `init` estimator.
- Utilizing an assertion mechanism to detect if the `fit` method fails due to the specific issue with passing `sample_weight` as a positional argument.
- Providing clear output on whether the issue still exists or if it has been rectified, adhering strictly to your specifications.

This solution assumes that the underlying environment is correctly configured with compatible versions of necessary libraries (NumPy, scikit-learn, etc.) as per the context of the described issue.
