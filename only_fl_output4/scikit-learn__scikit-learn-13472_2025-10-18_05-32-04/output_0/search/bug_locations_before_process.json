        "intended_behavior": "A modification in the fit method of the BaseGradientBoosting class is required to ensure compatibility when using a Pipeline as the init_ estimator. Specifically, the handling of sample_weight needs to adapt based on whether the init_ estimator can directly accept sample_weight or if it should be passed within **fit_params. In lines 1479-1484, where the initial estimator is fitted with sample_weight, add a conditional check to determine if self.init_ is an instance of a Pipeline. If self.init_ is a Pipeline, refactor the call to fit to ensure sample_weight is passed within **fit_params. This might look something like: self.init_.fit(X, y, **{\"sample_weight\": sample_weight}) when sample_weight is not None. If self.init_ does not support sample_weight directly and is not a Pipeline (or does not support sample_weight in any form), proceed with existing fallback logic that attempts to call fit(X, y) without sample_weight. Ensure this behavior preserves existing functionality for estimators that do support sample_weight directly, and only modify the behavior for cases where sample_weight cannot be directly passed. This maintains backward compatibility. This enhancement would correct the issue where the initial fitting process fails due to a TypeError when sample_weight is passed as a positional argument to a Pipeline's fit method, aligning with the flexible nature of fit method signatures across different estimators and ensuring the GradientBoostingRegressor can effectively use pipelines as initial estimators."
