This script checks for the specific issue in seaborn version `0.11.1` by attempting to reproduce the scenario described. It uses the `print_stacktrace` function to display detailed traceback information upon encountering an exception. The script aims to raise an `AssertionError` if an unexpected version is used or if an unexpected error occurs. Conversely, it prints a confirmation message if the code executes without errors, indicating that the issue might have been fixed or is not present in the used version of seaborn.
