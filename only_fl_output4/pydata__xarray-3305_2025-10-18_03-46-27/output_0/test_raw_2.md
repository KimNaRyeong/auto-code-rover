Certainly! Based on your instructions, here's a corrected `reproducer.py` script specifically tailored to detect whether the `xarray.DataArray.quantile` method properly honors the `keep_attrs` argument. If it fails to do so, it will raise an `AssertionError` and print a detailed stack trace as you requested. This script is designed with the expectation of being run in an environment where this issue could be present, and thus it will help to validate if a fix is needed or if the issue has been resolved.

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_quantile_keeps_attrs():
    da = xr.DataArray([0, 0], dims="x", attrs={'units': 'K'})
    out = da.quantile(0.9, dim='x', keep_attrs=True)
    assert out.attrs == {'units': 'K'}, "Quantile method did not keep attributes."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        test_quantile_keeps_attrs()
        print("Issue not present, exited with code 0.")
        sys.exit(0)
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
```

Please place this script at the root directory of your project and execute it by running `python3 reproducer.py` in your terminal or command prompt. This approach ensures that the script works as intended:

- It will run the test to check if the `quantile` method preserves attributes when instructed.
- If the test fails (meaning the issue is present), it will raise an `AssertionError` and then capture and print a stacktrace.
- If the test passes (meaning the issue is not present, possibly due to a fix or in an environment where the problem does not exist), it will exit with code 0.

This script serves as a diagnostic tool to verify the presence of the issue in question within your specific setup.
