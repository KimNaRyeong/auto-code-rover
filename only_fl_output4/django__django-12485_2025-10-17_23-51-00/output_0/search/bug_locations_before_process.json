        "intended_behavior": "In the parse method, specifically the section where the filename is extracted (around lines 209-213), the code should be enhanced to handle filenames wrapped in double quotes. The intended behavior here is to ensure that any leading and trailing double quotes around the filename are properly stripped after the filename is extracted and before any sanitization or further processing is performed. This change must preserve the existing functionality of handling file names, ensuring that filenames with legitimate double quotes as part of their content are not improperly modified. This requires careful consideration to avoid stripping internal quotes or affecting escape sequences. The exact change would involve: - Implementing logic to check for and remove leading and trailing double quotes (\"\") from the file_name variable. - This logic should only apply to the outermost quotes to ensure filenames with quotes within them are not affected. This change aims to address compatibility with third-party tools that encapsulate filename parameters in double quotes, aligning with the observed behavior in tools like PostmanCanary without breaking the existing filename handling conventions within Django."
