Based on your instructions and the distinction required for the test to adequately reproduce the specific issue conditions, the script needs adjusting to correctly trigger and assess the warning and the exception.

In the revised script below, we ensure to catch and validate the conditions as described in the issues. We will correct the logic surrounding the assertion to accurately reflect the occurrence and checking of the `UserWarning` from the first problem and handling the `StopIteration` from the second.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import warnings

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_mpl_user_warning_all_nan():
    try:
        with warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as w:
            warnings.simplefilter("always")
            # Trigger plot with all NaN color values
            plt.scatter(np.ones(10), np.ones(10), c=np.full(10, np.nan))
            plt.show()
            # Check for no UserWarning about converting a masked element to nan
            assert not any("converting a masked element to nan." in str(warning.message) for warning in w), \
                "UserWarning not expected when all color values are NaN"
        print("Test 1 passed: UserWarning about converting a masked element to nan not triggered.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

def test_mpl_stop_iteration_with_nan():
    try:
        # Trigger plot with NaN as yerr
        fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)
        ax.errorbar([0], [0], yerr=[np.nan])
        print("Test 2 passed: No StopIteration error with all NaN yerr.")
    except StopIteration:
        print("Test 2 failed: StopIteration error triggered with all NaN yerr.")
        exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_mpl_user_warning_all_nan()
    test_mpl_stop_iteration_with_nan()
```

This script now:
- Contains a corrected function for printing the stack trace.
- Conducts two tests to handle both your described issues separately.
- Uses assertions to verify that the `UserWarning` is not triggered incorrectly and that a `StopIteration` does not occur, with respective error messages and a clear printout when the test passes.
- Properly exits with a non-zero code if the assertion fails or the expected exception occurs, providing immediate feedback that an issue has been detected.

Please adjust the script further if there are additional nuances to the reported issues or other specific behaviors you wish to test for.
