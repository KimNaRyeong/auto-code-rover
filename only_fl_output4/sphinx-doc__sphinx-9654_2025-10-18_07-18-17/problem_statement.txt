Incorrect base class detection
### Describe the bug

I have a chain of subclasses, like A -> B -> C -> D. When I document class D, it lists the base class as A instead of C.

### How to Reproduce

```
$ git clone https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo.git
$ cd torchgeo/docs
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ make html
$ # open _build/html/api/datasets.html and see that the base class is torch.utils.data.Dataset instead of RasterDataset
```


### Expected behavior

I would expect the base class to be the direct super class.

### Additional context

I don't think this is the same as #9504 because I can reproduce it with 4.0.1 too.

Could be related to #9395.

For a class like [Landsat](https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo/blob/main/torchgeo/datasets/landsat.py#L14), even though the super class is `RasterDataset`, the base class is listed as `torch.utils.data.Dataset`.
