This involves modifying the anchor validation logic within or around this function to normalize anchor references by optionally stripping the `user-content-` prefix before checking for the anchor's presence in the HTML content. This adjustment will preserve the existing functionality of ensuring only valid anchors are marked as such, but it will also respect GitHub's convention of prefixing anchor names in rendered HTML, thereby reducing false negatives in link validation for GitHub-hosted documents. This approach aligns with the principle of least surprise, as users expect valid links (as rendered and navigable in browsers) to pass the link checking process."
