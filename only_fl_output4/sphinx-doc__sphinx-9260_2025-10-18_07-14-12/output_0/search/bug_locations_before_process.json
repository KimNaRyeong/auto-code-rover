        "intended_behavior": "This class should be modified to normalize anchor names by automatically removing or optionally ignoring the 'user-content-' prefix when attempting to match an anchor. This normalization process should occur before or during the 'handle_starttag' method's operation, ensuring that both prefixed and unprefixed versions of an anchor name can be recognized as valid. Importantly, this change should be done in a way that does not affect the parser's ability to recognize other valid anchors, ensuring that it maintains its original functionality for all other types of anchor names."

        "intended_behavior": "The 'check_anchor' function may need adjustment to work seamlessly with the updated 'AnchorCheckParser'. If the normalization of anchor names (removing or ignoring 'user-content-' prefix) is handled within the parser, 'check_anchor' may not need significant changes. However, it should be reviewed to ensure that the normalization logic is correctly applied before the parser starts processing the HTML content. This ensures that anchor checking logic remains robust and accurately reflects the behavior of web browsers and GitHub's rendering of anchor links, thus preserving the functionality of linking to the correct parts of a document while accommodating GitHub-specific anchor prefixes."
