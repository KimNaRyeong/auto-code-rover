If the normalization of anchor names (removing or ignoring 'user-content-' prefix) is handled within the parser, 'check_anchor' may not need significant changes. However, it should be reviewed to ensure that the normalization logic is correctly applied before the parser starts processing the HTML content. This ensures that anchor checking logic remains robust and accurately reflects the behavior of web browsers and GitHub's rendering of anchor links, thus preserving the functionality of linking to the correct parts of a document while accommodating GitHub-specific anchor prefixes."
