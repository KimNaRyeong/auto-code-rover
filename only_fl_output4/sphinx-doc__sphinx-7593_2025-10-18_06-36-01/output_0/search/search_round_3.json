Sphinx's source code is structured around directives, roles, and their processing, but the terminology used in my initial queries might not directly correlate with the Sphinx codebase's naming conventions.\n\nConsidering Sphinx is developed in Python and uses specific classes and methods for processing reStructuredText (RST) directives and roles, a more fruitful approach would be to search for these broader and more integral components within Sphinx's processing pipeline. This includes looking for classes that handle RST roles in general, or parsing functionality that might be involved in translating RST into HTML.\n\nTo get more context, let's try the following refined set of API calls:\n\n1. **Search for Sphinx components involved in role handling:** Since `:kbd:` is a role in RST, its processing would involve the logic that's part of the role handling infrastructure within Sphinx. We should start by searching for classes or methods responsible for parsing and handling roles.\n\n2. **Search for Sphinx components involved in HTML generation:** Given that roles eventually get translated to HTML, identifying components involved in the HTML output generation could provide insights into where and how the conversion logic can be extended for nested `<kbd>` elements.\n\nRefined API calls based on this strategy:\n\n- `search_class(\"Role\")`\n- `search_code(\"roles\")`\n- `search_method(\"visit_role\")`\n- `search_code(\"\\'<kbd>\\'\")` (Considering direct string searches might not catch encoded or parameterized HTML tags)\n\nThese searches might help us track down the relevant parts of Sphinx's source code that handle RST role processing and the generation of HTML elements.

Without concrete search results to examine, suggesting exact locations within the Sphinx codebase for modification or enhancement\u2014based on the issue described\u2014becomes speculative. However, I can provide a general approach based on common Sphinx extension mechanisms and the typical structure of documentation processing systems.\n\n### General Approach for Resolution:\n\n**1. Identifying Role Processing Mechanism:**\n\n- **File:** Potentially in a file related to role processing (e.g., `roles.py` or `directives/roles.py`).\n- **Class/Method:** A class or method specifically designed to handle custom roles (e.g., `RSTRole`, `process_roles`, or a similar mechanism).\n\n**Intended Behavior:** Enhance or implement a method to parse the `:kbd:` role content, splitting it based on a delimiter (in this case, a space or specific combination indicator like `-`) and creating nested `<kbd>` HTML elements for each split part. This parsing should only affect the `:kbd:` role parsing mechanism without altering how other roles are processed.\n\n**2. Enhancing HTML Generation:**\n\n- **File:** In a file that handles HTML rendering for roles (possibly named like `html.py`, `writer.py`, or within a templating system file).\n\n- **Class/Method:** Look for a method that translates the processed roles into HTML (similar to `visit_role` or `depart_role` in a visitor pattern, if applied).\n\n**Intended Behavior:** Once the `:kbd:` content is parsed into individual keystrokes or combinations, the HTML generation method should iterate over these parts, wrapping each in its own `<kbd>` tag for individual keystrokes or nesting them appropriately for combinations. Importantly, this should be done in a way that if the content of `:kbd:` is straightforward (not indicating a combination), it should still produce a single `<kbd>` element, thus preserving the existing functionality for simple cases.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWithout direct access to the Sphinx codebase's search results, the above approach provides a high-level plan rather than specific bug locations. Given Sphinx's extensible architecture, contributions often involve extending or enhancing existing handlers for directives and roles, or the translation mechanisms to output formats like HTML. To move forward effectively, direct examination of the codebase or more successful API call results would be necessary."

Since the initial and refined search terms didn't return the necessary information, I will suggest a new set of search API calls with a broader scope in hopes of identifying relevant entry points in the codebase.\n\n### New Search API Calls Strategy:\n\n1. **Generic Sphinx Processing Components:**\n   - Rather than searching for narrowly defined terms, we should begin with broad components known to be part of Sphinx's architecture.\n   \n2. **Infrastructure for Role and Directive Processing:**\n   - Since `:kbd:` is a role, identifying the general Sphinx infrastructure for handling roles could help locate the starting point for implementing the nested `<kbd>` feature.\n   \n3. **HTML Builder or Writer Components:**\n   - Identifying the components responsible for generating the final HTML output from processed RST content, where custom handling for the `:kbd:` role's HTML representation can be integrated.\n\n### Revised API Calls:\n\nBased on the above strategy, let's try:\n\n- `search_code(\"Role\")`\n- `search_code(\"directive\")`\n- `search_class(\"HTMLWriter\")`\n- `search_class(\"Builder\")`\n\nThese searches aim at finding broader components likely involved in role processing and HTML output generation within Sphinx.

Specifically, we found relevant files and classes that suggest points of interest for implementing modifications.\n\n### Analyzing the Collected Context\n\n#### 1. `sphinx/roles.py`\n\n**What does it do?** This file likely contains definitions and processing logic for custom roles in reStructuredText (reST) within Sphinx projects, including the `:kbd:` role.\n\n**Relationship to the issue:** Given that `:kbd:` is a special role meant for keyboard inputs, modifications needed to support nested `<kbd>` HTML elements would likely be implemented or adjusted in this area.\n\n**Intended behavior:** Modify the processing function related to the `:kbd:` role to split the given keyboard shortcuts into distinct keystrokes or combined keystrokes and wrap them individually in `<kbd>` tags.\n\n#### 2. `sphinx/writers/html.py` and `HTMLWriter` class\n\n**What does it do?** This class is responsible for converting processed reST content into HTML output. The `HTMLWriter` class interacts with document trees (doctrees) and applies transformations to generate HTML.\n\n**Relationship to the issue:** This is where the conversion to HTML happens. Adjustments here can directly influence how elements like `:kbd:` are represented in the final HTML, allowing for the implementation of nested `<kbd>` tags if not directly supported in the role processing stage.\n\n**Intended behavior:** Ensure that the transformed `:kbd:` content from the roles processing phase is correctly represented in HTML according to the new specifications. This could mean checking for and properly nesting `<kbd>` elements during HTML generation.\n\n#### 3. `sphinx/registry.py` and other `domains` files\n\n**What does it do?** These parts of the Sphinx framework deal with the registration and management of roles, directives, domains, and extensions. Domains like Python, C, and JavaScript have their specific roles and directives that interact with reST content in a domain-specific manner.\n\n**Relationship to the issue:** While not directly involved with the `:kbd:` role, understanding how roles are registered and managed in Sphinx could be crucial for implementing a robust solution. Especially if the handling of `:kbd:` needs to be extended or modified in a way that fits into the overall architecture of Sphinx.\n\n**Intended behavior:** If modifications to the `:kbd:` role require registration of a new role or directive, or alteration in how roles are generally handled, insights from these files could guide the correct integration of such changes in a way that's consistent with the rest of the Sphinx ecosystem.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo resolve the issue:\n\n- **In `sphinx/roles.py`,** enhance or adjust the handling of the `:kbd:` role to support parsing for nested keystrokes, and generate intermediate representations that can be easily converted to nested `<kbd>` HTML elements.\n  \n- **In `sphinx/writers/html.py` with `HTMLWriter`,** ensure that the HTML generation process recognizes and correctly transforms the enhanced `:kbd:` role representations into the desired nested `<kbd>` HTML format.\n\nThis dual approach ensures that the internal representation of `:kbd:` role content is appropriately structured for nesting and that this structure is faithfully realized in the generated HTML output."

Based on the information, we do not need further context at this stage. The action plan for addressing the issue involves specific files and possibly classes or methods within them.\n\n### Bug Locations and Intended Behavior\n\n#### 1. Location: `sphinx/roles.py`\n\n- **Description:** This file is likely where roles, including `:kbd:`, are processed. A method within this file should be responsible for parsing the `:kbd:` text and translating it into a structure that can later be converted into HTML.\n\n- **Intended Behavior:** Modify or enhance a method responsible for the `:kbd:` role to parse its content and identify distinct keystrokes or combined keystrokes. This method should create a representation (e.g., a list of keystrokes) that can be easily converted into nested `<kbd>` HTML tags. The parser should be able to distinguish between individual keystrokes separated by spaces and combinations denoted by `-` or other delimiters. This change must preserve existing functionality for roles that do not require nesting.\n\n#### 2. Location: `sphinx/writers/html.py`, Class: `HTMLWriter`\n\n- **Description:** This class is responsible for converting the internal Sphinx document representation into HTML. The `translate` method or another similar method within this class likely handles the conversion of roles to HTML elements.\n\n- **Intended Behavior:** Ensure the `HTMLWriter` class (or a relevant method within it) properly handles the enhanced `:kbd:` role representation (e.g., a list of keystrokes) by generating nested `<kbd>` tags for each keystroke or a group of keystrokes as required. For example, if the representation indicates a combination (e.g., \"Control-x\"), it should generate `<kbd><kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>x</kbd></kbd>`. The implementation should ensure backward compatibility, such that non-nested roles are unaffected and continue to work as they currently do.\n\nThese locations are critical to implementing the feature request without disrupting existing functionality. Modifying how `:kbd:` roles are processed allows for greater flexibility in representing keyboard shortcuts in documentation generated by Sphinx. Ensuring these changes are compatible with the way documents are currently written and processed by Sphinx users is essential to the success of this enhancement."
