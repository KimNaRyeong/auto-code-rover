Given the description of the issue, it seems we'll need to investigate how Sphinx handles the `:kbd:` role and then generates the HTML output. Considering Sphinx is a documentation tool written in Python, the functionality is likely implemented in one or more Python files that deal with parsing and rendering reStructuredText (RST).\n\nThe following API calls will help us gather the necessary context to understand how Sphinx currently processes the `:kbd:` role and generates `<kbd>` HTML elements:\n\n1. **Search for the class or method where `:kbd:` roles are processed:**\n   Since the `:kbd:` role is a part of Sphinx's reStructuredText processing, there might be a specific method or class handling this role. We can start by looking for any method that sounds like it might be responsible for handling RST roles or specifically the `:kbd:` role.\n\n2. **Search for the code where HTML `<kbd>` elements are generated:**\n   After identifying how `:kbd:` roles are handled, we'll need to find where Sphinx converts these roles into HTML code. This step will require looking for the generation of `<kbd>` tags.\n\nHere are the API calls I'm choosing based on the strategy above:\n\n- `search_method(\"handle_kbd_role\")`\n- `search_code(\":kbd:\")`\n- `search_method(\"generate_html\")`\n- `search_code(\"<kbd>\")`\n\nThese searches aim to cover the handling of the `:kbd:` role and the generation of the HTML tags. After we gather this information, we should have a clearer understanding of where and how to implement the necessary changes for nested `<kbd>` element support."

        "content": "Given that all the initial API search attempts returned no results, it highlights a need to refine our approach for getting context about how Sphinx processes the `:kbd:` role and converts it into `<kbd>` HTML elements. Sphinx's source code is structured around directives, roles, and their processing, but the terminology used in my initial queries might not directly correlate with the Sphinx codebase's naming conventions.\n\nConsidering Sphinx is developed in Python and uses specific classes and methods for processing reStructuredText (RST) directives and roles, a more fruitful approach would be to search for these broader and more integral components within Sphinx's processing pipeline. This includes looking for classes that handle RST roles in general, or parsing functionality that might be involved in translating RST into HTML.\n\nTo get more context, let's try the following refined set of API calls:\n\n1. **Search for Sphinx components involved in role handling:** Since `:kbd:` is a role in RST, its processing would involve the logic that's part of the role handling infrastructure within Sphinx. We should start by searching for classes or methods responsible for parsing and handling roles.\n\n2. **Search for Sphinx components involved in HTML generation:** Given that roles eventually get translated to HTML, identifying components involved in the HTML output generation could provide insights into where and how the conversion logic can be extended for nested `<kbd>` elements.\n\nRefined API calls based on this strategy:\n\n- `search_class(\"Role\")`\n- `search_code(\"roles\")`\n- `search_method(\"visit_role\")`\n- `search_code(\"\\'<kbd>\\'\")` (Considering direct string searches might not catch encoded or parameterized HTML tags)\n\nThese searches might help us track down the relevant parts of Sphinx's source code that handle RST role processing and the generation of HTML elements. Once identified, we can analyze the context provided by the search results to better understand how to implement support for converting `:kbd:` to nested `<kbd>` HTML elements."

Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

        "content": "It appears we don't have specific results to analyze from the provided API calls, which inhibits our ability to conclusively identify the exact locations of the bug or determine the necessary adjustments directly. Without concrete search results to examine, suggesting exact locations within the Sphinx codebase for modification or enhancement\u2014based on the issue described\u2014becomes speculative. However, I can provide a general approach based on common Sphinx extension mechanisms and the typical structure of documentation processing systems.\n\n### General Approach for Resolution:\n\n**1. Identifying Role Processing Mechanism:**\n\n- **File:** Potentially in a file related to role processing (e.g., `roles.py` or `directives/roles.py`).\n- **Class/Method:** A class or method specifically designed to handle custom roles (e.g., `RSTRole`, `process_roles`, or a similar mechanism).\n\n**Intended Behavior:** Enhance or implement a method to parse the `:kbd:` role content, splitting it based on a delimiter (in this case, a space or specific combination indicator like `-`) and creating nested `<kbd>` HTML elements for each split part. This parsing should only affect the `:kbd:` role parsing mechanism without altering how other roles are processed.\n\n**2. Enhancing HTML Generation:**\n\n- **File:** In a file that handles HTML rendering for roles (possibly named like `html.py`, `writer.py`, or within a templating system file).\n\n- **Class/Method:** Look for a method that translates the processed roles into HTML (similar to `visit_role` or `depart_role` in a visitor pattern, if applied).\n\n**Intended Behavior:** Once the `:kbd:` content is parsed into individual keystrokes or combinations, the HTML generation method should iterate over these parts, wrapping each in its own `<kbd>` tag for individual keystrokes or nesting them appropriately for combinations. Importantly, this should be done in a way that if the content of `:kbd:` is straightforward (not indicating a combination), it should still produce a single `<kbd>` element, thus preserving the existing functionality for simple cases.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWithout direct access to the Sphinx codebase's search results, the above approach provides a high-level plan rather than specific bug locations. Given Sphinx's extensible architecture, contributions often involve extending or enhancing existing handlers for directives and roles, or the translation mechanisms to output formats like HTML. To move forward effectively, direct examination of the codebase or more successful API call results would be necessary."
