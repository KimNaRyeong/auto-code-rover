It seems there was a problem with the initial setup in the Django environment within the script which resulted in the `ImproperlyConfigured` exception. To address the error and ensure correct execution of the script, it's important to correctly configure Django settings before defining any models. I'm correcting this issue and adjusting the script to ensure the models are only defined after the Django setup has been properly called. Here's an updated version of the script that addresses these concerns:

```python
# reproducer.py
import os
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models

# Dynamically configure Django settings necessary for running this script
def setup_django_environment():
    settings.configure(
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': 'test_db.sqlite3',
            }
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=('__main__',),
        SECRET_KEY='a-random-secret-key-for-django',
        USE_I18N=True,
        USE_L10N=True,
        USE_TZ=True,
    )
    django.setup()

    # Define models here to ensure Django is appropriately configured first
    global Foo, Bar
    class Foo(models.Model):
        a = models.CharField(max_length=10)
        d = models.IntegerField()

    class Bar(models.Model):
        a = models.ForeignKey(Foo, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        b = models.CharField(max_length=10)

def perform_test():
    try:
        # Ensure database and models are ready for the test
        from django.core.management import call_command
        call_command('migrate', run_syncdb=True)

        import copy
        # Perform the operations as described in the issue
        foo1 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo1', d=1)
        foo2 = Foo.objects.create(a='foo2', d=2)
        bar1 = Bar.objects.create(a=foo1, b='bar1')
        bar2 = copy.copy(bar1)
        bar2.pk = None
        bar2.a = foo2

        # Assertions mentioned in the issue
        assert bar2.a == foo2, "bar2.a should be foo2"
        assert bar2.a.id == bar2.a_id, "bar2.a.id should equal bar2.a_id"
        assert bar1.a == foo1, "bar1.a should be foo1"
        assert bar1.a.id == bar1.a_id, "bar1.a.id should equal bar1.a_id"

        print("Test passed: ForeignKey caching behavior works as expected.")
        return 0
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return 1

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    setup_django_environment()
    exit_code = perform_test()
    os.remove('test_db.sqlite3')  # Cleanup the sqlite database file
    exit(exit_code)
```

This updated script configures the Django settings before any models are defined and ensures that the Django environment is correctly set up. By moving the model definitions inside the `setup_django_environment` function, we ensure they are only defined after Django has been correctly configured. The script then continues to perform the test as previously, raising an `AssertionError` if the problem is reproduced, or finishing successfully otherwise.
