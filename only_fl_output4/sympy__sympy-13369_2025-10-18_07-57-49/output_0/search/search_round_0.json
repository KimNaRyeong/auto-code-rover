Search for the `Matrix` class to understand its implementation and any related documentation that might reference eigenvalue computation.\n2. Search for the `.eigenvals` method to understand directly how it computes eigenvalues and why it might fail for symbolic matrices.\n3. Search for the `charpoly` method within the `Matrix` class to see how the characteristic polynomial is determined, which is central to computing eigenvalues.\n4. Search for the usage of the `solve` function, as it's working where `eigenvals` is not, which might offer insights into how solutions are being approached differently.\n5. Lastly, search for the `roots` function, since the issue mentions that `roots(M.charpoly())` returns an empty set, indicating a potential problem area.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"Matrix\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"eigenvals\", \"Matrix\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"charpoly\", \"Matrix\")\nsearch_method(\"solve\")\nsearch_method(\"roots\")\n```"
