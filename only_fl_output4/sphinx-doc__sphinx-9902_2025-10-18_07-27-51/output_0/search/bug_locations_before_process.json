This may involve ensuring that there is a consistent, recognizable pattern for documenting types that Sphinx can auto-link based on its configuration or project structure. If Sphinx is unable to resolve short names to their full paths automatically, a custom Sphinx extension or a hook in conf.py using the autodoc-process-signature or autodoc-process-docstring events might be required to rewrite short type names to fully qualified module paths."
