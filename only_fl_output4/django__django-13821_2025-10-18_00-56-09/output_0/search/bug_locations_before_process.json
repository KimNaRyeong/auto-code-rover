To resolve the issue, it needs to update any conditional logic related to feature availability to ensure it begins consideration at SQLite version 3.9.0. Any feature checks or toggles that reference versions lower than 3.9.0 should be removed or updated to reflect the new minimum version. The intended behavior is to have the code logic accurately reflect that features supported from SQLite 3.9.0 onwards are available without checking for versions below this threshold."

        "intended_behavior": "In this file, SQLite database connection or configurations might be adjusted based on the detected SQLite version. To address the issue, any logic here that adjusts settings or behavior based on being lower than SQLite version 3.9.0 needs to be removed or updated. This could include removing outdated compatibility patches or version-based conditional logic that are now unnecessary given the updated version support policy. The intended behavior is simple: ensure that the database connections and initial configurations operate with the assumption that the SQLite version is at least 3.9.0, thereby possibly simplifying the code and improving overall project maintainability."
