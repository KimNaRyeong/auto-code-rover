If such scenarios are detected, output a message indicating that migrations couldn't proceed due to the need for manual input. This output should be thoughtfully designed to be both informative and noticeable to users running the command, possibly considering the verbosity level. The existing functionality for handling migrations automatically without user input should remain unchanged, ensuring that this enhancement does not alter the primary behavior of the command."

        "intended_behavior": "Similar to `makemigrations`, for the `migrate` command, update the `handle` method to gracefully detect when `--noinput` is likely preventing migrations from running due to a requirement for manual input. Emit a clear and concise message to stderr or stdout (considering the command's standard output behavior) that informs the user of the encountered stoppage, advising on the necessity of manual intervention. This adjustment must respect the non-interactive intent of the `--noinput` flag, purely adding informational output to aid in diagnosing and understanding script or command failure points without interfering with the non-interactive operation mode."
