Add output to makemigrations and migrate commands with --noinput
Description
	
The --noinput option to makemigrations seems to also mean "no output". It would be nice for scripting purposes if there could be some kind of output. When writing a script that helps manage migrations, it would be nice to be able to detect that the migrations needed input from the developer so that the script can fail gracefully and inform the developer that manual intervention is required. Right now the options seem to be to not use the --noinput options and have the prompt interrupt the script, or to use the option and have no idea when migrations failed because they required input.
I'm not very picky as far as how this functionality should be implemented goes. I would think that a little warning like
"No migrations run because input was required but --noinput option was specified."
would be sufficient. This could be output to stdout or stderr, either all the time or perhaps only if an additional option was set.
