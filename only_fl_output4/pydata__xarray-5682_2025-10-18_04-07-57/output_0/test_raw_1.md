Given the specific request and the context of the previously shared code snippet and the requirements for the `reproducer.py` file, this version is designed to explicitly check whether the complex LaTeX expressions in `long_name`s are rendered correctly when plotting with xarray and exit accordingly. Since an automatic verification of LaTeX rendering in plots can be exceedingly complex and might require an image comparison library or manual inspection, this revised script focuses on the execution path that leads to plotting and employs assertions based on what we can programmatically inspect.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_latex_rendering_issue():
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import xarray as xr

    try:
        # Create a DataArray with a LaTeX complex `long_name`
        da = xr.DataArray(np.random.rand(5,), dims=["x"], coords={"x": range(5)})
        complex_latex_name = r"$Ra_s = \mathrm{mean}(\epsilon_k) / \mu M^2_\infty$"
        da.x.attrs["long_name"] = complex_latex_name

        # Plotting using xarray with the LaTeX label
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        da.plot(ax=ax)

        # Extracting the x-label set by xarray to confirm if it's correctly rendered or passed as LaTeX
        x_label_text = ax.get_xlabel()

        # The assertion below would ideally be based on whether the label text is interpreted as LaTeX by the plotting backend.
        # For simplicity, we're checking the label is at least correctly set.
        # Note: Automatically verifying LaTeX rendering correctness might require manual inspection or advanced image processing.
        assert x_label_text == complex_latex_name, "LaTeX label is not correctly set by xarray."

        print("LaTeX rendering issue was not reproduced, the label is correctly set.")

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("LaTeX rendering issue could not be tested successfully.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        check_latex_rendering_issue()
    except AssertionError:
        import sys
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        sys.exit(0)
```

This `reproducer.py` script incorporates the function to print the stack trace from exceptions, includes detailed comments for clarification, and ensures that the setup aligns with the provided scenario. It checks if the complex LaTeX `long_name` is correctly transferred to the plot's x-axis label, a direct indicator given the problem description. The success or failure of this operation is determined programmatically by comparing the set label against the expected LaTeX string. It's worth noting, though, the exact rendering of LaTeX in matplotlib figures cannot be verified purely through code logic without implementing or using specialized image comparison methods or visual inspection.
