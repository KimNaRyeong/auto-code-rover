This script will reproduce the issue related to the absence of a `refit_time_` attribute in scikit-learn's `GridSearchCV` or similar classes. It attempts to access the `refit_time_` attribute after fitting the `GridSearchCV`. If the attribute does not exist (indicating the issue is present), it will raise an `AssertionError`. The script uses an error handling mechanism to capture and print detailed stack traces for different exceptions, including the specific case of the issue being tested for here. The script is designed to exit with code 0 if it successfully reproduces the issue (by catching the `AssertionError`), signaling the issue exists, or with code 1 if an unexpected error occurs.
