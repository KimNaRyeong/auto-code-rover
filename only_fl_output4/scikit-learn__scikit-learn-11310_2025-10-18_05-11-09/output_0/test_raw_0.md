This script aims to reproduce the issue where the `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV` (or similar) object does not have an attribute to directly get the refit time of the best model on the full data set after cross-validation. In the current version of scikit-learn covered by the knowledge, such an attribute was not present, thus executing this script should raise an `AssertionError`, showing that this issue is present.

The script tries to access an attribute `refit_time_` that does not exist, leading to an `AttributeError`, and then it estimates the refit time as a workaround. To correctly flag the issue, it raises an `AssertionError` if `refit_time_` does not exist. When or if the `refit_time_` attribute is added to sklearn in a future update, the script will directly print the refit time without error, indicating that the issue is fixed and will exit with code 0 only if the issue is reproduced, thus maintaining the requirements as specified.
