What I can so far do is retrieve the time it takes to fit and score each model:\r\n```\r\nimport sklearn.datasets\r\nimport sklearn.model_selection\r\nimport sklearn.ensemble\r\n\r\nX, y = sklearn.datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True)\r\n\r\nrs = sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV(\r\n    estimator=sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier(),\r\n    param_grid={'n_estimators': [2, 3, 4, 5]}\r\n)\r\nrs.fit(X, y)\r\nprint(rs.cv_results_['mean_fit_time'])\r\nprint(rs.cv_results_['mean_score_time'])\r\n```\r\nIn case I run this on a single core, I could time the whole search procedure and subtract the time it took to fit the single folds during hyperparameter optimization. Nevertheless, this isn't possible any more when setting `n_jobs != 1`.\r\n\r\nThus, it would be great to have an attribute `refit_time_` which is simply the time it took to refit the best model.\r\n\r\nUsecase: for [OpenML.org](https://openml.org) we want to support uploading the results of hyperparameter optimization, including the time it takes to do the hyperparameter optimization. \n"
