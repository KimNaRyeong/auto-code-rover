        "intended_behavior": "Within the `__init__` method of the `ManyToManyField` class, an additional check should be introduced after determining if the field is symmetrical (line 1181). This check should verify if `related_name` is provided (i.e., not `None`) when `symmetrical` is `True`. If both conditions are met, the method should raise a `ValueError` with a clear message indicating that `related_name` cannot be used with a symmetrical `ManyToManyField`. This validation step will ensure that developers are immediately made aware of the misuse of `related_name` in a symmetrical context, thereby avoiding confusion and potentially incorrect data modeling assumptions."
