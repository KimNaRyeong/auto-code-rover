It utilizes the `print_stacktrace` function as requested to print the stack trace clearly if an `AssertionError` occurs, signaling the test failed as detected in Travis CI and locally. \n\nThe script exits with:\n\n- Code `0` immediately after catching and printing an `AssertionError`, meeting the requirement to exit with code `0` when the issue is reproduced.\n- Code `0` if the test passes without exception, indicating the issue may have been resolved.\n- Code `1` if any unexpected exception is caught, to indicate another type of error occurred during the reproduction attempt.\n\nThis approach avoids running the entire test suite with `sympy.test()` and focuses exclusively on reproducing the specific failure mentioned."
