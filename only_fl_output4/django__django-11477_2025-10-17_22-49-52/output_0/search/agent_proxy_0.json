Since the issue specifically mentions the `translate_url()` function handling URLs with absent optional arguments, my approach will be to first locate this function in the codebase. Given this information, here are the API calls that would be most relevant to start with:\n\n1. `search_method(\"translate_url\")`: This will help us find where the `translate_url()` method is defined across the project, giving us a starting point to understand the codebase section responsible for URL translation.\n\n2. We might also need to search for any relevant classes or functions that deal with URLs or optional arguments handling. However, since the issue specifically points out a problem related directly to `translate_url()`, the first API call should suffice as an initial step. If this method is part of a class, the results will likely indicate which class or file to look further into."
