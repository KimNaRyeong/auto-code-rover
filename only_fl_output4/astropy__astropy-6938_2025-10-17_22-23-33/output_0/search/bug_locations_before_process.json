        "intended_behavior": "The method `_scale_back_ascii` is intended to transform floating point numbers in `output_field` by replacing the exponent separator 'E' with 'D' if 'D' is present in the given `format`. To resolve the issue, the operation performed by `replace` should actually modify `output_field` by reassigning the result of the replacement back to `output_field`. This ensures that `output_field` correctly reflects the replacements and functions as intended within the context of its usage. Thus, the corrected snippet should be:\nif 'D' in format:\n    output_field = output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))\nThis modification adheres to Python\u2019s handling of strings as immutable objects and correctly updates `output_field` as intended, preserving the existing functionality while fixing the reported bug."
