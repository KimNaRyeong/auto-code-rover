        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. Result from `search_method(\"from_levels_and_colors\")` in `lib/matplotlib/colors.py`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  This part of the code is responsible for generating a colormap (`cmap`) and a normalization instance (`norm`) based on provided levels and colors. It has the capability to extend the colormap on either or both ends, indicated by the `extend` parameter, which can be `'neither'`, `'min'`, `'max'`, or `'both'`. The method modifies the colormap by potentially adding \"under\" and \"over\" colors depending on the `extend` value.\n\n- **Relationship with the bug:**\n  This method directly relates to how the colormap is extended via the `extend` parameter. Since the issue concerns the edges not appearing at the colorbar extrema when `extend='both'`, the handling of the `extend` parameter and how the \"under\" and \"over\" colors are set could be relevant to the issue.\n\n- **Intended behavior:**\n  The intended behavior is for the colormap to visually show its extension by including edges at the extremities when `drawedges=True`, even with `extend='both'`. Thus, the expected outcome would involve ensuring that the drawn colorbar correctly displays these edges around the extended parts as well.\n\n#### 2. Failure to find `ColorbarBase` and `drawedges=True`\nThe inability to find `ColorbarBase` and code snippets specifically for `drawedges=True` suggests that we might need to look deeper into how the `ColorbarBase` class is implemented or find where the `drawedges` parameter is effectively used, potentially within the drawing or rendering logic of the colorbar.\n\n#### 3. References to `extend='both'` in Various Files\nAlthough no direct connections to the issue were found (since snippets were not provided), the widespread usage of `extend='both'` across tutorials and examples suggests that this functionality is well-documented and possibly leveraged in various contexts. It highlights that the bug might not be in the parameter's implementation per se, but possibly in how the edges are drawn when the colorbar is extended.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven the analysis above, we lack direct insight into the `ColorbarBase` implementation and how `drawedges` is actually processed when rendering the colorbar. Specifically, since `drawedges` wasn't found, we should investigate how edges are drawn for colorbars in general, which might involve looking into methods related to the rendering or drawing process within the colorbar logic.\n\n1. Investigate how `ColorbarBase` is related to the drawing of edges. This might involve searching for methods related to drawing or rendering within colorbar even without direct access to `ColorbarBase`. We might need to search for keywords like \"draw_edge\", \"colorbar draw\", or similar phrases that could reveal how edges are drawn.\n\n2. Since `drawedges=True` was not found directly, we should also consider looking into where and how this parameter is checked or used in the codebase to trigger the drawing of edges.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n- **Further API Calls Needed:**\n  - `search_code(\"colorbar draw\")`\n  - `search_code(\"draw_edge\")`\nThese searches aim to uncover how the drawing mechanism considers the `drawedges` parameter and how it might be affected or not correctly applied when `extend='both'` is used."
