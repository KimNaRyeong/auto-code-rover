Certainly! Below is the corrected standalone Python script, `reproducer.py`, which includes the function for printing a stack trace. This script attempts to reproduce the reported issue related to numerical precision differences in `euclidean_distances` when using `float32` data types in scikit-learn. If the discrepancy mentioned in the issue is present, the script will raise an `AssertionError` and print out a detailed stack trace. It will exit with code 0 if no issue is detected (i.e., when the scikit-learn's behavior is consistent with the user's expectations for both `float32` and `float64` inputs).

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        import numpy as np
        from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import pairwise_distances

        # Create 64-bit vectors a and b that are very similar to each other
        a_64 = np.array([61.221637725830078125, 71.60662841796875, -65.7512664794921875], dtype=np.float64)
        b_64 = np.array([61.221637725830078125, 71.60894012451171875, -65.72847747802734375], dtype=np.float64)

        # Create 32-bit versions of a and b
        a_32 = a_64.astype(np.float32)
        b_32 = b_64.astype(np.float32)

        # Compute the distance from a to b using numpy, for both 64-bit and 32-bit
        dist_64_np = np.array([np.linalg.norm(a_64 - b_64)], dtype=np.float64)
        dist_32_np = np.array([np.linalg.norm(a_32 - b_32)], dtype=np.float32)

        # Compute the distance from a to b using sklearn, for both 64-bit and 32-bit
        dist_64_sklearn = pairwise_distances([a_64], [b_64])
        dist_32_sklearn = pairwise_distances([a_32], [b_32])

        # Check if the 64-bit sklearn results agree with numpy
        assert np.allclose(dist_64_np, dist_64_sklearn, rtol=1e-7, atol=1e-9), "64-bit results do not agree!"
        # Check if the 32-bit sklearn results agree with numpy
        assert np.allclose(dist_32_np, dist_32_sklearn, rtol=1e-7, atol=1e-9), "32-bit results do not agree!"

    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

    else:
        print("No issues detected.")
        exit(0)
```

This script is designed to be executed within the context of a Python 3 environment where scikit-learn is installed and properly configured. It first performs distance calculations using both numpy and scikit-learn for `float64` and `float32` data types and then compares those results to check for any discrepancies. The expectation is that scikit-learn's `pairwise_distances` function should yield results that are consistent with numpy's `np.linalg.norm` calculations for both data types, within acceptable numerical precision tolerances.
