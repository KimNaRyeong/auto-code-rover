        "content": "To understand and resolve the issue about duplicate options in a form due to `limit_choices_to` on a `ForeignKey` field, we need context about how `ForeignKey` fields handle the `limit_choices_to` attribute and how options are generated for form fields involving `ForeignKey`. Hence, appropriate API calls to fetch code related to ForeignKey handling and formfield generation are needed.\n\nFirst, let's search for the `ForeignKey` class to understand how it's implemented and how `limit_choices_to` might be used within it:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"ForeignKey\")\n```\n\nNext, to understand how the formfield options are generated for `ForeignKey` fields which might be leading to duplicates, I will look for methods related to formfield generation in relation to `ForeignKey`:\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"formfield\", \"ForeignKey\")\n```\n\nThen, it will be helpful to understand how `Q` objects are handled since the issue mentions that passing a `Q` object as `limit_choices_to` is part of the problem. Searching for how `Q` objects interact with ForeignKey or formfields generation might give insights:\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"Q\")\n```\n\nThese searches should provide a good starting point to gather context needed for addressing the issue."
