        "intended_behavior": "Before attempting to convert the input value to a `Decimal`, implement a pre-validation step to ensure the input is of a type that could logically be converted to a decimal (e.g., string, numeric types). If the input is of a type that cannot logically be converted (e.g., dictionaries, lists), raise a `ValidationError` with an appropriate error message, such as 'Invalid input type for decimal field.' This change intends to catch type-related errors earlier in the process, avoiding `TypeError` and providing a more understandable error via `ValidationError`, thus making the system's behavior more predictable and debuggable."
