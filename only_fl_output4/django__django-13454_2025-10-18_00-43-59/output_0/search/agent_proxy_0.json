This will give us a clearer picture of the modifications required to support using `EmptyFieldListFilter` with `GenericForeignKey`.\n\n1. We should first locate the implementation of `GenericForeignKey` to understand how it behaves and why it might not have the `empty_strings_allowed` attribute. \n\n2. We also need to investigate the implementation of `EmptyFieldListFilter` in the admin module to understand its requirements and how it interacts with model fields.\n\nGiven these goals, the following API calls would be appropriate:\n\n- `search_class(\"GenericForeignKey\")`: Search for the `GenericForeignKey` class definition in the codebase.\n- `search_class(\"EmptyFieldListFilter\")`: Search for the `EmptyFieldListFilter` class definition in the codebase.\n\nThese calls are designed to provide insight into the internal workings of both the `GenericForeignKey` and the `EmptyFieldListFilter`, including their methods, properties, and the way they expect related fields to behave."
