[We're unfortunately stuck with 1.5.1](https://github.com/devitocodes/devito/blob/master/requirements.txt#L3), but the patches we've submitted have already been merged into SymPy master, and we're looking forward to jump to 1.6. Thanks!\n</issue>"

        "content": "To collect adequate context for resolving the issue about releasing version 1.6.1 of SymPy and their patches being merged into master, there isn't a direct code snippet, class, or method mentioned that needs investigation or a patch. The issue primarily pertains to the project's release planning and integration of specific patches into a newer version, rather than debugging or extending the codebase per se.\n\nHowever, to assist in a manner that's most aligned with the tools at disposal, understanding the basis for the issue might involve looking into how dependencies are managed or how versioning is handled within the project's codebase. For instance, examining files that typically contain version information such as setup.py, __init__.py, or possibly a requirements.txt file within the SymPy project itself if it mentions its own version for development purposes, which is less common.\n\nSince the issue does not specify particular code sections or components affected by their patches, and based on the information given, it's challenging to target a specific API call without further context. An approach that may be somewhat relevant (though not perfectly aligned with the nature of the issue) would involve checking for how SymPy's versioning or dependencies may be referenced within its codebase:\n\n1. `search_code(\"1.6.1\")`: To find any preliminary work towards the 1.6.1 release, possibly in versioning files, notes, or comments.\n2. `search_code_in_file('version=', 'setup.py')`: This is assuming setup.py contains version information, which is common in Python projects. It may provide insight into how the version is incremented or managed.\n3. `search_file(\"requirements.txt\")`: While not directly an API function provided, a search for references to `requirements.txt` might hint at intentional dependency management practices. \n\nGiven the constraints, these hypothetical API usages aim to illustrate a potential strategy rather than execute precise actions to address the issue directly. For an exact resolution, engaging with the project's maintainers or contributing guidelines regarding release timelines and versioning practices would be necessary."
