Given the updated requirements and the context provided, let's correct the previous misunderstanding and craft a script that attempts to reproduce the issue specified in a more targeted manner. If the issue is accurately reproduced (which is a `ValueError` regarding an invalid `vmin` or `vmax` for the `LogNorm`), the script will catch and display this exception using the provided function. Otherwise, it asserts that the issue is potentially fixed or not present, leading to an exit code of 0.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproducer():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib.colors import LogNorm
    import numpy as np

    # create some random data to fill a 2d plot
    rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
    img = rng.uniform(1, 5, (25, 25))

    # plot it
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(layout="constrained")
    plot = ax.pcolormesh(img)
    cbar = fig.colorbar(plot, ax=ax)

    vmin = 1
    vmax = 5

    try:
        plot.norm = LogNorm(vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax)
        plot.changed()  # Trigger an update to the plot
        cbar.update_normal(plot)  # Force colorbar to be updated with new norm
        fig.canvas.draw_idle()  # Optionally force a redraw to catch error during drawing
        print("The issue does not reproduce with the current environment.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The reproducer confirms the issue is present.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproducer()
```

In this script:

1. **Data Generation**: It starts by generating a set of random data, which it then attempts to display using `matplotlib.pyplot`.

2. **Plot Creation**: A plot and colorbar are created using the initial data.

3. **Attempted Norm Setting**: The script attempts to change the normalization of the plotted data to `LogNorm` with specified `vmin` and `vmax` values after the colorbar has already been created.

4. **Exception Handling**: If the script encounters an exception during this process, it prints a detailed stack trace and raises an `AssertionError` to indicate that the issue is present, thereby fulfilling the criteria for unsuccessful execution due to the bug's presence.

5. **Successful Execution**: If the script does not encounter any exception, it prints a success message, indicating that under the current environment, the issue does not reproduce, hence suggesting the discussed issue might have been resolved or is not present.

This approach ensures a clear distinction between a successful reproduction of the bug (via catching a `ValueError` and providing a detailed traceback) and the absence thereof, with the script's behavior changing accordingly.
