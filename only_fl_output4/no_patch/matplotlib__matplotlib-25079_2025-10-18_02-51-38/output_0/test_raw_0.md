This script will attempt to reproduce the issue described, using the matplotlib library to set a `LogNorm` after a colorbar has already been created. If the issue is present (i.e., `Invalid vmin or vmax` is raised), it will catch the exception, print its stack trace, including where in the script the exception occurred, and assert will fail, indicating the bug reproduces. Only if the bug is fixed (i.e., no exception is raised, and the plot adjustments are successful), the script will print that the issue does not reproduce and conclude successfully with an exit code of 0.
