To closely align with your request and ensure that the script precisely targets the problem described, I'll adjust the strategy to directly replicate the scenario causing the `ValueError: Invalid vmin or vmax` exception. This script will deliberately follow the steps described in your issue, attempting to set a `LogNorm` normalization after the colorbar has been created, which you've identified as problematic.

Here is an updated version of `reproducer.py`, tailored to capture the exception correctly and to assert its occurrence indicative of the presence of the mentioned issue. It ensures immediate feedback if the error manifests, aligned with your instructions for handling the issue reproduction.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib.colors import LogNorm
    import numpy as np

    try:
        # create some random data to fill a 2d plot
        rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
        img = rng.uniform(1, 5, (25, 25))

        # plot it
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        plot = ax.pcolormesh(img)
        cbar = fig.colorbar(plot, ax=ax)

        vmin = 1
        vmax = 5

        # Attempting to set LogNorm after colorbar has been created
        plot.norm = LogNorm(vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax)
        plot.autoscale()

        # Invokes draw to trigger the rendering & potential error
        plt.draw()

        # If no error has been raised, assume the issue does not reproduce
        print("The issue does not reproduce with the current environment.")
        exit(0)

    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The reproducer confirms the issue is present.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Explanation of changes and strategy:
- To ensure the script's focus remains narrowly on the described issue, this version removes interactive mode (`plt.ion()`) and direct figure showing (e.g., `fig.show()`) since the primary intent is to programmatically detect an error rather than visually inspect the plot. This streamlines execution, especially in headless environments or automated testing scenarios.
- It retains the core of reproducing the error: attempting to apply a `LogNorm` to a plot after a colorbar has been created from it. This mirrors the initial problem report.
- Immediately upon triggering the conditions that should reproduce the error, the code attempts to `draw()` the figure, coaxing any latent errors into manifesting.
- If the operation prone to failure (based on the reported issue) succeeds without exception, the script exits with code `0`, aligning with the stipulation that such an outcome would indicate the issue is either fixed or not present under the test conditions.
- The script prepares to catch and process any exception arising from the operation, using the provided function to print a detailed stack trace, thereby enriching the information available for diagnosing or confirming the bug's presence.

This setup assures a clear, reproducible path to either demonstrate the issue's existence within the current environment or validate conditions under which it does not occur.
