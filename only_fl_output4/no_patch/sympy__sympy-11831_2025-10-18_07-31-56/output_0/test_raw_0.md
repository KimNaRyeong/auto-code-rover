This script checks whether the issue described in the question persists. If the `TypeError` is raised with the specific message mentioned, it captures and prints the stack trace using the provided `print_stacktrace` function, and exits with code 1 to indicate the issue is still present. Contrarily, if the operation suceeds (indicating the issue has been fixed), it prints a message and exits with code 0.
