        "intended_behavior": "The intention is to introduce a new method, `make_and_validate_key`, within the `BaseCache` class. This new method should first construct a cache key using the existing `make_key` method, taking a `key` and an optional `version` as parameters. After constructing the key, it should immediately validate the constructed key by calling the existing `validate_key` method. This encapsulation ensures that every time a key is made, it is also validated according to the backend's rules, thus streamlining the usage and maintenance of cache keys and reducing code repetitiveness across the cache backend implementations."
