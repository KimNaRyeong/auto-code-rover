This would likely involve creating or modifying existing documentation to dynamically generate LaTeX strings from symbolic expressions instead of hardcoding them. The exact implementation strategy will require identifying the most common or error-prone instances of manual LaTeX in the docs and developing a systematic way of applying this automated approach without breaking existing documentation or rendering. This enhancement should be seamlessly integrated, preserving the readability of the documentation and the accuracy of mathematical expressions presented within it."
