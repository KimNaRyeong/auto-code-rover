        "intended_behavior": "A new method named `rewrite` should be implemented within the `Catalan` class. This method aims to enable the `Catalan` number to be rewritten in terms of a sum. The intended functionality is to provide a symbolic representation of the Catalan number as a summation, based on mathematical properties or identities that define the Catalan numbers. This addition will enhance the symbolic manipulation capabilities of the `Catalan` class, allowing for more flexible use of the Catalan number in various mathematical expressions and operations within the SymPy library. The implementation must preserve the existing functionalities of the `Catalan` class, such as its numerical properties and other methods."

        "intended_behavior": "The handling of LaTeX equations within documentation and docstrings needs to be enhanced by automating the generation of these equations wherever possible. The goal is to minimize manual errors and improve maintainability by utilizing the existing LaTeX printing capabilities of the SymPy library. This would likely involve creating or modifying existing documentation to dynamically generate LaTeX strings from symbolic expressions instead of hardcoding them. The exact implementation strategy will require identifying the most common or error-prone instances of manual LaTeX in the docs and developing a systematic way of applying this automated approach without breaking existing documentation or rendering. This enhancement should be seamlessly integrated, preserving the readability of the documentation and the accuracy of mathematical expressions presented within it."
