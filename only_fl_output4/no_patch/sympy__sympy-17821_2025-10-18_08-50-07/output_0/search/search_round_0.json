In many cases we could generate those equations ourselves instead of typing them manually (I found errors while doing #11014 for example).\nThis PR should demonstrate the idea.  @asmeurer what do you think?  Will this work?  Its certainly nice for maintainance, although it is probably slightly less readable...\n(If we want to do this widely, the latex printer could probably be optimized for things like `^{2}` and when it uses `\\left(` instead of `(`.)\n#### Release notes\n* core\n* Catalan can be rewritten as a sum\n</issue>"

Then I will look into how LaTeX equations are handled in the docs to better understand what changes might be needed for generating these equations dynamically. \n\n1. To address the request to implement `S.Catalan.rewrite(Sum)`, I'll start by looking for the `Catalan` class to get an overview of its current implementation and to find files that might need modification.\n   - `search_class(\"Catalan\")`\n\n2. It is also necessary to understand how the `rewrite` method is structured within the relevant class, so I will search for it in the class `Catalan`.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"rewrite\", \"Catalan\")`\n\n3. To get an idea about how LaTeX equations are currently embedded in the documentation, I'll try to find instances where LaTeX is used within code comments or docstrings. This requires a broad search since the specific files or classes where LaTeX is most frequently mentioned aren't specified.\n   - `search_code(\"LaTeX\")`\n\nThese searches should provide a substantial amount of context required to proceed with the implementation of the rewrite method for Catalan and to evaluate the feasibility and necessary steps for dynamically generating LaTeX equations in the documentation."
