Certainly! Given the request and the need to correctly handle and demonstrate the issue with `ColumnTransformer` when using negative indices, the following Python script `reproducer.py` is designed to test the scenario as described. If the behavior does not align with expectations—the results when using negative indices do not match those when using positive indices—it will raise an `AssertionError` that captures this discrepancy.

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
    from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

    # Reproduce the setup with positive and negative index
    X = np.random.randn(2, 2)
    X_categories = np.array([[1], [2]])
    X = np.concatenate([X, X_categories], axis=1)

    ohe = OneHotEncoder(categories='auto')
    tf_negative = ColumnTransformer([('ohe', ohe, [-1])], remainder='passthrough')
    tf_positive = ColumnTransformer([('ohe', ohe, [2])], remainder='passthrough')

    try:
        transformed_negative = tf_negative.fit_transform(X)
        transformed_positive = tf_positive.fit_transform(X)

        # Verify the output shapes are equal
        assert transformed_negative.shape == transformed_positive.shape, "The output shapes do not match."

        # Additionally, check if the transformation results are different
        assert np.array_equal(transformed_negative, np.hstack((transformed_positive, X[:, [-1]]))), \
            "Transformations do not match when using negative indices."

        print("No AssertionError raised. Behavior appears consistent.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This file should be executed as requested by running `python3 reproducer.py` in the root directory. The script is designed to:

1. Test the described issue by using both positive and negative column indices for transformation.
2. Use the provided function to print a detailed stack trace if an exception occurs, including an `AssertionError` if the test case fails due to inconsistent behavior with negative indices.

Exiting with code `0` when the issue is fixed (i.e., when the behavior becomes consistent or does not cause an `AssertionError`) and with code `1` if any exception is caught ensures that the script adheres to the required execution behavior.
