Inside the method, replace any usage of the using variable with self.connection.alias to preserve the functionality of determining the database to execute flush operations against. This change simplifies the method call, removing the need for callers to specify the database alias explicitly."

This adaptation ensures the command functionality remains intact, leveraging the connection's inherent database alias for flushing operations without explicitly passing it as an argument."
