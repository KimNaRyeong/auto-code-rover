        "content": "<issue>Add support for adding non-key columns to indexes\nDescription\n(last modified by Hannes Ljungberg)\nPostgres got support for the INCLUDE clause in CREATE INDEX. This can be used to add non-key columns to the index.\nCREATE INDEX idx\nON t1 ( col1 )\nINCLUDE ( col2 );\nThis allows for Index Only Scans on queries like:\nSELECT col1, col2 FROM t1 WHERE t1 = 'foo';\nMore info:\n\u200bhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createindex.html\n\u200bhttps://use-the-index-luke.com/blog/2019-04/include-columns-in-btree-indexes\n\u200bhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-index-only-scans.html\nThe idea is to add an additional kwarg to Index to support this:\nIndex(\nname='some-idx',\nfields=['headline'],\ninclude=['pub_date']\n)\nOne of the biggest possibilities of this feature is to add included columns to unique indexes and use them to perform Index Only Scans. This would require adding the same kwarg to UniqueConstraint. The implementation would be a lot like the condition kwargs to both Index and UniqueConstraint.\nAt the moment the only Django-supported database that can use this feature is Postgres but it's also supported by Microsoft SQL Server and IBM Db2 with the same syntax. Because of this I think it shouldn't be implemented as a postgres only feature but exposed on BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor to ease the adding of support when/if sqlite or mariadb/mysql get it.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the required context to address the issue of adding support for non-key columns in indexes and unique constraints, we'll need to target specific areas of the project that deal with database schema creation and modification. The classes `Index` and `UniqueConstraint` are directly mentioned, as well as the addition of a new argument, presumably to their constructors or another related method. We also need to consider the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` for supporting this feature in a database-agnostic way, as suggested for compatibility with Postgres, Microsoft SQL Server, and IBM Db2. Below are the API calls that would provide the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the `Index` class to understand its current structure and implementation:\n    - `search_class(\"Index\")`\n\n2. Search for the `UniqueConstraint` class to understand its current structure and implementation:\n    - `search_class(\"UniqueConstraint\")`\n\n3. Since the feature is proposed to be exposed on `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`, it's crucial to understand its current capabilities and methods related to index and constraint creation:\n    - `search_class(\"BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor\")`\n\n4. Specifically, we need to look for methods that create indexes and unique constraints within `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`, as the feature might be integrated there:\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"add_index\", \"BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor\")`\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"add_constraint\", \"BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor\")`\n\n5. Given the suggestion that this feature should not be implemented as a Postgres-only feature, it may be beneficial to look for any existing Postgres-specific implementations of index or constraint creation to understand how database-specific features are currently handled:\n    - `search_code(\"CREATE INDEX\")`\n\nThese API calls will help in gathering the necessary information from the project's codebase to understand the current implementation of index and constraint handling, and how the `INCLUDE` syntax for non-key columns can be integrated."
