        "content": "<issue>Add support for adding non-key columns to indexes\nDescription\n(last modified by Hannes Ljungberg)\nPostgres got support for the INCLUDE clause in CREATE INDEX. This can be used to add non-key columns to the index.\nCREATE INDEX idx\nON t1 ( col1 )\nINCLUDE ( col2 );\nThis allows for Index Only Scans on queries like:\nSELECT col1, col2 FROM t1 WHERE t1 = 'foo';\nMore info:\n\u200bhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createindex.html\n\u200bhttps://use-the-index-luke.com/blog/2019-04/include-columns-in-btree-indexes\n\u200bhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-index-only-scans.html\nThe idea is to add an additional kwarg to Index to support this:\nIndex(\nname='some-idx',\nfields=['headline'],\ninclude=['pub_date']\n)\nOne of the biggest possibilities of this feature is to add included columns to unique indexes and use them to perform Index Only Scans. This would require adding the same kwarg to UniqueConstraint. The implementation would be a lot like the condition kwargs to both Index and UniqueConstraint.\nAt the moment the only Django-supported database that can use this feature is Postgres but it's also supported by Microsoft SQL Server and IBM Db2 with the same syntax. Because of this I think it shouldn't be implemented as a postgres only feature but exposed on BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor to ease the adding of support when/if sqlite or mariadb/mysql get it.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather the required context to address the issue of adding support for non-key columns in indexes and unique constraints, we'll need to target specific areas of the project that deal with database schema creation and modification. The classes `Index` and `UniqueConstraint` are directly mentioned, as well as the addition of a new argument, presumably to their constructors or another related method. We also need to consider the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` for supporting this feature in a database-agnostic way, as suggested for compatibility with Postgres, Microsoft SQL Server, and IBM Db2. Below are the API calls that would provide the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the `Index` class to understand its current structure and implementation:\n    - `search_class(\"Index\")`\n\n2. Search for the `UniqueConstraint` class to understand its current structure and implementation:\n    - `search_class(\"UniqueConstraint\")`\n\n3. Since the feature is proposed to be exposed on `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`, it's crucial to understand its current capabilities and methods related to index and constraint creation:\n    - `search_class(\"BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor\")`\n\n4. Specifically, we need to look for methods that create indexes and unique constraints within `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`, as the feature might be integrated there:\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"add_index\", \"BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor\")`\n    - `search_method_in_class(\"add_constraint\", \"BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor\")`\n\n5.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides us with valuable insight into the structure and behavior of the Django codebase regarding database indexes and constraints, which is critical for addressing the issue at hand. Let's break down each piece of information:\n\n### `Index` and `UniqueConstraint` Classes\n- **What they do**: These classes are used to define indexes and unique constraints in Django models. They offer methods for creating SQL statements for these database objects and ensuring they are applied correctly to the related database tables.\n- **Relation to the issue**: The issue describes the need to extend these classes to support including non-key columns in index and unique constraint definitions, using the `INCLUDE` clause available in database systems like PostgreSQL.\n- **Intended behavior**: The intended modification would allow users to specify additional columns that should be included in the index or unique constraint without being part of the key. This feature would enhance query performance for certain use cases.\n\n### `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` Class\n- **What it does**: This class provides a base implementation for making schema changes in the database, including creating tables, adding fields, and, importantly for our issue, adding indexes and constraints.\n- **Relation to the issue**: To implement support for the `INCLUDE` clause in a database-agnostic way, modifications in `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` and possibly its concrete implementations are necessary. This includes modifications to the `add_index` and `add_constraint` methods or the SQL templates they utilize.\n- **Intended behavior**: `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` should be capable of understanding and correctly handling the new `include` keyword argument when creating indexes and constraints, ensuring the SQL statements generated for databases that support the `INCLUDE` clause are correct.\n\n### `add_index` and `add_constraint` Methods in `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`\n- **What they do**: These methods implement the logic for adding indexes and constraints to the database schema. They use the `create_sql` method from the `Index` or `Constraint` instances passed to them to get the correct SQL statement and then execute it.\n- **Relation to the issue**: The issue requires that the `create_sql` methods of `Index` and `UniqueConstraint`, and potentially other related methods, handle the `INCLUDE` clause for allowed databases. Changes may also be needed in `add_index` and `add_constraint` to support any new parameters or behaviors introduced.\n- **Intended behavior**: These changes would enable developers to define indexes and unique constraints with non-key included columns directly through Django models and migrations, improving query performance by leveraging database-specific optimizations.\n\n### `CREATE INDEX` Snippets\n- **What they do**: Various snippets and method implementations across database backends show how Django currently handles the construction and execution of `CREATE INDEX` statements.\n- **Relation to the issue**: These snippets illustrate Django's current method of index creation across different databases. The presence of database-specific implementations (e.g., in PostgreSQL and Oracle backends) highlights the variability in index creation syntax and features across databases.\n- **Intended behavior**: Understanding the current handling of index creation is crucial for implementing the new feature in a way that is compatible with the existing architecture. It suggests the need for a flexible approach that can accommodate database-specific syntax and capabilities, like the `INCLUDE` clause for indexes.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven this analysis, we can identify several next steps for implementing the feature:\n1. **Extend `Index` and `UniqueConstraint` constructors**: Include an `include` parameter that can hold the names of columns to be included in the index or constraint.\n2. **Modify SQL generation**: Update methods like `create_sql` in `Index` and `UniqueConstraint` to incorporate the `INCLUDE` clause in the generated SQL when `include` columns are specified and supported by the database.\n3. **Database backend adjustments**: Review and adjust database backend implementations (in `django/db/backends/`) to ensure they correctly support or ignore the `include` parameter based on their capabilities.\n4. **Documentation and testing**: Document the new feature and its database compatibility. Comprehensive tests should be added to ensure the feature works as expected across all supported databases and to handle edge cases gracefully.\n\nIn essence, the development must be mindful of Django's design principles, ensuring that any changes are backward compatible, database-agnostic (as much as possible), and do not introduce breaking changes for users who do not use this feature."

This argument should be stored as an instance variable for use in constructing the SQL statement.\n\n- **Location 2**: File: `django/db/models/indexes.py`, Class: `Index`, Method: `create_sql`\n    - **Intended Behavior**: Update the `create_sql` method to craft the SQL statement for creating an index, incorporating the `INCLUDE` clause if the `include` instance variable contains any columns. This involves appending the `INCLUDE` syntax with the specified columns to the generated SQL when supported by the database backend.\n\n- **Location 3**: File: `django/db/models/constraints.py`, Class: `UniqueConstraint`, Method: `__init__`\n    - **Intended Behavior**: Similar to the `Index` class, modify the `__init__` method of `UniqueConstraint` to accept an `include=[]` keyword argument. This argument specifies additional columns to be included in the unique constraint's index, for databases supporting this syntax.\n\n- **Location 4**: File: `django/db/models/constraints.py`, Class: `UniqueConstraint`, Method: `create_sql`\n    - **Intended Behavior**: Update the `create_sql` method to support generating SQL for unique constraints that include non-key columns, using the `INCLUDE` syntax where appropriate. This modification ensures that the unique constraints generated by Django can utilize the database feature for improved performance in index-only scans.\n\n- **Location 5**: File: `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, Class: `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`\n    - **Intended Behavior**: While no single method may need modification, it's critical to verify and potentially update several methods to ensure that the inclusion of the new `include` parameter in index and constraint definitions is handled correctly across all database backends. This may include ensuring that the `add_index` and `add_constraint` methods can pass through additional parameters to the `create_sql` calls correctly, and that the SQL generation for indexes and constraints in database backends that do not support the `INCLUDE` clause do not fail or improperly attempt to include this clause.\n\nThe modifications aim to implement the new feature without disrupting existing functionality, ensuring backward compatibility. For databases that do not support the `INCLUDE` clause, the feature should be ignored gracefully to maintain current behavior."
