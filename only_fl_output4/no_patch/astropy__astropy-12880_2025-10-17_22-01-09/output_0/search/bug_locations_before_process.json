        "intended_behavior": "This method should be modified to either directly support `datetime64` as a valid datatype or to provide a conversion mechanism that allows `datetime64` data to be interpreted in a format compatible with existing `ECSV_DATATYPES`. The explicit check that raises the `ValueError` when encountering `datetime64` should include logic to handle or convert such types gracefully. This adjustment would ensure that ECSV files written with `datetime64` columns by previous versions of Astropy can still be read by newer versions, preserving backward compatibility while maintaining strict type checking for data integrity. The intended behavior should not remove the strict type checking but rather extend it to be more inclusive or flexible with regards to `datetime64` types, potentially by treating them as equivalent to a supported string format or converting them to a timestamp representation."
