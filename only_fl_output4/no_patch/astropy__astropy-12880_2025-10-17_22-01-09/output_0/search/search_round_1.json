        "content": "<issue>No longer able to read BinnedTimeSeries with datetime column saved as ECSV after upgrading from 4.2.1 -> 5.0+\n### Description\nHi, [This commit](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/commit/e807dbff9a5c72bdc42d18c7d6712aae69a0bddc) merged in PR #11569 breaks my ability to read an ECSV file created using Astropy v 4.2.1, BinnedTimeSeries class's write method, which has a datetime64 column. Downgrading astropy back to 4.2.1 fixes the issue because the strict type checking in line 177 of ecsv.py is not there.\nIs there a reason why this strict type checking was added to ECSV? Is there a way to preserve reading and writing of ECSV files created with BinnedTimeSeries across versions? I am happy to make a PR on this if the strict type checking is allowed to be scaled back or we can add datetime64 as an allowed type.\n### Expected behavior\nThe file is read into a `BinnedTimeSeries` object from ecsv file without error.\n### Actual behavior\nValueError is produced and the file is not read because ECSV.py does not accept the datetime64 column.\n`ValueError: datatype 'datetime64' of column 'time_bin_start' is not in allowed values ('bool', 'int8', 'int16', 'int32', 'int64', 'uint8', 'uint16', 'uint32', 'uint64', 'float16', 'float32', 'float64', 'float128', 'string')`\n### Steps to Reproduce\nThe file is read using:\n`BinnedTimeSeries.read('<file_path>', format='ascii.ecsv')`\nwhich gives a long error.\nThe file in question is a binned time series created by  `astropy.timeseries.aggregate_downsample`. which itself is a binned version of an `astropy.timeseries.TimeSeries` instance with some TESS data. (loaded via TimeSeries.from_pandas(Tess.set_index('datetime')). I.e., it has a datetime64 index.  The file was written using the classes own .write method in Astropy V4.2.1 from an instance of said class:\n`myBinnedTimeSeries.write('<file_path>',format='ascii.ecsv',overwrite=True)`\nI'll attach a concatenated version of the file (as it contains private data). However, the relevant part from the header is on line 4:\n```\n# %ECSV 0.9\n# ---\n# datatype:\n# - {name: time_bin_start, datatype: datetime64}\n```\nas you can see, the datatype is datetime64. This works fine with ECSV V0.9 but not V1.0 as some sort of strict type checking was added.\n###\nFull error log:\n```\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)\nInput In [3], in <module>\n---> 49 tsrbin = BinnedTimeSeries.read('../Photometry/tsr_bin.dat', format='ascii.ecsv')\nFile ~/Apps/miniconda3/envs/py310_latest/lib/python3.10/site-packages/astropy/timeseries/binned.py:285, in BinnedTimeSeries.read(self, filename, time_bin_start_column, time_bin_end_column, time_bin_size_column, time_bin_size_unit, time_format, time_scale, format, *args, **kwargs)\n230 \"\"\"\n231 Read and parse a file and returns a `astropy.timeseries.BinnedTimeSeries`.\n232\n(...)\n279\n280 \"\"\"\n282 try:\n283\n284     # First we try the readers defined for the BinnedTimeSeries class\n--> 285     return super().read(filename, format=format, *args, **kwargs)\n287 except TypeError:\n288\n289     # Otherwise we fall back to the default Table readers\n291     if time_bin_start_column is None:\nFile ~/Apps/miniconda3/envs/py310_latest/lib/python3.10/site-packages/astropy/table/connect.py:62, in TableRead.__call__(self, *args, **kwargs)\n59 units = kwargs.pop('units', None)\n60 descriptions = kwargs.pop('descriptions', None)\n---> 62 out = self.registry.read(cls, *args, **kwargs)\n64 # For some readers (e.g., ascii.ecsv), the returned `out` class is not\n65 # guaranteed to be the same as the desired output `cls`.

        "content": "Let's analyze the collected context from the calls:\n\n### `BinnedTimeSeries` Class Code Snippet Analysis\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\nThe `BinnedTimeSeries` class is derived from `BaseTimeSeries` and includes a `read` method designed to parse files into a `BinnedTimeSeries` object. The method tries to use readers defined for the `BinnedTimeSeries` class first. If that fails due to a `TypeError`, it falls back to the default `Table` readers, requiring additional column parameters to guide the reading process.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\nThe issue arises when the `read` method is used, specifically with an ECSV file containing a `datetime64` column. The error occurs because the type `datetime64` does not appear to be supported based on the strict typing mentioned in the error message and not evident directly from the `BinnedTimeSeries` class.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\nThe intended behavior would be to successfully parse the ECSV file, converting it into a `BinnedTimeSeries` object regardless of the column's datatype, including supporting `datetime64` types without throwing a `ValueError`.\n\n### ECSV Parsing (`get_cols` Method) Analysis\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n\nIn the `EcsvHeader` class's `get_cols` method, it assigns datatypes to columns based on the ECSV file's header. If a column's datatype is not included in the allowed list (`ECSV_DATATYPES`), it raises a `ValueError`. This strict checking ensures data types are recognized and supported by the ECSV format as implemented in Astropy.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n\nThis part of the code directly relates to the bug. The error message returned matches the one provided by the user, indicating this strict type checking rejects the `datetime64` datatype, which is at the heart of the issue.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n\nIdeally, the code would either recognize `datetime64` as a valid type or provide a mechanism to handle such types more gracefully, possibly converting them to a supported format internally or expanding the supported datatype list to include `datetime64`.\n\n### Next Steps for Context Collection\n\nGiven the search for the specific code snippet regarding the `datatype 'datetime64' of column` in `astropy/io/ascii/ecsv.py` did not yield results directly (possibly an incorrect file path or an oversight in the error message), but we did find relevant context in the `get_cols` method of the `astropy/io/ascii/ecsv.py` file. This suggests we should:\n\n- Review the list of supported datatypes in `ECSV_DATATYPES` or look for related configuration or initialization code that could relate to where `ECSV_DATATYPES` is defined or modified.\n- Investigate any recent changes to the `EcsvHeader` class or its methods that might have introduced or altered the strict type checking mechanism to better understand the reasons behind the current implementation.\n\nTo proceed, an appropriate follow-up could involve searching for where `ECSV_DATATYPES` is defined:\n\n- `search_code(\"ECSV_DATATYPES\")`: This would give us insight into what types are allowed and if any logic could be adjusted to accommodate `datetime64`."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

The explicit check that raises the `ValueError` when encountering `datetime64` should include logic to handle or convert such types gracefully. This adjustment would ensure that ECSV files written with `datetime64` columns by previous versions of Astropy can still be read by newer versions, preserving backward compatibility while maintaining strict type checking for data integrity. The intended behavior should not remove the strict type checking but rather extend it to be more inclusive or flexible with regards to `datetime64` types, potentially by treating them as equivalent to a supported string format or converting them to a timestamp representation."
