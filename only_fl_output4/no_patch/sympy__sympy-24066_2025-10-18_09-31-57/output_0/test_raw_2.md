Based on your clarification, it seems like there was a misunderstanding in interpreting the success criteria for your test script. According to the behavior you've described, the script should indeed expect an error to occur due to the unresolved issue, and thus, encountering the `ValueError` is actually the intended outcome when the issue is present. Adjusting the script to reflect this, we should not exit with code 0 when the issue triggers the `ValueError`, as this indicates the issue is indeed present and has not been fixed.

Here's the modified version of `reproducer.py`:

```python
# reproducer.py

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import exp
    from sympy.physics import units
    from sympy.physics.units.systems.si import SI

    try:
        expr = units.second / (units.ohm * units.farad)
        dim = SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr)[1]
        # This assertion expects the dimensions to be correctly identified as dimensionless.
        assert SI.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(dim), "Expected dimension to be dimensionless."

        buggy_expr = 100 + exp(expr)
        # This line is expected to trigger a ValueError due to the bug.
        SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(buggy_expr)

    except AssertionError as ae:
        print("AssertionError. This may indicate that the dimension was not identified as expected.")
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        exit(1)
    except ValueError as ve:
        # If a ValueError is caught, this indicates the presence of the bug as described.
        print("ValueError caught as expected. This indicates the bug is present.")
        print_stacktrace(ve)
        # The script should indicate success in reproducing the issue.
        exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected exception occurred.")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

    # If no exception was thrown, this would erroneously indicate the issue is not present,
    # which contradicts the expectations. Hence, we handle this case separately.
    print("No exception was thrown. This may indicate the issue has been fixed unexpectedly.")
    exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script exits with code 0 when it successfully reproduces the issue by catching the specific `ValueError` as described. It exits with code 1 for either assertion failures or unexpected exceptions, accurately reflecting the presence of the issue per your requirement.
