        "intended_behavior": "The method is_dimensionless should perhaps be more robust in handling expressions resulting from functions like exp(). Whenever exp() is used on a dimensioned quantity, the resultant should ideally be treated as dimensionless, given that exponentiation typically transcends the original dimensionality to a realm where dimensions are not applicable in the traditional sense."
