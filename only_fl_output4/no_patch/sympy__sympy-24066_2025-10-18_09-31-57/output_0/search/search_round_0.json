        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue with `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` not properly detecting that an exponent is dimensionless, we should start by getting more information about the `SI` class and the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method within it. Additionally, understanding how `get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless()` is implemented could provide insights into how the dimension check is performed and why it fails for the exponential expression.\n\nLet's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. To understand how the `SI` class is constructed and find its file location, search for the class itself:\n   - `search_class(\"SI\")`\n\n2. Next, focus on the method where the issue occurs:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"_collect_factor_and_dimension\", \"SI\")`\n\n3. Since the problem involves the dimension checking method, understanding its implementation could also be necessary:\n   - `search_method(\"is_dimensionless\")`\n\n4. It's also worth checking how expressions involving functions like `exp` are handled in relation to units and dimensions, as the bug specifically involves the exponential function:\n   - `search_code(\"exp(\")`"
