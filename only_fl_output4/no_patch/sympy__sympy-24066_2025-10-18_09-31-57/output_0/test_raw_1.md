Based on your description, it seems the issue was indeed reproduced as expected: the script encountered a `ValueError` indicating that the dimensionality check failed (`Dimension of "exp(second/(farad*ohm))" is Dimension(time/(capacitance*impedance)), but it should be Dimension(1)`). This matches the reported issue where `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` does not properly detect that an exponent should be dimensionless, throwing a `ValueError` when it encounters an expression involving the exponential function `exp()` applied to a dimensioned quantity.

Since the script exited with code 1 and printed a relevant exception, it indicates that the issue is present, as designed. Given your request for a script that exits with code 0 when the issue is fixed and with code 1 along with an error trace when the issue is present, the provided script fulfills the requirement by demonstrating the issue through the occurrence of the error. If the intent is to refine the script or clarify the output, the provided code already aligns with your specification for identifying the presence of the bug in the current implementation.
