This new attribute should be capable of accepting a list of strings indicating specific system check tags that are required for the command, or the special string `'__all__'` indicating that all system checks are required (mirroring the behavior of the current implementation when `requires_system_checks=True`). The default behavior should mimic `requires_system_checks=True` by defaulting to `required_system_checks = '__all__'`. This change will allow for better flexibility in specifying required system checks for commands. Commands that previously set `requires_system_checks = False` should now set `required_system_checks = []` to skip all checks."

        "intended_behavior": "Modify the system check enforcement logic to interpret the new `required_system_checks` attribute. This modification should allow specifying a subset of system checks to run before command execution, handle the `__all__` value to run all checks, and an empty list to skip all checks. This enhanced logic will necessitate parsing the `required_system_checks` attribute, determining which checks are applicable based on its value, and executing only those checks. Additionally, this update must preserve the original functionality for commands not yet updated to use the new `required_system_checks` attribute, ensuring backward compatibility with the older `requires_system_checks` attribute during a transition period."
