        "content": "Analyzing the collected context gives us valuable insights into how the `Command` class, the `requires_system_checks = True` attribute, and the system check framework are implemented and interact within Django.\n\n### 1. `django/core/management/base.py` and `requires_system_checks = True`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  - This part of the code defines a base attribute `requires_system_checks` within the `BaseCommand` class (inferred based on file path and usage) and sets its default value to True. This attribute likely controls whether a system check is required to run before executing a command derived from this class.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  - The `requires_system_checks = True` directly relates to the issue at hand. The issue suggests replacing this attribute with `required_system_checks = '__all__'`, making it more flexible. Instead of a boolean toggle, it suggests an approach where specific checks can be enforced or bypassed by specifying them in a list or using `'__all__'` to indicate no checks are skipped.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code given the issue description?**\n  - The intended behavior after addressing the issue would allow commands to specify exactly which system checks should run. For example, a command could specify `required_system_checks = ['staticfiles']` to only perform checks related to static files. If set to an empty list, it would mean no checks are required, akin to setting `requires_system_checks` to False.\n\n### 2. System Check Framework Mention in `django/core/management/base.py`\n\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  - The system check framework is designed to validate the entire Django project for configuration errors or common issues before running server start commands or other management tasks. It throws a `SystemCheckError` if unrecoverable errors are found. The `check` method in `BaseCommand` class integrates these checks into the command execution flow, providing an API to execute these checks with configurable parameters such as `include_deployment_checks`, `fail_level`, and `databases`.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  - This part of the code is essential for understanding how system checks are integrated into command execution. The bug or feature request relates to making this integration more flexible and configurable on a per-command basis.\n\n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code given the issue description?**\n  - The intended behavior would be to enhance the system check execution mechanism to interpret the proposed `required_system_checks` attribute. This would involve modifying the logic that decides whether to run checks based on this new attribute, what checks to include or exclude, and how to handle the special `'__all__'` value effectively.\n\nIn summary, addressing the issue would require modifying the base `Command` class to remove or adapt the `requires_system_checks` attribute into the new `required_system_checks`, and updating the system checks framework integration to understand and act upon this new configuration. This change aims at making system checks more configurable for command authors, offering more granular control over what checks should be executed."

This new attribute should be capable of accepting a list of strings indicating specific system check tags that are required for the command, or the special string `'__all__'` indicating that all system checks are required (mirroring the behavior of the current implementation when `requires_system_checks=True`). The default behavior should mimic `requires_system_checks=True` by defaulting to `required_system_checks = '__all__'`. This change will allow for better flexibility in specifying required system checks for commands. Commands that previously set `requires_system_checks = False` should now set `required_system_checks = []` to skip all checks.\n\n   - **Location 2:**\n     - **File:** `django/core/management/base.py`\n     - **Class:** BaseCommand\n     - **Method:** `check` (or relevant method(s) that implement the logic to enforce system checks before command execution)\n     - **Intended Behavior:** Modify the system check enforcement logic to interpret the new `required_system_checks` attribute. This modification should allow specifying a subset of system checks to run before command execution, handle the `__all__` value to run all checks, and an empty list to skip all checks. This enhanced logic will necessitate parsing the `required_system_checks` attribute, determining which checks are applicable based on its value, and executing only those checks. Additionally, this update must preserve the original functionality for commands not yet updated to use the new `required_system_checks` attribute, ensuring backward compatibility with the older `requires_system_checks` attribute during a transition period."
