Additionally, understanding where and how system checks are invoked in commands would provide necessary context for proposing a new approach. Therefore, the following API calls would be essential:\n\n1. Search for the class `Command` to get an overview of its current implementation and to identify which file it's defined in:\n   - `search_class(\"Command\")`\n\n2. Search for any usage of `requires_system_checks` to see how it's currently being implemented across the codebase:\n   - `search_code(\"requires_system_checks = True\")`\n\n3. Since the issue suggests introducing a new attribute, `required_system_checks`, and mentions possible values (`'__all__'`, `[]`, `['staticfiles']`), it's useful to check existing system check tags to understand what checks are available and how they might be categorized:\n   - `search_code(\"system check framework\")`\n\nThese three queries will provide a broad yet detailed enough context regarding the current state of `Command.requires_system_checks` and system checks in general, which is vital for crafting a plausible solution."
