        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior for this method is to utilize the base manager (`_base_manager`) of a model for validation rather than the default manager (`_default_manager`). This change will allow the validation to include all instances of a model, encompassing those that may be excluded by the customized queries of a default manager (like filtering out archived articles in the given example). The internal logic that leverages the manager for checking if a particular instance exists will need to be adjusted to reference the base manager explicitly. This adjustment ensures that when validation is performed, particularly in contexts where all model entities are valid regardless of their state (such as including archived articles), it accurately reflects this inclusive stance and prevents misleading errors like \"article instance with id 123 does not exist\" when an entity is valid but excluded by the default manager's criteria. The fix must preserve the general behavior of validation for contexts where the default manager's scope is appropriate, making sure this change specifically targets contexts where validation against the full set of model instances is required."
