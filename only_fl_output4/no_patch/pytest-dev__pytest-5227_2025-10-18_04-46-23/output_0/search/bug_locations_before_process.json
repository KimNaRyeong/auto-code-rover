        "intended_behavior": "The `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` string should be updated to \"%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s\". This change directly addresses the issue by integrating the module name (`%(name)s`) into the default logging format, alongside the existing components such as the log level, filename, and line number. This modification does not remove any existing functionality but adds additional context to the log messages. This enhancement will make debugging easier by providing more detailed information about the source of each log message, particularly in projects where files with the same name might exist under different modules, or where understanding the module's context is crucial for interpreting the log. This change is confined to the definition of `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` and is expected to be backward compatible, as it only extends the information logged by default, without altering the fundamental behavior of logging within pytest."
