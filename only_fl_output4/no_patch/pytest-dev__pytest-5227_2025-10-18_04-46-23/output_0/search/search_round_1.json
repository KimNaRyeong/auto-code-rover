        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the `search_code` API calls gives us a good starting point to understand how the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` is used and where it is defined within the project, which appears to be a testing framework, likely PyTest given the file path and naming conventions.\n\n1. **Definition of `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT`:**\n   - **Location:** `src/_pytest/logging.py`\n   - **Code Context:**\n     ```python\n     18 DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT = \"%(filename)-25s %(lineno)4d %(levelname)-8s %(message)s\"\n     19 DEFAULT_LOG_DATE_FORMAT = \"%H:%M:%S\"\n     ```\n   - **Analysis:**\n     - This part of the code defines the default format for logging within the pytest framework. It sets the basis for how log messages will be structured, focusing on the filename, line number, log level, and the log message itself.\n     - **Relation to issue:** The issue suggests changing this format to include the module name (`%(name)s`) instead of or alongside the filename (`%(filename)s`) to give more contextual information about where the log is coming from, enhancing debuggability.\n\n2. **Usage of `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` in `pytest_addoption`:**\n   - This function configures command-line options for pytest users, allowing them to customize various aspects of the pytest execution, including logging.\n   - Two configurations use `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT`:\n     - **`--log-format`**: Allows users to specify the format of logs displayed to the console.\n     - **`--log-file-format`**: Allows users to specify the format of logs when they are written to a file.\n   - **Analysis:**\n     - These options provide the users with the flexibility to override the default log format for console and file logs, respectively.\n     - **Relation to issue:** The issue's proposed change would directly affect these configurations by changing what the default behavior is. Users who do not specify a custom log format will see the new format (including the module name) by default.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior Post Change:**\n   - The intent is to improve the default logging output by including the module name (`%(name)s`), which offers a clearer insight into where the log message originates without needing to rely solely on the filename. This is particularly useful in large projects where the same filename might appear under different packages or modules.\n\nGiven the issue description and the code context, the change would involve modifying the value of `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` in `src/_pytest/logging.py` to incorporate `%(name)s`. The suggested format is `\"%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s\"`. This change aims to provide a more informative logging output for users who rely on pytest's logging capabilities, particularly in projects where distinguishing between different modules is crucial for debugging. \n\nThe relationships established here between the current implementation and the proposed changes point towards a simple yet impactful enhancement. There doesn't appear to be a need for further context gathering through API calls at this point, as the next step would be to proceed with implementing the changes in the source code directly, ensuring to maintain compatibility and consider if any other parts of the documentation or framework functionality need to be updated correspondingly (such as user guides or API documentation mentioning the default log format)."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior.

This change directly addresses the issue by integrating the module name (`%(name)s`) into the default logging format, alongside the existing components such as the log level, filename, and line number. This modification does not remove any existing functionality but adds additional context to the log messages. This enhancement will make debugging easier by providing more detailed information about the source of each log message, particularly in projects where files with the same name might exist under different modules, or where understanding the module's context is crucial for interpreting the log. This change is confined to the definition of `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` and is expected to be backward compatible, as it only extends the information logged by default, without altering the fundamental behavior of logging within pytest."
