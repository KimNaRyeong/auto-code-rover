We then have multiple Apps that talk to their own databases. Some share the same table names.\nWe have used this setup for a while, but after upgrading to Django 2.2 we're getting an error saying we're not allowed 2 apps, with 2 different models to have the same table names.\nIs this correct behavior? We've had to roll back to Django 2.0 for now.\n</issue>"

        "content": "For the described issue, we need to gather more information about how models are defined and possibly how the database configurations are set up across the different apps within the Django project. Specifically, we are interested in how models in the \"base\" app and those in \"app2\" are defined, especially regarding their `Meta` classes where `db_table` might be declared. Furthermore, understanding the database router setup might also give insights into how the project is managing multiple databases and why the upgrade to Django 2.2 has caused this issue. Let's proceed with the following API calls to get detailed code context relevant to the issue:\n\n1. `search_class(\"ModelName\")` - This will help us find the definitions of the conflicting models in both `base` and `app2` apps.\n\n2. `search_method(\"db_for_read\")` - To check if there's any custom database routing logic that might be affecting how models are mapped to tables across different databases.\n\n3. `search_method(\"db_for_write\")` - Similarly, to check the database routing for write operations, which could also influence model to table mappings.\n\n4. `search_code(\"class Meta\")` - This will help to find any `Meta` class definitions within model classes that specify a `db_table`, which could be the root cause of the conflict seen.\n\n5. `search_code(\"DATABASE_ROUTERS\")` - Since the issue might be related to how databases are routed for different models, it's important to see how `DATABASE_ROUTERS` is configured in the project's settings."
