This Python script checks the `expand_trig` functionality for `csch` and `sech` from SymPy. If these functions do not expand in a similar manner to `tanh`, the script will raise an `AssertionError`, showing that the initial issue is present. The control case with `tanh` expansion is also checked to confirm proper behavior with a known good expansion. If an assertion fails, it will print the stack trace and exit with a code of 0, indicating that the issue has indeed been reproduced.
