Given the examples provided in the issue, it's also necessary to see the implementation for `csc` and `sec` to understand the intended expansion behavior. Therefore, I'm selecting the following API calls to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. `search_method(\"expand_trig\")`: To find where the `expand_trig` method is defined and used in the codebase. This will give us an entry point to understand how expansion rules are applied to different trigonometric functions.\n\n2. `search_code(\"expand_trig(csch\")`: We'll look for any occurrence of `csch` being used with `expand_trig` in the codebase. This could help understand if there's an existing partial implementation or call that we might need to extend or modify.\n\n3. `search_code(\"expand_trig(sech\")`: Similarly, this will help us find if `sech` is handled or mentioned somewhere in context with `expand_trig`, indicating if we have a specific logic that needs to be updated or expanded.\n\n4. `search_code(\"expand_trig(csc\")`: Given the issue's hint towards the expansion behavior of `csc`, we'll look for its implementation details to possibly replicate or adapt its logic for `csch`.\n\n5. `search_code(\"expand_trig(sec\")`: This will help us understand the expansion behavior for `sec`, which might give clues on how to implement similar behavior for `sech`."

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context and considering the information that could not be found through API calls, we are guided towards a series of steps to gather a comprehensive understanding and develop a strategy for addressing the issue:\n\n### 1. Analysis of `expand_trig` in `sympy/core/function.py`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe provided code snippet from `sympy/core/function.py` shows the `expand_trig` function, which acts as a wrapper around the general `expand` method, specifically focusing on trigonometric expansion. It takes an expression and applies trigonometric expansion to it, based on the arguments provided, here focusing solely on the `trig=True` flag to indicate trigonometric expansion.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug\nThis function is central to the reported issue as it explicitly handles the trigonometric expansion, but as reported, it does not expand `csch` and `sech` correctly. It suggests that the expansion rules or methods for `csch` and `sech` might either not be implemented or are not correctly integrated into the `expand_trig` function.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nBased on the issue description, the intended behavior would be to modify or extend `expand_trig` to include expansions for `csch` and `sech` similar to how it handles `csc` and `sec`, ensuring they expand in a manner consistent with trigonometric identities, ideally leading to output similar to what is expected for `csc(x + y)` and `sec(x + y)`.\n\n### 2. Failed Searches for `csch`, `sech`, `csc`, and `sec` within `expand_trig` contexts\n\nThe absence of direct references in the search results to `expand_trig(csch)`, `expand_trig(sech)`, `expand_trig(csc)`, and `expand_trig(sec)` indicates that:\n\n- There might not be specific conditions or branches within the `expand_trig` function (or related functions) that handle these trigonometric functions directly.\n- The logic for expanding `csc` and `sec` might be more generally applied or exists within different parts of the SymPy library, not directly invoked within `expand_trig` in a manner that a straightforward string search would reveal.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context\n\nGiven the absence of direct references and considering the structure of SymPy, which tends to modularize mathematical operations, our next steps should focus on less direct but potentially relevant relationships between the functions of interest (`csch`, `sech`, `csc`, `sec`) and the expansion mechanisms.\n\n1. **Explore Trigonometric Function Implementations**: Understand how `csch` and `sech` are implemented. This could provide insights into why they are not expanded like their counterparts. This might involve:\n   - `search_class(\"Csch\")` and `search_class(\"Sech\")` to get their definitions and any method that might relate to their expansion.\n   - `search_class(\"Csc\")` and `search_class(\"Sec\")` since their behavior is considered correct and could serve as a reference for implementation.\n\n2. **Investigate General Trig Expansion Mechanism**: Given that the `expand_trig` doesn't contain specific logic for these functions within the strings searched, it might be leveraging a more generalized mechanism for trigonometric expansions that needs to be extended.\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"expand\", \"sympy/core/function.py\")` to understand how general expansions are handled and see if specific conditions or delegations could affect `csch` and `sech`.\n\n3. **Review Related Parts of SymPy Documentation or Comments in Code**: Documentation or comments within the codebase might offer insights on where and how trigonometric expansions are defined and could hint at where to implement the missing expansions.\n\nBy following these steps, we aim to build a detailed understanding of the necessary implementations and locate the precise points of extension or modification for addressing the reported issue."

This would involve implementing a mechanism within `expand_trig` or within the trigonometric functions themselves, to decompose `csch(x + y)` and `sech(x + y)` into their expanded forms based on trigonometric identities, similar to how `csc(x + y)` is expanded. The expansion should preserve existing functionality while extending the capabilities to include proper handling of hyperbolic cosec and sec functions.\n\n    **Additional Remarks:** Since direct references to the handling of `csch` and `sech` within the `expand_trig` were not found, addressing the issue may involve either modifying the `expand_trig` function directly or implementing/adjusting methods in the classes that represent `csch` and `sech`, assuming such classes appropriately exist and are responsible for defining their behavior within the SymPy library. The changes should ensure that the expansion logic aligns with mathematical standards and preserves the integrity and expectations set by similar functionalities within the codebase."
