        "content": "Analyzing the collected context and considering the information that could not be found through API calls, we are guided towards a series of steps to gather a comprehensive understanding and develop a strategy for addressing the issue:\n\n### 1. Analysis of `expand_trig` in `sympy/core/function.py`\n\n#### What does this part of the code do?\nThe provided code snippet from `sympy/core/function.py` shows the `expand_trig` function, which acts as a wrapper around the general `expand` method, specifically focusing on trigonometric expansion. It takes an expression and applies trigonometric expansion to it, based on the arguments provided, here focusing solely on the `trig=True` flag to indicate trigonometric expansion.\n\n#### Relationship to the bug\nThis function is central to the reported issue as it explicitly handles the trigonometric expansion, but as reported, it does not expand `csch` and `sech` correctly. It suggests that the expansion rules or methods for `csch` and `sech` might either not be implemented or are not correctly integrated into the `expand_trig` function.\n\n#### Intended behavior\nBased on the issue description, the intended behavior would be to modify or extend `expand_trig` to include expansions for `csch` and `sech` similar to how it handles `csc` and `sec`, ensuring they expand in a manner consistent with trigonometric identities, ideally leading to output similar to what is expected for `csc(x + y)` and `sec(x + y)`.\n\n### 2. Failed Searches for `csch`, `sech`, `csc`, and `sec` within `expand_trig` contexts\n\nThe absence of direct references in the search results to `expand_trig(csch)`, `expand_trig(sech)`, `expand_trig(csc)`, and `expand_trig(sec)` indicates that:\n\n- There might not be specific conditions or branches within the `expand_trig` function (or related functions) that handle these trigonometric functions directly.\n- The logic for expanding `csc` and `sec` might be more generally applied or exists within different parts of the SymPy library, not directly invoked within `expand_trig` in a manner that a straightforward string search would reveal.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context\n\nGiven the absence of direct references and considering the structure of SymPy, which tends to modularize mathematical operations, our next steps should focus on less direct but potentially relevant relationships between the functions of interest (`csch`, `sech`, `csc`, `sec`) and the expansion mechanisms.\n\n1. **Explore Trigonometric Function Implementations**: Understand how `csch` and `sech` are implemented. This could provide insights into why they are not expanded like their counterparts. This might involve:\n   - `search_class(\"Csch\")` and `search_class(\"Sech\")` to get their definitions and any method that might relate to their expansion.\n   - `search_class(\"Csc\")` and `search_class(\"Sec\")` since their behavior is considered correct and could serve as a reference for implementation.\n\n2. **Investigate General Trig Expansion Mechanism**: Given that the `expand_trig` doesn't contain specific logic for these functions within the strings searched, it might be leveraging a more generalized mechanism for trigonometric expansions that needs to be extended.\n   - `search_method_in_file(\"expand\", \"sympy/core/function.py\")` to understand how general expansions are handled and see if specific conditions or delegations could affect `csch` and `sech`.\n\n3. **Review Related Parts of SymPy Documentation or Comments in Code**: Documentation or comments within the codebase might offer insights on where and how trigonometric expansions are defined and could hint at where to implement the missing expansions.\n\nBy following these steps, we aim to build a detailed understanding of the necessary implementations and locate the precise points of extension or modification for addressing the reported issue."

This would involve implementing a mechanism within `expand_trig` or within the trigonometric functions themselves, to decompose `csch(x + y)` and `sech(x + y)` into their expanded forms based on trigonometric identities, similar to how `csc(x + y)` is expanded. The expansion should preserve existing functionality while extending the capabilities to include proper handling of hyperbolic cosec and sec functions.\n\n    **Additional Remarks:** Since direct references to the handling of `csch` and `sech` within the `expand_trig` were not found, addressing the issue may involve either modifying the `expand_trig` function directly or implementing/adjusting methods in the classes that represent `csch` and `sech`, assuming such classes appropriately exist and are responsible for defining their behavior within the SymPy library. The changes should ensure that the expansion logic aligns with mathematical standards and preserves the integrity and expectations set by similar functionalities within the codebase."

Because of this,\n2700       some hints may prevent expansion by other hints if they are applied\n2701       first. For example, ``mul`` may distribute multiplications and prevent\n2702       ``log`` and ``power_base`` from expanding them. Also, if ``mul`` is\n2703       applied before ``multinomial`, the expression might not be fully\n2704       distributed. The solution is to use the various ``expand_hint`` helper\n2705       functions or to use ``hint=False`` to this function to finely control\n2706       which hints are applied. Here are some examples::\n2707 \n2708         >>> from sympy import expand, expand_mul, expand_power_base\n2709         >>> x, y, z = symbols('x,y,z', positive=True)\n2710 \n2711         >>> expand(log(x*(y + z)))\n2712         log(x) + log(y + z)\n2713 \n2714       Here, we see that ``log`` was applied before ``mul``.

The function should take the form::\n2768 \n2769         def _eval_expand_hint(self, **hints):\n2770             # Only apply the method to the top-level expression\n2771             ...\n2772 \n2773     See also the example below.  Objects should define ``_eval_expand_hint()``\n2774     methods only if ``hint`` applies to that specific object.  The generic\n2775     ``_eval_expand_hint()`` method defined in Expr will handle the no-op case.\n2776 \n2777     Each hint should be responsible for expanding that hint only.\n2778     Furthermore, the expansion should be applied to the top-level expression\n2779     only.  ``expand()`` takes care of the recursion that happens when\n2780     ``deep=True``.\n2781 \n2782     You should only call ``_eval_expand_hint()`` methods directly if you are\n2783     100% sure that the object has the method, as otherwise you are liable to\n2784     get unexpected ``AttributeError``s.  Note, again, that you do not need to\n2785     recursively apply the hint to args of your object: this is handled\n2786     automatically by ``expand()``.  ``_eval_expand_hint()`` should\n2787     generally not be used at all outside of an ``_eval_expand_hint()`` method.\n2788     If you want to apply a specific expansion from within another method, use\n2789     the public ``expand()`` function, method, or ``expand_hint()`` functions.\n2790 \n2791     In order for expand to work, objects must be rebuildable by their args,\n2792     i.e., ``obj.func(*obj.args) == obj`` must hold.\n2793 \n2794     Expand methods are passed ``**hints`` so that expand hints may use\n2795     'metahints'--hints that control how different expand methods are applied.\n2796     For example, the ``force=True`` hint described above that causes\n2797     ``expand(log=True)`` to ignore assumptions is such a metahint.  The\n2798     ``deep`` meta-hint is handled exclusively by ``expand()`` and is not\n2799     passed to ``_eval_expand_hint()`` methods.\n2800 \n2801     Note that expansion hints should generally be methods that perform some\n2802     kind of 'expansion'.  For hints that simply rewrite an expression, use the\n2803     .rewrite() API.\n2804 \n2805     Examples\n2806     ========\n2807 \n2808     >>> from sympy import Expr, sympify\n2809     >>> class MyClass(Expr):\n2810     ...     def __new__(cls, *args):\n2811     ...         args = sympify(args)\n2812     ...         return Expr.__new__(cls, *args)\n2813     ...\n2814     ...     def _eval_expand_double(self, *, force=False, **hints):\n2815     ...

        "content": "Given the collected context and focusing on the `expand` function in `sympy/core/function.py`, we can draw insightful connections towards resolving the reported issue with `expand_trig` for `csch` and `sech`.\n\n### 1. Overview of the `expand` Function\n\nThe `expand` function serves as a versatile tool for expression expansion within the SymPy library, with capabilities to expand expressions based on various hints such as `mul`, `log`, `trig`, amongst others. It's designed to apply a comprehensive expansion strategy across different mathematical domains, guided by specific hints to adjust its behavior accordingly.\n\n### 2. Relationship to the Bug\n\nGiven that the `expand` method supports a `trig` hint for trigonometric expansion, the issue with `expand_trig` failing to properly expand `csch` and `sech` functions directly relates to this part of the code. The method's current implementation includes an infrastructure capable of expanding trigonometric functions, yet the specific issue indicates that either the `csch` and `sech` functions are not properly integrated into this framework, or that their expansion logic needs to be explicitly defined or adjusted.\n\n### 3. Intended Behavior Regarding the Issue\n\nThe expected modification or extension involves integrating `csch` and `sech` into the trigonometric expansion logic within the ambit of the `expand` function, enabling these functions to be expanded in a manner akin to `csc` and `sec`. Considering the absence of predefined classes for `Csch`, `Sech`, `Csc`, and `Sec` within this part of the codebase, resolving the issue would likely entail:\n\n- **Defining or adjusting the expansion logic** for `csch` and `sech` to reflect proper trigonometric identities, possibly within the existing framework that handles trigonometric expansion under the `trig=True` hint.\n- **Ensuring compatibility and consistency** with the mathematical properties and expected behaviors of these functions, viewing existing implementations of similar functions as references for achieving the intended expansions.\n\nSpecifically, the adjustment means either adding necessary logic to handle `csch` and `sech` directly within the broader `expand` method or ensuring that these functions define appropriate `_eval_expand_trig` methods (or similar) that `expand` can utilize to perform the intended expansions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTo address the issue, focus shifts towards enhancing the `expand` method or the objects representing `csch` and `sech` to ensure they are capable of expanding in the desired manner. This could involve creating new handling logic within `expand` or ensuring that `csch` and `sech` are recognized and properly expanded through the method's existing mechanisms. The caveat here is maintaining the integrity and structure of the library while integrating new or adjusted functionality with minimal disruption to the existing codebase and functionality."

However, it's important to note that actual code changes would require a deeper understanding of the SymPy library's architecture and conventions, specifically how it handles trigonometric expansions.\n\n### 2. Where are bug locations\n\n**Bug Location:**\n- **File:** `sympy/core/function.py`\n- **Method:** `expand`\n\n**Intended Behavior:** The `expand` method, more specifically within the handling of the `trig=True` hint, should be enhanced to correctly identify and expand hyperbolic functions `csch` and `sech` when they are passed as arguments. This involves:\n\n1. Ensuring that `csch` and `sech` are recognised as functions to be expanded under the trigonometric hint. This might require adjustments or additions to the method to include logic that can handle these specific functions, mirroring how other trigonometric functions like `sin`, `cos`, `csc`, and `sec` are expanded.\n   \n2. Implementing or adjusting the expansion rules for `csch` and `sech` so that their expansion reflects accurate trigonometric identities. For instance, expanding `csch(x + y)` should ideally result in a form that incorporates the expansion identities of hyperbolic functions, similar to how `csc(x + y)` is expanded using trigonometric identities.\n\n3. Preserving existing functionality is paramount; thus, any additions or revisions should not adversely affect the current capability of the `expand` function to correctly process other expressions or hints. The update should seamlessly integrate with the method's current logic, ensuring that all existing tests continue to pass while also covering the new cases for `csch` and `sech`.\n\nConsidering the absence of direct search results for class definitions of `Csch`, `Sech`, `Csc`, and `Sec` within the SymPy codebase, it implies that the expansion logic is more generalized rather than tied to specific class methods for each trigonometric function. This suggests that enhancing the general expansion capabilities for trigonometric functions as a whole, or improving the handling of hints within the `expand` method, is a suitable approach to resolving the reported issue.\n\nThis solution provides a clear direction for implementing the necessary code changes within the SymPy project to address the reported issue with expanding `csch` and `sech` functions, while ensuring that the resolution aligns with the project's standards and conventions."
