Below is a standalone script named `reproducer.py`. When executed in the root directory of your Django project, it aims to reproduce the issue described. It attempts to generate a migration for a model change from a UUIDField to a ForeignKey and then attempts to apply this migration to verify if the proper dependencies are created and resolved correctly. In case of failure to resolve the related model due to missing dependencies in the migration file, it will catch the `ValueError`, print a detailed stack trace, and assert the presence of the issue. Otherwise, it will indicate the issue is fixed by exiting with code 0.

This script assumes a typical Django project setup and uses Django's `call_command` method to simulate the migration commands. It uses the `mock` library to patch the `Migration` class temporarily, allowing us to intercept the migration application process and insert a check for the correct resolution of ForeignKey dependencies.

Please customize the import statement for `App1` and the Django settings module to fit your project structure. You might also need to adjust the logic inside the `TestMigration` class to better match the specific behaviors of your application or Django's migration mechanism.
