I am new in django community, so please help me, because i really dont know is it really \"bug\".\nI have a django project named \"testproject\" and two apps: testapp1, testapp2.\nIt will be simpler to understand, with this example:\n# TestApp1(models.py):\nclass App1(models.Model):\n\tid = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, unique=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False, verbose_name=_('identifier'))\n\ttext = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name=_('text'))\n\tanother_app = models.UUIDField(null=True, blank=True, verbose_name=_('another app'))\n# TestApp2(models.py):\nclass App2(models.Model):\n\tid = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, unique=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False, verbose_name=_('identifier'))\n\ttext = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name=_('text'))\nFirst model named \"App1\" has UUID field named \"another_app\":\n another_app = models.UUIDField(null=True, blank=True, verbose_name=_('another app'))\nAfter some time i change field from UUID to FK, like this: \nanother_app = models.ForeignKey(App2, null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, verbose_name=_('another app'))\nAnd as result i create new migration, but Migration class was unexpected result, because it does not create any \"dependencies\" for App2, because of FK.\nI think the correct solution will be create dependency for App2.\nThis project use django version 2.2 and postgresql. Attach archive with sources. Project contains small test, after running him, you will get exception like this: ValueError: Related model 'testapp2.App2' cannot be resolved.\nSo is it problem in django or maybe i dont understand something ?\nHere is my post in django users:\n\u200bhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/django-users/Django$20bug$3A$20change$20uuid$20field$20to$20FK$20does$20not$20create$20dependency%7Csort:date/django-users/-h9LZxFomLU/yz-NLi1cDgAJ\nRegards, Viktor Lomakin\n"

It assumes a certain structure and intention based on your description, which might not perfectly align with all Django versions or usages. You will need to adjust the paths and model names according to your project, and more intricate logic might be required to fully emulate the Django migration behavior, especially for validating the migrations' dependency resolution."
