I am new in django community, so please help me, because i really dont know is it really \"bug\".\nI have a django project named \"testproject\" and two apps: testapp1, testapp2.\nIt will be simpler to understand, with this example:\n# TestApp1(models.py):\nclass App1(models.Model):\nid = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, unique=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False, verbose_name=_('identifier'))\ntext = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name=_('text'))\nanother_app = models.UUIDField(null=True, blank=True, verbose_name=_('another app'))\n# TestApp2(models.py):\nclass App2(models.Model):\nid = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, unique=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False, verbose_name=_('identifier'))\ntext = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name=_('text'))\nFirst model named \"App1\" has UUID field named \"another_app\":\nanother_app = models.UUIDField(null=True, blank=True, verbose_name=_('another app'))\nAfter some time i change field from UUID to FK, like this:\nanother_app = models.ForeignKey(App2, null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, verbose_name=_('another app'))\nAnd as result i create new migration, but Migration class was unexpected result, because it does not create any \"dependencies\" for App2, because of FK.\nI think the correct solution will be create dependency for App2.\nThis project use django version 2.2 and postgresql. Attach archive with sources. Project contains small test, after running him, you will get exception like this: ValueError: Related model 'testapp2.App2' cannot be resolved.\nSo is it problem in django or maybe i dont understand something ?\nHere is my post in django users:\n\u200bhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/django-users/Django$20bug$3A$20change$20uuid$20field$20to$20FK$20does$20not$20create$20dependency%7Csort:date/django-users/-h9LZxFomLU/yz-NLi1cDgAJ\nRegards, Viktor Lomakin\n</issue>"

        "content": "Given that searches for the classes `App1` and `App2` did not return results, this suggests these classes might be defined in unindexed or dynamically loaded modules, or perhaps the names provided in the issue are not exactly how they appear in the codebase (potentially due to typographical errors or abbreviation).\n\nThe information provided from the search for migration-related code snippets is comprehensive but requires further refining to pinpoint the issue related to the ForeignKey dependency not being properly generated in migrations involving our specific models (`App1` and `App2`). The migrations framework in Django (as detailed in the returned files like `loader.py`, `writer.py`, `recorder.py`, `migration.py`, etc.) is responsible for detecting changes to models and generating corresponding migration files that adjust the database schema accordingly.\n\n1. **Understanding the Django Migrations Framework**\n    - The returned files like `django/db/migrations/migration.py` and `django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py` are part of Django's migrations framework, implying a complex system designed to record and apply changes to the database schema.\n    - The migrations system inspects models and their fields (including relationships like `ForeignKey`) and then composes migration files that reflect those changes.\n\n2. **Relation to the bug**:\n    - The bug involves an unexpected behavior in this system when a field type in a model is altered from a `UUIDField` to a `ForeignKey`. The issue reported indicates that the migration system did not create the necessary dependencies for `App2` when this change was made, suggesting a potential oversight or bug in how Django's migration autodetector manages field type alterations involving relationships between different app models.\n\n3. **Intended behavior**:\n    - When altering a field from a `UUIDField` to a `ForeignKey`, the Django migrations framework should automatically detect this change and generate a migration file that not only updates the field type but also correctly establishes the foreign key constraint in the database schema. Moreover, it should recognize the dependency among related models (in this case, `App1` depends on `App2` due to the foreign key relationship) and include that in the migration's dependencies attribute. This ensures that migrations are applied in the correct order, maintaining referential integrity.\n\nGiven the absence of direct code results for `App1` and `App2`, and focusing on the broader migration system to understand where the problem might occur, the next logical steps are to:\n\n- Review the migration generation system (especially the autodetector logic in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`) for handling field type changes.\n- Specifically, explore how dependencies are calculated for ForeignKey relationships during migration auto-generation to identify potential gaps or issues in the logic.\n  \nTherefore, more targeted API calls such as searching within the specific Django migration-related files (e.g., `autodetector.py`) or looking for snippets or documentation strings that refer to handling ForeignKey relationships or field type changes during migrations could provide further insights.\n\nBased on the current context and intended directions:\n\n- **Explore how ForeignKey dependencies are autodetected:**\n    ```\n    search_code_in_file(\"dependencies\", \"django/db/migrations/autodetector.py\")\n    search_code_in_file(\"ForeignKey\", \"django/db/migrations/autodetector.py\")\n    ```\n\n- **Understand migration creation for ForeignKey changes:**\n    ```\n    search_code(\"alter field to ForeignKey\")\n    ```\n\nThese calls aim to directly address how Django detects and handles model field changes from non-relational to relational types and how that process might fail to generate necessary dependencies."

        "content": "Based on the provided information and analysis, the bug's location and further context are not explicitly clear due to the lack of direct access to specific source files or migration files for `App1` and `App2`. However, since the issue revolves around the Django migration system not properly handling a field change from `UUIDField` to `ForeignKey`, we can infer the likely locations and intended behavior needed to resolve this problem.\n\n### Need More Context\nTo pinpoint the bug's location and fully understand the issue, additional context would be critical. Specifically, examining the autodetector logic and how Django's migration system processes model field changes would be necessary. However, without executing more search API calls, we can hypothesize the potential bug locations based on standard Django migration behaviors and the nature of the issue described.\n\n### Hypothetical Bug Locations\n\n1. **File**: `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`\n   - **Class**: N/A\n   - **Method**: Potentially within methods responsible for detecting changes to model fields, especially those handling conversion to `ForeignKey`.\n   - **Intended Behavior**: The autodetector logic should identify a change from `UUIDField` to `ForeignKey` not merely as a field type change but also as a relational change that involves adding a dependency to another model (`App2` in this case). This would require ensuring the migration system generates a dependency for `App2` whenever such a change is detected, to ensure migrations are applied in the correct order and the database integrity is maintained.\n\n2. **File**: Custom migration file for changing `UUIDField` to `ForeignKey` within `App1`\n   - **Class**: The migration class for this specific change\n   - **Method**: The generated operations within this migration\n   - **Intended Behavior**: In the generated migration file, the operations should correctly reference `App2` as a dependency in the `dependencies` list of the migration class. This might involve manually editing the migration file to include this dependency or ensuring the migration autodetector logic is updated to automatically include such dependencies in future.\n\nGiven the lack of direct code or migration file access, these hypothetical locations and intended behaviors are inferred based on Django's migration system's typical operation and the described issue. Resolving the issue would likely involve ensuring the migration system accurately captures and represents the dependency relationships when model field types are altered, especially when moving to a relational field type like `ForeignKey`."
