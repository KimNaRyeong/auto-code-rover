        "content": "<issue>RFC ColumnTransformer input validation and requirements\nThere have been some issues around ColumnTransformer input requirements that I think we might want to discuss more explicitly. Examples are an actual bug when changing columns: #14237 and how to define number of input features #13603.\nRelated is also the idea of checking for column name consistency: #7242\nMainly I'm asking whether it makes sense to have the same requirements for ColumnTransformer as for other estimators.\nColumnTransformer is the only estimator that addresses columns by name, and so reordering columns doesn't impact the model and actually everything works fine. Should we still aim for checking for reordering of columns?\nRight now, ``transform`` even works if we add additional columns to ``X``, which makes sense, since it only cares about the columns it is using.\nShould we allow that going forward as long as remainder is not used? (if remainder is used, the result of ``ColumnTransformer`` would have a different shape and downstream estimators would break, so I think we shouldn't support it in this case).\nIn either case, what's ``n_features_in_`` for a ColumnTransformer? The number of columns in ``X`` during ``fit`` or the number of columns actually used?\nDoes it even make sense to define it if we allow adding other columns that are ignored?\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather more context about the `ColumnTransformer` class, its method `transform`, and how `ColumnTransformer` handles inputs, especially dealing with the number of input features (`n_features_in_`) and column reordering or additional columns. Here are the API calls we should make:\n\n1. **Search for the `ColumnTransformer` Class**: To better understand how `ColumnTransformer` is implemented and to see what validations and operations are performed during initialization and transformations.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"ColumnTransformer\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for the `transform` Method in the `ColumnTransformer` Class**: Since the issue discusses how `transform` works even if additional columns are added to `X`, understanding this method in detail is crucial.\n\n   ```python\n   search_method_in_class(\"transform\", \"ColumnTransformer\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for Code Related to `n_features_in_` in `ColumnTransformer`**: This will help us understand how `ColumnTransformer` calculates or uses `n_features_in_`, which is fundamental to understanding if and how we should modify its behavior regarding additional columns or column reordering.\n\n   ```python\n   search_code_in_file(\"n_features_in_\", \"ColumnTransformer\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls are designed to gather detailed information on the implementation and behavior of `ColumnTransformer`, focusing on areas relevant to the issue discussed. This gathered information will be essential for proposing changes to address the concerns raised regarding input validation and requirements."
