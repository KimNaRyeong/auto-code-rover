        "intended_behavior": "The validation logic in the `transform` method should be updated to allow the transformation to proceed when the input `X` contains additional columns not seen during the fitting phase, provided these columns are not directly involved in any transformations. Specifically, adjust the strict comparison that raises an error if the input `X` during transformation has more features than what was present during fitting to allow additional columns as long as they do not interfere with the configured transformers or change the expected output shape. Maintain existing functionality and error handling for scenarios where the number of features relevant to the transformers is less than during fitting. Clearly document this behavior in the method's comments."
