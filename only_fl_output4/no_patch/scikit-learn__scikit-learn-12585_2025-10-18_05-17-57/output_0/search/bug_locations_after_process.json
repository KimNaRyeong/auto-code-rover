        "intended_behavior": "The `clone` method should be able to correctly clone both instances and class types of estimators. Currently, it fails when trying to clone a class type because it treats every argument as if it were an instance (attempting to call `get_params` directly on it). To resolve the issue, `clone` needs to distinguish between class types and instances. When the argument is a class type (specifically, subclassing an estimator), it should not attempt to call `get_params()` on it directly. Instead, it could pass through class types unchanged or initiate an exception handling process tailored for dealing with class types, thus allowing the flexibility needed to support the use case presented in the issue. This behavior should preserve existing functionality for instance parameters while adding support for class type parameters, ensuring that cloning operations do not fail when encountering an estimator type as a parameter."
