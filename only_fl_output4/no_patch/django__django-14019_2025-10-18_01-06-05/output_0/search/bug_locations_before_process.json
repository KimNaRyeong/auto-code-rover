        "intended_behavior": "The `__repr__` methods for `Index`, `UniqueConstraint`, `ExclusionConstraint`, and `CheckConstraint` should follow a consistent string representation format that maintains readability and informativeness while ensuring they are easily distinguishable. The intended behavior involves standardizing the format of the output string to reflect essential attributes in a consistent order and format, accommodating each constraint's unique attributes but in a unified manner. This means:\n\n- Presenting attributes in a consistent order where possible.\n- Using consistent phrasing for attributes that are present or omitted.\n- Keeping the formatting style uniform across different classes (for example, deciding whether to use `' attribute=%s'` vs. `' attribute='%s'`, or how to display lists of items).\n- Ensuring the string is informative and reflects key attributes specific to each constraint's functionality.\n\n- Attributes like `fields`, `expressions`, `condition`, `include`, and `opclasses` which are common across these classes should be presented in a consistent manner regarding order and formatting.\n- For distinguishing between different constraints, ensure the class name is prominently included.\n- Conditions or settings that are `None` or not present should either be consistently included with a marker (e.g., `None` or `Not set`) or omitted in a uniform way across constraints.\n- The representation should aim to be concise but complete, ensuring that developers can grasp the constraint's key aspects at a glance.\n\nImplementing these changes will address the inconsistency issue, making the `__repr__` outputs across different constraint classes more aligned with each other, thus resolving the issue described."
