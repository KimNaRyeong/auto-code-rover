We might call this `combine_attrs=\"drop_conflicts\"` or `combine_attrs=\"matching\"`.\nThis is similar to how xarray currently handles conflicting values for `DataArray.name` and would be more suitable to consider for the default behavior of `merge` and other functions/methods that merge coordinates (e.g., apply_ufunc, concat, where, binary arithmetic).\ncc @keewis\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the results from the initial API calls, we find that the implementation details and usage of `combine_attrs` are quite spread throughout the `xarray` codebase. The `merge()` function and the handling of `combine_attrs` are centrally located in files that deal with core functionalities of merging datasets and coordinates. This suggests that the implementation of a new `combine_attrs` option would likely involve modifications in these areas. \n\n1. **xarray/core/merge.py**: Given that this file contains matches for both the `merge` method and the `combine_attrs` snippets, it's a key area for the implementation. The `merge.py` file is likely responsible for the internal logic of merging operations within `xarray`, including how attributes from multiple datasets are combined based on the specified `combine_attrs` strategy.\n\n2. **xarray/core/dataset.py**: This file contains implementations of `merge` methods that may offer high-level interfaces for merging datasets. Changes here could be necessary to propagate the new `combine_attrs` option to users.\n\n3. **xarray/core/combine.py & xarray/core/concat.py**: These files seem to handle combining datasets in various ways and also reference `combine_attrs`, indicating that the new option will need to be supported in these combining mechanics as well.\n\n4. **xarray/backends/api.py**: The matches in this file suggest that `combine_attrs` is also a consideration when loading datasets from files, where merging might occur. It hints at the need to ensure that the new option is compatible with data loading processes.\n\nGiven the scope of `combine_attrs` across merging, concatenation, and dataset loading, the intended behavior of the parts of the code involving this option is to dictate how attributes from multiple sources should be aggregated or resolved. The issue requests an enhancement to handle conflicting attributes by dropping them instead of raising an error or requiring them to match exactly.\n\nFor a next step based on this analysis, focusing on `merge.py` would provide the deepest insights into how the current strategies are implemented and where to introduce the new behavior. Specifically, looking at how `combine_attrs` options are currently processed and identifying where to integrate the logic for `drop_conflicts` or `matching` would be critical. \n\nTo proceed, we should:\n- search_method_in_file(\"merge\", \"xarray/core/merge.py\")\n- search_code_in_file(\"combine_attrs\", \"xarray/core/merge.py\")"

Since the specific class/method needs to be pinpointed for the exact modification, the focus would be on wherever `combine_attrs` options are interpreted and acted upon within this file.\n\n**Intended Behavior:**\nTo introduce a `combine_attrs=\"drop_conflicts\"` or `combine_attrs=\"matching\"` option that modifies the behavior of attribute combination during merge operations. The new functionality needs to examine the attributes of all objects being merged. If any attribute is found with conflicting values among these objects, those conflicting attributes should be dropped from the resulting merged dataset instead of raising an error or requiring an exact match. This behavior adds flexibility by allowing merges to proceed smoothly even in the presence of certain attribute conflicts, which caters to use cases where exact attribute alignment is non-essential. The implementation must ensure that this option does not interfere with the existing functionality for other `combine_attrs` values and that it's compliant with the way attributes are handled across different merge-related operations (`apply_ufunc, concat, where, binary arithmetic`). This requires careful integration into the current logic to handle the new policy without adverse side effects on existing behaviors."
