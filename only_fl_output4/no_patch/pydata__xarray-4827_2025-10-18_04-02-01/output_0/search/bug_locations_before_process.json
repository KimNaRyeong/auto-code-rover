        "intended_behavior": "This method should be extended to include a new `combine_attrs` option, possibly named `drop_conflicts`. When this option is selected, the method should combine attributes from all input objects, but if an attribute exists in more than one object with different values, those attributes should be silently dropped from the resulting object. This change allows for a flexible merging process that can ignore non-critical metadata conflicts, thereby facilitating operations on datasets with minor discrepancies in their attributes. The existing functionality for other `combine_attrs` values (`drop`, `identical`, `no_conflicts`, `override`) must remain unchanged to ensure backward compatibility and maintain current use cases. Implementing this behavior likely involves adding conditional logic within `merge_attrs` to check for the `combine_attrs` value being set to `drop_conflicts` and applying the necessary attribute handling logic accordingly."

        "intended_behavior": "Ensure that the implementation of `merge_core` correctly interprets and applies the new `combine_attrs` strategy when combining datasets. While `merge_core` might not need significant modification itself, it's crucial to verify that it properly utilizes `merge_attrs` with the newly introduced `combine_attrs` option. If necessary, adjustments should be made to ensure that `combine_attrs='drop_conflicts'` correctly influences the merging process, leading to the exclusion of conflicting attributes as per the new strategy. This step is to ensure that the higher-level `merge()` function and other functions that rely on `merge_core` for attribute handling can seamlessly integrate with the new option without altering the expected behavior for existing merging strategies."
