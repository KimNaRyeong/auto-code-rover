        "content": "To effectively gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to the way Django admin doesn't display proper Unicode characters in JSONFields, especially for Chinese characters, we can make the following API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the method that serializes JSON in the Django admin:**\n   The core of the issue lies in how JSON serialization happens within the Django admin for `JSONField`. Since `json.dumps` is mentioned explicitly to use ASCII encoding by default, we need to look for the Django admin method or utility that serializes `JSONField`. This could likely be in the form of a method that explicitly calls `json.dumps`.\n\n   - `search_method(method_name=\"json.dumps\")`\n\n2. **Look for customization in Django-MySQL integration:**\n   Given the user attempted a fix in `django-mysql`, it's essential to check any serialization customization within this library regarding `JSONField`.\n\n   - `search_code(code_str=\"JSONField\")`\n\n3. **Find the specific customization or method override for JSONFields in the admin panel:**\n   Since the issue specifically mentions Django admin and JSONFields' display, checking for any overrides or custom widgets used for `JSONField` in the Django admin interface could be vital.\n\n   - `search_code(code_str=\"class JSONField\")`\n   - `search_code(code_str=\"admin.py\")` to check if any customization is happening within the admin.py file that may relate to the handling or display of JSONFields.\n\nThese calls should give us a comprehensive set of information to understand where and how the JSON serialization is happening for `JSONField` in Django admin that might be causing the issue with Unicode characters, specifically Chinese characters, and how it's managed in the context of `django-mysql`."
