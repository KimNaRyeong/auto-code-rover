        "intended_behavior": "The `aggregate` method should be enhanced to correctly handle aggregated fields when they are used within `Case-When` expressions for further calculations. This involves ensuring that internally, the method can resolve references to aggregated fields correctly when they're part of a `Case` expression or used elsewhere within the same `aggregate` call. The intended behavior would preserve its existing functionality of performing aggregations over querysets, while adding the ability to reference these aggregated fields in subsequent operations without error. The correction should specifically address the resolution of aggregated field names within expressions, ensuring they can be correctly interpreted as part of complex calculations."

        "intended_behavior": "The `Case` class should properly integrate with aggregate functions, especially in situations where aggregated fields are referenced within its cases. The handling of aggregate references needs to be seamless, allowing `Case` expressions to be evaluated correctly when involving previously defined aggregated fields. This might entail enhancing the resolution process within the `Case` and potentially the `When` classes to ensure they can access and compute using the context of aggregated results correctly. The aim is to allow `Case` expressions to function predictably across various complex use cases, including when they depend on results of earlier aggregations in the query, without affecting the current functionality beyond this context."
