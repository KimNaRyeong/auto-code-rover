To avoid a zero division problem, we were using a Case-When clause over that field. It works well on any 4.1 and prior versions but stopped working since 4.2, raising a FieldError like:\nCannot resolve keyword 'sum_total_objs' into field\nThe bug is reproducible with an extra test on the django aggregation test suite:\ndef test_referenced_group_by_aggregation_over_annotation(self):\ntotal_books_qs = (\nBook.objects.filter(authors__pk=OuterRef(\"pk\"))\n.order_by()\n.values(\"pk\")\n.annotate(total=Count(\"pk\"))\n.values(\"total\")\n)\nannotated_authors = Author.objects.annotate(\ntotal_books=Subquery(total_books_qs.annotate(\ntotal_books=F(\"total\")\n).values(\"total_books\")),\ntotal_books_a=Subquery(total_books_qs.filter(\nname__istartswith=\"a\"\n).annotate(\ntotal_books_a=F(\"total\")\n).values(\"total_books_a\")),\n).values(\n\"pk\",\n\"total_books\",\n\"total_books_a\",\n).order_by(\"-total_books\")\ntotals = annotated_authors.aggregate(\nsum_total_books=Sum(\"total_books\"),\nsum_total_books_a=Sum(\"total_books_a\"),\na_over_total_rate=Case(\nWhen(\nsum_total_books=0,\nthen=0,\n),\ndefault=Round(\n(Sum(\"total_books_a\") / Sum(\"total_books\")) * 100, 2\n),\noutput_field=FloatField(),\n),\n)\nself.assertEqual(totals['sum_total_books'], 3)\nself.assertEqual(totals['sum_total_books_a'], 0)\nself.assertEqual(totals['a_over_total_rate'], 0)\nThanks for the support!\n</issue>"

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. `aggregate` Method in `django/db/models/query.py`\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `aggregate` method allows for aggregating values across the entire queryset, returning a dictionary of aggregate values based on the provided arguments. It validates the expressions for aggregation, checks for compatibility with the `distinct(fields)` feature, handles argument aliases, and ultimately calls `get_aggregation` on the queryset's query chain to compute the aggregate values.\n   \n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The bug described in the issue relates directly to the `aggregate` method's inability to resolve an aggregated field (`sum_total_objs`) as part of a computation within a `Case-When` expression in version 4.2. It seems the method might be handling field resolution or aggregation within `Case-When` expressions differently from previous versions, leading to the `FieldError`.\n   \n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Ideally, the `aggregate` method should be able to handle complex expressions that utilize previously computed aggregate fields in further computations, especially within `Case-When` statements. This includes being able to use an aggregated field to perform additional calculations (e.g., to prevent division by zero or calculate rates) correctly.\n\n#### 2. `Case` Class in `django/db/models/expressions.py`\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `Case` class implements conditional expressions in SQL, generating a `CASE WHEN...THEN...ELSE...END` SQL structure. It allows branching logic within query expressions, dynamically changing the output of a SQL query based on conditions.\n   \n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The `Case` class would be essential for correctly interpreting and translating the `Case-When` logic described in the bug into valid SQL, especially when involving aggregated values as conditions. The issue implies a possible shortcoming in handling or resolving aggregated fields as part of conditions in version 4.2.\n   \n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - It should seamlessly support the use of aggregated fields in its conditions, allowing operations like comparison, which are critical for calculations-based logic in determining the outcome of a `Case-When` expression. \n\n#### 3. `When` Class in `django/db/models/expressions.py`\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `When` class is a component of the conditional expression handling within Django queries, representing the `WHEN` part of the SQL case statement. It associates conditions with specific outcomes (`THEN`) in a `Case` expression.\n   \n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Given the error message reported in the bug, the handling of aggregated fields within a `When` condition might be part of the malfunction. Specifically, the ability to recognize and correctly process an aggregate field (`sum_total_objs`) used as a condition might be failing or changed in version 4.2.\n   \n- **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be to accurately evaluate conditions based on aggregated fields, allowing for complex logic within queries that depend on aggregate computations performed earlier in the query or subquery.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Context\nSince the initial search for the test method `test_referenced_group_by_aggregation_over_annotation` returned no results, but noting that the issue involves testing aggregation functionality, I should consider alternative strategies to find related tests or implementation details. This can include searching for tests related to the `aggregate` method or the handling of `Case-When` expressions in aggregations, which could have been modified in the transition to version 4.2, contributing to the issue at hand. Additionally, examining commit logs or changelogs specifically focusing on versions transitioning from 4.1.X to 4.2.X related to the `QuerySet` class or aggregation framework may provide insights into changes that could have introduced this bug."

This involves ensuring that internally, the method can resolve references to aggregated fields correctly when they're part of a `Case` expression or used elsewhere within the same `aggregate` call. The intended behavior would preserve its existing functionality of performing aggregations over querysets, while adding the ability to reference these aggregated fields in subsequent operations without error. The correction should specifically address the resolution of aggregated field names within expressions, ensuring they can be correctly interpreted as part of complex calculations.\n\n### Bug Location 2:\n- **File:** `django/db/models/expressions.py`\n- **Class:** `Case`\n- **Intended Behavior:**\n  - The `Case` class should properly integrate with aggregate functions, especially in situations where aggregated fields are referenced within its cases. The handling of aggregate references needs to be seamless, allowing `Case` expressions to be evaluated correctly when involving previously defined aggregated fields. This might entail enhancing the resolution process within the `Case` and potentially the `When` classes to ensure they can access and compute using the context of aggregated results correctly. The aim is to allow `Case` expressions to function predictably across various complex use cases, including when they depend on results of earlier aggregations in the query, without affecting the current functionality beyond this context."
