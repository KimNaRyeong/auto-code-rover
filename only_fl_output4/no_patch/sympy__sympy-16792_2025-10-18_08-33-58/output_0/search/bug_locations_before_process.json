        "intended_behavior": "This method should be enhanced to accurately declare array types for arguments identified as such (e.g., instances of `MatrixSymbol`). It needs to include logic that distinguishes between scalar and array (or pointer in C terms) types based on the symbolic expression analysis. The enhancement would ensure that the C code uses `double*` for arrays instead of `double` for scalar values, accurately reflecting the nature of the argument as it was defined in the SymPy expression."

        "method": "_prototype_arg",
        "intended_behavior": "Similar to `_declare_arg`, this method also requires adjustments to correctly generate function prototypes that account for array arguments. The method should generate prototype strings which correctly identify `MatrixSymbol` arguments as `double*` (or appropriate pointer types) instead of simply `double`. This adjustment ensures the generated Cython wrappers can handle array inputs without type conflicts, aligning the prototype with the actual argument types being passed."
