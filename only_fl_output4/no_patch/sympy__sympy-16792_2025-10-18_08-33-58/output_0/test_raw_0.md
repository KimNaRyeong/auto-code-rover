This script attempts to execute the provided scenario and uses the `print_stacktrace` function to print detailed debugging information upon encountering an exception that would likely arise due to the issue described. If the function `f` with the Cython backend returns the correct result (`1.0`), it prints a message indicating no issue was found. However, if there's any discrepancy or an exception is thrown, the script tries to print a detailed stack trace and exits with code `1`. 

Please ensure Cython and SymPy are installed in your environment before running this script. You can install these dependencies via pip if needed:

```sh
pip install cython sympy
```
