        "content": "To gather context and information that would assist in resolving the issue with the filter on exists-subquery with an empty queryset removing the entire WHERE block, the following API calls are required based on the details provided in the issue:\n\n1. Search for the Django model involved to understand if there are any custom implementations that could be causing the issue:\n   - `search_class(\"MyModel\")`\n\n2. The issue mentions a specific use of the `filter()` method involving a negated `Exists` subquery, so examining the implementation of the `filter` method can provide insights:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"filter\", \"QuerySet\")`\n\n3. Since the issue seems related to `Exists` within the framework of Django's ORM, more details on `Exists` should be helpful:\n   - `search_class(\"Exists\")`\n\n4. The issue could be related to how queries are constructed when `Exists().none()` is used. So, understanding how `none()` is implemented within querysets could be relevant:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"none\", \"QuerySet\")`\n\n5. Finally, understanding how the `EmptyResultSet` exception is used within Django's ORM might provide clues, since the issue description mentions this:\n   - `search_code(\"EmptyResultSet\")`\n\nThese API calls target critical components related to the issue, such as `MyModel`, `Exists`, and the `filter` method on a `QuerySet`, and look for potential interaction points that could lead to the described bug."
