The `as_sql` method, which generates the SQL for the EXISTS expression, should be reviewed to confirm it handles empty querysets in a way that does not lead to the entire WHERE block being omitted. This means likely adding logic to preserve a placeholder or no-op condition in the SQL when faced with an empty queryset, ensuring the WHERE clause is still present even if it's logically empty."

This might involve marking the QuerySet in a specific way that `Exists` can detect and handle appropriately, ensuring that the intended logic of 'no results possible' is encoded into the SQL without dropping the WHERE clause entirely."

A revision might be necessary to ensure that when compiling queries involving an `Exists` subquery that has been negated and is based on an `none()` queryset, the compiler preserves the WHERE block appropriately, potentially as a no-op or always-false condition, thereby conveying the intended semantics of the original queryset filtering criteria without erroneously excluding necessary SQL syntax."
