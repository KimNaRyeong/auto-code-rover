Keep in mind, `execute_from_command_line(['manage.py', 'migrate'])` is utilized to mimic running management commands which can also set up the environment before working with models. For this script to work correctly, `django` must be installed in your environment (`pip install django`), and the script must be named `reproducer.py` and placed in a directory where Django won't encounter conflicts with other files named `manage.py` or `settings.py`. \n\nThis script should now raise an AssertionError if the issue described is present (i.e., the Django ORM incorrectly removes the WHERE block when it should not), and it will correctly handle setup and the teardown of the Django environment."
