        "intended_behavior": "Introduce or modify existing pretty-print logic for `Product` objects that achieves the following goals: 1. Eliminate Extra Line: Adjust the pretty printing output to remove the extraneous empty line at the bottom, creating a more compact and symmetric appearance. 2. Adjust Width: Modify the visual representation of the product (\u220f) to be less wide, ensuring it's visually consistent with mathematical norms and other objects within `sympy`. 3. Optional Top Bar Extension: Evaluate and potentially implement the extension of the top bar of the product notation for a better visual alignment, especially when unicode is utilized. 4. Unicode and Non-Unicode Consideration: Ensure that these adjustments are compatible with both unicode and non-unicode settings, maintaining the distinction between these modes as dictated by the `use_unicode` flag. 5. Preserve Mathematical Integrity: All changes should strictly pertain to visual presentation, not affecting the mathematical representation or accuracy of the `Product` object's pretty-printing function."
