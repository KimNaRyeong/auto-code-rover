Keeping everything below the horizontal line is good, but the bottom looks asymmetric, and it makes the \u220f bigger than it needs to be.\n- The \u220f is too fat IMO.\n- It might look better if we extended the top bar. I'm unsure about this.\nCompare this\n```\n\u221e\n\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\n\u2502     \u2502  1\n\u2502     \u2502  \u2500\u2500\n\u2502     \u2502   2\n\u2502     \u2502  n\nn = 1\n```\nThat's still almost twice as wide as the equivalent Sum, but if you make it much skinnier it starts to look bad.\n```\n\u221e\n____\n\u2572\n\u2572   1\n\u2572  \u2500\u2500\n\u2571   2\n\u2571   n\n\u2571\n\u203e\u203e\u203e\u203e\nn = 1\n```\n</issue>"

This suggests the next logical steps are to inspect how `Product` objects are handled by the pretty-printing logic, and how we can customize this to achieve the desired output as raised in the issue. The intended behavior would be a modification to the pretty printing logic to present `Product` objects in a more compact and symmetric format, following the specific enhancements suggested.\n\nTo get more context on how `Product` objects are specifically handled by the pretty print system, and to see where the adjustments for its output can be made, the following API calls can be suggested:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"pretty\", \"sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py\")` to inspect how pretty printing decisions are made, including handling of `use_unicode`.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"Product\", \"sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py\")` to directly find if there are case handling or dispatch mechanisms for `Product` objects within the pretty printer."
