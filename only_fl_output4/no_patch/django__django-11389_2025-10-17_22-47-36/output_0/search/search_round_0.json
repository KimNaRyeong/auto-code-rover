        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue described, we need to look for how `SessionStore` is implemented, specifically focusing on `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date` methods since the issue suggests these are the methods where `settings.SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` is utilized and may need to be overridden for dynamic session cookie age functionality. Let's make the following API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"SessionStore\")` - To find in which files the `SessionStore` class is defined.\n2. `search_method(\"get_expiry_age\")` - To find where and how the method `get_expiry_age` is implemented across the project.\n3. `search_method(\"get_expiry_date\")` - To find where and how the method `get_expiry_date` is implemented across the project.\n4. `search_code(\"settings.SESSION_COOKIE_AGE\")` - To find where `settings.SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` is being used. This is critical for understanding the current implementation and how it can be dynamically overridden."
