        "intended_behavior": "This method should be extended to check the admin site through which the request is made and filter `LogEntry` objects not just by `object_id` and `content_type`, but also to ensure that they are related to models registered with the specific `AdminSite` instance handling the request. This could involve adding a reference from each `LogEntry` to the `AdminSite` it originated from or inferring the relation through the content type and registered models. This change needs to preserve the existing functionality of displaying a history of changes for an object within the admin interface, adding an additional layer of filtering based on the admin site to which the request belongs."

        "intended_behavior": "In the context of rendering log entries (likely for dashboard widgets or a similar use case), this method should be extended to allow filtering log entries by admin site. This would ensure that when logs are displayed in an admin site, they only include entries for models that are registered with that specific site. Similar to the enhancement in `ModelAdmin.history_view`, this might require modifying how `LogEntry` objects are queried, considering the admin site context. The existing functionality of filtering by user ID and limiting the number of entries should be preserved while adding the capability to filter by the relevant admin site."
