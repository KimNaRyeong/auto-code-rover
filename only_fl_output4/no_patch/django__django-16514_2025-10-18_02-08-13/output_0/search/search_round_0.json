It is confusing for users to access a specific site and see log entries for models they can't access.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need context regarding how `LogEntry` models are currently being logged and displayed in the Django admin site, and understand the mechanism by which models are registered to admin sites. Given the nature of the issue, we will likely be looking into how admin sites are initialized and how `LogEntry` objects are filtered and displayed in the admin interface. \n\nKey areas to investigate include:\n1. The implementation of the `AdminSite` class, where model registration happens.\n2. How `LogEntry` models are linked to the registered models and if there\u2019s any existing functionality for filtering these based on the admin site.\n3. Any existing method or class that handles the display of `LogEntry` models in the admin interface.\n\nFirst, let's get an overview of the `AdminSite` class and the `LogEntry` model. Since the issue discusses filtering `LogEntry` by registered models in admin sites, understanding these classes and their interactions will provide crucial context. \n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"AdminSite\")\nsearch_class(\"LogEntry\")\n```\n\nNext, to find how `LogEntry` models are currently handled or displayed within an `AdminSite`, we should look for methods related to this operation. It\u2019s possible that the integration point might not be explicitly named in relation to `LogEntry` or `AdminSite`, so we need a broader search approach.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"log_addition\", \"AdminSite\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"log_change\", \"AdminSite\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"log_deletion\", \"AdminSite\")\nsearch_method(\"get_queryset\")\n```\n\nLastly, to directly find any mention of `LogEntry` being filtered or associated with specific models in the admin context, a code snippet search that includes terms like \u201cfilter\u201d, \u201cLogEntry\u201d, and perhaps \u201cregister\u201d with `AdminSite` could reveal potential areas of interest.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"LogEntry.objects.filter\")\n```\n\nThese searches combined should provide sufficient context from the codebase for solving the issue described, which revolves around ensuring `LogEntry` displays are filtered by models registered to a specific `AdminSite`."
