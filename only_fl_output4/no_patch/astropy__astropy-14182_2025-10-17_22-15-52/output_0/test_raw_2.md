Based on your requirements, below is a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue mentioned. Note that this script checks specifically for the ability to use `header_rows` with the `ascii.rst` format in the `astropy.table.QTable.write` method and will raise an `AssertionError` if the feature does not work as expected. The script also includes the function to print a detailed stack trace in case of an error, adhering to the format you provided.

```python
# reproducer.py
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from astropy.table import QTable
    import astropy.units as u
    import sys

    # Construct a QTable object with units.
    tbl = QTable({'wave': [350, 950] * u.nm, 'response': [0.7, 1.2] * u.count})

    # Test the `ascii.rst` format without header_rows to ensure basic functionality.
    try:
        tbl.write(sys.stdout, format="ascii.rst")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Basic `ascii.rst` functionality failure:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Basic ASCII RST writing failed. The issue cannot be isolated to `header_rows` parameter.") from None

    # Attempt to use `header_rows` with `ascii.rst` format which is expected to fail if the issue exists.
    try:
        tbl.write(sys.stdout, format="ascii.rst", header_rows=["name", "unit"])
    except TypeError as e:
        # If this specific error is caught, it means the issue is present.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue with `header_rows` argument in `ascii.rst` format is confirmed.") from None
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected error occurred while testing `header_rows`:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise
    else:
        # If no error is raised, it means the functionality may have been implemented or fixed.
        print("No errors detected with `header_rows` argument in `ascii.rst` format. The issue might have been fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        exit(1)
    else:
        exit(0)
```

To run the script, save it as `reproducer.py` in the root directory of your project. Then execute it with the command `python3 reproducer.py`. The script outputs a detailed stack trace if the functionality for `header_rows` in the `ascii.rst` format is not supported or raises another error. It will exit with code 0 if the issue appears to be fixed, allowing for easy integration into automated testing environments. Please ensure you have `astropy` installed in your environment where you run this script.
