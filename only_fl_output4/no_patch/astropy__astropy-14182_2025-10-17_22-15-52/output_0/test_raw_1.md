Given the feedback, it appears that the previous attempt to create a working example had execution issues due to environment setup, particularly related to the `astropy` and `packaging` Python modules. To address this, I'm providing another attempt at a standalone Python script as requested. However, it's crucial to ensure that all dependencies, including `astropy` and `packaging`, are properly installed in your Python environment before executing the script. If these modules are not installed, you can install them using pip (`pip install astropy packaging`) or ensure your Python environment is correctly set up to include these modules.

Let's adjust the script slightly to ensure it better checks for the discussed feature (handling of `header_rows` in RestructuredText output of `astropy.table.QTable`) while incorporating the provided function for printing the stack trace.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from astropy.table import QTable
    import astropy.units as u
    import sys

    # Setup test case the reproduces the reported issue.
    tbl = QTable({'wave': [350, 950] * u.nm, 'response': [0.7, 1.2] * u.count})

    # Original line that succeeded as per issue description.
    tbl.write(sys.stdout, format="ascii.rst")

    try:
        # Attempt to produce output with custom header rows using ascii.rst format which originally failed.
        tbl.write(sys.stdout, format="ascii.rst", header_rows=["name", "unit"])
    except TypeError as error:
        print_stacktrace(error)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is still present.") from None
    except Exception as error:
        print("An unexpected error occurred:", error)
        raise
    else:
        print("No errors detected. The issue might have been fixed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as error:
        print(error)
        exit(1)
    else:
        exit(0)
```
This script now checks for the specific issue with handling of `header_rows` in the `ascii.rst` format and uses the provided `print_stacktrace` function to print detailed error information, should the issue still occur. Before running this script, please ensure your environment is correctly setup with all necessary dependencies. If the script exits with code 0, it suggests the issue might have been fixed; otherwise, it will provide detailed error traceback for further investigation.
