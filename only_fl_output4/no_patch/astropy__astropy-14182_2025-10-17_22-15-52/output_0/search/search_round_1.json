        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### 1. astropy/table/table.py (QTable)\n- **What does this part of the code do?:** It shows that `QTable` is a class that inherits from `Table`. The snippet provided does not include the `write` method directly, suggesting that `QTable` likely utilizes the `write` method from its superclass `Table` or through the `astropy` I/O registry mechanism.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** Since the issue relates to the `write` method not supporting `header_rows` in `ascii.rst` format, it's clear that the implementation or handling of the `write` method (likely in a superclass or through a registry) is where the enhancement needs to be integrated.\n- **Intended behavior:** Given the issue, the `write` method used by instances of `QTable` should be able to interpret and correctly handle the `header_rows` argument when exporting tables in the `rst` format.\n\n#### 2. astropy/io/ascii/rst.py (RST)\n- **What does this part of the code do?:** This snippet reveals the `RST` class that extends `FixedWidth`, aimed at handling reStructuredText table formatting. It mentions `data_class` and `header_class` but does not provide details on how `write` is implemented.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** Directly related. The issue stems from `RST.__init__()` not recognizing the `header_rows` keyword argument. Adjustments here are necessary to allow for `header_rows` handling to fulfill the issue request.\n- **Intended behavior:** The `RST` class should accept `header_rows` as an argument and modify the header output accordingly, in alignment with its usage in `fixedwidth` format or similarly flexible formats.\n\n#### 3. astropy/io/ascii/fixedwidth.py (Usage of header_rows)\n- **What does this part of the code do?:** This implies that `header_rows` functionality is implemented and utilized within the context of `FixedWidth` ASCII tables, hinting at existing logic that could potentially be adapted or referenced for `RST` format support.\n- **Relationship to the bug:** This is a key area concerning how `header_rows` is handled in a format that successfully interprets this argument. Learning how `fixedwidth.py` processes `header_rows` could inform a similar implementation in the `RST` writer.\n- **Intended behavior:** The handling of `header_rows` within `fixedwidth` serves as a model for how the `RST` format could manage such an argument, suggesting that a similar approach should be integrated into `RST` to achieve consistency across formats.\n\n#### Next Steps:\nGiven this analysis, the next logical steps involve:\n1. **Examining the implementation of `write` in `Table`:** Since `QTable` likely uses `Table`'s `write` method, understanding its mechanism for format handling is crucial. A search in `Table` for the `write` method would provide insight.\n2. **Investigating `RST.write` implementation details:** Detailed examination of how the `write` method is implemented within the `RST` class is necessary to plan the integration of `header_rows` support.\n3. **Comparing with `FixedWidth` handling of `header_rows`:** A deeper look into `fixedwidth.py` to understand how `header_rows` is processed and reflected in the output could guide modifications to the `RST` class.\n\nFor these next steps, further API calls targeting these specific areas of interest would be essential for crafting a well-informed approach to resolving the issue."

This argument should influence the `write` method to output header rows based on the content of `header_rows`, similar to how it is handled in the `fixedwidth.py` implementation. The `write` method should be updated or extended to use the `header_rows` content to generate the appropriate header lines in the resulting RestructuredText table, prioritizing this functionality while maintaining existing features for RST output.\n  \n- **Location 2: File: astropy/io/ascii/rst.py, Class: RST, Method: write**\n  - **Intended Behavior:** Extend the `write` method to dynamically handle `header_rows`, such that if `header_rows` is provided, the method utilizes this for generating the table header in the RestructuredText output. This involves adapting or revising the logic to insert names and units (if provided in `header_rows`) above the standard column headers, ensuring the output aligns with the RestructuredText table standards. The method should gracefully handle cases where `header_rows` are not provided, defaulting to the current behavior."
