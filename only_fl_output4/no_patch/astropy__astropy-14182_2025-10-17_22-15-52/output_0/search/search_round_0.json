        "content": "To effectively address the issue described, which involves adding support for `header_rows` in RestructuredText output for `astropy.table`'s write method, we need to gather specific context about the implementation of RestructuredText (RST) formatting, the `write` method, and how it delegates the writing process to different formats, particularly focusing on how `ascii.rst` is implemented. Here are the API calls we need to make:\n\n1. Look for where the `write` method is implemented within `QTable` or its parent classes to understand how the format argument is interpreted and handled.\n2. Investigate the RST writer class or function in `astropy.io.ascii` to identify how it is currently handling headers and what modifications might be necessary to support `header_rows`.\n3. Check for the method or function responsible for parsing the `header_rows` argument when given in other formats like `ascii.fixed_width` to understand how it's implemented there and to ensure consistency in the implementation across different formats.\n\nHere are the corresponding API calls:\n\n- `search_method(\"write\")`: To locate all instances of `write` methods in the project which would give us pointers on how the writing process is initiated.\n- `search_class(\"RST\")`: This would help locate the RestructuredText class or writer implementation.\n- `search_class(\"QTable\")`: To find the `QTable` class definition and see if the `write` method is defined or modified here.\n- `search_code(\"header_rows\")`: To find snippets where `header_rows` is used or mentioned, which could give us insight into how this argument is handled in other parts of the project."
