        "intended_behavior": "The current implementation of this method uses a hardcoded `copy=False` when calling the `transform` method on the `_tfidf` transformer. This behavior is efficient and intended as it avoids unnecessary duplication during the transformation. The intention here is to ensure that the behavior is clearly documented, explaining that during `fit_transform`, the transformation is done in-place for efficiency reasons, and thus, the `copy` parameter is not exposed to the user for this operation. If the `copy` parameter is to be exposed for `fit_transform` in the future, it should be implemented in a manner that allows users to choose whether the transformation is done in-place or on a copy, ensuring that the default behavior remains as efficient as it currently is while providing flexibility for cases where the original data must remain unchanged."

        "intended_behavior": "The `transform` method already respects the `copy` parameter, implying that the handling of data copying or in-place modification during transformation is driven by this parameter. The documentation and implementation are consistent with the intended functionality. However, for absolute clarity, ensure documentation around this method explicitly states the implications of the `copy` parameter, especially highlighting the default behavior and its impact on data handling. This behavior is critical for understanding how data is manipulated during the transformation process and directly relates to the concerns raised in the issue."
