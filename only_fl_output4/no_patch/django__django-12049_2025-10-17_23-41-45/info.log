</code><intended_behavior>The method should modify its mechanism to compare `field.column` with `column_names` in a case-insensitive manner. This adjustment would accurately reflect databases with case-insensitive collation settings. The modification could involve ensuring `column_names` are normalized to a consistent case (lower or upper) before the comparison and similarly normalizing `field.column`. This approach should be database-agnostic to a degree, provided it respects the specific database's case sensitivity configuration currently in use. This change ensures that migrations involving case-sensitive column names are correctly detected as applied or not, without altering the functionality for projects using case-sensitive databases. This solution maintains the integrity of database schema checks against migrations, thereby avoiding erroneous migration application errors or skipped migrations due to misidentification of existing tables or columns.</intended_behavior>, <file>django/db/migrations/executor.py</file>
