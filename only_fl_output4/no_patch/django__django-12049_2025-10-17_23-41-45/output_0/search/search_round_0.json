        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more context about the classes, methods, and specific code blocks mentioned in the user's description. The relevant parts from the issue are:\n\n- The file where the potential bug is located: `django/db/migrations/executor.py`.\n- The method or code block that might be causing the issue involves checking if a column is already present in a database by doing a case-sensitive comparison. The specific code snippet mentioned is:\n  ```python\n  column_names = [\n      column.name for column in\n      self.connection.introspection.get_table_description(self.connection.cursor(), table)\n  ]\n  if field.column not in column_names:\n      return False, project_state\n  ```\n- The Django model operation causing the error during migration: `migrations.AddField`.\n- The error encountered: `OperationalError: (1050, \"Table 'city' already exists\")`.\n\nGiven this information, here are the API calls we should make to gather more context:\n\n1. ```python\nsearch_code_in_file(\"column_names = [\", \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\")\n```\n2. ```python\nsearch_code_in_file(\"if field.column not in column_names:\", \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\")\n```\n3. ```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"get_table_description\", \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\")\n```\n4. ```python\nsearch_class_in_file(\"MigrationExecutor\", \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\")\n```\n\nThese API calls are designed to fetch the context around the code snippet that performs a case-sensitive check, understand the method `get_table_description` used within that snippet (to see how column names are retrieved), and gather details about the `MigrationExecutor` class where this logic might reside. This information will be crucial for crafting a patch that addresses case-insensitivity during migration detection."
