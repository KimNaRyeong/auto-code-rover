Django 2.2 autoreloader is failing intermittently (not using watchman)
Description
	
Since upgrading to Django 2.2 the autoreloader is working differently and is not always picking up changes to .py files to reload runserver. It seems to work consistently once on a file, but multiple changes to the same file will not necessarily trigger a reload. It's definitely a change in the behavior to previous versions of Django (up to 2.1.7)
I'm not using watchman.
I'm running runserver in a python 3.7 slim docker container like ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001
As a workaround I have tried to add an edit a different .py -- that doesn't seem to help consistently. I've also noticed that the problem seems to sometimes go away by itself -- perhaps there is some change to the timing of the autoreloader which is not clear? For example and ignore interval of a certain duration.
