        "content": "<issue>Feature/docs: how should url converters decline to match for a named route?\nDescription\nIt is sometimes convenient to have multiple instances of a named route, where the correct one is chosen based on whether the URL converters to_url call succeeds. For example, the attached file has routes like this:\npath('export/foo/<foo:obj>', index, name='export'),\npath('export/bar/<bar:obj>', index, name='export'),\nI then wanted to put {% url \"export\" some_foo_or_bar %} in a generic export template and have the correct URL inserted.\nMy first attempt to do this was to raise ValueError in to_url for non-matching values, hoping that it would work the same as to_python where the docs specify that \"A ValueError is interpreted as no match.\"\nThat didn't work -- nothing catches the ValueError in to_url -- so I found the workaround demonstrated in the attachment: if to_url returns an empty string (or some string that doesn't match the converter's regex), then the later regex check in _reverse_with_prefix will detect the non-match and everything seems to work out.\nSo this is either a feature request or a documentation check. I'm thinking either:\n_reverse_with_prefix could be updated so to_url works the same as to_python, and a ValueError indicates no match (which I think just means wrapping try: ... except ValueError: continue around the appropriate line), or\nthe docs could be updated to indicate that, in to_url, a converter should return a non-regex-matching string such as the empty string in order to decline a match.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, we need to understand how URL conversion works within the project, specifically focusing on the `to_url` method and how it's intended to behave according to the issue description. Since there's a mention of a failure in matching and a workaround involving return values from `to_url`, we'll also need to look into the handling mechanism for URL converters, which may involve specific classes or methods responsible for URL resolution and reverse matching.\n\nGiven the details of the issue, here are the API calls I would invoke:\n\n1. `search_method(\"to_url\")`: This call will help us find where the `to_url` method is defined or overridden, which is crucial for understanding how URL converters are expected to work and how they currently handle conversion failures.\n\n2. `search_code(\"_reverse_with_prefix\")`: Since the issue mentions `_reverse_with_prefix` as a potential place for improvement or at least as part of the current workaround, finding its implementation will give insight into how URL resolution is handled and how it might be adjusted to catch `ValueError` as a signal for no match.\n\n3. `search_method(\"path\")`: Given that the issue demonstrates the use of the `path` function for routing with custom converters (as seen in the lines with `path('export/foo/<foo:obj>', index, name='export')`), understanding its definition and how it interacts with URL converters will be necessary to grasp the full context of where and how the described problem occurs.\n\nThese calls are aimed at identifying key components and behavior related to the issue stated, such as how URL conversion is theoretically supposed to fail gracefully and what mechanisms are involved in selecting the appropriate named route based on URL arguments."
