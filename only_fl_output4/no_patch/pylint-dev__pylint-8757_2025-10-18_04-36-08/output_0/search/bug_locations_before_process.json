The specific mechanism for splitting tasks, initializing subprocesses with correct configurations, and aggregating results needs to ensure that no checks are skipped or duplicated across processes. It might require enhancing the way tasks are partitioned and results collected to ensure consistency."

        "intended_behavior": "When parsing the `--jobs` argument, this file should set up the linting process in a manner that ensures a consistent set of lint checks is applied across all specified files, independent of the number of parallel jobs. If the handling of `--jobs` directly affects which checks are run or how results are reported, this behavior needs adjustment to maintain the integrity of lint results. It might involve better integration with `parallel.py` to ensure that the parallel execution path mimics the serial path as closely as possible in terms of checks run and results reported."
