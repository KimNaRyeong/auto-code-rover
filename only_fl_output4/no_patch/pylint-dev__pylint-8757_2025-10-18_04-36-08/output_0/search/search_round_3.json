This suggests that either these files have been moved, deleted, or perhaps there\u2019s a typo in the file paths mentioned in the issue.\n   - To proceed, consider alternate approaches to understanding how `from __future__ import absolute_import` is generally handled across the project or to find if similar problems exist in other files. However, given the context of the task, the issue seems more closely related to how pylint handles parallel processing rather than the presence or absence of specific imports.\n\n2. **Occurrences of `pylintrc`**:\n   - The `pylintrc` configuration file is mentioned across multiple files in the pylint codebase, suggesting it\u2019s a central part of how pylint is configured and runs its linting processes.\n   - Specific attention should be given to files such as `pylint/lint/run.py` and `pylint/lint/pylinter.py` as they likely contain logic related to parsing the configuration file (`pylintrc`) and applying those configurations during pylint runs. This is directly related to the bug since the issue mentions a discrepancy in outputs when running with different `--jobs` settings, which could be influenced by configurations defined in `pylintrc`.\n   - The `pylint/config/find_default_config_files.py` file seems promising for understanding how pylint discovers and interprets `pylintrc` files, which could affect how parallel processes are managed and how linting decisions are made.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, to further understand the issue, my next steps would involve:\n\n1. **Exploring Pylint\u2019s Parallel Processing**:\n   - Since the bug deals with differences in output with different `--jobs` settings, understanding how pylint handles parallel processing could reveal potential areas where the configuration or linting behavior diverges based on the number of jobs.\n   - Investigate how the pylint processes and queues files for linting in parallel mode, which might involve searches around implementation details of the `--jobs` flag.\n\n2. **Configuration Handling**:\n   - Given that `pylintrc` appears in significant sections of the codebase related to configuration, a deeper dive into how configurations influence pylint\u2019s parallel execution could be crucial. Files like `pylint/lint/run.py` and `pylint/config/find_default_config_files.py` should provide insights into how configurations are applied, especially in parallel runs.\n\nFor the next steps in analysis, the following API calls could be important:\n\n- `search_code(\"parallel processing\")` to understand how pylint handles parallel execution.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"--jobs\", \"pylint/lint/run.py\")` to see if there are specific implementations or conditional logic based on the `--jobs` parameter.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"find_default_config_files\", \"pylint/config/find_default_config_files.py\")` to understand how `pylintrc` files are discovered and loaded, which could affect parallel linting behavior."

This indicates that either the term used doesn't exactly match the terminology within the pylint project, or the implementation of parallel processing could be abstracted in a way that doesn't explicitly use this phrase.\n   - A potential direction could be to look for related terms like \"concurrency\", \"multiprocessing\", or directly dive into parts of the code that manage linting tasks to see how they handle multiple jobs without specifying the term \"parallel processing\".\n\n2. **--jobs in `pylint/lint/run.py`**:\n   - Not finding \"--jobs\" in `pylint/lint/run.py` suggests that either the management of the `--jobs` parameter is handled elsewhere in the codebase or that the file path or manner of investigation may need to be adjusted. It's possible that `--jobs` parameter parsing and handling are abstracted in different parts of the project, perhaps in a command-line parsing module or function that wasn't directly checked.\n   - To further understand this, it may be beneficial to examine how pylint parses its command-line arguments more broadly, potentially by looking at how the argument parser is set up and where it connects with the linting process.\n\n3. **find_default_config_files in `pylint/config/find_default_config_files.py`**:\n   - This function appears to be responsible for locating possible configuration files for pylint to use when running. The snippet shows that it yields paths to where configuration files might be located, which indicates that pylint can dynamically determine its configuration based on environment, user directory, or project-specific settings.\n   - While this function's purpose is to find config files, it doesn't directly relate to the bug unless the way configurations are loaded differently in parallel versus single-job modes impacts the output. Given that our search didn't reveal direct hits on parallel processing or how `--jobs` is handled, the link to the issue might be tangential. The intended behavior here would likely remain as is, preserving the dynamic discovery of configuration files.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems the information we've gathered doesn't directly answer the question about why pylint produces different outputs for different `--jobs` settings. Without clear insights into how pylint implements or manages parallel linting tasks, it's challenging to pinpoint the bug location or propose intended behavior modifications.\n\nIn the absence of direct leads from these queries, further investigation would be necessary, possibly by:\n- Looking closer at how pylint queues linting tasks for execution.\n- Examining the overall architecture of pylint to understand where the parallel execution paths diverge from single-threaded execution. \n\nBased on the current context, a deeper dive into the internal workings of pylint related to task management and argument parsing would be essential to properly address the issue."

These files are likely where the handling of parallel linting processes is implemented.\n\n#### **pylint/lint/parallel.py**\n- **What it does**: This file likely contains the core logic for distributing linting tasks across multiple processes. The use of `multiprocessing` here suggests that this file manages the creation and synchronization of parallel jobs, splitting the linting workload to speed up the execution.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: Given the issue with varying outputs depending on the `--jobs` parameter, `parallel.py` could be where the discrepancy originates. There might be a problem with how tasks are split, how results are collected, or how the individual linting processes are initialized.\n- **Intended behavior**: To resolve the issue, the code in this file should ensure consistent linting results regardless of the number of processes used. This could involve making sure that the configuration (loaded from `pylintrc`) is correctly applied to each process and that the aggregation of results from each job is handled correctly.\n\n#### **pylint/lint/run.py**\n- **What it does**: Contains the code that's executed when the pylint command-line interface is run, likely parsing arguments (including `--jobs`) and kicking off the linting process, potentially in parallel based on those arguments.\n- **Relationship to the bug**: This file likely interprets the `--jobs` parameter and initializes the parallel linting process. An issue here could mean incorrect handling of the parameter or its effect on the linting process setup.\n- **Intended behavior**: It should correctly parse the `--jobs` parameter and initiate the linting process in a way that ensures consistent output across different job counts. This might involve proper distribution of configuration across processes or ensuring that all checks are performed regardless of parallelism.\n\n### Conclusions and Further Action\n\nBased on the search results for `multiprocessing`, further investigation into `pylint/lint/parallel.py` and `pylint/lint/run.py` is warranted. Specifically, examining how these files handle parallel execution and how configuration is applied in parallel contexts could provide insights into the root cause of the reported issue.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nGiven this analysis, more specific examination of these files is necessary. Making focused API calls such as:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"multiprocessing\", \"pylint/lint/parallel.py\")`\n- `search_code_in_file(\"--jobs\", \"pylint/lint/run.py\")`\n\ncould yield the code snippets directly responsible for the behavior in question. From there, one could isolate the logic related to job distribution, process initialization, and result aggregation in parallel executions to identify and rectify the discrepancy in linting outputs observed with different `--jobs` values."

The specific mechanism for splitting tasks, initializing subprocesses with correct configurations, and aggregating results needs to ensure that no checks are skipped or duplicated across processes. It might require enhancing the way tasks are partitioned and results collected to ensure consistency.\n\n- **Location 2:**\n  - **File**: `pylint/lint/run.py`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: When parsing the `--jobs` argument, this file should set up the linting process in a manner that ensures a consistent set of lint checks is applied across all specified files, independent of the number of parallel jobs. If the handling of `--jobs` directly affects which checks are run or how results are reported, this behavior needs adjustment to maintain the integrity of lint results. It might involve better integration with `parallel.py` to ensure that the parallel execution path mimics the serial path as closely as possible in terms of checks run and results reported.\n\nThese locations are identified based on the understanding that the issue lies in how pylint handles parallel execution, specifically with respect to task distribution, process initialization, configuration application in parallel contexts, and results aggregation. The modifications in these areas should aim to fix the inconsistency observed when running pylint with different `--jobs` settings, ensuring that the output is consistent and accurate, reflecting all the required lint checks regardless of the number of processes used."
