The discrepancies in output when running pylint with different `--jobs` parameters suggest that the parallel execution might be affecting how pylint processes and outputs warnings and errors.\n\nFrom the issue description, we're dealing with different modules and different warnings/errors being reported depending on the number of jobs. Key areas of interest would be:\n- How pylint parallelizes tasks\n- How the pylint configuration (`pylintrc`) might affect parallel runs\n- The specific warnings about missing `from __future__ import absolute_import` and the use of print statements, which could be tied to the specifics of the code base\n- Differences in execution paths or configurations when running with one versus multiple jobs\n\nGiven this, here are the initial API calls I will make to gather more context:\n\n1. Search for occurrences of `from __future__ import absolute_import` in the files that were specifically mentioned to be missing these imports. This should help understand if the issue is widespread or isolated.\n2. Get the configuration from `pylintrc` to see if there are any settings that could affect the jobs/parallel execution behavior differently.\n3. Search for configuration or implementation details around parallel execution within pylint's codebase, especially anything related to handling file or module processing differently based on the `--jobs` parameter.\n\nHere are the specific API calls:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"from __future__ import absolute_import\", \"app/codein/callback.py\")`\n- `search_code_in_file(\"from __future__ import absolute_import\", \"app/codein/types.py\")`\n- `search_code(\"pylintrc\")` \n\nNext steps would likely involve diving deeper into both the pylint and project code bases based on what these initial searches reveal."

This suggests that either these files have been moved, deleted, or perhaps there\u2019s a typo in the file paths mentioned in the issue.\n   - To proceed, consider alternate approaches to understanding how `from __future__ import absolute_import` is generally handled across the project or to find if similar problems exist in other files. However, given the context of the task, the issue seems more closely related to how pylint handles parallel processing rather than the presence or absence of specific imports.\n\n2. **Occurrences of `pylintrc`**:\n   - The `pylintrc` configuration file is mentioned across multiple files in the pylint codebase, suggesting it\u2019s a central part of how pylint is configured and runs its linting processes.\n   - Specific attention should be given to files such as `pylint/lint/run.py` and `pylint/lint/pylinter.py` as they likely contain logic related to parsing the configuration file (`pylintrc`) and applying those configurations during pylint runs. This is directly related to the bug since the issue mentions a discrepancy in outputs when running with different `--jobs` settings, which could be influenced by configurations defined in `pylintrc`.\n   - The `pylint/config/find_default_config_files.py` file seems promising for understanding how pylint discovers and interprets `pylintrc` files, which could affect how parallel processes are managed and how linting decisions are made.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, to further understand the issue, my next steps would involve:\n\n1. **Exploring Pylint\u2019s Parallel Processing**:\n   - Since the bug deals with differences in output with different `--jobs` settings, understanding how pylint handles parallel processing could reveal potential areas where the configuration or linting behavior diverges based on the number of jobs.\n   - Investigate how the pylint processes and queues files for linting in parallel mode, which might involve searches around implementation details of the `--jobs` flag.\n\n2. **Configuration Handling**:\n   - Given that `pylintrc` appears in significant sections of the codebase related to configuration, a deeper dive into how configurations influence pylint\u2019s parallel execution could be crucial. Files like `pylint/lint/run.py` and `pylint/config/find_default_config_files.py` should provide insights into how configurations are applied, especially in parallel runs.\n\nFor the next steps in analysis, the following API calls could be important:\n\n- `search_code(\"parallel processing\")` to understand how pylint handles parallel execution.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"--jobs\", \"pylint/lint/run.py\")` to see if there are specific implementations or conditional logic based on the `--jobs` parameter.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"find_default_config_files\", \"pylint/config/find_default_config_files.py\")` to understand how `pylintrc` files are discovered and loaded, which could affect parallel linting behavior."
