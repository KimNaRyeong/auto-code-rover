        "content": "To start analyzing this issue, I'll need to gather context in several steps based on the information provided in the issue. The discrepancies in output when running pylint with different `--jobs` parameters suggest that the parallel execution might be affecting how pylint processes and outputs warnings and errors.\n\nFrom the issue description, we're dealing with different modules and different warnings/errors being reported depending on the number of jobs. Key areas of interest would be:\n- How pylint parallelizes tasks\n- How the pylint configuration (`pylintrc`) might affect parallel runs\n- The specific warnings about missing `from __future__ import absolute_import` and the use of print statements, which could be tied to the specifics of the code base\n- Differences in execution paths or configurations when running with one versus multiple jobs\n\nGiven this, here are the initial API calls I will make to gather more context:\n\n1. Search for occurrences of `from __future__ import absolute_import` in the files that were specifically mentioned to be missing these imports. This should help understand if the issue is widespread or isolated.\n2. Get the configuration from `pylintrc` to see if there are any settings that could affect the jobs/parallel execution behavior differently.\n3. Search for configuration or implementation details around parallel execution within pylint's codebase, especially anything related to handling file or module processing differently based on the `--jobs` parameter.\n\nHere are the specific API calls:\n\n- `search_code_in_file(\"from __future__ import absolute_import\", \"app/codein/callback.py\")`\n- `search_code_in_file(\"from __future__ import absolute_import\", \"app/codein/types.py\")`\n- `search_code(\"pylintrc\")` \n\nNext steps would likely involve diving deeper into both the pylint and project code bases based on what these initial searches reveal."
