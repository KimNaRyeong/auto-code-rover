Based on your request, here is a revised standalone Python script named `reproducer.py` designed to reproduce the issue described. This script will purposely attempt operations that are expected to fail due to the problem with multioutput ensemble models having non-numeric dependent variables (DVs). The specialized function `print_stacktrace` will be utilized for detailed error reporting.

```python
# reproducer.py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_multioutput_string():
    X_train = [[-2, -1], [-1, -1], [-1, -2], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1], [-2, 1],
               [-1, 1], [-1, 2], [2, -1], [1, -1], [1, -2]]
    y_train = [["red", "blue"], ["red", "blue"], ["red", "blue"], ["green", "green"],
               ["green", "green"], ["green", "green"], ["red", "purple"],
               ["red", "purple"], ["red", "purple"], ["green", "yellow"],
               ["green", "yellow"], ["green", "yellow"]]
    X_test = [[-1, -1], [1, 1], [-1, 1], [1, -1]]

    try:
        est = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=0, bootstrap=False)
        est.fit(X_train, y_train)  # This should raise an exception
        y_pred = est.predict(X_test)
        print("No exception was raised. This might indicate the issue has been fixed.")
        print("Predicted:", y_pred)
        exit(0)  # Exit code 0 to indicate no exception (potential fix)
    except ValueError as e:
        if str(e) == "could not convert string to float:":
            # This is the expected specific error, so the issue is present.
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)
        else:
            # Some other ValueError which is not part of this issue.
            print("A different ValueError occurred, not related to the specific issue:")
            print_stacktrace(e)
            exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An unexpected exception occurred:")
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_multioutput_string()
```

Note: Ensure that you have the latest version of scikit-learn installed in your environment as this script assumes such. This script checks if the operation that's expected to fail due to the aforementioned issue indeed fails. If the operation does not raise the specific `ValueError`, it might indicate that the issue has been resolved in the version of scikit-learn you are using.
