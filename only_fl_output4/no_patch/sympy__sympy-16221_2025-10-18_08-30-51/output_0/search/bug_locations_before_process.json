        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue of adding support for printing matrices and arrays in Mathematica format, a new method or an expansion of existing methods within the Printer class will be necessary. Specifically, a method capable of identifying Mathematica matrices and arrays within the expr argument and formatting them according to Mathematica's syntax for matrices and arrays, ensuring correct printing. This enhancement should preserve existing functionalities of the Printer class."
