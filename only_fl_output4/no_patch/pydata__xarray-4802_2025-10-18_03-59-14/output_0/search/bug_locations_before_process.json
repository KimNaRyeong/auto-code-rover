        "intended_behavior": "This method currently assumes that `scale_factor` and `add_offset`, if present, can be directly accessed using `.item()`, which only works if these attributes are numpy arrays or scalars. However, datasets may contain these attributes as lists (particularly length-1 lists), leading to an `AttributeError`. To resolve the issue, the method should be updated to first check the type of `scale_factor` and `add_offset`. If these attributes are lists, the method should handle converting them to an appropriate format (e.g., extracting the single list element) before applying transformations. This ensures that `scale_factor` and `add_offset` can be handled correctly regardless of whether they are scalars, numpy arrays, or lists, preserving the existing functionality while extending it to accommodate lists.\n\nThis update will ensure compatibility with datasets that encode `scale_factor` and `add_offset` as lists, addressing the user-reported issue without disrupting current functionalities for other data types."
