Specifically, if swapping the order of the 'for' loops\u2014cleaning 'garbage-*' directories before the others\u2014prevents the 'PermissionError', this change should be tested thoroughly to ensure it does not introduce other issues. Additionally, the method could implement a more robust checking mechanism to verify whether a directory is still under deletion by the OS to avoid the race condition that raises the permission error. This adjustment should preserve the method's primary functionality: cleaning up older directories while ensuring no undue interference with file system operations."

        "intended_behavior": "Enhance error handling or checking mechanisms within 'try_cleanup' to more gracefully handle scenarios where a directory or file is temporarily locked or in the process of being deleted by the operating system. This could involve retry logic with a short delay when a 'PermissionError' is encountered, assuming the error is transient and related to timing. The existing functionality\u2014to clean up a directory if it's deemed deletable\u2014should remain intact, but with added resilience against transient permission errors."
