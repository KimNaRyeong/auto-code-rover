Specifically, if swapping the order of the 'for' loops\u2014cleaning 'garbage-*' directories before the others\u2014prevents the 'PermissionError', this change should be tested thoroughly to ensure it does not introduce other issues. Additionally, the method could implement a more robust checking mechanism to verify whether a directory is still under deletion by the OS to avoid the race condition that raises the permission error. This adjustment should preserve the method's primary functionality: cleaning up older directories while ensuring no undue interference with file system operations."
