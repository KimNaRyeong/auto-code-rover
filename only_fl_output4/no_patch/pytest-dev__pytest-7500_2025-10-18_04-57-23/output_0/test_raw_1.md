Creating a standalone Python file `reproducer.py` to simulate the outlined `PermissionError` during pytest's cleanup of temporary directories requires a setup that aggressively creates and deletes temporary directories in a way that mirrors the problematic scenario. To enhance the likelihood of encountering the issue, the script should specifically aim to mimic conditions under which the `PermissionError` was initially reported, including creating multiple temp directories in a constrained environment, simulating system load, and doing so within a Windows environment as specified.

However, it's essential to remind that replicating such an issue might need several iterations or specific system conditions (like stress or load) to manifest reliably. The following attempt is an educated approximation intended to closely follow the description provided:

```python
import os
import sys
import tempfile
import threading
import time

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def create_temp_dirs(base_dir, count=100):
    for _ in range(count):
        temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp(dir=base_dir)
        os.rmdir(temp_dir)  # Comment this line to simulate workload and potential locking issues.

def simulate_cleanup_issue():
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as base_dir:
        # Create a significant number of temporary directories to simulate pytest's temp dir cleanup behavior.
        threads = []
        for _ in range(10):  # Adjust the number of threads to increase system load.
            thread = threading.Thread(target=create_temp_dirs, args=(base_dir, 100))
            threads.append(thread)
            thread.start()
        
        for thread in threads:
            thread.join()

        # At this point, the creation and deletion of temp dirs simulate a load similar to the pytest scenario.
        try:
            create_temp_dirs(base_dir, 10)  # Create more dirs to potentially trigger the permission error on cleanup.
        except PermissionError as e:
            print_stacktrace(e)
            raise AssertionError("Caught PermissionError during cleanup simulation.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        simulate_cleanup_issue()
    except AssertionError:
        print("Issue reproduced.")
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("No PermissionError detected; cleanup simulation might not mimic the exact condition or issue is resolved.")
        sys.exit(0)
```

Please note:

- This script attempts to recreate a similar environment where temporary directories are created and removed aggressively in a multiprocessing/multithreading context, potentially leading to permission errors during cleanup.
- Altering the number of directories created or the concurrency level (number of threads) may be necessary to replicate the conditions on different systems accurately.
- The cleanup issue might not manifest every run, reflecting real-world scenarios where the problem occurs under specific conditions, such as high system load or particular timing.
- Even if this script does not exactly reproduce the issue on every system or setup due to the complex nature of concurrent filesystem operations and permissions management on Windows, it's designed to closely approximate the conditions leading to the observed `PermissionError`.
