To create a standalone Python script `reproducer.py` aiming to reproduce the `PermissionError` when pytest attempts to clean up temporary directories, and according to the provided scenario, we'll script a pytest invocation that triggers the cleaning process. It's appropriate to mention that to reliably reproduce an issue dealing with file-system timing and potential race conditions under load, a single execution might not always trigger the issue. This script will run a simplified pytest setup that aims to increase the likelihood of encountering the `PermissionError` during temporary directory cleanup.

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def trigger_pytest_with_cleanup_issue():
    test_script_content = """
import pytest

def test_temp(tmp_path_factory):
    for _ in range(1000):
        tmp_path_factory.mktemp("temp")
    """

    with open("test_temp.py", "w") as test_script_file:
        test_script_file.write(test_script_content)

    try:
        result = subprocess.run(["pytest", "test_temp.py"], capture_output=True, text=True)
        assert "PermissionError" not in result.stderr, "PermissionError encountered during cleanup"
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Failed to confirm the absence of PermissionError.") from e

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        trigger_pytest_with_cleanup_issue()
    except AssertionError as ae:
        sys.exit(1)
    print("Issue not detected; cleanup was successful.")
    sys.exit(0)
```

This script performs the following actions:
1. Writes a simple test script that creates a thousand temporary directories to trigger the cleanup logic.
2. Runs pytest against this test script. We capture the output to check for the occurrence of `PermissionError`.
3. If the `PermissionError` is found in the pytest's stderr output, an assertion is raised.
4. The `print_stacktrace` function is used to print the exception's traceback if the script catches an error during its assertion checks or execution.
5. The script exits with code `0` if no issue is detected, indicating the potential fix; otherwise, if the assertion catches the cleanup related `PermissionError`, it exits with code `1`.

Please remember that executing this reproducer may have varying results due to its dependency on the system's current state, file system timing, and the nature of the issue being somewhat intermittent under specific conditions such as system load. You might have to run the script multiple times or adjust the script (e.g., the number of temporary directories created) to consistently reproduce the issue on different setups.
