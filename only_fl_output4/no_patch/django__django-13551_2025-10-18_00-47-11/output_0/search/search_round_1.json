        "content": "The collected context provides significant insight into the parts of the codebase that are relevant to the issue of password reset token validation upon changing the user's email. Let\u2019s analyze the context and connect it to the issue.\n\n### 1. PasswordResetTokenGenerator Class\n\n- **What it does**: This class is responsible for generating and checking tokens that are used in the password reset process. The `_make_hash_value` method constructs a value that ensures the token is invalidated under certain conditions, namely if the user's password or `last_login` changes.\n  \n- **Relationship to the bug**: The current implementation in `_make_hash_value` constructs the hash value using the user's primary key, password, and `last_login`. Since the user's email is not included in this hash calculation, changing the email does not invalidate the reset token as it ideally should.\n  \n- **Intended behavior**: To address the issue, `_make_hash_value` should also factor in the user's email. This would mean that any change to the user's email would change the hash value, effectively invalidating any previously generated tokens.\n\n### 2. AbstractBaseUser Class\n\n- **What it does**: This class serves as a base for creating user models, providing essential fields and methods, including handling passwords and authentication.\n  \n- **Relationship to the bug**: Given that `AbstractBaseUser` provides the framework for user authentication, including the method `get_session_auth_hash`, it's crucial in ensuring that the token generation is aligned with the user's authentication state.\n   \n- **Intended behavior**: The issue highlights a potential enhancement where methods akin to `get_session_auth_hash` could be considered for ensuring that password reset tokens are invalidated when significant user attributes, like email, are altered. However, since not all user models require an email (based on `AbstractBaseUser`), the solution must account for such flexibility.\n\n### 3. `get_session_auth_hash` Method\n\n- **What it does**: This method returns a hashed value of the user's password which is used for session authentication. The hashing includes a key salt and the password itself.\n  \n- **Relationship to the bug**: Although the current use of `get_session_auth_hash` is specifically for session authentication, the concept behind it \u2014 using hashed values to validate user sessions or actions \u2014 is relevant. This method exemplifies how a critical piece of user data (in this case, the password) can be used to generate an auth-related hash.\n  \n- **Intended behavior**: Drawing inspiration from how `get_session_auth_hash` is used, a similar approach can be taken to ensure `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` includes the user's email in its hash value calculation. This would make the reset token sensitive to changes in the user's email address, adding an extra layer of security by invalidating tokens when such changes occur.\n\n### Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nTo patch the issue, the fix should involve modifying the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator._make_hash_value` method to add the user's email as part of the hash value. This approach aligns with the intended behavior of invalidating the token when significant user details change (specifically the email in this context).\n\nA concrete next step would involve coding the patch to include the user's email in `_make_hash_value`'s return statement, potentially similar to how user.pk, user.password, and login_timestamp are currently used. This change should be carefully tested to ensure it meets Django's security and functionality standards, considering both users with and without email addresses as per the flexible design of `AbstractBaseUser`."

This adjustment ensures that any password reset tokens generated are immediately invalidated if the user's email is changed after the token is created but before it's used. The new behavior should still factor in the user's primary key, password, last_login, and now the email, to maintain or enhance security without disrupting the original token generation and validation logic. Specifically, the code inside this method that constructs the hash value should concatenate the user's email address with the other attributes (`user.pk`, `user.password`, `login_timestamp`) to form the string used for hashing. This approach preserves the method's purpose of invalidating tokens when significant user attributes change, thus addressing the issue without impacting users who may not have an email associated with their account."
