        "content": "To address the issue described, I need to gather context on several points mentioned in the issue description:\n\n1. **`PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class**: This is likely where the `_make_hash_value()` method should be modified. I need to find where this class is defined and how the method currently generates values.\n\n2. **`AbstractBaseUser` class**: Since the issue mentions that not all users might have an email, verifying where and how this class handles email attributes is important. Additionally, finding if there's a method like `get_session_auth_hash()` that could influence or be influenced by changes to `_make_hash_value()` is necessary.\n\nGiven these requirements, here are the search API calls I would use to start collecting information:\n\n- `search_class(\"PasswordResetTokenGenerator\")`: To locate the definition and files related to this class.\n- `search_method_in_class(\"_make_hash_value\", \"PasswordResetTokenGenerator\")`: To get the specific implementation of the mentioned method.\n- `search_class(\"AbstractBaseUser\")`: To understand how the user model is defined, especially around handling of email attributes.\n- `search_method(\"get_session_auth_hash\")`: This will help find if `get_session_auth_hash` is defined within `AbstractBaseUser` or elsewhere, and how it is used.\n- `search_code(\"email\")`: Since the email attribute plays a central role in this issue, understanding how it's used across the project might provide additional insights."
