This way, when a `SingularityFunction` is raised to a power and printed in LaTeX, it is displayed correctly without causing an error. A practical approach could be to include conditional handling for the `exp` argument within `_print_SingularityFunction`, allowing it to render the power expression correctly in LaTeX."

        "intended_behavior": "The `_print_Pow` method may require adjustment to ensure that if it's going to pass the `exp` argument to other print methods such as `_print_SingularityFunction`, those methods are capable of handling this argument. An alternative fix could be implementing a more selective argument passing strategy that avoids sending unsupported kwargs to print methods not designed to receive them. The method must ensure compatibility and prevent the passing of unexpected kwargs to methods not equipped to handle them, thus preserving the functionality of rendering power expressions in LaTeX format accurately."
