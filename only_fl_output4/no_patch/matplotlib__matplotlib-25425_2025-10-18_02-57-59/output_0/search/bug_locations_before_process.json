        "intended_behavior": "Implement a new method named `get_shape` that aligns with numpy's convention by returning the dimensions of the image data in the form `(nrows, ncols)`, and potentially depth if applicable (i.e., whether the data is colormapped, RGB, or RGBA). This method would complement or serve as an alias to the existing `get_size` method, depending on the decision to purely alias or to include more detailed information like depth. The precise implementation would depend on how image data dimensions are stored within the `AxesImage` object, likely requiring access to `_A.shape` or a similar attribute that holds the image data."

        "method": "__str__",
        "intended_behavior": "Modify the `__str__` method to utilize the new `get_shape` method (or directly include depth information if opted against a separate `get_shape` method). The string representation of `AxesImage` should then reflect this by preferably formatting as `AxesImage(shape=(nrows, ncols[, depth]))`, where `depth` is included if applicable. This change will make the representation more consistent with numpy's conventions and enhance clarity regarding the image's dimensions and color information."
