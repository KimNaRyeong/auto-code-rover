Given the previous misunderstanding, let's tackle it anew. Bearing in mind the specific requirements to both trigger an `AssertionError` if the issue is detected (i.e., the `__repr__` strings of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` do not match the expected outputs) and correctly use the stack trace printing function provided. I'll rewrite the `reproducer.py` accordingly.

```python
def check_repr_issues():
    from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedKFold, RepeatedStratifiedKFold

    # Create instances of RepeatedKFold and RepeatedStratifiedKFold
    rkf = RepeatedKFold()
    rskf = RepeatedStratifiedKFold()

    # Obtain the repr strings for these instances
    rkf_repr = repr(rkf)
    rskf_repr = repr(rskf)

    # Define the expected repr strings based on how they should ideally appear
    expected_rkf_repr = "RepeatedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)"
    expected_rskf_repr = "RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)"

    # Asserting that the actual repr matches the expected
    assert rkf_repr == expected_rkf_repr, "Incorrect __repr__ for RepeatedKFold"
    assert rskf_repr == expected_rskf_repr, "Incorrect __repr__ for RepeatedStratifiedKFold"

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        check_repr_issues()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)  # Exits with a non-zero exit code to indicate failure
    else:
        print("No issues detected.")
        exit(0)  # Exits with a zero exit code to indicate success
```

This version of `reproducer.py` will perform the checks correctly:

- If the issue is present, and the `__repr__` methods of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` do not return the strings as expected, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints the detailed stack trace using the `print_stacktrace` function.
- If the issue is not present, meaning the `__repr__` methods behave as intended, it prints "No issues detected." and exits with code 0, indicating success.
