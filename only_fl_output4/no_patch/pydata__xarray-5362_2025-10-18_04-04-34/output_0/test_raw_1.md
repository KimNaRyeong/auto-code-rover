This revised script will reproduce the issue described, attempting to perform a weighted operation using xarray with a non-existent dimension. If the library behavior is correct (i.e., it properly raises a KeyError when attempting to perform operations on non-existent dimensions), the script will catch this specific exception, print a confirmation message, and exit with code 0 indicating success. For any other unanticipated errors, it prints a detailed stack trace provided by the `print_stacktrace` function and exits with code 1, indicating an unexpected issue.
