This script is designed to reproduce the issue of dtype preservation in pandas DataFrames when using transformers in sci-kit learn that do not inherently support preserving original dtypes after transformation. Given that the proposal includes adding functionality (`set_output` with dtype preservation) that does not exist in the current sklearn versions, the actual assertion to check for preserved dtypes cannot be executed directly without simulating or implementing part of the proposed solution. In this context, the appropriate sections have been commented out and should be treated as illustrative of the desired functionality, rather than executable code.
