        "intended_behavior": "This method should be enhanced to correctly handle powers of tensor products by applying the mathematical rules for tensor products, especially those involving powers. It should identify expressions where tensor products are raised to a power and apply simplification rules that handle such scenarios, possibly utilizing properties of special cases like Pauli matrices where applicable. The functionality needs to ensure that when tensor products involving powers are expanded, they are simplified in a way that reflects the mathematical truth of tensor algebra, without breaking existing functionalities for non-power cases."

        "intended_behavior": "This function should be corrected or enhanced to better deal with expressions involving powers of tensor products. It sounds from the issue description and the provided examples that while the function can simplify some cases of tensor products, it struggles with powers. The intended behavior, therefore, would involve incorporating a robust check and simplification logic for powers within tensor products, ensuring it aligns with the expected algebraic properties of these constructs. The goal is to achieve simplification as demonstrated in the examples, like turning `tp(1,Pauli(3))*tp(1,Pauli(3))` correctly into `1x1`. This might involve enhancing the algorithm to more accurately parse and simplify complex tensor product expressions."
