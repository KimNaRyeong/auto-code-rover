        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need more context on how `unit.to_string(format)` and relevant decomposition methods are implemented within the Astropy project. Given the description, we're looking for the implementation of unit formatting in both `unicode` and `console` formats, and how decompose methods affect these representations. The following API calls are necessary to gather sufficient code context:\n\n1. **Search for the method that handles unit to string conversion**: Since the issue revolves around the `unit.to_string` functionality, we need to identify the method that implements this logic. This method could be part of a class dedicated to handling unit representations.\n\n   `search_method(\"to_string\")`\n\n2. **Look for the decomposition method**: The issue description also mentions the `.decompose()` method and its influence on unit formatting. Understanding its implementation can provide insights into why the space inconsistency occurs.\n\n   `search_method(\"decompose\")`\n\n3. **Investigate unit representation in unicode**: The issue specifically mentions problems with the `unicode` and `console` formats. Code related to these formats might reside in methods or functions related to formatting or printing units. Thus, we need to search for code snippets that directly relate to `unicode` representation.\n\n   `search_code(\":unicode\")`\n\n4. **Look into unit handling for console format**: Similar to the `unicode` format, we need to understand how the `console` formatting is handled in the codebase, especially in relation to spaces being added or omitted.\n\n   `search_code(\":console\")`\n\nThese API calls will help gather the necessary information to understand and address the formatting inconsistency mentioned in the issue."
