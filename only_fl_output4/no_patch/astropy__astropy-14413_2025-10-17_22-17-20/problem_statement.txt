Unicode and console unit representations sometimes include an extraneous space
### Description

As noted in #14407, for units typset in `unicode` or `console` format, a space is included in front, unlike for regular units, yet it is sometimes omitted if a unit scale factor is present.

### Expected behavior

`unit.to_string(format)` should never start with a space, independent of `format`.

### How to Reproduce

From https://github.com/astropy/astropy/pull/14407/files#r1108987447 and https://github.com/astropy/astropy/pull/14407/files#r1109066798:

```python
import astropy.units as u
print(f'{(u.m**-1):unicode}')
 1
 ─
 m
f"{(u.eV*u.s**2).decompose()}"             # space between scale and unit
'1.60218e-19 kg m2'
f"{(u.eV*u.s**2).decompose():unicode}"     # no space between scale and unit
'1.6021766×10⁻¹⁹m² kg'
f"{(1*u.eV*u.s**2).decompose()}"           # space between value and unit
'1.602176634e-19 kg m2'
f"{(1 * u.eV*u.s**2).decompose():unicode}" # space between value and unit
'1.602176634e-19 m² kg'
```
