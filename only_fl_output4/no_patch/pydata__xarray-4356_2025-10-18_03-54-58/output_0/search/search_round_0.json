        "content": "To obtain the required context for resolving the issue, we need to focus on a few key elements specified in the issue:\n1. The problem arises within the `sum` method when used with `min_count` and more than one dimension is specified.\n2. The proposed solution involves modifying a specific line in `nanops.py` from using `mask.shape[axis]` to `np.take(a.shape, axis).prod()`.\n\nGiven these points, the following API calls will help gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the file and the exact location of the `sum` method, as this is where the bug is noted to occur. The `sum` method could be part of classes or directly defined in a module. Since the issue does not specify which class (if any) the `sum` method belongs to, it's prudent to search across the entire codebase first.\n   \n2. Search for the specific code snippet in `nanops.py` as mentioned in the proposed solution to identify the context around the proposed change. This is critical for understanding how `min_count` is currently being handled and ensuring that the suggested fix aligns properly with existing logic.\n\n3. Given the reference to a specific line in `nanops.py`, obtaining the code around that line will further clarify the existing implementation and how it integrates with the broader functionality of the `sum` method.\n\nLet's execute these API calls to get the needed context:\n- `search_method(\"sum\")`\n- `search_code(\"mask.shape[axis]\")`\n- `get_code_around_line(\"xarray/core/nanops.py\", 35, 5)`"
