To create a standalone Python file `reproducer.py` that aims to reproduce the issue regarding `sum` with `min_count` in xarray and handle it as specified, follow the corrected structure below. This script specifically checks for the issue described – where the `sum` function raises an error when using `min_count` with more than one dimension – and prints the stack trace if the error occurs, following your requirements:

```python
# reproducer.py
import xarray as xr
import numpy as np
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproducer():
    # Attempt to use sum with min_count on a DataArray with more than one dimension
    da = xr.DataArray([[1., 2., 3.], [4., 5., 6.]], dims=['dim_0', 'dim_1'])
    try:
        result = da.sum(dim=["dim_0", "dim_1"], min_count=1)
        # Check if the sum operation returns an expected result without raising an exception
        assert not result.isnull(), "Result should not be NaN or Inf"
        print("Issue not present, exits with code 0")
        sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating the absence of the issue or that it's fixed
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 indicating the assertion failed but caught
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 indicating an unhandled exception occurred

if __name__ == "__main__":
    reproducer()
```

This script replicates the issue described in the task by attempting operation `da.sum(dim=["dim_0", "dim_1"], min_count=1)` on a DataArray and checks if an assertion error can be raised or if any exception occurs. The script checks for `AssertionError` to handle cases where the function might execute but returns an unexpected result (e.g., resulting in `NaN` values when it shouldn't). Make sure to have the correct environment setup with compatible versions of xarray and its dependencies to avoid unrelated errors.
