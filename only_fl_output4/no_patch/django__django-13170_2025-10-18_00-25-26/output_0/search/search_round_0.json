        "content": "To address the issue of supporting nested relations in `FilteredRelation`'s condition within the Django framework (given the context of the provided error), we should focus on gathering information about the `FilteredRelation` class, the `annotate()` method since the error occurs there, and look into how the condition parameter is processed. We'll also need to understand the current implementation of the `Q` object handling nested relations. Here are the needed API calls:\n\n1. `search_class(\"FilteredRelation\")`: This will help us find where the `FilteredRelation` class is defined, giving us insights into how it's currently implemented and how conditions are processed.\n\n2. `search_method(\"annotate\")`: Since the issue occurs when using the `annotate` method, getting context about where and how this method is implemented across the Django ORM will be crucial. This includes understanding how it interacts with objects like `FilteredRelation`.\n\n3. `search_class(\"Q\")`: Understanding how the `Q` class is implemented will shed light on how nested conditions are parsed and processed. This is integral to the issue since the error explicitly mentions the failure of `FilteredRelation` to process a `Q` object with nested relations.\n\n4. `search_code(\"condition=Q\")`: This specific search will help us find examples or implementations within the codebase where a `Q` object is passed as a condition to either a `FilteredRelation` or similar constructs. It can provide insights into how conditions are generally handled.\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive overview of the parts of the codebase that need to be addressed or understood to fix the nested relations issue in `FilteredRelation`'s condition."
