This all seems to be working fine, but when I have a custom property (`prop` below) that tries to access a non-existent attribute (`random_attr`) below, the error message is misleading because it says `prop` doesn't exist, where it should say `random_attr` doesn't exist.\n```python\nimport astropy.coordinates as coord\nclass custom_coord(coord.SkyCoord):\n@property\ndef prop(self):\nreturn self.random_attr\nc = custom_coord('00h42m30s', '+41d12m00s', frame='icrs')\nc.prop\n```\nraises\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"test.py\", line 11, in <module>\nc.prop\nFile \"/Users/dstansby/miniconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/astropy/coordinates/sky_coordinate.py\", line 600, in __getattr__\n.format(self.__class__.__name__, attr))\nAttributeError: 'custom_coord' object has no attribute 'prop'\n```\n</issue>"

Here is the list of API calls we can make to get this context:\n\n1. `search_class(\"SkyCoord\")` - To find the file(s) containing the `SkyCoord` class definition, which is being subclassed.\n2. `search_method(\"__getattr__\")` - To locate the implementation of the `__getattr__` method which is mentioned in the error traceback, indicating it's part of the attribute access mechanism.\n3. `search_code(\"class custom_coord(coord.SkyCoord):\")` - To see if there are more instances or references to the subclassing of `SkyCoord` that could give insights into common patterns or related issues within the codebase.\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how `SkyCoord` and its attribute access mechanism are defined and potentially suggest why the error message does not reflect the actual missing attribute."
