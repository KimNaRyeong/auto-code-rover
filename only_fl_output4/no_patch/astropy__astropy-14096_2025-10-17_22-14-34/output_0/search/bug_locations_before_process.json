        "intended_behavior": "The `__getattr__` method should be modified to provide a more accurate error message when an attempt is made to access a non-existent attribute. This adjustment would involve checking if the attribute being accessed is part of a custom property defined in a subclass. If the attribute lookup fails due to an attribute that is not part of the base class (`SkyCoord`) but possibly part of a subclass, the error message should clearly indicate the name of the nonexistent attribute (`random_attr`) instead of misleadingly pointing towards a different attribute or property (`prop`). This change must ensure that it does not interfere with the existing functionality for attribute access for `SkyCoord`, including its handling of defined attributes and methods, while improving clarity in error reporting for subclassed instances."
