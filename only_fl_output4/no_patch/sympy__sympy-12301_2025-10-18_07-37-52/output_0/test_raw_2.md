Given that the previous attempt did not reproduce the issue as expected and based on your original description, it seems we may need a more targeted approach or clarification to directly trigger and capture the specific failure within `test_issue_11230` from SymPy's test suite. However, it's important to note that reproducing an issue accurately often requires access to the exact environment and version in which the issue was observed, which in this case includes running the specified test from SymPy's test suite for version 1.0.1.dev0 with Python 3.5 in an isolated conda environment, as you've described.

Unfortunately, without being able to modify SymPy's internal test suite or invoking it directly in a way that would bypass the normal test harness (as `sympy.test()` aggregates and runs tests in a collected manner that may alter state or execution order), creating a standalone reproducer in the form of a Python script to exactly pinpoint this failure via direct import and execution of a single test function from the codebase may not be feasible. This is particularly the case if the test function `test_issue_11230` relies on global state or fixtures set up by the test framework that aren't being replicated accurately in a standalone script.

However, we can try a different approach where we still use the `sympy.test()` function but try to limit the scope to just the failing test module, and include detailed instructions for setting up the environment to closely match the original failing context. Then, assuming that `test_issue_11230` is the name of a real SymPy test related to a reported issue, and given the limitations discussed, below is an example of an updated `reproducer.py` that follows your request while highlighting these considerations:

```python
# reproducer.py

def setup_environment():
    import os
    os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = '736538842'

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_specific_test():
    setup_environment()
    # Import SymPy and the specific test module
    import sympy
    try:
        # Attempt to directly call the sympy.test() function with arguments
        # to isolate the test. Adjust the parameters based on SymPy's documentation.
        result = sympy.test("sympy/simplify/tests/test_cse.py:test_issue_11230", seed=57601301)
        if not result:
            raise AssertionError("Specified test failed.")
    except Exception as e:
        # This will catch both AssertionError and any other exception,
        # then print the stack trace as per your request.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(0)  # Exit code 0 to indicate the issue is reproduced or an error occurred.

    print("Test passed: The issue seems to be fixed.")
    exit(0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_specific_test()
```

**Please note:** The success of this reproducer depends on the behavior of `sympy.test()` and the assumption that specifying a test path and seed will isolate the test execution accordingly. The actual behavior may vary depending on SymPy's test infrastructure and the version of the library, and this script may need adjustments to work as expected.
