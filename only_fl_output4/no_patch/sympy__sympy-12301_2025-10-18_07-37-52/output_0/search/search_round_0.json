        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the test failure issue in `sympy/simplify/tests/test_cse.py` for `test_issue_11230`, I will invoke the following API calls:\n\n1. Get the code around the failure line to understand the test setup and what is being asserted:\n   - `get_code_around_line(file_path=\"sympy/simplify/tests/test_cse.py\", line_number=433, window_size=10)`\n\n2. Since the test name `test_issue_11230` suggests it is related to a specific issue, it might involve specific methods or classes within the `sympy` codebase that handle simplifications or common subexpression eliminations. The test assertion failure indicates it's checking for something not being an instance of `Mul` across transformations. However, without specific method or class names mentioned in the issue description, we can only guess which parts of the code are relevant. To get a broader understanding, searching for `is_Mul` could give insight into where such checks are performed in the sympy codebase and might lead us to related simplification logic:\n   - `search_code(code_str=\"is_Mul\")`\n\n3. Since `C` appears to be the main object of interest in the assertion and it's being iterated over, it might be helpful to understand how `C` is constructed or what it represents. But, with the available information, it's difficult to directly search for `C` without additional context because such a single-letter variable could be used widely across different parts of the project for different purposes. \n\nThe first search is aimed at understanding the immediate context of the failing test, and the second search is to gather information on related parts of the sympy project that could be causing the issue seen in the test."
