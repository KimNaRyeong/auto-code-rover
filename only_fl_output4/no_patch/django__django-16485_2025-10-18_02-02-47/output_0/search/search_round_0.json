        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to find where the `floatformat` function is defined and understand how it handles its arguments, particularly focusing on how it deals with the `prec` parameter that is mentioned in the error message. Additionally, understanding the usage context and any conditions around the error mentioned will be crucial.\n\n1. To locate the `floatformat` function within the Django template default filters, I will use the `search_method` API call with \"floatformat\" as the method name to identify all occurrences of this function in the codebase:\n   - `search_method(\"floatformat\")`\n\n2. Since the error message involves the handling of precision, and specifically mentions a \"valid range for prec,\" identifying the code handling the precision (`prec`) parameter will be important. I'll use the `search_code` API call with a part of the error message to find where this validation or check might be occurring:\n   - `search_code(\"valid range for prec\")`\n\nThese actions should provide sufficient information to understand the context and implementation of `floatformat` and any related precision handling, helping us towards identifying a resolution to the issue."
