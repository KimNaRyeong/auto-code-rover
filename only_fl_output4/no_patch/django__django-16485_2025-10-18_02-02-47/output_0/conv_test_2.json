It captures a `ValueError` as expected for the issue and then checks if the error message matches the described issue. If the condition is true, an `AssertionError` is raised with a message indicating the issue is present. When no exception is raised by the `floatformat` calls, it prints a message stating no issue was found, indicating the issue has been resolved, and exits with code 0."
