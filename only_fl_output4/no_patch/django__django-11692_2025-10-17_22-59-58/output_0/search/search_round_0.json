        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to the use of `OuterRef` in a union `Subquery`, we need to look at a few specific places in the codebase:\n\n1. Since the issue involves Django models, specifically around the construction of complex `QuerySet` commands using `union` and the `Subquery` with `OuterRef`, we should start by looking at where the `Document` model is defined. This will give us insight into the fields and methods that might be interacting with the problematic code.\n\n2. Next, we'll want to understand how the `annotate` method is used within the context of this project, as the issue describes a problem happening when `annotate` is part of the query that includes a union operation. The problem appears when `Subquery` and `OuterRef` are used, so getting examples of their usage might help us understand the typical patterns or any existing workarounds in the codebase.\n\n3. Finally, understanding where and how the `union` method is used in conjunction with `Subquery` and `OuterRef` will help.\n\nBased on these considerations, I will make the following API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"Document\")`: This will help us find the `Document` class in the codebase, which is critical for understanding the models involved in the issue.\n- `search_method(\"annotate\")`: To get examples of how `annotate` is used throughout the project. This might show us other instances where `Subquery` and `OuterRef` are used or might help us identify a common pattern.\n- `search_code(\"OuterRef('id')\")`: This call aims to find usages of `OuterRef` in relation to the bug, giving us context about its application and possibly related issues or patterns.\n- `search_code(\"Subquery\")`: To understand how `Subquery` is generally used across the project, which can provide insight into whether this issue is unique or part of a broader pattern of similar problems."
