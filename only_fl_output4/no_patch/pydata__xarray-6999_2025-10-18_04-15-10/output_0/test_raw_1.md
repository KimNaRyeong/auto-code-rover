Based on the information provided and the guidelines for including the stack trace printing function, here is the corrected `reproducer.py` file that should operate as expected, printing a stack trace if the issue is reproduced and existing with code 0 if the issue is fixed. This script specifically checks if renaming a variable to match a dimension name automatically creates an index for selection, which is the essence of the reported issue.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import xarray as xr

    data = xr.DataArray([5, 6, 7], coords={"c": ("x", [1, 2, 3])}, dims="x")
    data_renamed = data.rename({"c": "x"})  # Attempt to rename 'c' to 'x', making it a dimension coordinate

    # Check if 'x' in data_renamed is recognized as an index
    assert "x" in data_renamed.indexes and data_renamed.indexes["x"] is not None, "Renaming did not create index for 'x'."

    try:
        # Attempt to select with 'x' should work if index was created properly
        _ = data_renamed.sel(x=2)
        print("Issue is fixed. Exiting with code 0.")
    except KeyError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("Failed to select with 'x' after renaming, indicating missing index.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    exit(0)
```

This script attempts to replicate the issue as described. It first renames a non-dimension coordinate to be a dimension coordinate and then checks if this operation creates an index for the new dimension coordinate. The script raises an `AssertionError` if the operation doesn't behave as expected (i.e., if it doesn't create an index or if the subsequent `sel` operation fails due to the lack of an index).
