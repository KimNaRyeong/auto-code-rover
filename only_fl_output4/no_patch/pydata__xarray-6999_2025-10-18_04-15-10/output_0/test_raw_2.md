Based on your instructions and correcting the formatting issues in the stack trace printing function, here is a revised version of the `reproducer.py` script. This version ensures the error handling and output are correctly managed to distinguish between the script failing due to the reported issue or other errors such as import problems.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    import xarray as xr

    try:
        data = xr.DataArray([5, 6, 7], coords={"c": ("x", [1, 2, 3])}, dims="x")
        data_renamed = data.rename({"c": "x"})  # Rename 'c' to 'x', intending to make it a dimension coordinate

        # 'data_renamed.indexes' should show an index for 'x' if correctly created
        assert "x" in data_renamed.indexes, "Index for 'x' was not created upon renaming."

        _ = data_renamed.sel(x=2)  # This would fail if the index for 'x' is not correctly set up    
        print("Issue seems to be fixed. Exiting with code 0.")
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        exit(1)
    except Exception:
        exit(1)
    exit(0)
```
This version of the script attempts to execute the series of operations described in the issue: it renames a coordinate to match the name of a dimension and then tries to access the data using the `.sel()` method, which depends on the presence of an index. It correctly handles the case where the operation might fail by raising an `AssertionError` if the index is missing but does not explicitly check whether the `x` coordinate is displayed as a dimension coordinate in the output. This check is implicit in that if `.sel()` works as expected, it implies that `x` is functioning as a dimension coordinate with an associated index.
