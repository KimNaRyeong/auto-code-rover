As noted in #10648, it can be easy for users to miss that they need to set validate=False to pass through a DataFrame without converting it to a NumPy array. I think it would be more user-friendly to have `validate='array-or-frame'` by default, which would pass through DataFrames to the function, but otherwise convert its input to a 2d array. For strict backwards compatibility, the default should be changed through a deprecation cycle, warning whenever using the default validation means a DataFrame is currently converted to an array.\nDo others agree?\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue related to the `FunctionTransformer` and its handling of Pandas DataFrames, I will request specific information that targets the essence of the problem.\n\n1. To understand how `FunctionTransformer` is currently implemented, we need to look at its class definition. We start by locating the class itself in the codebase.\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"FunctionTransformer\")\n```\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a default behavior that involves validation\u2014specifically, the conversion of input data (potentially a DataFrame) to a NumPy array unless `validate=False` is specified\u2014we should look for methods where this validation occurs. A likely candidate method in this context would be an initializer (`__init__`) where default parameters are defined and possibly a method responsible for the actual transformation or validation process.\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"FunctionTransformer\")\nsearch_method_in_class(\"transform\", \"FunctionTransformer\")\n```\n\n3. The issue also suggests introducing a new default option `validate='array-or-frame'`. To understand how to implement this change, we should find where the `validate` parameter is used in the code. This will likely be in the same or related methods identified above but might also involve utility functions that handle validation.\n\n```python\nsearch_code(\"validate\")\n```\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive view of how `FunctionTransformer` is implemented and interacts with DataFrames and other data types, as well as insights into where and how the `validate` parameter is utilized. This information should form a solid basis for crafting a patch to address the issue."
