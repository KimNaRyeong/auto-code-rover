        "intended_behavior": "The `get_admin_url` method needs to be adjusted to correctly generate URLs for ForeignKey fields in the context of a custom admin site. Currently, it generates a URL with the assumption that all admin URLs start with `/admin/...`, which causes issues when used in conjunction with custom admin sites that might utilize a different base path (e.g., `/custom-admin/...`). To resolve the issue, the method should dynamically use the `current_app` parameter in the call to `reverse`, analogous to the pattern observed in the `response_add` method of the `ModelAdmin` class. Specifically, this involves modifying the `reverse` call within `get_admin_url` to include `current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name`:\n    url = reverse(url_name, args=[quote(remote_obj.pk)], current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name)\nThis change intends to preserve the existing functionality of URL generation within the Django admin while ensuring that links correctly reflect the namespace of the current admin site. It is a critical fix to support Django applications that utilize custom admin site instances, enhancing the framework's flexibility and adherence to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle."
