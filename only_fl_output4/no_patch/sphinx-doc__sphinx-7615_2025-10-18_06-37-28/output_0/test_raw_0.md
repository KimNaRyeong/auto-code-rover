This script attempts to reproduce the issue described with Sphinx rendering consecutive backslashes incorrectly. It creates a simple Sphinx project with a single document that includes the problematic backslashes as described. The script then builds the project and checks the HTML output to ensure the backslashes are rendered according to the expectation outlined. Assertion errors are raised with detailed information if the issue occurs, facilitating diagnosis and fixing.
