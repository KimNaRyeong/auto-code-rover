It should correctly flag content that is associated with `:noindex:` to be excluded from indexing processes. The existing functionality to generate identifiers or handle directive options must remain intact, but it should be extended or checked for consistent handling of all options across different directive types."

This involves making sure that any content or structure associated with a directive that includes `:noindex:` does not appear in the index or search results of the generated documentation. The functionality to customize directive behavior via options must be preserved, with added assurance that options are comprehensively accounted for and applied as intended."
