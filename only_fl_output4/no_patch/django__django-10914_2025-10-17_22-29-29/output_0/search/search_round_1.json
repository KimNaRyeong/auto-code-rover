In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n</issue>"

Thus, the following API calls will be helpful:\n\n1. Search for the `FileSystemStorage` class to understand how files are stored and how permissions are handled:\n   ```\n   search_class(\"FileSystemStorage\")\n   ```\n\n2. Search for any code dealing with `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to see how the default permissions are set and managed:\n   ```\n   search_code(\"FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\")\n   ```\n\n3. Since `MemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile` are mentioned in relation to their influence on uploaded data handling, let's get more context about them:\n   ```\n   search_class(\"MemoryUploadedFile\")\n   search_class(\"TemporaryUploadedFile\")\n   ```\n\n4. Lastly, because the issue mentions temporary file permissions specifically (0o0600) and a sequence using `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` + `os.rename`, it would be beneficial to examine how temporary files are handled during uploads:\n   ```\n   search_code(\"tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile\")\n   search_code(\"os.rename\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive view of how Django handles file uploads, specifically regarding file storage, temporary file handling, and permissions management.

        "content": "### Analysis of Collected Context\n\n#### FileSystemStorage class in `django/core/files/storage.py`\n- **What does this part of the code do?** The `FileSystemStorage` class is responsible for handling basic file storage operations such as saving, opening, and deleting files on the filesystem. It provides the functionality to interact with the storage layer in a standardized manner across Django projects.\n- **Relationship with the bug:** This class is central to the issue, as it handles the file permissions for newly uploaded files and directories. The `file_permissions_mode` and `directory_permissions_mode` properties are particularly relevant. The behavior regarding default file permissions upon upload (i.e., handling `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting) is implemented here.\n- **Intended behavior:** The intended behavior appears to be that if `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is not explicitly set, the default file permissions for uploaded files should be predictable and consistent. The issue indicates there's a lack of consistency in how permissions are applied, influenced by whether a `MemoryUploadedFile` or a `TemporaryUploadedFile` is used.\n\n#### FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS snippets in `storage.py` and `global_settings.py`\n- **What do these parts of the code do?** The `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting in `global_settings.py` provides a default value (None) that can be overridden in a Django project's settings to specify the filesystem permissions for newly uploaded files. In `storage.py`, particularly within the `FileSystemStorage` class, this setting is accessed to determine the permissions with which new files should be created.\n- **Relationship with the bug:** Directly related, as the issue discusses the inconsistency and potential absence of explicit configuration for `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`, leading to varying permissions for uploaded files. The snippets show where and how this setting is applied to files.\n- **Intended behavior:** When provided, `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` should enforce a consistent set of permissions on all uploaded files, irrespective of the temporary storage mechanism (memory vs. tempfile) used during upload processing.\n\n#### MemoryUploadedFile class and TemporaryUploadedFile class\n- **What does this part of the code do?** These classes handle different types of uploaded files. While a reference to `MemoryUploadedFile` wasn't directly found, `TemporaryUploadedFile` is defined for handling files that are stored temporarily on the filesystem during the upload process.\n- **Relationship with the bug:** The issue stems from a discrepancy in how these classes (or at least `TemporaryUploadedFile`, based on the available context) manage file permissions compared to the desired or expected set by `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`. This implies a handling mechanism in `TemporaryUploadedFile` might be overlooking the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` or applying it inconsistently.\n- **Intended behavior:** Both `MemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile` should ensure that when files are moved from temporary to permanent storage, they adhere to the permissions defined by `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` if it's set.\n\n#### `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` and `os.rename` code snippets\n- **What do these parts of the code do?** They are used within Django's file handling mechanisms for creating temporary files (`tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`) and renaming them (possibly moving to a new location with `os.rename`). These operations are part of the process for handling file uploads, especially for large files that need to be written to disk temporarily.\n- **Relationship with the bug:** The issue might arise from how the temporary files (created with `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`) inherit default system-level permissions which might not align with the intended `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`. Furthermore, the use of `os.rename` suggests that the file is moved but not necessarily re-permissioned according to `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`.\n- **Intended behavior:** The process of handling temporary files during uploads should ensure that once a file is moved from its temporary location to its final destination, it should have the permissions specified by `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`, if such a setting is configured.\n\n### Further Investigation\nGiven the analysis, it's clear that the behavior of Django concerning file permissions during the upload process might not always adhere to the expectations set by `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`. Particularly, the transition of files from temporary storage (handled by `TemporaryUploadedFile` and possibly by an unlocated `MemoryUploadedFile`) to permanent storage (`FileSystemStorage`) needs to respect the configured permissions.\n\nThe next steps could involve examining how `TemporaryUploadedFile` applies file permissions upon closing or moving the file and ensuring there is a mechanism to apply `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` consistently across all file uploads. Also, understanding the absence of `MemoryUploadedFile` in the context might direct further inquiries into alternative implementations or name changes in recent versions of Django that address or avoid the described issue."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This includes handling files uploaded through both `MemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile` mechanisms. The functionality should remain unchanged, except for an additional step to verify and enforce the specified file permissions on the newly saved file. This approach ensures consistent file permissions aligned with the administrator's configuration, potentially mitigating security concerns arising from overly restrictive or permissive default permissions.  \n\n- **Bug Location 2:**  \n  **File:** django/core/files/uploadedfile.py  \n  **Class:** TemporaryUploadedFile  \n  **Intended Behavior:** Consider introducing a mechanism (either within `__init__`, `temporary_file_path`, or `close` method; but more context is needed to specify further) that enforces the application of `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` settings to the temporary file before it gets moved to its permanent location. This step would help in maintaining consistency in file permissions from the moment a file is uploaded and stored temporarily, to when it is permanently stored on the filesystem.  \n\nThese locations and adjustments would directly address the inconsistency in file permissions for uploaded files that do not explicitly configure `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`. Ensuring that the `FileSystemStorage`'s `_save` method and possibly the handling within `TemporaryUploadedFile` respect the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting at all stages of file handling would resolve the issue."
