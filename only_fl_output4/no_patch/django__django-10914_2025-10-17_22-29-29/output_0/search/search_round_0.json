In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue \u200bon GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue raised regarding `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` and its inconsistent behavior because of `MemoryUploadedFile` or `TemporaryUploadedFile`, and the system's file permissions, we need to gather code context related to Django's file upload mechanism, especially around `FileSystemStorage`, `MemoryUploadedFile`, `TemporaryUploadedFile`, and the part of the codebase responsible for handling default file upload permissions. Thus, the following API calls will be helpful:\n\n1. Search for the `FileSystemStorage` class to understand how files are stored and how permissions are handled:\n   ```\n   search_class(\"FileSystemStorage\")\n   ```\n\n2. Search for any code dealing with `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to see how the default permissions are set and managed:\n   ```\n   search_code(\"FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS\")\n   ```\n\n3. Since `MemoryUploadedFile` and `TemporaryUploadedFile` are mentioned in relation to their influence on uploaded data handling, let's get more context about them:\n   ```\n   search_class(\"MemoryUploadedFile\")\n   search_class(\"TemporaryUploadedFile\")\n   ```\n\n4. Lastly, because the issue mentions temporary file permissions specifically (0o0600) and a sequence using `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` + `os.rename`, it would be beneficial to examine how temporary files are handled during uploads:\n   ```\n   search_code(\"tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile\")\n   search_code(\"os.rename\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls aim to provide a comprehensive view of how Django handles file uploads, specifically regarding file storage, temporary file handling, and permissions management. This context will be critical for crafting a patch to address the reported inconsistency."
