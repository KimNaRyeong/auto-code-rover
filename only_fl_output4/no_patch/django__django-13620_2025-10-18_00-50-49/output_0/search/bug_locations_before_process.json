        "intended_behavior": "The `add_arguments` method currently allows the addition of arguments to the parser, but there's no explicit handling or customization focused on enabling list arguments within mutually exclusive groups as described in the issue. To resolve the issue, while preserving existing functionality, the implementation here does not necessarily need to be changed directly (unless further context reveals such necessity). Instead, ensuring that the argument parser (likely instantiated and configured within `create_parser`) correctly supports and parses list arguments when passed via `call_command` should be the goal. This may involve ensuring compatibility or introducing handling logic within the parser setup that accounts for list-type arguments within mutually exclusive groups, ensuring they are correctly identified and processed without causing errors."

        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior here is to ensure that `call_command` correctly interprets and forwards list arguments for options within mutually exclusive argument groups. This involves ensuring that any necessary preprocessing or identification of argument value types (specifically lists) is correctly handled so that such arguments are passed to the underlying command's execution as expected. The logic that simulates argument parsing and assembles the `defaults` dictionary may need to be updated or extended to handle list arguments gracefully, ensuring they are not misinterpreted or incorrectly flagged as invalid when processing mutually exclusive arguments. This update should preserve the function's ability to handle various types of arguments and command invocations without introducing regressions in existing functionality."
