This `reproducer.py` script attempts to reproduce the issue described. However, there are several considerations to be mindful of:

1. **Environment Setup**: The script assumes a Django project with a minimal setup, including a settings module named `reproducer.settings`. You will need to adjust this if your settings module is differently named or located.

2. **Django Application Requirement**: For this script to work as intended, it expects that Django is properly set up and configured to run management commands. This includes having a configured database for the `migrate` command to run successfully.

3. **Command Registration**: This script tries to call a management command named `command_name`, which corresponds to an instance of the `Command` class within the script. Ensure that this command is properly registered with Django for it to be callable via `call_command`.

4. **Error Handling and Assertion**: The script prints a stack trace for any `CommandError` exceptions thrown during its execution but does not raise an `AssertionError` directly. To adhere to the requirement of raising an `AssertionError` when the issue is present, consider adding explicit checks on the commands' outcomes and raise an `AssertionError` accordingly if the command behavior deviates from the expected.

Adjust the script according to your specific project setup and requirements.
