        "content": "By reviewing the results from the initial search, we can gather that the Sitemap generation functionality and i18n configurations are spread across various parts of the Django framework. This gives us a more focused area for deeper investigation. Specifically, the files `django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py` and `django/contrib/sitemaps/views.py` are likely involved in Sitemap generation, while files like `django/views/i18n.py` and `django/conf/urls/i18n.py` are more aligned with internationalization (i18n) functionalities. The presence of matches in both contexts suggests an existing integration point we need to understand better to tailormake the solution for the described issue.\n\n1. **Analysis of Sitemap Related Files:**\n   - Files under `django/contrib/sitemaps/` are definitely where the Sitemap generation logic resides. This part of the code is responsible for configuring and generating Sitemaps according to the Django project's requirements. Given that Sitemaps are instrumental in SEO by listing URLs provided by a site, the logic for how URLs (and, implicitly, their corresponding content) are selected for inclusion in the Sitemap is crucial here.\n\n2. **Analysis of i18n Related Files:**\n   - The files like `django/views/i18n.py` suggest where Django handles i18n mechanisms for rendering views in multiple languages based on user preferences or default settings. The issue's description points to a challenge in linking these i18n capabilities with the Sitemap's generation in a way that respects language-specific content availability. Essentially, the goal would be for this part of the code to intelligently include or exclude certain items from the Sitemap based on their availability in the requested language, which may involve custom logic beyond the current i18n and Sitemap generation integration.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior:**\n   - Considering the issue description, the intended behavior would be to enhance the current Sitemap and i18n integration to allow for conditional item inclusion based on language. This implies either extending the existing Sitemap generation logic to consult more closely with i18n settings or introducing new configurations/interfaces that would let developers specify the availability of certain content in specific languages, thus preventing errors or dead links in the Sitemap for languages where some content might not be available or translated.\n\nTo proceed, we need specific sections of the code that deal with how Sitemaps are currently generated, especially in relation to i18n. This requires looking into:\n\na. How `django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py` and `django/contrib/sitemaps/views.py` implement Sitemap generation.\nb. How `django/views/i18n.py` and `django/conf/urls/i18n.py` configure and manage i18n, particularly regarding URL resolution and content selection based on language.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Investigate the Sitemap generation process by looking into the method definitions in `django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py` and `django/contrib/sitemaps/views.py`.\n- Understand i18n URL handling and content selection mechanism by inspecting relevant methods or configurations in `django/views/i18n.py` and `django/conf/urls/i18n.py`.\n\nSuggested API calls to make:\n- `search_method_in_file(\"__init__\", \"django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py\")`\n- `search_method_in_file(\"get_urls\", \"django/contrib/sitemaps/views.py\")`\n- `search_method_in_file(\"set_language\", \"django/views/i18n.py\")`"

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

However, I can speculate on potential bug locations and their intended behaviors based on the descriptions and functionality involved.\n\n1. **do we need more context:**\n   - Yes, specific method implementations within the identified files would provide clarity. However, I will proceed with a hypothetical analysis based on typical patterns in Django's handling of sitemaps and i18n.\n\n2. **where are bug locations:**\n   - **Location 1:** \n     - **File:** `django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py`\n     - **Class:** Likely a class that extends `Sitemap` or similar.\n     - **Intended Behavior:** This class or module should be extended to include logic that decides whether to include a URL in the sitemap based on its availability in the requested language. This might involve adding a method or altering an existing one to filter out items not translated into the current language. This logic should preserve existing functionality by defaulting to the current behavior when no language-specific rules are defined.\n   \n   - **Location 2:** \n     - **File:** `django/contrib/sitemaps/views.py`\n     - **Method:** Likely in a method that generates the sitemap entries, such as `get_urls`.\n     - **Intended Behavior:** Modify the `get_urls` method (or wherever the URL generation logic resides) to consult the possibly extended Sitemap logic (from Location 1) to filter out non-available language content. This requires incorporating i18n awareness directly into the sitemap generation process, ensuring that each URL is validated against its i18n availability before being added.\n\nGiven the speculative nature of these locations and intended behaviors without specific method details, the actual implementation might require additional modifications or entirely different approaches depending on how the Django project has implemented i18n and Sitemap generation functionalities."
