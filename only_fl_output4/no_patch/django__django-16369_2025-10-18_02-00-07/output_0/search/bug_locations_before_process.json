        "intended_behavior": "The `_items` method currently returns a list of all items for all languages when `i18n` is enabled. The intended behavior is to enhance this method with additional logic to filter out items not available in certain languages. This could involve introducing a filter method or lambda function as an attribute of the `Sitemap` class that developers can override to define per-item and per-language availability. This method would check each item's availability for each language and only include those items that are meant to be displayed for the languages in question. The default behavior (if no filter is defined) should remain as currently implemented, including all items for all languages."

        "intended_behavior": "While the `_location` method primarily focuses on generating the URLs for the items, considering the new logic added to `_items`, it might not require significant changes. However, ensuring that the logic in `_items` for filtering based on language carries through effectively to item URL generation will be crucial. If any additional filtering or adjustments are needed to ensure that only valid, language-specific URLs are generated, those should be incorporated here. This means double-checking that the items being processed by `_location` have already been filtered for language availability. Essentially, there should be congruence between the items listed and their corresponding URLs, reflecting the correct availability per language."
