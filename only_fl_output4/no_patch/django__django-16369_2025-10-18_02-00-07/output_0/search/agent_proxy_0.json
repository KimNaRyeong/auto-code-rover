We should focus on finding the class or classes that manage the Sitemap generation and any i18n related configurations or methods.\n\nI propose the following API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the Sitemap class or module:** Since the issue description does not provide a specific class name related to the Sitemap generation, we will attempt a broad search to locate this class or module.\n   - `search_code(\"Sitemap\")`\n\n2. **Search for i18n configurations or methods:** Since i18n plays a crucial role in the issue, finding how it is configured or integrated in the project will give us insights into potential places for modification.\n   - `search_code(\"i18n\")`\n\nThese searches aim to identify the code responsible for Sitemap generation and its interaction with internationalization (i18n), providing a starting point to address the issue described."
