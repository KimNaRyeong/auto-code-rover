        "intended_behavior": "This method should be modified to better handle language variants that include regional codes, especially in cases where multiple alternatives (e.g., `zh-hans` vs `zh-Hant-HK`) are available and listed in `settings.LANGUAGES`. It should prioritize exact matches to the `Accept-Language` header, taking into account both language code and region. Thus, if `zh-Hant-HK` is available and requested, it should be selected over a more generic `zh-hans`. The priority order should reflect the specificity of the language-region combination, ensuring that a user's regional preferences are accurately captured and reflected in the language selection. This likely requires a nuanced comparison strategy that accounts for language subtags and variants. Preserve the existing fallback and generic language handling when more specific requests cannot be matched, ensuring backward compatibility and maintaining current functionality for other languages and cases."
