The issue is centered around the `LocaleMiddleware` and the `get_supported_language_variant` method within `django.utils.translation.trans_real`. Let's start by finding the specific locations and code context of these components.\n\n1. To understand how `LocaleMiddleware` works and to see if the issue might also involve how it uses `get_supported_language_variant`, we should first find where `LocaleMiddleware` is defined. Thus, we need to search for the class definition.\n   \n   - `search_class(\"LocaleMiddleware\")`\n\n2. Next, we need to pinpoint the location and implementation details of `get_supported_language_variant` to see how it is determining the language preference, especially in the case of `zh-Hant-HK`.\n\n   - `search_method(\"get_supported_language_variant\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a good starting point by locating the relevant parts of the Django codebase involved in the reported issue."
