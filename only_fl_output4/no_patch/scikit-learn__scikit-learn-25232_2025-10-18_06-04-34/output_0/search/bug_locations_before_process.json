        "intended_behavior": "Introduce a new parameter called `fill_value` with a default value that signifies it is unset (for instance, `None` or `np.nan`), which will be used in the initial imputation when `initial_strategy` is set to `constant`. This addition should ensure that existing functionality for other strategies (`mean`, `median`, `most_frequent`) remains unchanged. The interface should check if `initial_strategy` is `constant` and `fill_value` is not set to its default, then proceed to use the provided `fill_value` for initial imputation. This change aims to allow custom initialization of missing values, especially to support the use case where `np.nan` can be used as a fill value for compatibility with decision tree-based estimators."

        "intended_behavior": "Modify the implementation to use the `fill_value` parameter (introduced in the `__init__` method) when the `initial_strategy` is `constant`. The method should check if `fill_value` is provided (i.e., not the default value) when `initial_strategy` is set to `constant` and apply this value to initialize missing values. This would allow users to specify how initial imputations are performed with a constant value of their choosing, including `np.nan`, enhancing the flexibility and applicability of the `IterativeImputer`, especially in conjunction with decision tree-based models."
