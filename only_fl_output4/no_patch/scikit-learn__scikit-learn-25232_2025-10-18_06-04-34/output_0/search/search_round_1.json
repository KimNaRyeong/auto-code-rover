From its [docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.IterativeImputer.html):\n> **initial_strategy {\u2018mean\u2019, \u2018median\u2019, \u2018most_frequent\u2019, \u2018constant\u2019}, default=\u2019mean\u2019**\n> Which strategy to use to initialize the missing values. Same as the strategy parameter in SimpleImputer.\nI have set the initial strategy to `\"constant\"`. However, I want to define this constant myself. So, as I look at the parameters for `SimpleImputer` I find `fill_value`:\n>When strategy == \u201cconstant\u201d, fill_value is used to replace all occurrences of missing_values. If left to the default, fill_value will be 0 when imputing numerical data and \u201cmissing_value\u201d for strings or object data types.\nBased on this information, one would assume that `IterativeImputer` also has the parameter `fill_value`, but it does not.\n### Describe your proposed solution\nThe parameter `fill_value` needs to be added to `IterativeImputer` for when `initial_strategy` is set to `\"constant\"`. If this parameter is added, please also allow `np.nan` as `fill_value`, for optimal compatibility with decision tree-based estimators.\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if relevant\n_No response_\n### Additional context\n_No response_\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the provided information about the `IterativeImputer` class reveals several key points relevant to addressing the issue at hand:\n\n1. **`IterativeImputer` Initialization Parameters**: The `__init__` method of the `IterativeImputer` class lists `initial_strategy=\"mean\"` as one of its initialization parameters. This directly relates to the reported issue, as it is where the strategy for initializing missing values is specified. The absence of a `fill_value` parameter in this list confirms the issue's claim.\n\n2. **Initial Imputation Method**: The method named `_initial_imputation` likely handles the initial filling of missing values before starting the iterative imputation process. The presence of this method suggests that it is where the initial strategy (`mean`, `median`, `most_frequent`, `constant`) is applied. To address the issue, modifications would need to be made within or around this method to incorporate the `fill_value` parameter when the initial strategy is `constant`.\n\n3. **Connection to `SimpleImputer`**: The `IterativeImputer` does not share the `fill_value` parameter found in `SimpleImputer`, a discrepancy that is the focus of the reported issue. Given that `IterativeImputer`\u2019s initial strategy operates similarly to how `SimpleImputer` decides on filling missing values, introducing a `fill_value` parameter should logically extend to how `SimpleImputer` uses this parameter\u2014allowing users to specify a custom fill value when the strategy is `constant`.\n\n4. **Intended Modification**: To address the issue, a `fill_value` parameter needs to be introduced within the `IterativeImputer` class, particularly affecting its constructor (`__init__`) and the `_initial_imputation` method where this value would be applied. The change should allow users to define a custom fill value, used during the initial imputation phase when `initial_strategy=\"constant\"`. Moreover, the implementation should handle `np.nan` as a valid `fill_value`, catering to the need for compatibility with decision tree-based estimators highlighted in the issue.\n\nConsidering the above points, the next steps would involve:\n- Reviewing the implementation details of `_initial_imputation` to assess how the current initial strategies are applied and where to integrate the `fill_value`.\n- Examining if any other methods within `IterativeImputer` interact with the `initial_strategy` in a way that would be influenced by the introduction of a `fill_value`.\n\nTo obtain the necessary details for these steps, we can follow up with:\n- search_method_in_class(\"_initial_imputation\", \"IterativeImputer\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"__init__\", \"IterativeImputer\")"

The interface should check if `initial_strategy` is `constant` and `fill_value` is not set to its default, then proceed to use the provided `fill_value` for initial imputation.

The method should check if `fill_value` is provided (i.e., not the default value) when `initial_strategy` is set to `constant` and apply this value to initialize missing values. This would allow users to specify how initial imputations are performed with a constant value of their choosing, including `np.nan`, enhancing the flexibility and applicability of the `IterativeImputer`, especially in conjunction with decision tree-based models."
