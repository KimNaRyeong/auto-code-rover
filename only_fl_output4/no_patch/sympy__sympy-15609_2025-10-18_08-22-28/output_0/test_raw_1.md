Given the requirements, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the handling of the test to reproduce the issue reliably. Let's correct this by ensuring the `AssertionError` is indeed raised when the output latex string is not what we expect due to the double subscript issue reported.

The script below is rewritten to directly check for the problematic output and raise an `AssertionError` if the generated LaTeX string matches the problematic pattern. This aims to accurately detect the issue as described:

```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import symbols, MatrixSymbol, latex

    i, j, k = symbols("i j k")
    M = MatrixSymbol("M", k, k)
    N = MatrixSymbol("N", k, k)

    try:
        generated_latex = latex((M*N)[i, j])
        # Check for the specific problematic pattern in the generated LaTeX string.
        assert "\sum_{i_{1}=0}^{k - 1} M_{i, _i_1} N_{_i_1, j}" != generated_latex, "Issue with LaTeX subscript rendering detected."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with code 1 indicating failure/reproduction of the issue

    print("Issue fixed or not present.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 indicating no issue detected

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This version of `reproducer.py` is crafted to directly check for the double subscript problem in the generated LaTeX string. If the string matches the known problematic pattern, an `AssertionError` is raised, and the script will print a stack trace. If the output does not contain this issue, indicating a possible fix or absence of the problem, the script reports "Issue fixed or not present." and exits with code 0.
