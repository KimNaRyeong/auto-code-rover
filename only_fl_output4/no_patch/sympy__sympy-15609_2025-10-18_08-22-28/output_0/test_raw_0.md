Below is the `reproducer.py` file designed to reproduce the issue you're experiencing with the LaTeX printer for indexed matrix expressions. This script includes an assertion to check if the issue exists and uses the provided function to print a stack trace if the generated LaTeX string contains the problematic double subscript error.

```python
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_latex_issue():
    from sympy import symbols, MatrixSymbol, latex

    i, j, k = symbols("i j k")
    M = MatrixSymbol("M", k, k)
    N = MatrixSymbol("N", k, k)

    generated_latex = latex((M*N)[i, j])

    # Check if the generated LaTeX string contains the problematic double subscript issue
    if "_i_1" in generated_latex:
        return True
    else:
        return False

try:
    assert check_latex_issue(), "LaTeX double subscript issue not found!"
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exit with error if the assertion fails (issue is present)

print("Issue fixed or not present.")
sys.exit(0)  # Exit successfully if the issue is fixed or not present
```

When this script is executed, it will raise an `AssertionError` if the generated LaTeX string contains the double subscript issue (indicative of the problem being present). The `print_stacktrace` function is used to print detailed info about the assertion failure. If the issue has been fixed or isn't present, the script exits cleanly with a success message.
