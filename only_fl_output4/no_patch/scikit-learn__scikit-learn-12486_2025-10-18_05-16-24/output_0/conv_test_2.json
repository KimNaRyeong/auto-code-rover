This version is more cautious about potential errors and includes the suggested function to print stack traces for any exceptions encountered. It attempts to directly address the `IndexError` as noted in the provided example, ensuring an `AssertionError` is raised if the issue manifests, indicative of a problem, and exits gracefully with code 0 if resolved.\n\n```python\n# reproducer.py\ndef print_stacktrace(e: Exception):\n    import traceback\n    import sys\n    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)\n    print(\"Traceback (most recent call last):\", file=sys.stderr)\n    for frame in tb:\n        line_number = frame.lineno\n        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else \"Unknown\"\n        print(f'  File \"{frame.filename}\"', file=sys.stderr)\n        print(f\"    {line_number}: {code_context}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    print(f\"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\ndef main():\n    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification\n    from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n    from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture  # Assuming GaussianMixture as the closest alternative to deprecated GMM.\n    import sys\n\n    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=10000, n_features=10, n_classes=2)\n\n    gm_model = GaussianMixture()  # Updated from GMM to GaussianMixture\n\n    param_grid = {\n        'n_components': [1, 2, 3, 4],\n        'covariance_type': ['tied', 'full', 'spherical']\n    }\n\n    grid_search = GridSearchCV(gm_model, param_grid, scoring='roc_auc')\n\n    try:\n        grid_search.fit(X, y)\n    except IndexError as e:\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        raise AssertionError(\"The issue is present.\") from e\n    except Exception as e:  # Additional catch for any unexpected exception types.\n        print_stacktrace(e)\n        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with an error code for unexpected exceptions.\n\n    print(\"The issue is fixed.\")\n    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed.\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis script checks for the specific `IndexError` involved in the issue and uses an explicit exception handling strategy to provide clear outcomes depending on whether the error is encountered. The approach also includes a generic exception handler to ensure that any unexpected errors still result in a clear, concise output, along with a stack trace for debugging purposes."
