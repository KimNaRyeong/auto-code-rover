This Python script aims to reproduce the specific issue outlinedâ€”with adaptations for updated API usage and addressing deprecations in scikit-learn (e.g., replacing `GMM` with `GaussianMixture`). 

It includes comprehensive error handling via a try-except block that specifically looks for the `IndexError` indicative of the described problem, prints a detailed stack trace for easier debugging, and asserts an error's presence to provide clear feedback when the issue is reproduced.

Note that this script uses Python 3 syntax and scikit-learn conventions in place at the time of writing. Updates or changes in the involved libraries or their APIs might necessitate adjustments to this reproduction script.
