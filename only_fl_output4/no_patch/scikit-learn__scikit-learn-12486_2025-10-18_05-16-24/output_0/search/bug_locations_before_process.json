If the estimator does not naturally support the scoring method (as might be the case with `GMM` or `GaussianMixture` for `roc_auc`), a more descriptive error message should be thrown to guide the user. This validation should preserve the functionality of allowing any classifiers that can output probabilities or decision function values to be scored appropriately while preventing or handling more gracefully the cases where an unsupervised model is incorrectly used for supervised tasks. For supervised models that do not support `predict_proba` or `decision_function`, an alternative handling or suggestion in the error message should advise on the correct use or model adaptation."

        "method": "",
        "intended_behavior": "Given that the issue also stems from a misunderstanding or misuse of `GridSearchCV` with a non-typical classifier (`GMM`), it's crucial that `GridSearchCV` performs a check on the estimator to ensure it is suitable for the type of scoring being requested (`roc_auc`). This could involve verifying that the estimator adheres to the interface required for the specified scoring strategy. The behavior should ensure that users are immediately notified when there is a mismatch between the estimator's capabilities and the requirements of the scoring method, without altering the existing functionality of `GridSearchCV` for compatible model and scorer combinations. This might involve extending the existing validation within `GridSearchCV` to more comprehensively cover the capabilities of the provided estimator relative to the scoring method utilized."
