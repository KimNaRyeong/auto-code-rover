Explain your changes.\nWe are fixing this issue: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/7598\nWe added a test in the scorer.py file that raises a ValueError if the user is either trying to use a non classifier model for a classification problem, or is using a dataset with only one class.\n#### Any other comments?\n@reshamas\nBUG: Using GridSearchCV with scoring='roc_auc' and GMM as classifier gives IndexError\nWhen performing grid search using GridSearchCV using ootb scoring method 'roc_auc' and ootb GMM classifier from sklearn.mixture.GMM I get an index error.\nCode to reproduce:\n```\nfrom sklearn import datasets\nfrom sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.mixture import GMM\nX,y = datasets.make_classification(n_samples = 10000, n_features=10,n_classes=2)\n# Vanilla GMM_model\ngmm_model = GMM()\n# Standard param grid\nparam_grid = {'n_components' : [1,2,3,4],\n'covariance_type': ['tied','full','spherical']}\ngrid_search = GridSearchCV(gmm_model, param_grid, scoring='roc_auc')\n# Fit GS with this data\ngrid_search.fit(X, y)\n```\nSorry if the format is incorrect. First time I am posting.\nERROR:\nFile \"*/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/metrics/scorer.py\", line 175, in **call**\ny_pred = y_pred[:, 1]\nIndexError: index 1 is out of bounds for axis 1 with size 1\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather context from several components mentioned within the issue:\n\n1. **GridSearchCV Class**: Since the bug is encountered when using GridSearchCV, understanding how it interacts with scoring and models would be useful.\n2. **Scorer.py File & call Method**: The error traceback points to the `call` method in scorer.py, suggesting that this is where the IndexError occurs. Understanding how predictions are handled here would be critical.\n3. **GMM Class**: Given that the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) from `sklearn.mixture` is specifically mentioned, it's important to see how it outputs predictions and why those predictions are leading to an IndexError in scorer.py.\n \nConsidering these points, the following API calls will provide the necessary context:\n\n```python\nsearch_class(\"GridSearchCV\")\nsearch_method_in_file(\"__call__\", \"scorer.py\")\nsearch_class(\"GMM\")\n```\n\nThese calls aim to gather insights into how GridSearchCV uses scoring functions, how the `call` method handles predictions (specifically for classifier models and why it might fail for GMM), and any relevant details about the GMM's output shape or characteristics that could contribute to the IndexError observed."
