To address the clarification and maintain consistency with the requirements for creating a standalone Python file (`reproducer.py`) that reproduces the issue encountered, refer to the updated code block below. This script attempts to recreate the reported scenario with the `IndexError` during the execution of `GridSearchCV` with `GaussianMixture` (as an equivalent to the deprecated `GMM`) and scoring parameter set to `'roc_auc'`. The script includes comprehensive error handling to raise an `AssertionError` if the problem persists or to exit cleanly when the issue is resolved:

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
    from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
    from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture  # Updated from deprecated GMM to GaussianMixture
    from sklearn.exceptions import NotFittedError

    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, n_classes=2)

    gaussian_mixture_model = GaussianMixture()  # Updated from GMM to GaussianMixture

    param_grid = {
        'n_components': [1, 2, 3, 4],
        'covariance_type': ['tied', 'full', 'spherical']
    }

    grid_search = GridSearchCV(gaussian_mixture_model, param_grid, scoring='roc_auc')

    try:
        grid_search.fit(X, y)
    except IndexError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("The issue is present.") from e
    except NotFittedError as e:  # To handle the case if GaussianMixture is not intended for use with GridSearchCV in this manner.
        print_stacktrace(e)
        print("GaussianMixture may not be compatible with GridSearchCV and 'roc_auc' scoring without a custom scorer.")
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)  # Exit with an error code for any other exceptions that were not anticipated.

    print("The issue is fixed.")
    sys.exit(0)  # Exit with code 0 when the issue is fixed.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Ensure Python 3 is being used for execution as indicated by the command `python3 reproducer.py`, and the scikit-learn library is updated to a version that doesn't have the mentioned issues or is compatible with such a test scenario.
