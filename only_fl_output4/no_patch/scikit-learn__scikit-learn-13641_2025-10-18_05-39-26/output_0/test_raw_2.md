Given the specifications and keeping the issue description in mind, I will create a standalone Python script named `reproducer.py`. This script will attempt to reproduce the issue where `CountVectorizer` with a custom `analyzer` ignores the `input` argument. It should raise an `AssertionError` when the issue is present, and exit with code 0 when it is fixed. The desired stack trace printing function is included to detail any exceptions that occur during execution.

```python
# reproducer.py

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_count_vectorizer_behavior():
    try:
        cv = CountVectorizer(analyzer=lambda x: x.split(), input='filename')
        # Unlike 'filename', directly passing strings should raise an error based on the argument conflict
        cv.fit(['hello world'])  # This should technically conflict with the input='filename' specification
        # If the above line does not raise an error, it means the issue is still present
        return False
    except ValueError:
        # If a ValueError is raised, indicating the input parameter is being considered
        # we assume the issue is fixed.
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return False

def main():
    if test_count_vectorizer_behavior():
        print("The issue appears to be fixed.")
        sys.exit(0)
    else:
        raise AssertionError("CountVectorizer with a custom analyzer ignores the 'input' argument.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as ae:
        print_stacktrace(ae)
        sys.exit(1)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
```

This script explicitly checks for the presence of the described issue by attempting to use `CountVectorizer` in a way that should be incompatible with the `input='filename'` argument when a custom `analyzer` is provided. This setup is intended to simulate the problem, asserting an incorrect process flow based on the input parameters.
