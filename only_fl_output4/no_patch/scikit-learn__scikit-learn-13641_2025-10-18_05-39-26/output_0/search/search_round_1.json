        "content": "To address the issue in question, we should focus on gathering information about the `CountVectorizer` class and how it handles the `analyzer` and `input` parameters. Specifically, it's important to understand the implementation details of how the `analyzer` function is applied and how the `input` parameter influences the behavior of `CountVectorizer`. Thus, we need to look at both the definition of the `CountVectorizer` class and the methods that deal with the `analyzer` and `input` parameters.\n\nTo get started, the following search API calls will be necessary:\n\n1. **Search for the `CountVectorizer` class to understand its structure and relevant methods.**\n   - `search_class(\"CountVectorizer\")`\n\n2. **Search for methods in the `CountVectorizer` class that are responsible for fitting the data and processing the `input` parameter.**\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"fit\", \"CountVectorizer\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"_validate_params\", \"CountVectorizer\")` \n\n3. **Since the issue mentions the behavior when the `input` parameter is set to `filename` or `file`, it's important to find code that specifically handles different `input` types.**\n   - `search_code(\"input='filename'\")`\n   - `search_code_in_class(\"input\", \"CountVectorizer\")`\n\n4. **Understanding how the custom analyzer is being utilized or ignored requires looking at how the analyzer function is applied within `CountVectorizer`.**\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"build_analyzer\", \"CountVectorizer\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a thorough context surrounding how `CountVectorizer` handles the `analyzer` and `input` parameters, which will be crucial for resolving the issue at hand."
