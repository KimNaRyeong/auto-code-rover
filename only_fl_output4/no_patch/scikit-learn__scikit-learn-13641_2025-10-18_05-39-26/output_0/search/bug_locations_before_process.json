        "intended_behavior": "The method should ensure the custom analyzer is applied correctly to inputs, irrespective of the 'input' type. If a custom analyzer is provided, it must be integrated into the processing of documents, whether the input consists of direct text content, filenames, or file objects. This may involve adjusting the preliminary processing steps within 'fit_transform' or ensuring that any upstream methods (such as those preparing the documents based on the 'input' type) correctly pass documents in a form that the custom analyzer can process. The solution may require a check or modification to ensure the analyzer's logic is executed as intended for all types of input."
