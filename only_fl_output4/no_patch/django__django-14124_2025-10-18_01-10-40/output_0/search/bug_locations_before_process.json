        "intended_behavior": "The `_check_custom_error_handlers` method should be updated to correctly handle class-based views as custom error handlers. This involves adjusting the method to recognize class-based views (which inherently include a `self` parameter when instantiated) and validate them appropriately. The specific changes needed include: Implementing a check to determine if a handler is a class-based view by inspecting if the handler is a class that inherits from Django's View class or checking if `handler.__module__ + '.' + handler.__qualname__` points to a class-based view. Adjusting the validation logic to account for the `self` parameter in class-based views, meaning when a class-based view is detected, the method should understand that the `self` parameter is implicit and not count it against the expected parameters (i.e., for `handler500`, it should only expect the `request` parameter). Ensuring that this new logic preserves the existing functionality for function-based views, which means function-based views should still be validated based on the current expectations (`request, exception` for 400, 403, and 404 handlers, and `request` for 500 handlers). This modification ensures that users can set class-based views as error handlers without encountering SystemCheckErrors due to incorrect parameter counts while maintaining the expected checks for function-based views."
