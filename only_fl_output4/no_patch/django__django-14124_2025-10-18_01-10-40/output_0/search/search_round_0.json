The signature variable in this function is expected to match (request, exception) for all handlers except for handler500 which is expected to have only (request). A positional argument, template_name is also present.\nWhile using class based views, we get two positional arguments (self, request) and then it recieves *args and * *kwargs. The check is permitting other handlers as the number of arguments coincidentally match.\nI suggest a fix in the _check_custom_error_handlers which first checks if the handler* are function based or class based, and then it preceed the check with the appropriate number of arguments.\n</issue>"

This will help us verify the described behavior and how class-based view signatures are validated. Since the issue mentions that this method expects different signatures for `handler500` versus other handlers, reviewing its implementation is crucial. \n\nGiven the information, it seems pertinent to:\n\n1. Search for the method `_check_custom_error_handlers` in the codebase to understand its current implementation.\n2. Look into how Django differentiates between function-based views and class-based views, especially in the context of error handlers.\n\nLet's proceed with these actions:\n\n- search_method(\"_check_custom_error_handlers\")"
