        "intended_behavior": "Implement an `__iter__` method within the Paginator class. This new method will make Paginator objects directly iterable, enhancing their usability and making the interface conform more closely to Python's iteration protocol. The `__iter__` method should leverage the existing `page_range` to iterate through all the pages, yielding each page in turn. Essentially, the method would allow users to iterate over pages in a Paginator object without needing to explicitly call or iterate over `page_range`, thus maintaining existing functionality while providing an improved, more intuitive interface."
