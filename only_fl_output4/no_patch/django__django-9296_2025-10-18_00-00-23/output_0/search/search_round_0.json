It would be more logical and naturel to use the normal python of doing that by implementing the iter function like that:\ndef __iter__(self):\nfor page_num in self.page_range:\nyield self.page(page_num)\n</issue>"

        "content": "To resolve the issue regarding the lack of an `__iter__` function in the Paginator class which affects the natural way of iterating over Paginator objects in Python, we'll focus on identifying the relevant parts of the codebase. Here's how we'll proceed:\n\n1. **Find the Paginator class**: To understand how the Paginator class is currently implemented and to see if there's any existing iterator functionality that we might extend or modify.\n\n2. **Locate the `page_range` method within the Paginator class**: Since the issue description mentions using `page_range` for iteration, we need to understand its current implementation to ensure that adding `__iter__` complements rather than conflicts with existing functionality.\n\n3. **Search for any existing `__iter__` implementations in the Paginator class**: It\u2019s necessary to check if there's an `__iter__` method already, either incomplete or improperly implemented, which requires modification.\n\nBased on these objectives, I'll make the following API calls:\n- search_class(\"Paginator\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"page_range\", \"Paginator\")\n- search_method_in_class(\"__iter__\", \"Paginator\")"
