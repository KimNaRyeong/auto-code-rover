Now widget['attrs']['id'] contains the \"id\" we would like to use when rendering the label of our CheckboxSelectMultiple.\nHowever BoundWidget.id_for_label() is implemented as\nclass BoundWidget:\n...\ndef id_for_label(self):\nreturn 'id_%s_%s' % (self.data['name'], self.data['index'])\nignoring the id available through self.data['attrs']['id']. This re-implementation for rendering the \"id\" is confusing and presumably not intended. Nobody has probably realized that so far, because rarely the auto_id-argument is overridden when initializing a form. If however we do, one would assume that the method BoundWidget.id_for_label renders that string as specified through the auto_id format-string.\nBy changing the code from above to\nclass BoundWidget:\n...\ndef id_for_label(self):\nreturn self.data['attrs']['id']\nthat function behaves as expected.\nPlease note that this error only occurs when rendering the subwidgets of a widget of type CheckboxSelectMultiple. This has nothing to do with the method BoundField.id_for_label().\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue, I would invoke the following search API calls:\n\n1. Search the `BoundField` class to understand its responsibilities and implementation since the issue description starts with the implementation of `BoundField.subwidgets`. This can give us insight into how `BoundField` interacts with `BoundWidget` and `ChoiceWidget.options`.\n   - `search_class(\"BoundField\")`\n\n2. Search the `BoundWidget` class to gain a deep understanding of its structure and to see the current implementation of `id_for_label`, which is the primary concern in this issue.\n   - `search_class(\"BoundWidget\")`\n\n3. Since the issue mentions the handling of `subwidgets` in `BoundField` leads to problems in `BoundWidget`, particularly with `CheckboxSelectMultiple`, it would be prudent to find the implementation of `subwidgets` method or related code that handles the `subwidgets` within these classes.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"subwidgets\", \"BoundField\")`\n\n4. Check for the implementation or usage of `CheckboxSelectMultiple` to understand how it's related to `BoundField` and `BoundWidget`, and how the `id` attribute is expected to behave.\n   - `search_class(\"CheckboxSelectMultiple\")`\n\n5. Lastly, it would be useful to search for any explicit references or code snippets where `attrs['id']` is set or used, particularly in relation to `BoundWidget` or within the context of rendering subwidgets, as mentioned in the issue.\n   - `search_code(\"attrs['id']\")`\n\nThese calls will provide a comprehensive context around the structures and behaviors of the involved classes and methods, as well as how they are supposed to handle `id` attributes, especially within the scenario presented in the issue."
