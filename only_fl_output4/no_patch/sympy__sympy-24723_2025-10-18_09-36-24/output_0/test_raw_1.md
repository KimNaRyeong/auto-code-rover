Given the feedback that the previous approach did not successfully reproduce the issue due to a type error in the test, let's correct the script to better align with the goal of reproducing the mentioned issue with the probability density function (PDF) of the Matrix Normal Distribution in Sympy.

This updated version tries to directly compare the output from Sympy's density function for a MatrixNormal distribution against an explicitly crafted expected expression that correctly represents the PDF as per the provided information. It assumes the presence of the problem is indicated by a mismatch between these expressions, especially focusing on the denominator concerning \(2\pi\).

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def reproduce_issue():
    from sympy import MatrixSymbol, pi, exp, symbols, Matrix, trace
    from sympy.stats import density, MatrixNormal

    M = MatrixNormal('M', Matrix([[1, 2]]), Matrix([[1]]), Matrix([[1, 0], [0, 1]]))
    X = MatrixSymbol('X', 1, 2)
    d = density(M)(X).doit()

    # Define symbols for comparison
    mu = Matrix([[1, 2]])
    Sigma = Matrix([[1]])
    U = Matrix([[1, 0], [0, 1]])

    # Expected expression for the PDF
    n, m = X.shape
    expected_pdf = exp(-trace((X - mu).T * U.inv() * (X - mu) * Sigma.inv())/2) / ((2*pi)**(n*m/2) * sqrt(Sigma.det())**(n) * sqrt(U.det())**(m))

    # Assert that the density expression matches the expected PDF
    try:
        assert d.equals(expected_pdf), "PDF formula does not match the expected expression."
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise SystemExit(1)

try:
    reproduce_issue()
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise SystemExit(1)
else:
    print("The issue is fixed.")
    SystemExit(0)
```

This script explicitly checks whether the calculated PDF from Sympy's `density(M)(X).doit()` matches the manually constructed expected expression derived from the mathematical formula for the Matrix Normal Distribution's PDF. If any part, specifically the normalization constant, does not match as expected, the script raises an `AssertionError` and exits with code 1. If the expressions match (indicating the issue with the PDF is fixed), it prints a confirmation message and exits with code 0.
