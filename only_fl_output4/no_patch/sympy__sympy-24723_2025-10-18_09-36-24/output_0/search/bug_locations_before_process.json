        "intended_behavior": "The code snippet within `MatrixNormal` shows how the density function is calculated and specifically how the PDF is computed for a Matrix Normal distribution instance. The problem lies in the constant factor applied to the exponential function within the PDF equation. To resolve the issue, the constant in the PDF's calculation must be corrected to accurately reflect the mathematical definition of the Matrix Normal distribution's PDF. The issue points out that the current implementation effectively uses `2*exp(...)/pi`, which is an incorrect representation. According to the issue description and the linked Wikipedia page for the Matrix Normal distribution, the correct PDF calculation should involve a single exponential divided by the product of `2*pi` for the one-dimensional case, adjusting for dimensions accordingly. Therefore, the exponential's constant and the denominator must be adjusted to match this definition. This likely involves correcting the factor in front of the exponential function and ensuring the denominator correctly uses `2*pi` for one-dimensional cases, and appropriately generalizes for multi-dimensional cases. The existing functionality for calculating the density must be preserved, ensuring that any changes maintain the correct computational behavior for various input parameters, not just the example given in the issue description. The adjustment should be universally correct for any instance of a `MatrixNormal` distribution."
