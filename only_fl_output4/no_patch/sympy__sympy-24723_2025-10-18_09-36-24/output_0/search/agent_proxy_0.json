First, locate the `MatrixNormal` class, as it's directly mentioned in the issue with respect to initializing the distribution.\n   - `search_class(\"MatrixNormal\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions the calculation (doit) of the PDF which yields an incorrect constant, it's necessary to explore the `density` function related to `MatrixNormal`.\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"density\", \"MatrixNormal\")`\n\n3. The issue points out a discrepancy in the expected PDF calculation for a Matrix Normal Distribution. So, looking for the PDF calculation part in the code, which involves the `density` and potentially an incorrect constant, is crucial.\n   - `search_code(\"density(M)(X).doit()\")`\n\nThese steps should provide enough context from the codebase to understand where the bug might be located and which parts of the code need to be reviewed for a patch."
