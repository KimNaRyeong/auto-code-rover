It calculates the density for another type of distribution (`MatrixGamma`) but the structure and approach might be similar for `MatrixNormal`.\n- The relationship to the bug is indirect; yet, understanding this part can help in grasming how Sympy implements the `.doit()` method for PDF calculations in matrix distributions.\n- The intended behavior in this context (for the `MatrixGamma` distribution) is to correctly calculate the PDF according to its mathematical definition. This parallels what `MatrixNormal` should achieve: an accurate PDF calculation.\n\n#### Search Result 2: `MatrixNormal`\n- This is directly related to the issue. It shows the implementation of `density(M)(X).doit()` for a `MatrixNormal` distribution. The calculation provided here includes an expression for the PDF.\n- The snippet is crucial for understanding the bug as it directly includes the incorrect PDF calculation mentioned in the issue. According to the issue, the constant in front of the `exp` function and its division by `pi` is incorrect.\n- The intended behavior, as per the issue description, is to adjust the PDF calculation such that the constant matches the correct form according to the Matrix Normal distribution's definition. Specifically, it seems the reduction to `2*exp(...)/pi` should instead adhere to a form that correctly represents the constant as `exp(...)/(2*pi)` for the given parameters.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the relationship between the snippet and the bug, it's evident that the PDF calculation for `MatrixNormal` needs to be corrected to match its mathematical definition accurately. Specifically, attention should be focused on adjusting the constant in the PDF expression to reflect the correct mathematical formula as per the issue description.\n\nTo further proceed, examining the definition of the `density` function within the `MatrixNormal` context and any auxiliary methods or functions it uses for the PDF calculation would be beneficial. Additionally, it might be useful to verify if any constants or factors applied in this calculation are defined elsewhere in the code that could be affecting the output incorrectly.\n\nPossible actions include:\n- Reviewing the mathematical operations and constants used in the PDF calculation within `sympy/stats/matrix_distributions.py` for `MatrixNormal`.\n- Verifying any related documentation or comments in the source code that describe how the PDF should be calculated, to ensure the fix aligns with the intended implementation.\n- Making API calls to explore the `density` function definition and any other helper functions or constants `MatrixNormal` might use from `matrix_distributions.py` or related files."

The problem lies in the constant factor applied to the exponential function within the PDF equation.\n  - To resolve the issue, the constant in the PDF's calculation must be corrected to accurately reflect the mathematical definition of the Matrix Normal distribution's PDF. The issue points out that the current implementation effectively uses `2*exp(...)/pi`, which is an incorrect representation. According to the issue description and the linked Wikipedia page for the Matrix Normal distribution, the correct PDF calculation should involve a single exponential divided by the product of `2*pi` for the one-dimensional case, adjusting for dimensions accordingly.\n  - Therefore, the exponential's constant and the denominator must be adjusted to match this definition. This likely involves correcting the factor in front of the exponential function and ensuring the denominator correctly uses `2*pi` for one-dimensional cases, and appropriately generalizes for multi-dimensional cases.\n  - The existing functionality for calculating the density must be preserved, ensuring that any changes maintain the correct computational behavior for various input parameters, not just the example given in the issue description. The adjustment should be universally correct for any instance of a `MatrixNormal` distribution.\n"
