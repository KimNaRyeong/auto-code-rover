Given the task and constraints, we'll focus on reproducing the issue with the PDF calculation for a MatrixNormal distribution in Sympy. We'll check if the PDF calculation returns the expected constant as per the corrected formula.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    from sympy import MatrixSymbol, pi, exp
    from sympy.stats import density, MatrixNormal
    
    # Initialize a simple MatrixNormal Distribution as per issue description
    M = MatrixNormal('M', [[1, 2]], [1], [[1, 0], [0, 1]])
    X = MatrixSymbol('X', 1, 2)
    d = density(M)(X).doit()
    
    # Expected constant in denominator of PDF is supposed to be 2*pi, not pi
    expected_constant = 2*pi
    
    # Checking if the constant part of the output is as expected
    # Note: This is a simplified approach, assuming the issue is specifically 
    # about the constant and the expression structure doesn't change dramatically.
    if expected_constant not in d.args:
        raise AssertionError("The PDF does not contain the expected constant.")
    
try:
    main()
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise SystemExit(1)
except Exception as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    raise SystemExit(1)
else:
    print("The issue is fixed.")
    SystemExit(0)
```

This python script, when executed, attempts to reproduce the issue with Sympy's calculation of the Matrix Normal Distribution's PDF. It specifically looks for the expected constant in the output and raises an AssertionError if it's not present, assuming this means it's incorrect as described in the issue. If the script encounters any other exception, it prints the stack trace for that exception. If there are no exceptions and the constant is as expected, it concludes the issue is fixed.
