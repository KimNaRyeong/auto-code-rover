This script aims to reproduce the reported issue by creating a MatrixNormal distribution and calculating its density. It then extracts the constant part from the PDF and compares it to the expected constant that includes the correct \(2\pi\) term in the denominator. If the constants do not match, it raises an `AssertionError` and prints the stack trace, indicating the issue is present. If the constants match, it indicates the issue is fixed.
