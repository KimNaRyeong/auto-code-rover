Here's an updated version of the `reproducer.py` script based on the details you've provided and the goal to have a script exit with code 0 when the issue is resolved, and to raise an `AssertionError` with a detailed stack trace, using your `print_stacktrace` function, when the in-place addition issue is encountered:

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def test_inplace_addition():
    import numpy as np
    import xarray as xr

    n = 5

    d1 = np.arange(n)
    np.random.shuffle(d1)
    A = xr.DataArray(np.ones(n), coords=[('dim', d1)])

    d2 = np.arange(n)
    np.random.shuffle(d2)
    B = xr.DataArray(np.ones(n), coords=[('dim', d2)])

    try:
        A += B  # This is the operation that is expected to work
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise AssertionError("In-place addition failed when it should succeed.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_inplace_addition()
    print("In-place addition succeeded.")
```

This script adheres to the instructions given, with modifications to ensure it works correctly for the goal of producing a clear outcome regarding the in-place addition issue. When you run this script in the context of your project, it's designed to directly test the key operation causing the issue and provide detailed feedback if the error occurs. However, if the operation succeeds without any exceptions, it indicates the absence of the initially reported issue, and the script will simply print a success message.
