        "intended_behavior": "This method should incorporate a strategy to align `DataArray` indices when performing in-place operations if the indices have the same elements but are ordered differently. The function should attempt to reorder `other` based on `self`'s index order before performing the operation, or more explicitly check if the operation can be safely performed with existing indices and provide a user-friendly error or warning if alignment cannot be achieved automatically. This would preserve the existing functionality while addressing the issue of in-place addition with differently ordered indices."

        "intended_behavior": "Enhance the logic to either better handle the merging of differently ordered but compatible indices, or provide a clear and actionable error message guiding the user on how to pre-align their `DataArray` indices before attempting an in-place operation. The goal would be to allow for seamless merging where possible, or at the least, inform the user of the necessary steps to take to avoid the `MergeError`, hence maintaining the robustness and usability of the library."
