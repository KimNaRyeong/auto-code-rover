        "intended_behavior": "Update the `rm_rf` method to support the change in Python 3.12 alpha by replacing the `shutil.rmtree` usage with the `onerror` parameter to use `onexc` parameter instead. This update must ensure that the method continues to remove paths recursively, handling read-only files or permission errors without causing `DeprecationWarning` in Python 3.12, preserving compatibility with previous Python versions if necessary. This may involve conditionally checking the Python version and deciding which parameter to use or abstracting the error handling in a way compatible with both pre- and post-deprecation environments."

        "method": "addDuration",
        "intended_behavior": "Implement a new method `addDuration` in the `TestCaseFunction` class. This method should record the duration of test execution. The implementation must ensure that `TestCaseFunction` can accept and correctly handle duration data without impacting its integration with the `unittest` framework. The method should meet the expectations of Python 3.12's test result protocol, which requires this method for test result objects, thereby preventing warnings or errors due to its absence when tests are run under Python 3.12 with warnings treated as errors. This method should also not interfere with the existing functionalities of the `TestCaseFunction` class or disrupt tests running under versions of Python earlier than 3.12."
