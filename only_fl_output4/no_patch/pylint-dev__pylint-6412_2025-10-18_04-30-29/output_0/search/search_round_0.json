        "content": "To start addressing the issue detailed in the description, we need to gather more context about the current implementation of checker and reporter categorization within the PyLinter codebase, as well as how the `ABCMeta` introduction could impact existing structures. Given the description, we will likely need to understand the current implementation of both the `PyLinter` class and any relevant checker or reporter interface classes. We also need to know how the `__implements__` attribute is currently used.\n\nI will perform the following API calls to gather the necessary code context:\n\n1. Search for the `PyLinter` class to understand its implementation, especially how it currently categorizes checkers and reporters.\n   - `search_class(\"PyLinter\")`\n\n2. Search for any mention of the `__implements__` attribute to see how it is currently used to categorize checkers and reporters.\n   - `search_code(\"__implements__\")`\n\n3. Since the proposal includes changing interfaces to use `ABCMeta` as a metaclass, it's important to identify these interface classes. However, without specific names, it's challenging to directly search for them. We can start by finding any current usage of `ABCMeta`, which might point us towards interface definitions or patterns to follow for this proposal.\n   - `search_code(\"ABCMeta\")`\n\nThese API calls will provide an initial context around the current implementation and the potential classes and code structures that the proposal would impact."
