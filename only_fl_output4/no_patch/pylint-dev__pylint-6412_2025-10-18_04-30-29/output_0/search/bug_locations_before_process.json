        "method": "register_checker, register_reporter, _load_reporters",
        "intended_behavior": "These methods should be adjusted to leverage `isinstance` for determining if a given checker or reporter fulfills the interface requirements, which now should be defined using abstract base classes created with `ABCMeta`. The code should maintain compatibility with existing plugins using `__implements__`, but prefer `isinstance` checks for future development. This means adding additional logic to these methods to perform `isinstance` checks against the new ABCs that represent valid checkers and reporters. This makes plugin development more in line with standard Python practices."
