        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving the issue regarding the \"Admin date_hierarchy filter by month displays an extra day at timezone boundary\" in a Django-like admin interface, we need to focus primarily on the code managing the date hierarchy filter, especially in relation to timezone handling. Below are the API calls that would help gather the needed context:\n\n1. Search for classes or methods that might be directly involved in handling or rendering the date hierarchy filters. Assuming a Django-like environment, we can start by looking for a class that could be managing these admin filters.\n   ```\n   search_class(\"SimpleListFilter\")\n   ```\n   ```\n   search_class(\"DateFieldListFilter\")\n   ```\n\n2. Since the issue specifically mentions issues at the timezone boundary, it's crucial to investigate any code that deals with timezones. Django typically uses timezone-aware datetime objects under the hood, so let's search for methods that might be handling the conversion or filtering based on time zones.\n   ```\n   search_method(\"get_timezone\")\n   ```\n   ```\n   search_code(\"timezone.now()\")\n   ```\n\n3. Given that the issue seems to affect the calculation or display of dates in the admin filter, it would be useful to look directly at any method that could be responsible for fetching or filtering dates for the admin interface.\n   ```\n   search_method(\"date_hierarchy\")\n   ```\n   ```\n   search_code(\"date_hierarchy\")\n   ```\n\n4. Assuming that we might need to patch or understand the filtering logic that includes date boundary calculation, let's search for relevant methods that directly involve date boundary processing. This might involve internal logic for determining the start and end of months in a timezone-aware manner.\n   ```\n   search_code(\"timedelta\")\n   ```\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"get_previous_month\", \"DateFieldListFilter\")\n   ```\n   ```\n   search_method_in_class(\"get_next_month\", \"DateFieldListFilter\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches are designed to locate the relevant portions of the codebase where the issue could originate from and provide enough context to start drafting a patch. By focusing on class definitions, method implementations, and specific code fragments related to date handling and timezone effects, we should be able to collect the necessary information to address the reported issue accurately."
