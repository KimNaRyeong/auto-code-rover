        "intended_behavior": "The intended behavior would involve ensuring that all date range calculations within `DateFieldListFilter` accurately account for the user's timezone. This would specifically affect how the start and end dates of months are determined, ensuring that no additional days from the previous or following months are included due to timezone offsets. This could necessitate adding new utility methods within `DateFieldListFilter` to handle timezone-aware date range calculations or adjusting existing logic to correctly interpret and apply timezone offsets when filtering dates. Implementing or updating methods to explicitly consider the timezone when calculating month boundaries would preserve and enhance the existing functionality by providing accurate date filtering across different time zones."
