        "content": "<issue>Avoid passing NULL to the IN lookup\nDescription\nCurrently prefetch_related on a FK passes the NULL through to the database for e.g. author_id IN (NULL, 2). Passing NULL is always unnecessary, since it's not allowed in FK's. There's a small risk from passing NULL that it could lead to incorrect with complex prefetch querysets using PK refs because of NULL's weirdness in SQL.\nFor example with these models:\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Author(models.Model):\npass\nclass Book(models.Model):\nauthor = models.ForeignKey(Author, null=True, on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING)\nPrefetching authors on Books, when at least one Book has author=None, uses IN (..., NULL, ...) in the query:\nIn [1]: from example.core.models import Author, Book\nIn [2]: a1 = Author.objects.create()\nIn [3]: Book.objects.create(author=a1)\nOut[3]: <Book: Book object (3)>\nIn [4]: Book.objects.create(author=None)\nOut[4]: <Book: Book object (4)>\nIn [5]: Book.objects.prefetch_related('author')\nOut[5]: <QuerySet [<Book: Book object (3)>, <Book: Book object (4)>]>\nIn [6]: from django.db import connection\nIn [7]: connection.queries\nOut[7]:\n[{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_author\" (\"id\") VALUES (NULL)', 'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_book\" (\"author_id\") VALUES (2)', 'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'INSERT INTO \"core_book\" (\"author_id\") VALUES (NULL)',\n'time': '0.001'},\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"core_book\".\"id\", \"core_book\".\"author_id\" FROM \"core_book\" LIMIT 21',\n'time': '0.000'},\n{'sql': 'SELECT \"core_author\".\"id\" FROM \"core_author\" WHERE \"core_author\".\"id\" IN (NULL, 2)',\n'time': '0.000'}]\nMaybe this could generally be extended to use of __in with non-nullable fields?\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather more information about how the prefetch_related and related query generation for ForeignKey fields are handled within the Django codebase. Specifically, we're interested in the part of the code that constructs the IN query for prefetching related objects, including handling of NULL values in ForeignKeys. Given the context of the issue, here are the API calls we need to make:\n\n1. Search for the `ForeignKey` class definition to understand how it is designed and potentially get hints on where the prefetch logic might be implemented.\n```python\nsearch_class(\"ForeignKey\")\n```\n\n2. Search for the method that handles the `prefetch_related` functionality. This is because the issue specifically mentions the IN query construction happening during the use of `prefetch_related`.\n```python\nsearch_method(\"prefetch_related\")\n```\n\n3. Since the issue involves generating IN queries that include NULL values, we need to find the exact place in the code where the query is constructed. It's probable this happens in a method associated with fetching or preparing the query for execution.\n```python\nsearch_method(\"get_prefetch_queryset\")\n```\n\n4. The issue suggests a potential area of improvement is in filtering out NULL values from the IN clause for non-nullable fields. Thus, understanding how __in lookups are constructed can also be beneficial.\n```python\nsearch_method(\"build_filter\")\n```\n\n5. Lastly, assuming the logic that needs to be altered might reside in a ORM query construction module, a search for code snippets directly incorporating `__in` might highlight useful sections to consider for the patch.\n```python\nsearch_code(\"__in\")\n```\n\nCompleting these searches should provide a comprehensive background to address the issue by identifying where modifications are necessary to exclude NULL values from IN queries involving ForeignKey fields in prefetch_related operations."
