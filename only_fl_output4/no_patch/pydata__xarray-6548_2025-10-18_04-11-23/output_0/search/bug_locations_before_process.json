Preserving the existing functionality should include maintaining the method's ability to evaluate polynomials over a set of coordinates while ensuring it doesn't fail unexpectedly when encountering unnamed coordinates."

        "intended_behavior": "Given that get_clean_interp_index is where the absence of a name directly leads to a failure, this method should include a check for when dim (derived from coord.name) is None and either raise a more informative error message earlier in the process or implement logic to handle unnamed coordinates. This could involve defining a fallback mechanism where unnamed dimensions are either automatically named in a temporary context for the sake of computation or skipped with a warning, depending on what makes sense in the broader context of xarray's design philosophy."
