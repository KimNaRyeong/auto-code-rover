        "content": "Given the issue, it seems related to how Sphinx processes file paths, particularly those involved in directives like `:download:` which may result in duplicate files for what essentially is the same resource when referred in different ways. To address this issue, gathering context around the code responsible for processing these directives, normalizing paths, and handling file downloads or references in Sphinx is crucial. \n\nHere are the API calls that would be helpful:\n\n1. **Search for code that processes `:download:` directive**: This can provide insight into how Sphinx handles file references in directives.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_code(\":download:`\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Search for methods that might be involved in building or copying files to the `_downloads` directory**: This could help identify where the duplication might occur.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_method(\"copy_asset_files\")\n   search_method(\"build_finished\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for code snippets that deal with path normalization**: Since the issue suggests missing normalization, looking for existing normalization logic can be informative.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_code(\"os.path.normpath\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Look into the Sphinx Builder class or relevant classes**: Since the building of HTML and handling of resources like downloads would be managed by the build process, finding relevant classes can give a broader context.\n\n   ```python\n   search_class(\"Builder\")\n   search_method_in_class(\"write_doc\", \"Builder\")\n   ```\n\nThese searches aim to uncover how Sphinx processes directives that include file references, how it handles asset copying during the build phase, and whether path normalization is applied anywhere in this process. Insights from these searches can guide the next steps in crafting a patch to ensure Sphinx correctly handles multiple references to the same file without treating them as duplicates."
