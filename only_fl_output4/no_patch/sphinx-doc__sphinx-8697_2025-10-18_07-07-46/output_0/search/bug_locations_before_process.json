        "intended_behavior": "A new method, let\u2019s name it normalize_path, should be introduced in the Builder class. This method should take a file path as an input and apply path normalization to it using os.path.normpath or a similar approach. The method should handle various inputs, such as absolute paths, relative paths, and paths with mixed separators (UNIX and Windows), to produce a consistent, canonical form of the path. This normalization should occur before any file-related operations, such as copying or linking files, to ensure that duplicate files are not created for the same resource. This functionality is intended to preserve existing features while preventing the creation of duplicate files from different references to the same file."

        "intended_behavior": "Within methods that handle writing to the file system or processing output files (e.g., write_doc, post_process_images), ensure that the normalize_path method is called for any file paths before proceeding with their processing. This ensures that all paths are consistently normalized, reducing the chance of duplicates due to differing path references. This adjustment preserves the method's ability to process and output files appropriately while ensuring that the same resource referenced in varying ways is treated as identical, thus avoiding duplicate file creation in the output directory."
