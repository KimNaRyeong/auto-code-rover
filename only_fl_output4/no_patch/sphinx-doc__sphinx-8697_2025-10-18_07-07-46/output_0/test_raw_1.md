Based on the issue's complex nature involving Sphinx documentation builds and handling of file references, creating a reproducer that directly interacts with Sphinx and filesystem operations to trigger and verify the specific issue described is essential. The revised `reproducer.py` below aims to recreate the original issue within a Sphinx project, and it will validate if the issue of generating duplicate files from singular references persists. If the problem is detected, it will raise an `AssertionError` and provide a detailed stack trace. If the script identifies the issue has been rectified, it will gracefully exit with code 0, indicating success without errors.

```python
import os
import traceback
import shutil
import subprocess
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def setup_sphinx_project():
    project_dir = "sphinx_test_project"
    source_dir = os.path.join(project_dir, "source")
    build_dir = os.path.join(project_dir, "build")
    download_dir = os.path.join(source_dir, "document", "downloads")
    os.makedirs(download_dir, exist_ok=True)
    
    with open(os.path.join(source_dir, 'conf.py'), 'w') as f:
        f.write("project = 'TestDupFiles'\n")
        
    index_rst_content = """

    with open(os.path.join(source_dir, 'index.rst'), 'w') as f:
        f.write(index_rst_content)
    
    with open(os.path.join(download_dir, 'archive.zip'), 'wb') as f:
        f.write(b"Test content")

    return project_dir, source_dir, build_dir

    shutil.rmtree(project_dir, ignore_errors=True)

    downloads_dir = os.path.join(build_dir, "_downloads")

    if not os.path.isdir(downloads_dir):
        raise FileNotFoundError("Downloads directory not found.")
    files = os.listdir(downloads_dir)
    if not len(files) == 1 or not files[0].startswith(expected_single_file):
        raise AssertionError("Duplicate files detected. Issue not resolved.")
    print("No duplicates found. Issue likely resolved.")

try:
    project_dir, source_dir, build_dir = setup_sphinx_project()
    
    # Execute the build (assuming Sphinx is installed and accessible)
    process = subprocess.run(
        ["sphinx-build", "-b", "html", source_dir, build_dir],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True
    )
    
    if process.returncode != 0:
        raise Exception("Sphinx build failed", process.stdout, process.stderr)
    
    assert_duplicate_files(build_dir)

This script encapsulates the creation of a simple Sphinx project including the `conf.py` and `index.rst` files, and then invokes the Sphinx build process on this project. It specifically checks for the duplication issue in the `_downloads` directory of the build output. Given the issue's specificity and the reliance on the Sphinx build process, make sure you have Sphinx installed (`pip install sphinx`) and properly configured in your environment for this script to function as intended.

It is critical to adapt and verify the effectiveness of such a reproducer, as the behavior of tools like Sphinx and their interaction with the filesystem can vary with versions and operating environments. This script is tailored to closely replicate the issue within its original context, with the provision of catching and detailing errors related to the issue at hand.
