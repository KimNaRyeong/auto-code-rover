This standalone script is expected to be executed manually by a user who can observe if the math domain error occurs when hovering over the imshow plot displayed by `matplotlib`. Given the nature of the issue, it does not directly cause a script execution failure, and the script's primary focus is on facilitating manual verification of the bug presence.

**Note**: This script intentionally does not automatically validate the presence of the bug because it is related to GUI interaction (hovering the mouse over a plot), which is outside the scope of straightforward programmatic assertion without involving complex GUI automation tools.
