        "intended_behavior": "The `__str__` method needs to be adjusted to handle the whitespace between the column name and its suffix more accurately. Specifically, when appending `col_suffixes[idx]` to a column name, the method should check if the suffix is not just an empty string but a meaningful character sequence (e.g., 'DESC' for descending order, opclass names) that requires a preceding space for correct syntax. In cases where the suffix is an empty string, implying no specific ordering or opclass, it should not add an additional space. This change would ensure that the generated SQL statements maintain their syntactical correctness while also being formatted properly, addressing both highlighted issues without affecting scenarios where the current behavior is correct (e.g., descending orders where a space is necessary)."
