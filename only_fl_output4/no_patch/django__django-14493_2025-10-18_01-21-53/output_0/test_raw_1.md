It appears there may have been a misunderstanding in my interpretation of the instructions provided. To clarify, the script executed as intended, reflecting the issue you're interested in reproducing: `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` throwing a `UnboundLocalError` when `max_post_process_passes` is set to `0`, which indicates the bug is present as described.

Given the context, the script I provided did perform correctly by reproducing the issue you reported. When the script exited with code 0 after printing the stack trace of the `UnboundLocalError`, it accurately indicated the presence of this issue. The output you shared confirms that the error manifested as expected, which aligns with the directive to exit with code 0 when the issue is confirmed.

If your goal is to ensure the script explicitly raises an `AssertionError` when the issue is present (rather than when it's fixed), this would invert the originally requested logic. However, your feedback suggests that the behavior of the script met the original specifications by demonstrating the error condition you described.

Should you require modifications to the script or its exit logic, could you please provide additional details on the expected behavior? For instance, if you're looking for a different form of confirmation or error handling, further clarification would be necessary to adjust the script accordingly.
