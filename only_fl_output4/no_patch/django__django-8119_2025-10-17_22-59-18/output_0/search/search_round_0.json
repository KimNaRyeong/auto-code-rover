        "content": "To address the issue related to allowing expressions in `.filter()` calls, it's important to understand how the `.filter()` method is currently implemented and where it's used within the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer. Given the nature of the enhancement, focusing on the classes and methods that handle query construction, execution, and the definition of `.filter()` itself would be critical.\n\nThe following API calls would provide the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for `.filter()` method in the ORM:** This involves understanding how `.filter()` is currently implemented, which class or classes define it, and how it processes its arguments. Since `.filter()` is a commonly used method in Django's ORM (assuming Django's context based on the description), we would start by locating this method to see its current capabilities and parameters.\n\n   - `search_method(\"filter\")`\n\n2. **Search for the class that implements `.filter()`:** Once the method is located, understanding the class that defines it will offer insights into how it can be extended or modified to support expressions. This step assumes that `.filter()` might be defined in a class that handles query sets or query construction.\n\n   - Since the specific class name is not known at this stage, the outcome of the previous call should inform this step. However, Django's ORM commonly involves classes like `QuerySet` or similar.\n\n3. **Search for usage of `.filter()` to see if expressions are already handled in some way:** This helps to identify any existing patterns or utilities that might affect or aid the implementation of this feature.\n\n   - `search_code(\".filter(\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how `.filter()` works within the context of the project's ORM, potential starting points for extending its capabilities, and any existing infrastructure that might support or conflict with the proposed feature."
