Given the nature of the enhancement, focusing on the classes and methods that handle query construction, execution, and the definition of `.filter()` itself would be critical.\n\nThe following API calls would provide the necessary context:\n\n1. **Search for `.filter()` method in the ORM:** This involves understanding how `.filter()` is currently implemented, which class or classes define it, and how it processes its arguments. Since `.filter()` is a commonly used method in Django's ORM (assuming Django's context based on the description), we would start by locating this method to see its current capabilities and parameters.\n\n   - `search_method(\"filter\")`\n\n2. **Search for the class that implements `.filter()`:** Once the method is located, understanding the class that defines it will offer insights into how it can be extended or modified to support expressions. This step assumes that `.filter()` might be defined in a class that handles query sets or query construction.\n\n   - Since the specific class name is not known at this stage, the outcome of the previous call should inform this step. However, Django's ORM commonly involves classes like `QuerySet` or similar.\n\n3. **Search for usage of `.filter()` to see if expressions are already handled in some way:** This helps to identify any existing patterns or utilities that might affect or aid the implementation of this feature.\n\n   - `search_code(\".filter(\")`\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of how `.filter()` works within the context of the project's ORM, potential starting points for extending its capabilities, and any existing infrastructure that might support or conflict with the proposed feature."

        "content": "Given the results from the API calls, let's break down and analyze the findings to better understand the current implementation and how it relates to the issue at hand.\n\n### Analysis of `search_method(\"filter\")` Results\n\nFrom the method search results, `django/db/models/query.py` is the most relevant file, as it's where Django's ORM query functionalities, such as `.filter()`, are likely to be defined. This file is directly related to the issue because it's where modifications will need to be made to allow expressions in `.filter()` calls.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?** - The methods named \"filter\" within `django/db/models/query.py` are responsible for filtering querysets based on given parameters. This functionality is core to Django's ORM, allowing developers to retrieve records from the database that meet specified criteria.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?** - These methods are directly related to the enhancement request. Currently, `.filter()` may not support complex expressions directly (like the example given with `.lower()`), which is something that needs to be enhanced based on the issue description.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?** - The intended behavior would be to modify the `.filter()` method so that it can understand and correctly interpret expressions, not just simple keyword arguments. This would involve parsing these expressions and translating them into the appropriate SQL or database queries.\n\n### Analysis of `search_code(\".filter(\")` Results\n\nThe search for snippets containing `.filter(` across various files shows a widespread use of this method throughout Django's codebase. This demonstrates how vital and integral `.filter()` is to Django's operation and the importance of maintaining backward compatibility and integrity when making changes to such a foundational method.\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?** - These snippets showcase different uses of the `.filter()` method, from filtering database records in views, models, and administration, to templates and form handling. It highlights the flexibility and importance of `.filter()` in Django's ecosystem.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?** - These snippets provide context on how `.filter()` is currently used, which would be essential in ensuring that any changes made to support expressions do not break existing functionality. It's also valuable for identifying potential patterns or utility functions that could be adapted or extended to support the new feature.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?** - In light of the requested feature, these parts of the code offer insight into ensuring that the ability to use expressions in `.filter()` calls integrates seamlessly with existing uses of `.filter()`. The intended behavior would involve allowing more complex queries to be constructed in a manner that feels natural to Django developers and is consistent with the current API design.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nGiven this analysis:\n\n- It's essential to further inspect `django/db/models/query.py` to understand the current implementation of `.filter()`. Specifically, we might need the actual code of the `.filter()` method to assess how it currently parses arguments and what modifications might support the inclusion of expressions.\n- Understanding how Django currently translates query parameters into SQL queries will also be crucial because supporting expressions implies a deeper level of parsing and translation than what simple key-value pairs require.\n- Evaluating any existing utilities within Django that facilitate the parsing and handling of more complex queries could offer a foundation for implementing this feature.\n\nIn conclusion, the next practical steps involve a closer examination and possibly refactoring of the `.filter()` method implementation in `django/db/models/query.py` to support the feature outlined in the issue."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

The modification must extend the method's capabilities to interpret these expressions correctly and convert them into the corresponding SQL where clauses without breaking the existing functionality for simple keyword arguments. The enhancement should enable third-party apps to create query syntax extensions, promoting a more unified and powerful ORM experience. This will likely involve implementing additional parsing logic to distinguish between simple keyword arguments and more complex expression arguments, as well as interfacing with Django's underlying query construction logic to accurately translate these expressions into SQL."
