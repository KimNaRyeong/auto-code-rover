        "intended_behavior": "This method needs to be enhanced to support parsing and interpreting expressions, such as `F('some_field').lower() == 'anssi'`, as valid filtering criteria. The modification must extend the method's capabilities to interpret these expressions correctly and convert them into the corresponding SQL where clauses without breaking the existing functionality for simple keyword arguments. The enhancement should enable third-party apps to create query syntax extensions, promoting a more unified and powerful ORM experience. This will likely involve implementing additional parsing logic to distinguish between simple keyword arguments and more complex expression arguments, as well as interfacing with Django's underlying query construction logic to accurately translate these expressions into SQL."
