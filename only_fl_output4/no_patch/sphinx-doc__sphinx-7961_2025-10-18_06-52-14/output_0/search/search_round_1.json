It would be great to get this into the Sphinx MathJax extension.\nThe [MathJax upgrading docs](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/v2.html#upgrading-from-v2-to-v3) suggest that it will not be trivial to upgrade, but it may be worth it given the performance and modularity improvements.

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context from the API results:\n\n### 1. Analysis of `MathJax.Hub.Config(` Code Snippet\n- **What does this part of the code do?**\n  This part of the code, found in `sphinx/ext/mathjax.py` within the `install_mathjax` function, is responsible for customizing the MathJax configuration. It dynamically builds a JavaScript configuration script for MathJax using settings from `app.config.mathjax_config` and adds this script to the Sphinx page being generated. The configuration is serialized to a string via `json.dumps()` and then inserted directly into the generated HTML as a `<script>` tag of type `\"text/x-mathjax-config\"`.\n\n- **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n  The mention of `MathJax.Hub.Config` is specific to MathJax 2.x's way of configuring MathJax. In MathJax 3.x, the configuration and initialization process has significantly changed, moving away from `MathJax.Hub` to using a more modular and promise-based approach for configuration and initialization. This code snippet signifies the part of the Sphinx extension that will most certainly need to be updated for MathJax 3.0 compatibility. The API, methods, and possibly the overall approach to initializing and configuring MathJax will need to be altered according to the new version's guidelines.\n\n- **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n  The intended behavior is to correctly configure and load MathJax based on the extension's configurations (`app.config.mathjax_config`). For MathJax 3.0, this behavior would still need to ensure that all user-defined configurations are respected but implemented using the new initialization and configuration mechanisms provided by MathJax 3.0. It suggests adapting this part to use the new MathJax 3.0 API.\n\n### 2. Analysis of `mathjax_path` Code Snippets\n- These snippets, all located within `sphinx/ext/mathjax.py`, likely reference the pathway to the MathJax library, which is critical for loading the library into the Sphinx documents. Given the transition to MathJax 3.0, this path might need updating, especially if the library's structure or file naming conventions have changed with the new version. It might also affect how MathJax is loaded, considering MathJax 3.0's shifts towards more modular and promise-based loading mechanisms.\n\n### Next Steps for Context Acquisition\nGiven the results and their analysis, we now understand that:\n- The `sphinx/ext/mathjax.py` file is crucial for MathJax integration.\n- The functions and configurations specifically related to loading and initializing MathJax need to be updated for MathJax 3.0.\n\nTo further prepare for creating a patch, it would be beneficial to:\n1. Look more into the `sphinx/ext/mathjax.py` file to get an overview of the entire MathJax extension script. This could provide insights into additional areas needing updates.\n   \n2. Since no class or method names directly related to MathJax initialization were successfully found (e.g., `init_mathjax` was not found), and the direct `MathJax` class search was unfruitful, exploration should focus on understanding the entire workflow of the `install_mathjax` function and identifying new, MathJax 3.0 relevant methods or initialization practices within `sphinx/ext/mathjax.py`.\n\n3. Because the transition from MathJax 2.x to 3.x includes changes in the API and configuration structure, examining the documentation or examples of MathJax 3.x initialization would be crucial parallel research to understand the new implementation requirements before attempting to integrate these into `sphinx/ext/mathjax.py`.\n\nA subsequent API call might involve:\n- Taking a closer look at the entire `install_mathjax` method or other parts of the `mathjax.py` file to fully understand its operation and identify all the pieces that need changes to support MathJax 3.0.\n\nGiven these are more about overarching analysis rather than specific API calls, the next concrete step would be:\n- `get_code_around_line(\"sphinx/ext/mathjax.py\", 87, 10)` to get a broader look at the context around the `MathJax.Hub.Config` usage and any related configuration or initialization code patterns."

For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.).

This entails altering the configuration script construction method to align with MathJax 3.0's initialization API. Specifically, the `MathJax.Hub.Config` call must be replaced or updated with MathJax 3.0 configuration and initialization code that might use a completely different syntax or approach. The new implementation should ensure that any existing MathJax customization specified in `app.config.mathjax_config` is compatible with or appropriately translated to the new MathJax 3.0 configuration structure. Additionally, the method for adding the MathJax script to the webpage might need to be updated to reflect any changes in MathJax 3.0's file structure or loading mechanism, ensuring the fastest possible loading times and adherence to the new modularity and performance optimizations present in MathJax 3.0.\n\n    The update should maintain backward compatibility as much as possible, or provide clear migration paths or warnings for configurations that no longer apply or need changes. The goal is to leverage MathJax 3.0's improvements without losing the existing functional expectations of the Sphinx MathJax extension's users."
