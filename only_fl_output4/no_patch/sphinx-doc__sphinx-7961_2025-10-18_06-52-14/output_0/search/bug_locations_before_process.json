        "intended_behavior": "To resolve the issue, the install_mathjax function needs to be updated to load MathJax 3.0 correctly instead of its current configuration which is designed for MathJax 2.x. This entails altering the configuration script construction method to align with MathJax 3.0's initialization API. Specifically, the MathJax.Hub.Config call must be replaced or updated with MathJax 3.0 configuration and initialization code that might use a completely different syntax or approach. The new implementation should ensure that any existing MathJax customization specified in app.config.mathjax_config is compatible with or appropriately translated to the new MathJax 3.0 configuration structure. Additionally, the method for adding the MathJax script to the webpage might need to be updated to reflect any changes in MathJax 3.0's file structure or loading mechanism, ensuring the fastest possible loading times and adherence to the new modularity and performance optimizations present in MathJax 3.0.\n\nThe update should maintain backward compatibility as much as possible, or provide clear migration paths or warnings for configurations that no longer apply or need changes. The goal is to leverage MathJax 3.0's improvements without losing the existing functional expectations of the Sphinx MathJax extension's users."
