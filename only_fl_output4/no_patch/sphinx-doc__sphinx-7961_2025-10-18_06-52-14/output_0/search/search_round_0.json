It would be great to get this into the Sphinx MathJax extension.\nThe [MathJax upgrading docs](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/v2.html#upgrading-from-v2-to-v3) suggest that it will not be trivial to upgrade, but it may be worth it given the performance and modularity improvements. What do folks think?\n</issue>"

        "content": "To get more context about integrating MathJax 3.0 into the Sphinx MathJax extension as mentioned in the issue, we should focus on finding the relevant classes, methods, and code snippets associated with the current MathJax integration within the Sphinx project. Based on the issue description, we need to identify where and how MathJax is currently being set up and used. Here are some targeted API call proposals to gather the necessary context:\n\n1. Search for the Sphinx MathJax extension class or module to understand its current structure and integration points. Since the issue directly pertains to the Sphinx MathJax extension, finding the main class or module where MathJax is configured will provide a substantial context for planning the upgrade.\n\n   `search_class(\"MathJax\")`\n\n2. Locate the method or function responsible for loading or initializing MathJax within the Sphinx project. This could include any setup functions or configuration routines that specify MathJax version, load its scripts, or define its configuration options.\n\n   `search_method(\"init_mathjax\")`\n   \n3. Since MathJax configuration details are critical for the upgrade process (as suggested by the upgrading docs from MathJax v2 to v3), searching for any code snippets that reference MathJax configuration will be crucial. This includes any explicit version declarations or configuration blocks.\n\n   `search_code(\"MathJax.Hub.Config(\")`\n   `search_code(\"mathjax_path\")`\n\nThese search API calls are designed to uncover the main areas of the Sphinx project that handle the MathJax setup, which will be essential for planning the upgrade to version 3.0."
