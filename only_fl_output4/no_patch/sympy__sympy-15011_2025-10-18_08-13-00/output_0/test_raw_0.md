Certainly! Below is the `reproducer.py` script designed to run at the root directory of your project and test the scenario you described. It will raise an `AssertionError` if the issue is present (where `lambdify` fails with a `MatrixSymbol` that has a name with curly braces, even with `dummify=True`), and provide a detailed stack trace as specified.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sympy as sy

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def main():
    curlyx = sy.symbols("{x}")
    v = sy.MatrixSymbol("v", 2, 1)
    curlyv = sy.MatrixSymbol("{v}", 2, 1)

    # These should work
    try:
        curlyScalarId = sy.lambdify(curlyx, curlyx)
        vectorId = sy.lambdify(v,v)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "Unexpected failure with scalar or vector lambdify."

    # These should also work but are known to cause issues
    try:
        curlyVectorId = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv)
    except SyntaxError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "Failed with curly braces in MatrixSymbol without dummify."
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "Unexpected exception type."

    try:
        curlyVectorIdDummified = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv, dummify=True)
    except SyntaxError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "Failed with curly braces in MatrixSymbol with dummify=True."
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        assert False, "Unexpected exception type."

    print("Issue not present. Exiting with code 0.")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except AssertionError as e:
        # An AssertionError means the issue is present.
        exit(1)
    exit(0)
```

This script ensures the following:
- Utilizes SymPy to create symbols and matrix symbols, some of which contain curly braces in their names.
- Attempts to `lambdify` functions with both scalar symbols and matrix symbols, applying `dummify=True` where noted.
- Catches `SyntaxError` explicitly to check for the specific issue described. If such an error occurs, it prints a detailed stack trace and exits with an error status indicating the problem is present.
- Asserts failure conditions directly tied to the described issue, providing an immediate indication if the concern is valid.
- Exits with code 0 if no issues are found, implying that a previously present bug has been addressed or that the environment does not exhibit the problem.
