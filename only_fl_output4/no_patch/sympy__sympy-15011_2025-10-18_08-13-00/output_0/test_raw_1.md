Given the new information and the requirements, let's adjust the `reproducer.py` to accurately identify and report on the issue you're facing with `lambdify`, using curly braces in `MatrixSymbol` names, and properly handle exit codes based on the test outcome.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sympy as sy

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def check_for_issue():
    curlyx = sy.symbols("{x}")
    v = sy.MatrixSymbol("v", 2, 1)
    curlyv = sy.MatrixSymbol("{v}", 2, 1)

    # Confirming that these work as expected
    try:
        curlyScalarId = sy.lambdify(curlyx, curlyx)
        vectorId = sy.lambdify(v,v)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return True, "Unexpected failure with scalar or vector lambdify."

    # Testing the problematic cases
    try:
        curlyVectorId = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv)
        curlyVectorIdDummified = sy.lambdify(curlyv, curlyv, dummify=True)
    except SyntaxError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return True, "SyntaxError with curly braces in MatrixSymbol name, demonstrating the issue."
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        return True, "Unexpected exception type."

    return False, "No issue detected, lambdify works correctly with curly braces in MatrixSymbol name."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    issue_detected, message = check_for_issue()
    if issue_detected:
        print(message)
        exit(1)
    else:
        print(message)
        exit(0)
```

This script does the following:
- It first defines a `print_stacktrace` function to provide detailed error reports.
- In the `check_for_issue` function, it attempts to reproduce the issue by running the problematic code. It particularly checks whether `lambdify` works correctly with `MatrixSymbol` names including curly braces, testing both with and without `dummify=True`.
- It handles the specific `SyntaxError` expected when the issue is present and uses the `print_stacktrace` function to display detailed information about where and why the error occurred.
- The main block of the script runs `check_for_issue` and adjusts the script exit code based on whether the issue was reproduced. Exit code `1` indicates the issue persists, while exit code `0` means the issue is apparently fixed or not present.

When executed, if the issue is reproduced, it will exit with code 1 and provide a detailed traceback of the `SyntaxError`. If the issue is not present, it will exit with code 0, indicating the problem has been resolved.
