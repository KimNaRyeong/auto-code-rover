To understand how `lambdify` functions with different symbol names and why it fails with a `MatrixSymbol` that contains curly braces, even with `dummify=True`, we need to look into the implementation of `lambdify`.\n   - `search_method(\"lambdify\")`\n\n2. Since the problem seems to relate specifically to handling `MatrixSymbol` instances with special characters in their names within `lambdify`, it's crucial to see how `MatrixSymbol` is defined and potentially interacts with `lambdify`.\n   - `search_class(\"MatrixSymbol\")`\n\n3. The issue mentions the use of `dummify=True` as a parameter to `lambdify`. It's important to understand how `lambdify` utilizes this argument, particularly how it treats `MatrixSymbol` names during the dummification process.\n   - `search_code(\"dummify=True\")`\n\n4. Given that the error is a `SyntaxError`, it would be useful to see how `lambdify` generates the code from the symbols and possibly how it validates or parses the symbol names.\n   - `search_code(\"SyntaxError\")`\n\nThese API calls will provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms behind the issue, offering insights into potential spots where the bug might be residing and guiding towards an effective patch."
