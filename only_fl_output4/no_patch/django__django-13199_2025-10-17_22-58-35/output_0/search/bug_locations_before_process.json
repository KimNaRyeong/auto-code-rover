        "intended_behavior": "The delete_cookie method should be patched to ensure it correctly handles the SameSite attribute when deleting cookies. This means the method needs to allow specifying a SameSite value or default to a sensible and secure option that complies with current browser policies on cookies. When cookies are deleted, the SameSite attribute should either preserve the existing attribute of the cookie or apply a default value that ensures the browser will accept the deletion request without generating warnings about missing or misconfigured SameSite attributes. The rest of the delete_cookie functionality should remain as is, ensuring that cookies are correctly marked for deletion with attributes like expires set to a past date and max_age set to 0. This modification has to maintain the overall functionality of the code while aligning it with modern browser expectations for cookie handling, specifically regarding SameSite and Secure attributes."
