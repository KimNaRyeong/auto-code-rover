The following API calls would be appropriate:\n\n1. Search for the `HttpResponse` class to see if the `delete_cookie` method is directly part of it or inherited from a base class like `HttpResponseBase`.\n   \n   ```\n   search_class(\"HttpResponse\")\n   ```\n\n2. If `HttpResponse` inherits from `HttpResponseBase` and does not override the `delete_cookie` method, we should check for the `HttpResponseBase` class to ensure we're looking in the right place for the implementation.\n\n   ```\n   search_class(\"HttpResponseBase\")\n   ```\n\n3. Search for the implementation of `delete_cookie` method in the entire codebase. This will help us understand if there are multiple implementations or overrides in different subclasses.\n\n   ```\n   search_method(\"delete_cookie\")\n   ```\n\n4. Search for the `set_cookie` method's usage since the issue description implies modifications were tested with it. Understanding its parameters and usage can be crucial for creating a patch.\n\n   ```\n   search_method(\"set_cookie\")\n   ```\n\nThese API calls should provide a comprehensive overview of where and how cookies are managed, specifically with regards to deleting and setting them, which is central to resolving the reported issue."
