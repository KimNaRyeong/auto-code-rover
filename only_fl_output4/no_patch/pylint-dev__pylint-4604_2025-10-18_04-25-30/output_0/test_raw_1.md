Given the previous error message indicates that `pylint` was not found in your environment, it's important to ensure that `pylint` is installed and accessible in your system's PATH before running the script. It appears there was a misunderstanding in the execution environment previously. Assuming `pylint` is correctly installed, let's adjust the script to focus directly on reproducing the issue as requested.

Here's a revised version of `reproducer.py`, taking into account the requirement for `pylint` to be accessible, and focusing on raising an `AssertionError` if the issue is detected, or exiting with code 0 otherwise:

```python
import subprocess
import sys
import tempfile
import os

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

def run_pylint_on_code(code: str):
    """Run pylint on the given code and checks for the specific issue."""
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, suffix=".py", mode='w') as tmp_file:
        tmp_file_name = tmp_file.name
        tmp_file.write(code)
        tmp_file.flush()

    try:
        # Make sure pylint is installed in your environment.
        result = subprocess.run(["pylint", tmp_file_name], capture_output=True, text=True, check=False)
        pylint_output = result.stdout + "\n" + result.stderr
        if "unused-import" in pylint_output:
            raise AssertionError("False positive unused-import warning detected.")
        else:
            print("No false positive detected. Exiting with code 0.")
            sys.exit(0)
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        sys.exit(1)
    finally:
        os.remove(tmp_file_name)

def main():
    test_code = """
\"\"\"Docstring.\"\"\"

import abc
from abc import ABC

X = ...  # type: abc.ABC
Y = ...  # type: ABC
"""
    run_pylint_on_code(test_code)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Before executing the script, ensure that `pylint` is installed and properly configured in your environment. If `pylint` is not installed, you can typically install it using pip:

```sh
pip install pylint
```

This script is designed to create a temporary Python file that includes the code sample provided in your issue. It then runs `pylint` on this file to identify if the `unused-import` warning is mistakenly reported. If the issue is detected (the false positive is present), it raises an `AssertionError` and prints a detailed stack trace. Otherwise, it exits with code 0, indicating no issue was found.
