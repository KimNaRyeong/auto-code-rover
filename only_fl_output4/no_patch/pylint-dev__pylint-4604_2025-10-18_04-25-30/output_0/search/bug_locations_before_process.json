A modification or enhancement should be made here to include logic that recognizes and validates imports used in type comments. The checker should parse comments for variables, class attributes, and function annotations, identify type hints within these comments, and cross-reference these types with imported modules or objects. Such an enhancement would address the issue by not flagging imports as unused if they are referenced in type comments."

The intended behavior would include enhancements to traverse and analyze comments adjacent to or within node structures that can have associated type hints (e.g., variable annotations, function signatures). This would ensure that the AST traversal logic supports identifying use cases of imported types within comments."
