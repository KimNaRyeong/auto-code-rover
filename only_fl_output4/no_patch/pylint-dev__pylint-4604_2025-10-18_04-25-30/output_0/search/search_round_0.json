        "content": "To gather the necessary context for resolving this issue, we need to understand how pylint checks for unused imports and how type comments are processed. We should also look into how pylint differentiates between actually unused imports and those used in type comments. This would likely involve the linting rules for detecting unused imports and possibly the handling of type comments. Given this, let's perform the following search API calls:\n\n1. `search_method(\"check_unused_imports\")`: To find how pylint checks for unused imports.\n2. `search_code(\"type: abc.ABC\")`: To understand how pylint processes type comments with module references.\n3. `search_code(\"type: ABC\")`: Similarly, this will help to see if the handling differs when the import is directly used in the type comment."
