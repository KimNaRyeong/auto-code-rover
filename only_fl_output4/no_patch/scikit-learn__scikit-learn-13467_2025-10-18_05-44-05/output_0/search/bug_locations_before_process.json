This involves defining a new scoring function or adapting the existing 'mean_squared_error' function within the scoring framework to calculate RMSE and ensure it is registered appropriately within the 'SCORERS' object/dictionary. The scoring function should negate the RMSE value, in line with the naming convention and expectations for scorers within scikit-learn (where lower scores are better). This new scorer should be made accessible to users in the same way as existing scorers, adhering to the framework's mechanisms for scorer registration and usage."
