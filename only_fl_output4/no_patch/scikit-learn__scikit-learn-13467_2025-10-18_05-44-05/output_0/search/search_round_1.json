It supports weights and multiple outputs handling through `sample_weight` and `multioutput` parameters, respectively.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Since the issue suggests adding a `squared` option to this method to enable calculating the root-mean-square error (RMSE) directly, this method is directly related. The current implementation does not support toggling between MSE and RMSE, and the issue aims at modifying this functionality or extending it to allow such a feature.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior after resolving the issue would be a modified or additional functionality in this method to accept a `squared=False` parameter (or similar) that, when set, would return the square root of the MSE, thereby directly providing the RMSE.\n\n### `SCORERS` Code Snippets Context\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - The `SCORERS` dictionary or object seems to be a registry or a collection where different scoring metrics are registered or defined. This is found in multiple files, indicating it\u2019s a central part of how scoring metrics are managed across the `sklearn.metrics` module.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue mentions adding a scorer `neg_root_mean_squared_error`, which suggests that we need to register this new scoring metric into the existing framework. Understanding where and how `SCORERS` is used or updated will be necessary to implement this part of the feature.\n\n3. **Given the issue description, what would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior would be to have the new `neg_root_mean_squared_error` scorer available for use within the scikit-learn framework, similar to other scorers. Users should be able to import or select this scorer to evaluate model predictions against true outcomes using RMSE, specifically where the value is negated for consistency with other scorers that prefer lower values for better scores.\n\nGiven this analysis, the next steps would involve planning modifications to the `mean_squared_error` function to support a `squared` argument and investigating how new scorers are added to the `SCORERS` object. This may require further examination of how `SCORERS` is structured or updated in `sklearn.metrics.__init__.py` and `sklearn.metrics.scorer.py`, and potentially designing or adapting a function that calculates the RMSE to fit within the scorer's framework."

However, further examination of how to correctly modify `mean_squared_error` and the structure of `SCORERS` for adding a new scorer was gathered directly from the available code snippets and the issue description. Additional specific API calls are not needed at this stage, considering we have a clear understanding of where modifications are required and what their nature should be.\n\n2. **Where are bug locations:**\n   - **Location 1:**\n     - **File:** `sklearn/metrics/regression.py`\n     - **Class:** N/A\n     - **Method:** `mean_squared_error`\n     - **Intended Behavior:** This method should be extended or modified to support an additional parameter, e.g., `squared`, which defaults to `True` to preserve existing functionality. When `squared=False`, the method should return the square root of the mean squared error, thereby calculating the RMSE. This modification should ensure backwards compatibility while offering additional functionality.\n   \n   - **Location 2:**\n     - **File:** `sklearn/metrics/__init__.py` and/or `sklearn/metrics/scorer.py`\n     - **Class:** N/A\n     - **Method:** N/A\n     - **Intended Behavior:** Implement the `neg_root_mean_squared_error` scorer. This involves defining a new scoring function or adapting the existing `mean_squared_error` function within the scoring framework to calculate RMSE and ensure it is registered appropriately within the `SCORERS` object/dictionary. The scoring function should negate the RMSE value, in line with the naming convention and expectations for scorers within scikit-learn (where lower scores are better). This new scorer should be made accessible to users in the same way as existing scorers, adhering to the framework's mechanisms for scorer registration and usage.\n\nThese modifications aim to directly address the issue by extending existing functionality in a backward-compatible manner and integrating a new scorer into the scikit-learn metrics framework, enhancing the utility and ease of use for calculating RMSE."
