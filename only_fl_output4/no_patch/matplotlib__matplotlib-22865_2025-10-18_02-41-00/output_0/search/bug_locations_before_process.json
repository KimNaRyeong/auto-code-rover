The code should ensure that:\n- Edge colors are correctly applied to the extended parts of the colorbar. This means ensuring that the edges at both the beginning and the end of the colorbar, which correspond to the extended areas when extend='both', are visibly drawn with the specified edge color.\n- This behavior must be consistent regardless of the colorbar's orientation (horizontal or vertical).\n- The existing functionality for colorbars without extensions or when drawedges=False remains unchanged, preserving backward compatibility."
