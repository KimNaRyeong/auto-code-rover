To create a standalone Python file `reproducer.py` that reproduces the issue described, we will set up a minimal Django environment programmatically within the script. We will use an in-memory SQLite database for simplicity, though the issue pertains to PostgreSQL behavior. This approach allows us to focus on the Django ORM behavior around `ExpressionWrapper` and constant expressions in a GROUP BY clause, understanding that the precise database error might not be replicable with SQLite. However, the script will assert the presence of the issue based on the generated SQL query, raising an `AssertionError` if the constant expression improperly appears in the GROUP BY clause.

```python
import os
import sys

# Setup Django environment
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'reproducer.settings')
import django
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import ExpressionWrapper, IntegerField, Sum, Value
from django.db.utils import ProgrammingError

def setup_django_environment():
    settings.configure(
        DEBUG=True,
        DATABASES={
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': ':memory:',
            },
        },
        INSTALLED_APPS=('__main__',),
        USE_I18N=False,
        USE_L10N=False,
        USE_TZ=False,
    )
    django.setup()

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

# Define a model to use with the Django ORM
class Model(models.Model):
    column_a = models.IntegerField()
    column_b = models.IntegerField()

# Function to reproduce the issue
def execQuery(expr):
    expr = ExpressionWrapper(expr, output_field=IntegerField())
    return Model.objects.annotate(expr_res=expr).values('expr_res', 'column_a').annotate(sum=Sum('column_b')).query

# Reproducer main logic
def main():
    setup_django_environment()

    # Run Django model system checks
    django.core.management.call_command('check')

    # Try to reproduce the issue
    try:
        with django.db.connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:
            schema_editor.create_model(Model)
        
        expr = Value(3)
        query = execQuery(expr)

        sql = str(query)
        if ', 3' in sql:
            raise AssertionError("Constant expressions should not appear in the GROUP BY clause.")
    except AssertionError as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        print_stacktrace(e)
    finally:
        # Cleanup - attempting to delete the model table, if it was created.
        try:
            with django.db.connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:
                schema_editor.delete_model(Model)
        except:
            pass  # In a real script, logging might be appropriate here.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Please note:
- This script assumes an application structure where the model is defined inline, making it necessary to use `'__main__'` as the application label.
- Exception handling in the script is designed to demonstrate catching assertion errors specifically related to the described issue and printing a stack trace for debugging.
- The actual issue revolving around PostgreSQL-specific behavior might not trigger in the same way when using SQLite. However, the logic is set to assert the condition that would be problematic in a PostgreSQL environment, thus making assumptions about SQL generation.
- The cleanup section tries to remove the created model table to reset the state. In this in-memory setup, it mainly serves as an example of good practice.
