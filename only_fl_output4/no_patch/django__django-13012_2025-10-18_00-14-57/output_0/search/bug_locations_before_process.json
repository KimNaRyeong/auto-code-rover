This might involve modifying how `ExpressionWrapper`'s `as_sql` or potentially other relevant methods communicate with the query construction logic about the nature of its wrapped expressions, especially constant values."

        "intended_behavior": "While the method itself may not be directly causing the issue, ensuring that the annotate method correctly interprets and handles the expressions passed to it, particularly those wrapped in `ExpressionWrapper`, without improperly grouping constants, is essential. This could involve more nuanced processing within `annotate` to recognize and act upon the nature of expressions like those produced by `ExpressionWrapper`, ensuring they are treated appropriately for SQL generation. The goal is to retain the utility of `annotate` in extending queries with additional data or aggregations while respecting SQL constraints and expected behaviors, particularly for databases like PostgreSQL."
