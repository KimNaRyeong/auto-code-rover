Specifically:\n\n1. **Search for the `ExpressionWrapper` class**: Since the issue involves the `ExpressionWrapper` object, understanding its implementation and how it interacts with the Django ORM could provide insights into why the constant expressions are incorrectly placed in the `GROUP BY` clause.\n\n2. **Search for the `Value` class usage**: Given that the `Value` expression works correctly when not wrapped by `ExpressionWrapper`, examining its usage and implementation could reveal how Django ORM treats constant expressions differently in both scenarios.\n\n3. **Search for the `annotate` method in the codebase**: The `annotate` method\u2019s handling of expressions, especially constant expressions wrapped in `ExpressionWrapper`, is central to this issue. Understanding its implementation could reveal why the constant is included in the `GROUP BY` clause when it shouldn't be.\n\n4. **Search for the `Sum` class**: Investigating the `Sum` class might provide additional context on how aggregate functions are processed alongside constant expressions and whether their handling impacts the formation of the `GROUP BY` clause.\n\nBased on these considerations, here are the API calls:\n\n- `search_class(\"ExpressionWrapper\")`\n- `search_class(\"Value\")`\n- `search_method(\"annotate\")`\n- `search_class(\"Sum\")`"
