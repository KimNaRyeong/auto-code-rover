        "content": "<issue>[Napoleon] Retrieve type of attributes from type hints when using google-style\nFollowing [google style guide for classes](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#384-classes), I added an `Attributes:` section my classes docstring. As I have [PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/) annotations (because I use `attrs`), I did not add types in the docstring., as per the style guide.\nWhen generating the documentation with `.. automodule::` from `autodoc`, with `napoleon`, the attributes are not typed. I tried using the `:undoc-members:` flag of `automodule`, but this resulted in duplicated attributes: one with the explanation, the other with the type-hint.\nWhile it is possible to not use type hints with `attrs` and replace `attr.s(auto_attribs=True)` by `attr.ib()`, this is not an option for e.g. [`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html). I also tried `napoleon_use_ivar=True`, which silenced sphinx's warnings but still resulted in two definition of the attribute in the documentation.\nIt would be nice if `napoleon` (or `autodoc`) extracted the type hint of the class, or merged the attributes when using `:undoc-members:`. That would avoid duplicated types definitions in either the code or the doc. Currently, either the code has an annotation and a type in the docstring, or the generated documentation has two entry for each attribute.\nThis might be related to #7582  and #4074 .\n**Additional info**\n- sphinx version `3.2.1`\n- [`conf.py`](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/docs/conf.py)\n- [code being autodocumented](https://github.com/QuentinSoubeyran/pheres/blob/dev/src/pheres/exceptions.py)\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue described, we need to gather sufficient context about how attributes are documented and how type hints are used within the class, specifically in the context of `attrs` usage and data classes. Since the issue mentions problems with documentation generation, particularly with the Napoleon extension and `autodoc`, it's essential to look into how classes and their attributes are defined and documented in the mentioned files. The user has provided links to specific configurations and code, which mentions `conf.py` and files under `src/pheres/exceptions.py`. Given this information, the relevant API calls would be:\n\n1. To understand how the documentation configuration might be affecting this, we should first check the Sphinx configuration:\n- `search_code_in_file(\"napoleon\", \"docs/conf.py\")` - to see how `napoleon` is configured in `conf.py`.\n\n2. Since the issue mentions the utilization of `attrs` and potentially data classes, let's inspect the classes within the specified exceptions file to understand how attributes are being declared and documented:\n- `search_code_in_file(\"attr.s(\", \"src/pheres/exceptions.py\")` - This will help us find classes decorated with `attr.s()` to see how attributes are being defined.\n- `search_code_in_file(\"@dataclass\", \"src/pheres/exceptions.py\")` - Although not directly mentioned if dataclasses are used in this particular file, it's helpful to check considering the issue's discussion about them.\n\n3. The concern about duplicate definitions in the documentation requires checking for instances of attributes being documented in the Google style docstrings and how they are defined in the code:\n- `search_code_in_file(\":type\", \"src/pheres/exceptions.py\")` - to check if there are type hints within the docstrings in the exceptions file.\n\nThis combination of API calls should provide a thorough understanding of the problem by revealing how `napoleon` is configured, how `attrs` are utilized and documented in the `exceptions.py` file, and whether or not there's an overlap between code annotations and docstring annotations that's leading to the issue described."
