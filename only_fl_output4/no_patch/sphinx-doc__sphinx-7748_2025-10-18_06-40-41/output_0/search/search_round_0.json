Currently, `autodoc_docstring_signature` can only pick up the first one. It would be nice to be able to pick up all of them.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address this issue, we need to understand how the `autodoc_docstring_signature` feature is currently implemented within the project. We're looking at a problem with handling overloaded methods in docstrings generated by SWIG for Python bindings of C++ classes. This means we'll likely need to investigate the following:\n\n1. The implementation of `autodoc_docstring_signature` to see how it currently processes docstrings and why it might be missing overloaded methods.\n2. How docstrings for overloaded methods are formatted or expected to be formatted by the tooling.\n3. Any classes or methods that specifically deal with the extraction or parsing of method signatures from docstrings, especially in the context of SWIG wrapped classes or overloaded methods.\n\nGiven this, let's proceed with some specific API searches to gather relevant context:\n\n- **Search for the implementation of `autodoc_docstring_signature`:** Since this is likely a specific method or function involved in the issue, searching for it directly can give us immediate insights into its current capabilities and limitations.\n```python\nsearch_method(\"autodoc_docstring_signature\")\n```\n\n- **Search for code that handles docstrings for methods, especially overloaded ones:** Since the issue deals with overloaded methods, there might be existing code that attempts to handle these cases.\n```python\nsearch_code(\"overloaded methods docstring\")\n```\n\n- **Specific usage or format of method docstrings in SWIG wrapped classes:** This can give us a hint on how the current system expects docstrings to be formatted and if there is any special handling for overloaded methods already in place.\n```python\nsearch_code(\"SWIG method docstring\")\n```\n\nThese searches aim to get a broad understanding of the current project's structure related to the issue, the specific implementation details of `autodoc_docstring_signature`, and any existing treatment of docstrings related to overloaded methods in SWIG-wrapped C++ classes."
