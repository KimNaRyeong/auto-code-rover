The implementation of `autodoc_docstring_signature` to see how it currently processes docstrings and why it might be missing overloaded methods.\n2. How docstrings for overloaded methods are formatted or expected to be formatted by the tooling.\n3. Any classes or methods that specifically deal with the extraction or parsing of method signatures from docstrings, especially in the context of SWIG wrapped classes or overloaded methods.\n\nGiven this, let's proceed with some specific API searches to gather relevant context:\n\n- **Search for the implementation of `autodoc_docstring_signature`:** Since this is likely a specific method or function involved in the issue, searching for it directly can give us immediate insights into its current capabilities and limitations.\n```python\nsearch_method(\"autodoc_docstring_signature\")\n```\n\n- **Search for code that handles docstrings for methods, especially overloaded ones:** Since the issue deals with overloaded methods, there might be existing code that attempts to handle these cases.\n```python\nsearch_code(\"overloaded methods docstring\")\n```\n\n- **Specific usage or format of method docstrings in SWIG wrapped classes:** This can give us a hint on how the current system expects docstrings to be formatted and if there is any special handling for overloaded methods already in place.\n```python\nsearch_code(\"SWIG method docstring\")\n```\n\nThese searches aim to get a broad understanding of the current project's structure related to the issue, the specific implementation details of `autodoc_docstring_signature`, and any existing treatment of docstrings related to overloaded methods in SWIG-wrapped C++ classes."

The functionality related to picking up method signatures from docstrings for autodocumentation purposes might be part of a larger system or handled by methods with different names.\n2.

Our initial search queries might have been too specific or used terminology not present in the code documentation or naming conventions.\n\nGiven this, we should broaden our search to find relevant parts of the code. Here are a few strategies we can employ:\n\n1. **Broaden the search to documentation-related methods:** Since `autodoc_docstring_signature` did not yield results, we can look for functions or methods related to documentation generation broadly. This might include functions for parsing docstrings, generating documentation pages, or extracting method signatures.\n    ```python\n    search_method(\"parse_docstring\")\n    search_method(\"generate_documentation\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Search for SWIG integration points:** Given the focus on SWIG and its bindings, finding how SWIG is integrated or utilized within the project could lead us to the relevant parts of the code that handle C++ to Python bindings and possibly their documentation.\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"SWIG\")\n    ```\n\n3. **General function handling for methods or classes:** Looking for how methods and classes are parsed or handled in the codebase might bring us closer to finding out how their documentation is managed.\n    ```python\n    search_method(\"parse_method\")\n    search_method(\"parse_class\")\n    ```\n\n4. **Explore the project's approach to handling overloaded methods:** Since the initial query for overloaded methods' docstrings didn't return results, perhaps understanding how the project deals with overloaded methods at a code level might be helpful.\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"overloaded method\")\n    ```\n\nThese broader searches should help us identify the mechanism or part of the code responsible for the behavior mentioned in the issue (only picking up the first method signature in docstrings for overloaded methods) and guide us toward understanding how to potentially resolve it."

Therefore, examining configuration files or scripts that might dictate how SWIG interfaces with Python could provide clues.\n\n2. **Investigating how the project builds or generates code documentation:** Instead of looking for specific method names, exploring build scripts, makefiles, or setup scripts could uncover how documentation is generated or how SWIG is utilized, offering insights into where the functionality affecting this issue might be located.\n\n3. **Examining common entry points for documentation within Python projects:** Given the issue's nature, it could be beneficial to investigate common libraries or frameworks used for documentation in Python projects, such as Sphinx, and how they are set up within the project, even if they are not directly mentioned in the search queries.\n\nGiven the above analysis, more context is needed, but the approach to obtaining it should shift towards exploring configuration, build processes, and common tooling used for documentation and SWIG integration in Python projects. However, without direct access to the codebase and only limited search functionality available through the API, recommending specific new API calls is challenging. Instead, the focus should be on manually reviewing the project's structure for the aforementioned aspects."
