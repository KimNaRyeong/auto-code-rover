Currently, `autodoc_docstring_signature` can only pick up the first one. It would be nice to be able to pick up all of them.\n</issue>"

We're looking at a problem with handling overloaded methods in docstrings generated by SWIG for Python bindings of C++ classes. This means we'll likely need to investigate the following:\n\n1. The implementation of `autodoc_docstring_signature` to see how it currently processes docstrings and why it might be missing overloaded methods.\n2. How docstrings for overloaded methods are formatted or expected to be formatted by the tooling.\n3. Any classes or methods that specifically deal with the extraction or parsing of method signatures from docstrings, especially in the context of SWIG wrapped classes or overloaded methods.\n\nGiven this, let's proceed with some specific API searches to gather relevant context:\n\n- **Search for the implementation of `autodoc_docstring_signature`:** Since this is likely a specific method or function involved in the issue, searching for it directly can give us immediate insights into its current capabilities and limitations.\n```python\nsearch_method(\"autodoc_docstring_signature\")\n```\n\n- **Search for code that handles docstrings for methods, especially overloaded ones:** Since the issue deals with overloaded methods, there might be existing code that attempts to handle these cases.\n```python\nsearch_code(\"overloaded methods docstring\")\n```\n\n- **Specific usage or format of method docstrings in SWIG wrapped classes:** This can give us a hint on how the current system expects docstrings to be formatted and if there is any special handling for overloaded methods already in place.\n```python\nsearch_code(\"SWIG method docstring\")\n```\n\nThese searches aim to get a broad understanding of the current project's structure related to the issue, the specific implementation details of `autodoc_docstring_signature`, and any existing treatment of docstrings related to overloaded methods in SWIG-wrapped C++ classes."

This could mean several things:\n\n1. The functionality related to picking up method signatures from docstrings for autodocumentation purposes might be part of a larger system or handled by methods with different names.\n2. The handling of docstrings, especially parsing or formatting them concerning overloaded methods and SWIG bindings, does not have a dedicated, easily searchable path in the codebase or is part of a more generic documentation handling feature.\n3. Our initial search queries might have been too specific or used terminology not present in the code documentation or naming conventions.\n\nGiven this, we should broaden our search to find relevant parts of the code. Here are a few strategies we can employ:\n\n1. **Broaden the search to documentation-related methods:** Since `autodoc_docstring_signature` did not yield results, we can look for functions or methods related to documentation generation broadly. This might include functions for parsing docstrings, generating documentation pages, or extracting method signatures.\n    ```python\n    search_method(\"parse_docstring\")\n    search_method(\"generate_documentation\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Search for SWIG integration points:** Given the focus on SWIG and its bindings, finding how SWIG is integrated or utilized within the project could lead us to the relevant parts of the code that handle C++ to Python bindings and possibly their documentation.\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"SWIG\")\n    ```\n\n3. **General function handling for methods or classes:** Looking for how methods and classes are parsed or handled in the codebase might bring us closer to finding out how their documentation is managed.\n    ```python\n    search_method(\"parse_method\")\n    search_method(\"parse_class\")\n    ```\n\n4. **Explore the project's approach to handling overloaded methods:** Since the initial query for overloaded methods' docstrings didn't return results, perhaps understanding how the project deals with overloaded methods at a code level might be helpful.\n    ```python\n    search_code(\"overloaded method\")\n    ```\n\nThese broader searches should help us identify the mechanism or part of the code responsible for the behavior mentioned in the issue (only picking up the first method signature in docstrings for overloaded methods) and guide us toward understanding how to potentially resolve it."
