This is because MessageEncoder checks for the truthyness of extra_tags rather than checking it is not None.\nTo replicate this bug\n>>> from django.conf import settings\n>>> settings.configure() # Just to allow the following import\n>>> from django.contrib.messages.storage.base import Message\n>>> from django.contrib.messages.storage.cookie import MessageEncoder, MessageDecoder\n>>> original_message = Message(10, \"Here is a message\", extra_tags=\"\")\n>>> encoded_message = MessageEncoder().encode(original_message)\n>>> decoded_message = MessageDecoder().decode(encoded_message)\n>>> original_message.extra_tags == \"\"\nTrue\n>>> decoded_message.extra_tags is None\nTrue\nEffect of the bug in application behaviour\nThis error occurred in the wild with a template tag similar to the following:\n{% if x not in message.extra_tags %}\nWhen the message was displayed as part of a redirect, it had been serialised and deserialized which meant that extra_tags was None instead of the empty string. This caused an error.\nIt's important to note that this bug affects all of the standard API (messages.debug, messages.info etc. all have a default value of extra_tags equal to \"\").\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context provides us with an understanding of how the `Message` class and the `MessageDecoder` method function and their connection to the reported issue.\n\n1. **`Message` class in `django/contrib/messages/storage/base.py`**:\n   - The `Message` class constructor accepts `level`, `message`, and `extra_tags` arguments, with `extra_tags` defaulting to `None` if not provided.\n   - This class is likely central to how messages generated by Django's messaging framework are represented internally.\n   - Regarding the issue, the critical piece is the handling of `extra_tags`. The default `None` is appropriate for situations when no extra tags are specified. However, according to the bug description, when `extra_tags` is explicitly set to an empty string (`\"\"`), it should remain as such and not be turned into `None` through the serialization/deserialization process.\n\n2. **Missing `MessageEncoder` `encode` method context**:\n   - We couldn't find information on how the `MessageEncoder` class's `encode` method serializes instances of `Message`, which is key to understanding part of the serialization process that might be misinterpreting `extra_tags` as `None` when it's actually an empty string.\n\n3. **`MessageDecoder` `decode` method in `django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py`**:\n   - This method takes a string `s` and decodes it, processing the messages with `process_messages`. The exact handling of `extra_tags` during decoding isn't clear from the snippet, but it's part of the deserialization process where `extra_tags` might be incorrectly set to `None`.\n   - The relation to the bug is that this process does not correctly maintain the distinction between `None` and an empty string for `extra_tags`, according to the issue description.\n\n**Intended Behavior**:\n\n- For the `Message` class, when `extra_tags` is specified as an empty string, this value should persist through serialization and deserialization, differentiating it from being undefined or `None`.\n- The `MessageEncoder`'s `encode` method should serialize `Message` instances in such a way that an empty string for `extra_tags` remains distinguishable from `None`.\n- The `MessageDecoder`'s `decode` method should ensure that during deserialization, the `extra_tags` attribute, if originally an empty string, is preserved as such, rather than being interpreted as `None`.\n\nGiven the missing context for the `MessageEncoder`'s `encode` method, we should search for this method in the same file as the `MessageDecoder` since they are likely part of the same module or closely related modules. Let's proceed to search for the `encode` method in the file `django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py` to get a comprehensive view of the serialization and deserialization process pertaining to this issue:\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"encode\", \"django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py\")`"

When `extra_tags` is provided as an empty string, it should explicitly be preserved as such through serialization and deserialization, not converted to `None`. This ensures that when `extra_tags` is used in templates or other parts of the application expecting a string, its type and value are consistent with how it was defined.\n\n- **Bug Location 2**: \n  - **File**: `django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py`\n  - **Class**: `MessageEncoder`\n  - **Method**: `encode` (Assuming this method exists in this file based on the structure, need more context to confirm)\n  - **Intended Behavior**: Modify the `encode` method to correctly handle `extra_tags` when it is an empty string. Instead of using truthiness which would treat an empty string as false (leading to it being ignored or converted to `None`), it should be serialized in such a way that its status as an empty string is preserved. This may involve explicitly checking for `None` vs an empty string or ensuring the encoding process distinguishes between the two.\n\n- **Bug Location 3**: \n  - **File**: `django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py`\n  - **Class**: `MessageDecoder`\n  - **Method**: `decode`\n  - **Intended Behavior**: The `decode` method should correctly deserialize `extra_tags`, ensuring that if an empty string was encoded, it remains an empty string upon decoding, rather than being interpreted as `None`. This may require adjusting the deserialization logic to distinguish between the absence of `extra_tags` and its presence as an empty string."
