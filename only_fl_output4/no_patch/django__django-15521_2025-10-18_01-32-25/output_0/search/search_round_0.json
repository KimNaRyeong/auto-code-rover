        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather information on how the `makemessages` command is implemented and how the `to_locale` method translates the locale names. Based on the described issue, it seems relevant to explore the `makemessages` command implementation, particularly around the commit mentioned, and also to inspect how the `to_locale` method is working with such locales. Therefore, I plan to perform the following API calls:\n\n1. Locate the `to_locale` method to understand how it translates `nl-nl-x-informal` into `nl_NL-x-informal`. This is critical to ensure we understand the expected behavior:\n   - `search_method(\"to_locale\")`\n\n2. Since the issue mentions a specific behavior in the `makemessages` command introduced by a certain commit, we should examine the code around the `makemessages` command, especially near the problematic check for `-` in the locale name. However, without knowing the exact file name where `makemessages` is implemented, I will first search for the method (or possibly a command class if it's structured that way) globally, and then we can narrow it down:\n   - `search_method(\"makemessages\")`\n\n3. Since the issue describes a specific commit where the behavior was introduced, it would be helpful to examine any code comments or logic changes around that commit's context in `makemessages`. However, given the constraints of our interaction, I can't directly inspect the commit; instead, I will focus on understanding the current implementation of `makemessages` and the handling of locales within it.\n\n4. It might also be informative to search for the handling of locales in general, to see if there's a specific pattern or method that checks locale formats which could be causing the issue:\n   - `search_code(\"invalid locale\")`\n\nThese API calls are planned to gather a comprehensive understanding of how locales are handled within the `makemessages` command and how it relates to the `to_locale` method translation for `nl-nl-x-informal`. Let's proceed with these calls."
