        "intended_behavior": "This method should discriminate between different uses of dashes (\"-\") in locale names. Specifically, it should only suggest a replacement with underscores for the language-country code part and not for extensions such as \"x-informal\". Therefore, a modification is necessary to ensure it checks if the locale includes an extension beyond the standard language-country format. Instead of blanket replacement of \"-\" with \"_\", the method should be refined to: Validate locales more intelligently, possibly reusing or aligning with the logic found in `to_locale` to handle extended locale formats correctly. Allow locales with additional specifications (like \"nl-nl-x-informal\") to be processed without mistaken alteration, adhering to the expected format `language_COUNTRY-extension`. Preserve existing functionality for locales that do not include such extensions, ensuring that standard locales like \"en-us\" are still suggested to be changed to \"en_US\", which aligns with Django's internal expectations and the `to_locale` function's behavior."
