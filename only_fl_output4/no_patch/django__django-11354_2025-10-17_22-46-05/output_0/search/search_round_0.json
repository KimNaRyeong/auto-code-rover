Query.get_aggregation method drops INNER JOIN required to select the title field. Specifically, this code drops it:\nif not inner_query.distinct:\n# If the inner query uses default select and it has some\n# aggregate annotations, then we must make sure the inner\n# query is grouped by the main model's primary key. However,\n# clearing the select clause can alter results if distinct is\n# used.\nif inner_query.default_cols and has_existing_annotations:\ninner_query.group_by = [self.model._meta.pk.get_col(inner_query.get_initial_alias())]\ninner_query.default_cols = False\nCode is taken from Django 1.8 but 1.11 looks the same.\ndefault_cols is set to False and the INNER JOIN is dropped. Quick fix is to add a condition for setting default_cols to False:\nif not inner_query.distinct:\n# If the inner query uses default select and it has some\n# aggregate annotations, then we must make sure the inner\n# query is grouped by the main model's primary key. However,\n# clearing the select clause can alter results if distinct is\n# used.\nif inner_query.default_cols and has_existing_annotations:\ninner_query.group_by = [self.model._meta.pk.get_col(inner_query.get_initial_alias())]\nif not has_existing_annotations:\ninner_query.default_cols = False\nI don't know if it could be done in a nicer way. I was able to reproduce this in 1.8.18 and 1.11.0\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to understand and locate several pieces of the Django framework codebase as described in the issue. Let's proceed with the following API calls:\n\n1. **Search for the classes involved** - This will help us understand how inheritance is handled for models and queries in Django. Specifically, we're interested in the `BaseItem` and `Item` classes, although they likely serve mostly as examples. The actual code modification seems to be needed in the Django query handling classes. However, understanding the inheritance might give context:\n    - `search_class(\"BaseItem\")`\n    - `search_class(\"Item\")`\n\n2. **Locate the `Query.get_aggregation` method** - The issue description suggests that the problem lies within this method when handling annotation and count operations involving inherited model fields. Understanding its current implementation is crucial:\n    - `search_method(\"get_aggregation\")`\n\n3. **Search for code snippet related to default_cols and INNER JOIN handling** - The reported issue involves a snippet where `default_cols` is set and possibly causes the dropping of the required `INNER JOIN`. We want to see the exact implementation and any surrounding logic:\n    - `search_code(\"inner_query.default_cols = False\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a strong foundation to understand where the issue occurs, how inheritance is factored into queries, and where the proposed fix should be applied within the Django codebase."
