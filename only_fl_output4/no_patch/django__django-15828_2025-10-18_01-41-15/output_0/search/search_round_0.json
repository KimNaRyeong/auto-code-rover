        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to gather context about where and how the `BaseConstraint.deconstruct()` and `__eq__` methods are implemented and used in the codebase. Additionally, understanding how `violation_error_message` is currently managed or overlooked in these methods will also be crucial. Here are the API calls that would be helpful:\n\n1. Search for the `BaseConstraint` class to find where it is defined:\n   - `search_class(\"BaseConstraint\")`\n\n2. Once we have the file path for `BaseConstraint`, we need to look into the implementations of `deconstruct()` and `__eq__` methods within this class, so we'll need the file path from the first call to use in the next two calls:\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"deconstruct\", \"BaseConstraint\")`\n   - `search_method_in_class(\"__eq__\", \"BaseConstraint\")`\n\n3. Lastly, to understand how `violation_error_message` is handled or supposed to be handled in comparison and deconstruction operations, we should search for instances where `violation_error_message` is mentioned in the context of `BaseConstraint`. This might give us insights into what's missing or what needs to be adjusted:\n   - `search_code(\"violation_error_message\")`\n\nThese API calls will provide a comprehensive overview of the necessary code context to address the reported issue effectively."
