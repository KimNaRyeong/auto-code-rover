        "content": "Given the issue description, here are the steps I'll take to gather context:\n\n1. **Search for the `JSONField` class**: This will help understand how `JSONField` is defined and used within the project. It's a common Django model field, but since we're dealing with a form field issue, the context around its declaration might provide insights into custom implementations or overrides.\n\n2. **Search for the `bound_data` method within `JSONField` class**: Since the issue mentions 'JSONField.bound_data raises TypeError', it's important to see the implementation or any overrides of this method to understand how `None` values are handled.\n\n3. **Examine the `JSONField` usage in a Form**: The bug report includes a simple form class `JSONForm` with `json_field = JSONField(required=False)`. While this seems straightforward, searching for similar usage across the project could reveal patterns or common practices around `JSONField` handling in forms that might not adhere to the Django standard.\n\n4. **Search for instances of `form.as_p()`**: Since the error occurs when rendering a form without provided values (`form = JSONForm({})` and then `assert form.as_p()`), understanding how forms are typically rendered in the project could shed light on additional context or custom rendering logic that might interfere with JSONField handling.\n\nHere are the API calls that would gather the necessary context for these steps:\n\n- `search_class(\"JSONField\")`\n- `search_method_in_class(\"bound_data\", \"JSONField\")`\n- `search_code(\"JSONField(required=False)\")`\n- `search_code(\"form.as_p()\")`\n\nThese calls should provide a comprehensive view of the `JSONField` implementation, its usage in forms, and any custom rendering methods that could influence form behavior, particularly with respect to handling `None` values."
