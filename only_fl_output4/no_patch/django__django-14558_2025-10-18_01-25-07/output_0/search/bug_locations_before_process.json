        "intended_behavior": "This method should be updated to handle `None` values gracefully. Currently, it attempts to decode `data` as JSON without checking if `data` is `None`, which leads to a `TypeError`. The fix should involve adding a condition to check if `data` is `None` and, if so, returning `None` or a default value that does not crash the system but is also reflective of the field being empty or not provided. This preserves the method's existing functionality while ensuring it does not raise an exception when encountering `None` values. This approach will prevent the crash mentioned in the issue, allowing forms containing a `JSONField` with no data provided to be rendered without errors."
