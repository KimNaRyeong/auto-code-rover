Write contents of snippet to module and set it to be explorable by sphinx.\n2. Install dependencies, in my `docs/requirements.txt`:\n```txt\nSphinx>=2.0.1\nsphinx-rtd-theme>=0.4.3\n```\n2. Build docs.\n**Expected behavior**\nDocs are built and there is `foo` with valid type annotations.\n**Your project**\nhttps://github.com/lycantropos/robust/tree/1c7b74e0cc39c1843a89583b8c245f08039a3978\n**Environment info**\n- OS: Windows 10, but also reproduces on [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/shewchuk/builds/10817256/).\n- Python version: 3.8.0\n- Sphinx version: 3.0.1\n- Sphinx extensions:  `['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'sphinx.ext.viewcode']`\n</issue>"

        "content": "To gather sufficient context for resolving this issue, the following API calls would be necessary:\n\n1. Since the issue happens with Sphinx, specifically within a file related to Python domain handling (sphinx/domains/python.py), it would be beneficial to search for the method where the error occurs to understand its logic and how it interacts with type annotations.\n   \n   ```python\n   search_code_in_file(\"result.pop()\", \"sphinx/domains/python.py\")\n   ```\n   \n2. Given the bug report involves a type annotation issue (`Tuple[()]` leading to `IndexError`), exploring how Sphinx handles type annotations could offer insights. However, without specific function names, looking directly at how Sphinx parses or unparse type annotations within the provided file or generally could be more challenging without a broader examination.\n\n3. To understand the broader context of how Sphinx generates documentation for functions and their annotations, searching for functions related to parsing or generating documentation for functions might be useful. Since the exact function names are not provided in the issue, a direct search might not be feasible without more specific details. \n\n4. The user's project URL indicates the issue might be related to how their specific code (or a Sphinx extension they might be using) interacts with Sphinx. Looking into their `conf.py` file or any custom Sphinx extensions they wrote could also provide insights. However, with the current information and available API functions, we cannot directly search within a user's repository.\n\nGiven the constraints and information provided, the most direct approach to gathering context about the bug from the available API calls would be to start with the first action:\n\n```python\nsearch_code_in_file(\"result.pop()\", \"sphinx/domains/python.py\")\n``` \n\nThis should provide insight into the specific logic that leads to the `IndexError` when handling empty tuple type annotations."
