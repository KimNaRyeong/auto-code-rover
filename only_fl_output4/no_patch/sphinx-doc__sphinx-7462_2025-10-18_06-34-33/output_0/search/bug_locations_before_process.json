        "intended_behavior": "The method should conditionally execute `result.pop()` only if the `result` list is not empty or if there were actually elements processed. This can be achieved by checking if `node.elts` is not empty before adding commas and attempting to remove them. Alternatively, ensuring that `result` contains elements before calling `result.pop()` would also prevent the `IndexError` from occurring. This approach would preserve the existing functionality of correctly formatting non-empty sequences without causing an error on empty sequences. For the first context, before line 103, insert a condition to check if `result` is not empty or if `node.elts` is not empty before popping. For the second context, similar to the first, insert a condition before line 121 to ensure there's an item to pop, guarding against the IndexError for empty tuples."
