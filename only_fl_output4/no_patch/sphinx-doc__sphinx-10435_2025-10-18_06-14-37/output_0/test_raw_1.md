Given the error encountered during your test execution, it looks like there's an issue related to the absence of `docutils`, which is a dependency required by Sphinx to function correctly. Before adapting the script, you must ensure that both `sphinx` and `docutils` are installed in your environment. You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install sphinx docutils
```

Then, modify the `reproducer.py` script to take into account this prerequisite and improve its checks. The improved script provided below is a fresh attempt to reproduce the issue, focusing on detecting unwanted whitespace in the `.tex` output generated from Sphinx due to the inline code highlighting feature. The script checks the LaTeX output for the presence or absence of additional spaces around the inline code that was reported as an issue.

```python
def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    import sys
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

This script creates a minimal Sphinx project with an `index.rst` file that should trigger the behavior reported in the issue when built to LaTeX. It checks the `.tex` file for appropriate `%` markers that would indicate correct handling of whitespace around inline code blocks. An error is raised if these markers are not found, pointing towards the issue being present. Make sure Sphinx is correctly set up and the dependencies mentioned (`docutils` in particular) are installed before running this version of the reproducer.
