Inspecting the globals and source code of `f` shows us why we get the result:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import inspect\r\n>>> print(inspect.getsource(f))\r\ndef _lambdifygenerated(A):\r\n    return (I + A)\r\n>>> f.__globals__['I']\r\n1j\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code printer prints `I`, which is currently being interpreted as a Python built-in complex number. The printer should support printing identity matrices, and signal an error for unsupported expressions that might be misinterpreted.\n"
