Given the clarification needed, let's correct and streamline your requirement into a `reproducer.py` script. This new version will retain the intended logic to catch and highlight the issue with lambdifying expressions involving identity matrices. Importantly, it will include error handling that will indeed reproduce the error under conditions where the issue exists, using the provided `print_stacktrace` function for clear debug information.

```python
# reproducer.py
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    import numpy as np
    from sympy import symbols, MatrixSymbol, Identity, lambdify

    # Constructing the matrix expression
    n = symbols('n', integer=True)
    A = MatrixSymbol("A", n, n)
    a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

    # using lambdify to create a function
    f = lambdify(A, A + Identity(n))

    # function call with an array input
    result = f(a)
    
    # Constructing the expected result for comparison
    expected = np.array([[2, 2], [3, 5]], dtype=complex)  # Adjusted for complex dtype due to unexpected function behavior.

    # Assertion to check if the issue exists
    assert np.array_equal(result, expected), "Lambdify misinterprets some matrix expressions."

except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)  # Exiting with error code 1 indicating the presence of the issue
except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected error occurred:", str(e))
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)

print("Test passed, no issues found with lambdifying matrix expressions.")
sys.exit(0)
```

**Notes**:

- **Why an Error May Occur**: Given that the original issue describes unexpected behavior when using `lambdify` with identity matrices — specifically, the function mistakenly outputs complex numbers due to a misinterpretation of the symbolic identity `I` as the imaginary unit `1j` in Python — the test checks for this incorrect behavior directly.
- **Execution Result**: When the issue is present (i.e., the output contains complex numbers where it should not), the script raises an `AssertionError` and prints a detailed stack trace, allowing for clear identification of the issue's location. Conversely, if the problem is fixed and `lambdify` works as intended, the script will confirm the absence of issues and exit cleanly with code 0. 

Remember to have `numpy` and `sympy` installed in your environment to run this script effectively.
