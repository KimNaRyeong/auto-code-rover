        "method": "lambdify",
        "intended_behavior": "The `lambdify` function needs to ensure that the conversion of symbols to numerical functions correctly interprets the `I` symbol as an identity matrix when used in a matrix context, rather than the imaginary unit. This might require checking the context in which `I` appears during the conversion process and applying appropriate conversion logic for matrix expressions specifically. This special handling should preserve the existing functionality where `I` represents the imaginary unit outside of matrix contexts, ensuring that numerical computations involving complex numbers remain unaffected."
