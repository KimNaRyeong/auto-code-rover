Inspecting the globals and source code of `f` shows us why we get the result:\n```python\n>>> import inspect\n>>> print(inspect.getsource(f))\ndef _lambdifygenerated(A):\nreturn (I + A)\n>>> f.__globals__['I']\n1j\n```\nThe code printer prints `I`, which is currently being interpreted as a Python built-in complex number. The printer should support printing identity matrices, and signal an error for unsupported expressions that might be misinterpreted.\n</issue>"

        "content": "To address the issue effectively, we need to explore several aspects of the codebase:\n\n1. **Lambdify Functionality**: We should begin by understanding how `lambdify` is implemented, especially how it converts symbolic expressions into numeric functions.\n2. **Identity Matrix Handling**: Given that the identity matrix is being misinterpreted, we need to investigate how identity matrices are being printed or converted in the context of lambdify.\n3. **Complex Number 'I' Interpretation**: It's mentioned that `I` is being interpreted as `1j` (the Python notation for the imaginary unit). We should look for where this interpretation is set.\n\nBased on these requirements, the following API calls will help:\n\n1. **Lambdify Implementation**: Since `lambdify` is likely a function, we should search for its definition.\n2. **Identity Matrix Printing**: We need to look into how matrix symbols and identity matrices are handled during the conversion or printing process.\n3. **Code Printer Misinterpretation**: The issue indicates a problem with how symbolic expressions are being translated to numeric expressions, particularly with the handling of `I`. This suggests we might need to look at the code printer functionality, specifically where symbols are being translated or printed.\n\nTherefore, the needed API calls are:\n\n- `search_method(\"lambdify\")`: To find the implementation details of `lambdify`.\n- `search_code(\"MatrixSymbol\")` and `search_code(\"Identity\")`: These calls will help us find how MatrixSymbol and Identity are implemented or used, giving us insight into potential areas where the misinterpretation occurs.\n- `search_code(\"I\")`: Since `I` is being interpreted wrongly, finding where `I` is defined or used in the context of lambdify or expressions handling could clue us into the misinterpretation issue."
