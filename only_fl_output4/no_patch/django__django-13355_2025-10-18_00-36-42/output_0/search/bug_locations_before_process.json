        "intended_behavior": "The `__add__` method within the `Media` class should be optimized to prevent performance degradation when a large number of `Media` objects are added together. The existing functionality of adding (merging) the media resources (CSS and JS files) from two `Media` instances should be preserved. However, to address the performance issue, the method should include a mechanism to limit the performance impact when the combined number of items in `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` exceeds a certain threshold. The modified `__add__` method could incorporate a check to determine the total number of items within `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` of the current and the `other` `Media` object. If this total exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 1000 items, as suggested in the issue description), the method may then apply a more efficient strategy for combining the lists to prevent excessive processing time and memory usage. This strategy might involve more efficiently managing the list additions or implementing an alternative data structure that is more performance in scenarios involving large numbers of elements. This approach would maintain the existing functionality for \"smaller\" numbers of additions, ensuring that the method's behavior remains unchanged for the majority of use cases, preserving backward compatibility and the integrity of the current API. For \"larger\" numbers of additions, where performance issues become apparent, the method would employ this modified approach to ensure that the performance remains consistent and acceptable, even as the number of media objects grows significantly."
