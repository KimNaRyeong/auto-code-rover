        "content": "<issue>Optimize django.forms.widgets.Media.__add__.\nDescription\nWhile working with another project that make extensive use of django.forms.widgets.Media I discovered that the fix for ticket #30153 has unintended consequences on the performance of Media.__add__. If the number of Media objects added grows beyond a certain point (not sure it may be machine specific) then the performance of all subsequent Media.__add__ calls becomes terrible.\nThis was causing page load times of several minutes on my development machine. I agree that you need to delay as long as possible as #30153 intends but it seems that there probably should be an upper bound on this so that performance does not suddenly decrease.\nHere is some sample code that can reproduce the issue:\nfrom django.forms import Media\nimport datetime\ndef create_media(MediaClass):\n'''Creates a simple Media object with only one or two items.'''\nreturn MediaClass(css={'all': ['main.css']}, js=['main.js'])\nstart = datetime.datetime.now()\nmedia = create_media(Media)\nfor i in range(100000):\nmedia = media + create_media(Media)\nprint('100000 additions took: %s' % (datetime.datetime.now() - start))\nOn my machine several runs of this code result in times between 1:35 - 1:44 (eg. 1 minute 35 seconds to 1 minute 44 seconds). However, taking away one zero from the number of media objects runs in under a second. Near as I can tell this has to do with the memory used to store these arrays and when it gets past a certain point the performance is awful. Since I am not sure if it is machine specific, for reference my machine is a i7-8700 with 64 GB RAM.\nHere is a sample that has a modified Media class that does not have theses issues:\nfrom django.forms import Media\nimport datetime\ndef create_media(MediaClass):\n'''Creates a simple Media object with only one or two items.'''\nreturn MediaClass(css={'all': ['main.css']}, js=['main.js'])\nclass CustomMedia(Media):\ndef __add__(self, other):\ncombined = CustomMedia()\nif len(self._css_lists) + len(other._css_lists) > 1000:\ncombined._css_lists = [self._css, other._css]\nelse:\ncombined._css_lists = self._css_lists + other._css_lists\nif len(self._js_lists) + len(other._js_lists) > 1000:\ncombined._js_lists = [self._js, other._js]\nelse:\ncombined._js_lists = self._js_lists + other._js_lists\nreturn combined\nstart = datetime.datetime.now()\nmedia = create_media(CustomMedia)\nfor i in range(100000):\nmedia = media + create_media(CustomMedia)\nprint('100000 additions took: %s' % (datetime.datetime.now() - start))\nWith this change it again runs in under a second. If I increase the number of loops the performance seems to change at a much more expected level.\nI set an upper limit on the length allowed before a merge occurs. I'm not sure if the number of additions allowed should be a setting that can be adjusted to meet specific needs or if something that is just \"reasonably\" high is sufficient. It does appear that limiting the total number of items in the list to about 1000 works best on my machine. I'm also not sure that this is the best solution.\nThanks for your consideration.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Upon analyzing the returned results from the API calls, we have found key pieces of information relating to the `Media` class and its `__add__` method:\n\n1. **Location and Context of the Media Class:**\n   - The `Media` class is located in `django/forms/widgets.py`. This class is significant within Django's forms framework, specifically for managing CSS and JavaScript files. There's no need to look into the `Media` classes within `django/contrib/gis/forms/widgets.py` or `django/contrib/admin/widgets.py` for the purpose of this bug fix, as the issue explicitly revolves around the `Media` class used in form widgets.\n\n2. **Current Implementation of `__add__` Method:**\n   - The `__add__` method within the `Media` class is designed to combine the CSS and JS lists from two `Media` objects into a new one. This method directly concatenates `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` from `self` and `other`, effectively merging their media files.\n   - Code snippet from `django/forms/widgets.py`:\n     ```python\n     147     def __add__(self, other):\n     148         combined = Media()\n     149         combined._css_lists = self._css_lists + other._css_lists\n     150         combined._js_lists = self._js_lists + other._js_lists\n     151         return combined\n     ```\n\n**Analysis Based on the Issue Description:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Code's Functionality:**\n   - The `__add__` method allows for straightforward merging of `Media` objects' CSS and JS resources. This functionality is central when building forms with multiple widgets, each potentially adding its own media resources.\n\n2. **Relationship to the Bug:**\n   - The performance issue arises when \"adding\" a large number of `Media` objects due to the unbounded growth of `_css_lists` and `_js_lists`. Each addition operation involves creating a new `Media` object and concatenating the lists, which can become increasingly performance-intensive with the growing number of elements.\n\n3. **Intended Behavior Post-Fix:**\n   - Given the issue description, the intended behavior would be to optimize the `__add__` method in a way that prevents performance degradation with a large number of additions. The example fix provided suggests an approach where, beyond a certain threshold (suggested as 1000 items), the method changes its behavior to prevent excessive memory usage or processing time. This implies implementing a condition to check the length of the lists and potentially changing how the addition operation is performed based on this condition.\n\nTo address the performance issue, the ideal solution involves modifying the `__add__` method to include a threshold for the number of media objects it concatenates, similar to the solution provided in the issue description. This would involve checking the combined lengths of `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` from both `Media` objects and implementing a more performance-conscious strategy when these lengths exceed a certain limit."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

The existing functionality of adding (merging) the media resources (CSS and JS files) from two `Media` instances should be preserved. However, to address the performance issue, the method should include a mechanism to limit the performance impact when the combined number of items in `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` exceeds a certain threshold.\n\nThe modified `__add__` method could incorporate a check to determine the total number of items within `_css_lists` and `_js_lists` of the current and the `other` `Media` object. If this total exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 1000 items, as suggested in the issue description), the method may then apply a more efficient strategy for combining the lists to prevent excessive processing time and memory usage. This strategy might involve more efficiently managing the list additions or implementing an alternative data structure that is more performance in scenarios involving large numbers of elements.\n\nThis approach would maintain the existing functionality for \"smaller\" numbers of additions, ensuring that the method's behavior remains unchanged for the majority of use cases, preserving backward compatibility and the integrity of the current API. For \"larger\" numbers of additions, where performance issues become apparent, the method would employ this modified approach to ensure that the performance remains consistent and acceptable, even as the number of media objects grows significantly."
