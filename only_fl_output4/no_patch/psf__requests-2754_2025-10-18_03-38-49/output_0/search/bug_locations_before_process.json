        "intended_behavior": "This method currently ensures the hostname is encoded to IDNA to handle international domain names correctly. However, to resolve the issue, the method should also correctly handle the encoding of the path segment of URLs, especially when they contain non-ASCII characters. The intended behavior is to ensure that both the domain and the path in a URL are accurately encoded to maintain the integrity of non-ASCII characters in redirects. This would involve a more comprehensive approach to encode the path part of the URL, ensuring it adheres to the expected URL encoding standards (e.g., percent encoding for non-ASCII characters). Additionally, this method should be mindful of existing functionality for ASCII URLs to ensure backward compatibility and adherence to HTTP standards."
