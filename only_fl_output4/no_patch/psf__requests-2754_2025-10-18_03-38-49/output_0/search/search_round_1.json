This works fine in Firefox etc.\nWith requests, I get the following error (Python 3.4 with Requests 2.7.0 on a Japanese Ubuntu 15.04):\n```\n'<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN\">\\n<html><head>\\n<title>404 Not Found</title>\\n</head><body>\\n<h1>Not Found</h1>\\n<p>The requested URL /\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x83\u00c2\\x96\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x83\u00c2\\xad\u00c3\u00a3\u00c2\\x82\u00c2\u00b0/ was not found on this server.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<address>Apache/2.2.15 (CentOS) Server at test.xn--q9jyb4c Port 80</address>\\n</body></html>\\n'\n```\nSo I guess the request lib gets a redirect from a server with Japanese characters, but then fails to convert the characters correctly. If I do `requests.get(http://test.\u307f\u3093\u306a/\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0)` directly it works, only the redirect does not.\n</issue>"

        "content": "Analyzing the collected context reveals insights into how the project might be interacting with URLs, specifically regarding redirects and IDN (Internationalized Domain Names).\n\n### Analysis of `Redirect` Search Results\n\nThe search results for `Redirect` showing appearances in various files of the `requests` library indicate areas in the codebase where handling of HTTP redirects is implemented. Given the files mentioned, such as `requests/sessions.py` which likely deals with session management for HTTP requests, and `requests/exceptions.py` which presumably defines exceptions related to HTTP requests, including those that fail due to issues with redirects, this context is particularly relevant. The following analysis can be drawn:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - This part of the code presumably manages how HTTP redirects are handled within the project. This would involve recognizing HTTP status codes that dictate a redirect (like 301, 302, 307, and 308), and subsequently following the redirect to the new URL specified by the `Location` header in the response.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - The issue described is specifically with handling redirects to non-ASCII paths. The listed code segments involved in handling redirects within `requests` could potentially be where the bug manifests, either due to how the redirected URL is parsed, encoded, or followed.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - Ideally, when handling a redirect, the code should correctly interpret and encode non-ASCII characters in URLs, ensuring that the request library can follow redirects to URLs containing such characters without resulting in a 404 error. This should include proper handling of IDN domains and paths.\n\n### Analysis of `.htaccess` Search Result\n\nThe search could not find references to `.htaccess` within the codebase, which is not surprising since `.htaccess` is an Apache server configuration file and would not be manipulated directly through Python code in a library like `requests`.\n\n### Analysis of `IDN` Search Result\n\nThe search for `IDN` yielded a snippet from the `requests/models.py` file, within a method designed to prepare a URL, which involves encoding the hostname to IDNA format. This could be directly relevant to the issue:\n\n1. **What does this part of the code do?**\n   - This code segment attempts to encode the hostname portion of a URL to its ASCII IDN equivalent, which is essential for resolving IDN domains correctly over the network.\n\n2. **What is the relationship between this part of the code and the bug?**\n   - Since the issue involves an IDN domain and non-ASCII path, the functionality for encoding the hostname to IDNA is crucial. However, the problem seems centered around path encoding rather than domain encoding. It raises the question of whether similar encoding practices are robustly applied to the path portion of the URL upon receiving a redirect.\n\n3. **What would be the intended behavior of this part of the code?**\n   - The intended behavior is for the hostname to be correctly encoded, allowing domains with international characters to be resolved correctly. By extension, a similar mechanism should ensure that paths in URLs (particularly in redirects) are correctly handled, maintaining the integrity of non-ASCII characters.\n\n### Next Steps for Further Investigation\n\nGiven the insights and the relation to the bug, further investigation should aim at understanding how redirected URLs are processed, especially focusing on:\n\n- The encoding of URL paths on redirect, which may not be handled with the same attention as domain names.\n- Handling of headers in redirect responses, to ensure `Location` headers with non-ASCII paths are correctly interpreted and followed.\n\n**Suggested API Calls for Further Context:**\n\n- `search_method_in_file(\"prepare_url\", \"requests/models.py\")`: To understand better how URLs are prepared and if path encoding is considered.\n- `search_method(\"handle_redirect\")`: This is a speculative search to find methods that explicitly handle redirects, especially decoding or reencoding the URL path.\n- `get_code_around_line(\"requests/sessions.py\", [line number of matches from redirects search], 10)`: To gather more context around how redirects are being processed within a session, though the exact line numbers were not provided initially.\n\nThese steps are essential to patching the described issue by ensuring both IDN domains and non-ASCII paths are correctly managed during redirects."

However, to resolve the issue, the method should also correctly handle the encoding of the path segment of URLs, especially when they contain non-ASCII characters. The intended behavior is to ensure that both the domain and the path in a URL are accurately encoded to maintain the integrity of non-ASCII characters in redirects. This would involve a more comprehensive approach to encode the path part of the URL, ensuring it adheres to the expected URL encoding standards (e.g., percent encoding for non-ASCII characters). Additionally, this method should be mindful of existing functionality for ASCII URLs to ensure backward compatibility and adherence to HTTP standards. \n\nGiven the issue primarily revolves around the handling of non-ASCII characters in redirected URLs, focusing on how `prepare_url` manages the encoding of different URL components is key. By extending or refining its functionality to cover path encoding, the library can better support redirects to non-ASCII paths, thus addressing the reported bug. This solution would preserve existing functionality while expanding support for internationalized resource identifiers."
