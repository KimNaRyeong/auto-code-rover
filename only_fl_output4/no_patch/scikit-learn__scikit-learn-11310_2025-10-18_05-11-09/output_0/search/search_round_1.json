What I can so far do is retrieve the time it takes to fit and score each model:\n```\nimport sklearn.datasets\nimport sklearn.model_selection\nimport sklearn.ensemble\nX, y = sklearn.datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True)\nrs = sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV(\nestimator=sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier(),\nparam_grid={'n_estimators': [2, 3, 4, 5]}\n)\nrs.fit(X, y)\nprint(rs.cv_results_['mean_fit_time'])\nprint(rs.cv_results_['mean_score_time'])\n```\nIn case I run this on a single core, I could time the whole search procedure and subtract the time it took to fit the single folds during hyperparameter optimization. Nevertheless, this isn't possible any more when setting `n_jobs != 1`.\nThus, it would be great to have an attribute `refit_time_` which is simply the time it took to refit the best model.\nUsecase: for [OpenML.org](https://openml.org) we want to support uploading the results of hyperparameter optimization, including the time it takes to do the hyperparameter optimization.\n</issue>"

        "content": "The collected context indicates that the `GridSearchCV` class is defined in two different files within the sklearn library, but the relevant implementation related to the `fit` method, which is of interest for addressing the refitting time measurement, appears to be located in `sklearn/grid_search.py`. The presence of `GridSearchCV` in both files suggests a division of functionalities or perhaps a refactoring process that separated parts of the GridSearch functionality into a more specialized module (`_search.py`). Nonetheless, only the class within `grid_search.py` provides the `fit` method directly in the search results, suggesting that this file contains the relevant implementation details for the issue at hand.\n\nAnalyzing the `fit` method in `GridSearchCV`, we see it is designed to \"Run fit with all sets of parameters.\" This method essentially orchestrates the process of evaluating various parameter combinations to determine which yields the best model performance. Understanding this part of the code is crucial since the issue description requests tracking and introducing a new attribute, `refit_time_`, representing the time it takes to refit the best found model on the full dataset. This timing is not currently tracked explicitly in the method\u2019s implementation or output.\n\nGiven this context, the intended behavior to resolve the issue would involve modifying the `fit` method (or closely related methods) to:\n1. Measure the time immediately before the refitting process begins.\n2. Measure the time immediately after the refitting process completes.\n3. Calculate the elapsed time for the refitting process by subtracting the start time from the end time.\n4. Store this calculated time in a new attribute, `refit_time_`, that can be accessed after the `fit` method completes.\n\nTo implement this, it is essential to identify exactly where within the `fit` method (or a related method) the refitting process is initiated and completed. At this stage, I should search for where the parameter grid is utilized and where the best parameters are selected and applied to the model for refitting, likely near or at the end of the `fit` method. \n\nGiven the snippet suggests that `_fit` is called with parameters including `ParameterGrid(self.param_grid)`, which likely leads to actual fitting including refitting, a good next step would be to explore the `_fit` method in `grid_search.py` further to pinpoint where refitting occurs.\n\nTherefore, an appropriate next API call would be to search for the `_fit` method within the `GridSearchCV` class to understand how it works in detail, especially how and where the refitting process is executed:\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"_fit\", \"sklearn/grid_search.py\")\n```"
