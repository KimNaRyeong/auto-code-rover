What I can so far do is retrieve the time it takes to fit and score each model:\n```\nimport sklearn.datasets\nimport sklearn.model_selection\nimport sklearn.ensemble\nX, y = sklearn.datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True)\nrs = sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV(\nestimator=sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier(),\nparam_grid={'n_estimators': [2, 3, 4, 5]}\n)\nrs.fit(X, y)\nprint(rs.cv_results_['mean_fit_time'])\nprint(rs.cv_results_['mean_score_time'])\n```\nIn case I run this on a single core, I could time the whole search procedure and subtract the time it took to fit the single folds during hyperparameter optimization. Nevertheless, this isn't possible any more when setting `n_jobs != 1`.\nThus, it would be great to have an attribute `refit_time_` which is simply the time it took to refit the best model.\nUsecase: for [OpenML.org](https://openml.org) we want to support uploading the results of hyperparameter optimization, including the time it takes to do the hyperparameter optimization.\n</issue>"

        "content": "The collected context indicates that the `GridSearchCV` class is defined in two different files within the sklearn library, but the relevant implementation related to the `fit` method, which is of interest for addressing the refitting time measurement, appears to be located in `sklearn/grid_search.py`. The presence of `GridSearchCV` in both files suggests a division of functionalities or perhaps a refactoring process that separated parts of the GridSearch functionality into a more specialized module (`_search.py`). Nonetheless, only the class within `grid_search.py` provides the `fit` method directly in the search results, suggesting that this file contains the relevant implementation details for the issue at hand.\n\nAnalyzing the `fit` method in `GridSearchCV`, we see it is designed to \"Run fit with all sets of parameters.\" This method essentially orchestrates the process of evaluating various parameter combinations to determine which yields the best model performance. Understanding this part of the code is crucial since the issue description requests tracking and introducing a new attribute, `refit_time_`, representing the time it takes to refit the best found model on the full dataset. This timing is not currently tracked explicitly in the method\u2019s implementation or output.\n\nGiven this context, the intended behavior to resolve the issue would involve modifying the `fit` method (or closely related methods) to:\n1. Measure the time immediately before the refitting process begins.\n2. Measure the time immediately after the refitting process completes.\n3. Calculate the elapsed time for the refitting process by subtracting the start time from the end time.\n4. Store this calculated time in a new attribute, `refit_time_`, that can be accessed after the `fit` method completes.\n\nTo implement this, it is essential to identify exactly where within the `fit` method (or a related method) the refitting process is initiated and completed. At this stage, I should search for where the parameter grid is utilized and where the best parameters are selected and applied to the model for refitting, likely near or at the end of the `fit` method. \n\nGiven the snippet suggests that `_fit` is called with parameters including `ParameterGrid(self.param_grid)`, which likely leads to actual fitting including refitting, a good next step would be to explore the `_fit` method in `grid_search.py` further to pinpoint where refitting occurs.\n\nTherefore, an appropriate next API call would be to search for the `_fit` method within the `GridSearchCV` class to understand how it works in detail, especially how and where the refitting process is executed:\n\n```python\nsearch_method_in_file(\"_fit\", \"sklearn/grid_search.py\")\n```"

This method manages the creation of parameter iterables, handles the cross-validation (CV) logic, initiates parallel computation of the grid search (if applicable), and aggregates the results into a format that can be used to make decisions about which parameter set provided the best performance.\n\n### Analysis of the Collected Context\n\n1. **What this part of the code does:** \n    - Initializes the cross-validation and scoring mechanisms.\n    - Iterates over all possible combinations of parameters provided in the `parameter_iterable`.\n    - For each parameter combination, it cross-validates the current model setting by splitting the data according to the CV strategy and fitting the model on each fold. It computes the score for each fold.\n    - Aggregates the scores across all folds for each parameter setting, determines the best set of parameters based on these scores, and if `refit` is true, refits a model using the best parameter combination on the entire dataset.\n\n2. **Relationship between this part of the code and the bug:**\n    - This method encapsulates the logic for refitting the model, which is the focus of the issue. The issue describes the lack of timing information for the refitting process as a missing feature. \n    - The part of the code responsible for the refitting (`if self.refit:...`) does not currently measure or record the time taken for this operation.\n\n3. **Intended behavior of this part of the code given the issue description:**\n    - To address the issue, the intended behavior is to introduce timing measurement around the refitting process. This involves recording the time immediately before and after the refitting operation (lines 617-623 where `best_estimator.fit(X, y, **self.fit_params)` is called) and then calculating the elapsed time for the refitting.\n    - This elapsed time should then be stored in a new attribute, such as `refit_time_`, making it accessible post-fit. This does not change the existing functionality but extends it to include timing information for the refitting process.\n    - Care should be taken to ensure that this timing measurement and storage is done in a way that does not disrupt any existing workflows or expectations around the `GridSearchCV`'s behavior.\n\nGiven the analysis, the next steps for implementation would involve modifying the `_fit` method to include start and end time measurements around the refitting process and introducing an attribute to store this information (`refit_time_`). This adjustment ensures that users can access the refitting time, addressing the issue raised."

If you don't need more context, LEAVE THIS EMTPY.\n2. where are bug locations: buggy files, classes, and methods. Only include the necessary locations that need to be fixed. For each bug location, you should also describe the intended behavior of the code at that location, in order to resolve the issue. The intended behavior should preserve the existing functionality of the code. If you think two methods in the same class are buggy, you should provide two bug locations (E.g. Location 1: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: a. Location 2: File: a.py, Class: A, Method: b.). If you want to add a method to a class, you should only provide the file and class as bug location, and describe the new method in intended behavior. If you still need more context, LEAVE THIS EMPTY."

This could be achieved by using time measurement functions (e.g., using `time.time()` before and after the fit call). The difference between these two timestamps should be stored in a new attribute of the `GridSearchCV` class, named `refit_time_`. This attribute would then capture the time taken to refit the best estimator on the full dataset. This timing information should be captured regardless of whether `y` is `None` or provided, ensuring that it always reflects the duration of the refitting process. The implementation must ensure this additional feature does not alter the original logic or flow of the method but serves as an add-on information point for users who might need to know the refit timing."
